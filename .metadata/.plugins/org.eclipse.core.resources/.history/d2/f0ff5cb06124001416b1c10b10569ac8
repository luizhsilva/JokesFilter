"<p>A very successful businessman had a meeting with his new son-in-law. ""I<br /> love my daughter, and now I welcome you into the family,"" said the man. ""To<br /> show you how much we care for you, I'm making you a 50-50 partner in my<br /> business.  All you have to do is go to the factory every day and learn the<br /> operations.""</p>
<p>The son-in-law interrupted.  ""I hate factories. I can't stand the noise.""</p>
<p>""I see,"" replied the father-in-law.  ""Well, then you'll work in the office<br /> and take charge of some of the operations.""</p>
<p>""I hate office work,"" said the son-on-law.  ""I can't stand being stuck<br /> behind a desk all day.""</p>
<p>""Wait a minute,"" said the father-in-law.  ""I just make you half-owner of a<br /> money making organization, but you don't like factories and won't work in<br /> an office.  What am I going to do with you?""</p>
<p>""Easy,"" said the young man.  ""Buy me out.""</p>

"<p>A company, feeling it was time for a shake-up, hires a new CEO.<br /> This new boss is determined to rid the company of all slackers. </p>
<p>On a tour of the facilities, the CEO notices a guy leaning on a wall.<br /> The room is full of workers and he thinks this is his chance to show everyone<br /> he means business! </p>
<p>The CEO, walks up the guy and asks - ""and how much money do you make a week?"" </p>
<p>Undaunted, the young fellow looks at him and replies, ""I make $200.00 a<br /> week. Why?"" </p>
<p>The CEO then hands the guy $200 in cash and screams - ""here's a week's pay,<br /> now GET OUT and don't come back!"" </p>
<p>Feeling pretty good about his first firing, the CEO looks around the room and<br /> asks - ""does anyone want to tell me what that slacker did here?"" </p>
<p>With a sheepish grin, one of the other workers mutters -<br /> ""Pizza delivery guy"".</p>

"<p>""Hello. Tech Support; may I help you?""<br /> ""Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect."" </p>
<p>""What sort of trouble?""<br /> ""Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away.""</p>
<p>""Went away?""<br /> ""They disappeared.""</p>
<p>""Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?""<br /> ""Nothing.""</p>
<p>""Nothing?""<br /> ""It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type.""</p>
<p>""Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?""<br /> ""How do I tell?""</p>
<p>[Uh-oh. Well, let's give it a try anyway.]<br /> ""Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?""<br /> ""What's a sea-prompt?""</p>
<p>[Uh-huh, thought so. Let's try a different tack.]<br /> ""Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?""<br /> ""There isn't any cursor: I told you, it won't accept anything I type.""</p>
<p>[Ah--at least s/he knows what a cursor is. Sounds like a hardware problem. I wonder if s/he's kicked out his/her monitor's power plug?]</p>
<p>""Does your monitor have a power indicator?""<br /> ""What's a monitor?""</p>
<p>""It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on?""<br /> ""I don't know.""</p>
<p>""Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?""<br /> [sound of rustling and jostling] [muffled] ""Yes, I think so.""</p>
<p>""Great! Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into the wall.""<br /> [pause] ""Yes, it is.""</p>
<p>[Hmm. Well, that's interesting. I doubt s/he would have accidentally turned it off, and I don't want to send him/her hunting for the power switch because I don't know what kind of monitor s/he has and it's bound to have more than one switch on it. Maybe the video cable is loose or something.] ""When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?""</p>
<p>""No.""</p>
<p>""Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable.""<br /> [muffled] ""Okay, here it is.""</p>
<p>""Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely into the back of your computer.""<br /> [still muffled] ""I can't reach.""</p>
<p>""Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?""<br /> [clear again] ""No.""</p>
<p>""Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?""<br /> ""Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle--it's because it's dark.""</p>
<p>""Dark?""<br /> ""Yes--the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window.""</p>
<p>""Well, turn on the office light then.""<br /> ""I can't.""</p>
<p>""No? Why not?""<br /> ""Because there's a power outage.""</p>
<p>""A power--!?!"" ...[AAAAAAARGH!]""A power outage? Aha! Okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?""<br /> ""Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.""</p>
<p>""Good! Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.""</p>
<p>""Really? Is it that bad?""<br /> ""Yes, I'm afraid it is.""</p>
<p>""Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?""</p>
<p>""Tell them you're TOO STUPID TO OWN A COMPUTER!""</p>

"<p>A small bottle containing urine sat upon the desk of Sir William Osler, the<br /> eminent professor of medicine at Oxford University. Sitting before him was a<br /> class full of young, wide-eyed medical students, listening to his lecture on the<br /> importance of observing details. To emphasise his point, Sir Osler announced,<br /> ""This bottle contains a sample for analysis. It's often possible by tasting it<br /> to determine the disease from which the patient suffers.""<br /> He then dipped a finger into the fluid and brought it into his mouth. He<br /> continued speaking, ""Now I am going to pass the bottle around. Each of you<br /> please do exactly as I did. Perhaps we can learn the importance of this<br /> techinque and diagnose the case.""</p>
<p>The bottle madeit's way from row to row, each student gingerly poking his<br /> finger in and bravely sampling the contents with a frown.</p>
<p>Dr. Osler then retrieved the bottle and startled his students by saying,<br /> ""Gentlemen, now you will understand what I mean when I speak about details. Had<br /> you been observant, you would have seen that I put my INDEX FINGER in the bottle<br /> but my MIDDLE FINGER into my mouth!""</p>

"<p>A wealthy playboy met a beautiful young girl in an exclusive lounge. He took her to his lavish apartment where he soon discovered she was not a tramp, but was well groomed and apparently very intelligent. Hoping to get her into bed; he began showing her his collection of expensive paintings, first editions by famous authors and offered her a glass of wine. </p>
<p>He asked whether she preferred Port or Sherry and she said, ""Oh, Sherry by all means. To me it's the nectar of the gods. Just looking at it in a crystal-clear decanter fills me with a glorious sense of anticipation. When the stopper is removed and the gorgeous liquid is poured into my glass, I inhale the enchanting aroma and I'm lifted on the wings of ecstasy. It seems as though I'm about to drink a magic potion and my whole being begins to glow. The sound of a thousand violins being softly played fills my ears and I'm transported into another world. On the other hand, Port makes me fart.""</p>

"<p>There was this 8 year old kid who lived with his 82 year old grandma. He had been living with her for some time, and he thought, that with all the work she does, he could at least make her a cup of coffee in the morning.  </p>
<p>So he woke up early one day, and made a cup of coffee and brought it to his grandma. She took one drink of it and died instantly. He called 911, and the paramedics rushed over there.  </p>
<p>While examining the grandma, one of the paramedics pulls out a little plastic green soldier from her throat. After the paramedic learns that the kid made her coffee and put that soldier in there, of course, the first question is ""why"". The kid answered, ""Grandma always said, 'The best part of waking up is soldiers in your cup'!""</p>

"<p>This chain letter was started in hopes of bringing relief to other tired and discouraged men. Unlike most chain letters, this one does not cost anything.<br /> Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are equally tired and discontented. Then bundle up your wife or girlfriend and send her to the man whose name appears at the top of the following list and add your name to the bottom of the list. </p>
<p>When your turn comes, you will receive 15,625 women. One of them is bound to be better than the one you already have. At the writing of this letter, a friend of mine had already received 184 women, of whom 4 were worth keeping. </p>

<li>Unroll a 50 metre roll of duct tape check whether it really is 50 metre. Then find you can't roll it all back because it's stuck on the floor. When a member of staff asks what you are doing tell them you've covered up a large crack in their floor and they ""really ought to take more care of their building"".</li>
<li>Ask for the bits from the middle of your washers so that you can use them for Tiddlywinks.</li>

<li>Go to the Customer Service desk and ask how to connect the plumb line you've just bought to your washing machine.</li>
<li>Take some planks of wood into the store and ask to try their best orbital sander. Afterwards ask them where they keep the wood varnish... you'd like to try that as well.</li>
<li>Order 90 metres of nylon cable with a strain rating of 6 Kg. Once they've measured and cut it produce a piece of paper from your pocket, stare at it and turn it upside down. Apologise and say that you really wanted 9 metres of nylon cable with a strain rating of 60 Kg.</li>
<li>Complain that none of the taps work in the model bathroom. Threaten to sue them on health grounds because they've also forgotten to provide soap or towels.</li>
<li>Try to hold up the cashier with a glue gun. Shout ""Stick 'em up!"" and start sniggering. When the cops come say ""It was only a joke. Geddit? Glue. Stick 'em up. Joke."" Keep protesting your innocence and sue them for not having a sense of humour.</li>
<li>Take a section of bright yellow carpet into the paint department and get people's opinion of which paint matches it best. Then produce some bright yellow curtain material and ask whether the paint still matches. Next get some bright pink cloth (""the color of my sofa"") and ask which paint goes best with all three. You can then produce another patch of material from your cushions, rugs, light-shades...</li>
<li>Join the longest checkout queue when ready to pay for your goods. Then move to the back of another long queue when just about to be served. Start complaining about the slow service - but keep moving to the back of another long queue when just about to be served. Eventually the manager will come out and take you to the front of a queue - just to get rid of you. When this happens turn round and grin at everybody else who you've just jumped in front of.</li>

<li>Go to the Customer Service desk with a tin of paint (for example ""Egg-shell blue"", ""Buttermilk white"" or ""Jasmine yellow"") and ask whether they've got the same color but with a different name; the color's just right but there's no way you're going to paint your wall with something called *that*.</li>
<li>Borrow a volt meter from the electrical section, undo all packs of batteries and test them to find the freshest ones. Then decide to buy rechargeables instead.</li>

Repeat the whole process yet again then remember you wanted the special ""reflector"" spotlight ones.

<p>""One day,"" he begins, ""I was hunting when I got lost in the woods. I heard someone crying for help and finally realized that it was coming from a frog sitting next to a stream. So I picked up the frog and it said, ""Kiss me. Kiss me and I will turn into a genie and grant you 3 wishes"". </p>
<p>So I looked around to make sure I was alone and gave the frog a kiss. </p>
<p>POOF! </p>

<p>I looked hungrily at her beautiful body and replied, ""I want to make sensuous love with you here by this stream."" </p>
<p>She nodded, laid down, and beckoned to me. We then made love for hours! Later, as we lay there next to each other, sweating from our glorious lovemaking, she whispered into my ear, ""You know, you do have one more wish. What will it be?"" </p>

"<p>She spent the first day packing her belongings into boxes, crates and suitcases. </p>
<p>On the second day, she had the movers come and collect her things. </p>
<p>On the third day, she sat down for the last time at their beautiful dining room table by candlelight, put on some soft background music and feasted on a pound of shrimp, a jar of caviar and a bottle of Chardonnay.. </p>
<p>When she had finished, she went into each and every room and deposited a few half-eaten shrimp shells dipped in caviar, into the hollow of the curtain rods. She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. </p>
<p>When the husband returned with his new girlfriend, all was bliss for the first few days. Then slowly, the house began to smell. They tried everything; cleaning, mopping and airing the place out. Vents were checked for dead rodents and carpets were steam cleaned. Air fresheners were hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in to set off gas canisters, during which they had to move out for a few days, and in the end they even paid to replace the expensive wool carpeting. </p>
<p>Nothing worked. People stopped coming over to visit. Repairmen refused to work in the house. The maid quit. </p>
<p>Finally, they could not take the stench any longer and decided to move.  A month later, even though they had cut their price in half, they could not find a buyer for their stinky house. Word got out and eventually even the local realtors refused to return their calls. Finally, they had to borrow a huge sum of money from the bank to purchase a new place. </p>
<p>The ex-wife called the man and asked how things were going. He told her the saga of the rotting house. She listened politely and said that she missed her old home terribly, and would be ! willing to reduce her divorce settlement in exchange for getting the house back. Knowing his ex-wife had no idea how bad the smell was, he agreed on price that was about 1/10th of what the house had been worth, but only if she were to sign the papers that very day. She agreed and within the hour his lawyers delivered the paperwork. </p>
<p>A week later the man and his girlfriend stood smiling as they watched the moving company pack everything to take to their new home, including the curtain rods.</p>

"<p>I never have quite figured out why the sexual urges of men &amp; women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Mars &amp; Venus thing. And, I never have figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart. And, I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene gets thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words ""I do"".</p>
<p>One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""</p>
<p>I said, ""WHAT??"" So she says the words that I and every husband on the planet dreads. She explains that I must not be in tune with her emotional needs as a Woman. I'm thinking, ""What was her first clue?""</p>
<p>I finally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to bed. The very next day we went shopping at a big unnamed department store... I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them.</p>
<p>She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say OK. And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond earrings. Let me tell you ...she was so excited. She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don't think she cared. I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she doesn't even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK.</p>
<p>She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have seen her face when she said, ""I'm ready to go, let's go to the cash register.""</p>
<p>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No, honey. I don't feel like buying all this stuff now."" You should have seen her face ... it went completely blank. I then said, ""Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.""</p>
<p>And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a Man.""</p>
<p>I figure that I should be having sex again sometime during the Spring thaw.</p>

Although he   didn't ask for them, Wife1.0 came with plug-ins such as MotherInLaw   and BrotherInLaw.   Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend4.0...    - A 'Don't remind me again' button    - Minimize button    - Shutdown feature    - An installshield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be completely      uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache and other      objects)    - 'Abort' button     I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still    installed, they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted.

"<p>As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research help from that renowned scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990) - I am pleased to present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus.</p>
<p>1. No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen.</p>
<p>2. There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since Santa doesn't (appear to) handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one good child in each.</p>
<p>3. Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purpose of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household, a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and so forth. This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.</p>
<p>4. The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized Lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that ""flying reindeer"" (see point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>5. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft reentering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.</p>
<p>In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now!</p>

<p>If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough however to spread paint on all four walls of 20 by 20 foot room.</p>
<p>You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. And the glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a<br /> baseball hit by a ceiling fan.</p>
<p>Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four year old.</p>
<p>VCR's do not eject peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, even though TV commercials show they do.</p>

"<p>To the citizens of the United States of America: </p>
<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. </p>
<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. </p>
<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: </p>
<p>1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up ""aluminium"" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. </p>
<p>Look up ""vocabulary"". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"". </p>
<p>2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. </p>
<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. </p>
<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. </p>
<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through. </p>
<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. </p>
<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. </p>
<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for ""shit"" </p>
<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day. </p>
<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. </p>
<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy. </p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

"<p>As I let go of my feelings of guilt, I can get in touch with my Inner<br /> Sociopath.</p>
<p>I have the power to channel my imagination into ever-soaring levels of<br /> suspicion and paranoia.</p>
<p>I assume full responsibility for my actions, except the ones that are<br /> someone else's fault.</p>
<p>I no longer need to punish, deceive or compromise myself. Unless, of<br /> course, I want to stay employed.</p>
<p>In some cultures what I do would be considered normal.</p>
<p>Having control over myself is nearly as good as having control over others.</p>
<p>My intuition nearly makes up for my lack of good judgment.</p>
<p>I honor my personality flaws, for without them I would have no personality<br /> at all.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc heard voices too.</p>
<p>I am grateful that I am not as judgmental as all those censorious,<br /> self-righteous people around me.</p>
<p>I need not suffer in silence while I can still moan, whimper and complain.</p>
<p>As I learn the innermost secrets of the people around me, they reward me<br /> in many ways to keep me quiet.</p>
<p>When someone hurts me, forgiveness is cheaper than a lawsuit. But not<br /> nearly as gratifying.</p>
<p>The first step is to say nice things about myself. The second, to do nice<br /> things for myself. The third, to find someone to buy me nice things.</p>
<p>As I learn to trust the universe, I no longer need to carry a gun.</p>
<p>All of me is beautiful and valuable, even the ugly, stupid, and disgusting<br /> parts.</p>
<p>I am at one with my duality.</p>
<p>Blessed are the flexible, for they can tie themselves into knots.</p>
<p>I will strive to live each day as if it were my 40th birthday.</p>
<p>Only a lack of imagination saves me from immobilizing myself with<br /> imaginary fears.</p>
<p>I honor and express all facets of my being, regardless of state and local<br /> laws.</p>
<p>Today I will gladly share my experience and advice, for there are no<br /> sweeter words than ""I told you so.""</p>
<p>False hope is nicer than no hope at all.</p>
<p>A good scapegoat is nearly as welcome as a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Just for today, I will not sit in my living room all day watching TV.<br /> Instead I will move my TV into the bedroom.</p>
<p>Who can I blame for my own problems? Give me just a minute... I'll find<br /> someone.</p>
<p>Why should I waste my time reliving the past when I can spend it worrying<br /> about the future?</p>
<p>The complete lack of evidence is the surest sign that the conspiracy is<br /> working.</p>
<p>I am learning that criticism is not nearly as effective as sabotage. </p>
<p>Becoming aware of my character defects leads me to the next step --<br /> blaming my parents.</p>
<p>To have a successful relationship I must learn to make it look like I'm<br /> giving as much as I'm getting.</p>
<p>I am willing to make the mistakes if someone else is willing to learn from<br /> them.</p>

I am an<br /> expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.<br /> Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once<br /> single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin<br /> from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I<br /> was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous<br /> documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges<br /> in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after<br /> school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge. I am an<br /> abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie.<br /> Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy<br /> evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I<br /> receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won<br /> the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a<br /> traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft<br /> floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany<br /> circles.</p>
<p>Children trust me. I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving<br /> objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby<br /> Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to<br /> refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact<br /> location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed<br /> several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when<br /> I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I<br /> successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had<br /> seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me. I<br /> balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.<br /> On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact<br /> origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot<br /> to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals<br /> using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning<br /> clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving<br /> competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I<br /> have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I<br /> have spoken with Elvis. But I have not yet gone to college.</p>

"<p>Here's a dilemma for you... With all your honor and dignity what would you do? This test only has one question, but it's a very important one.</p>
<p>Please don't answer it without giving it some serious thought. By giving an honest answer you will be able to test where you stand morally.</p>
<p>The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, where you will have to make a decision one way or the other. Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous. Please scroll down slowly and consider each line - this is important for the test to work accurately.</p>
<p>You're in Florida...In Miami, to be exact. There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods. There are huge masses of water all over you. You are a CNN photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless. You're trying to shoot very impressive photos. There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destructive power and is ripping everything away with it.</p>
<p>Suddenly you see a man in the water, he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.</p>
<p>Suddenly you know who it is -- it's George W. Bush!</p>
<p>At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away, forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the best photo of your life. So you can save the life of George W. Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer prize winning photo, a unique photo displaying the death of one of the world's most powerful men.</p>

"<p>It started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker. I began to think alone - ""to relax,"" I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. </p>
<p>Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself. I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, ""What is it exactly we are doing here?"" </p>
<p>Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's. I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, "" I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job."" This gave me a lot to think about. I came home early after my conversation with the boss. </p>
<p>""Honey,"" I confessed, ""I've been thinking..."" </p>
<p>""I know you've been thinking,"" she said, ""and I want a divorce!"" </p>
<p>""But Honey, surely it's not that serious."" </p>
<p>""It is serious,"" she said, lower lip aquiver. ""You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!"" </p>
<p>""That's a faulty syllogism,"" I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I'd had enough. ""I'm going to the library,"" I snarled as I stomped out the door. </p>
<p>I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed. As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. ""Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?"" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinkers Anonymous poster. Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was ""Porky's."" Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting. </p>
<p>I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.</p>

"<p>Customer: ""Your sound card is defective and I want a new one.""<br /> Tech Support: ""What seems to be the problem?""<br /> Customer: ""The balance is backwards. The left channel is coming out of the right speaker and the right channel is coming out the left.<br /> It's defective!""<br /> Tech Support: ""You can solve the problem by moving the left speaker to the right side of the machine and vice versa.""<br /> Customer: (sputter) (click)<br /> Tech Support: (snicker) </p>
<p>**************** </p>
<p>I had been doing Tech Support for Hewlett-Packard's DeskJet division for about a month when I had a customer call with a problem I just couldn't solve. She could not print yellow. All the other colors would print fine, which truly baffled me because the only true colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. For instance, green is a combination of cyan and yellow, but green printed fine. </p>
<p>Every color of the rainbow printed fine except for yellow. I had the customer change ink cartridges. I had the customer delete and reinstall the drivers. Nothing worked. I asked my co-workers for help; they offered no new ideas. </p>
<p>After over two hours of troubleshooting, I was about to tell the customer to send the printer in to us for repair when she asked quietly, </p>
<p>""Should I try printing on a piece of white paper instead of this ""yellow"" construction paper?"" </p>
<p>******************* </p>
<p>A man attempting to set up his new printer called the printer's tech support number, complaining about the error message: ""Can't find the printer."" </p>
<p>On the phone, the man said he even held the printer up in front of the screen, but the computer still couldn't find it! (YEE-HAW!) </p>
<p>***************** </p>
<p>Customer: ""Hello? I'm trying to dial in. I installed the software okay, and it dialed fine. I could hear that. Then I could hear the two computers connecting. But then the sound all stopped, so I picked up the phone to see if they were still connected, and I got the message, 'No Carrier,' on my screen. What's wrong?"" </p>
<p>***************** </p>
<p>An unfailingly polite lady called to ask for help with a Windows installation that had gone terribly wrong. </p>
<p>Customer: ""I brought my Windows disks from work to install them on my<br /> home computer."" (Training stresses that we are ""not the Soft-ware Police,"" so I let the little act of piracy slide.)<br /> Tech Support: ""Umm-hmm. What happened?""<br /> Customer: ""As I put each disk in it turns out they weren't initialized."" </p>
<p>Tech Support: ""Do you remember the message exactly, ma'am?""<br /> Customer:(proudly) ""I wrote it down. 'This is not a Macintosh disk. Would you like to initialize it'?""<br /> Tech Support: ""Er, what happened next?""<br /> Customer: ""After they were initialized all the disks appeared to be blank. And now I brought them back to work, and I can't read them in the A: drive; the PC wants to format them. And this is our only set of Windows disks for the whole office. Did I do something wrong?"" </p>

<p>For a computer programming class, I sat directly across from someone, and our computers were facing away from each other. </p>
<p>A few minutes into the class, she got up to leave the room. I reached between our computers and switched the inputs for the keyboards. She came back and started typing and immediately got a distressed look on her face. </p>
<p>She called the teacher over and explained that no matter what she typed, nothing would happen. The teacher tried everything. By this time I was hiding behind my monitor and quaking red-faced. </p>
<p>I started to type, ""Leave me alone!"" </p>
<p>They both jumped back, silenced. ""What the . . . "" the teacher said.<br /> I typed, ""I said leave me alone!"" </p>
<p>The kid got real upset. ""I didn't do anything to it, I swear!""<br /> It was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud. The conversation between them and HAL 2000 went on for an amazing five minutes. </p>
<p>Me: ""Don't touch me!"" </p>
<p>Her: ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit your keys that hard."" </p>
<p>Me: ""Who do you think you are anyway?!"" Etc. Finally, I couldn't contain myself any longer and fell out of my chair laughing. </p>
<p>After they had realized what I had done, they both turned beet red. Funny, I never got more than a C- in that class. </p>
<p>*************** </p>
<p>I have a friend who just bought a computer and was instructed to load a program by typing ""A:"" and then the name of the program. My friend told me it would not work because his keyboard was no good. He said he couldn't type the ""dot over dot thingie"" and that every time he tried to type the ""dot over dot thingie"" he kept getting the ""dot over comma thingie"" no matter how careful he was to press only on the very top of<br /> the key.<br /> When I taught him about the shift key, he thought I was a genius. </p>

<p>This guy calls in to complain that he gets an ""Access Denied"" message every time he logs in.

<p>My friend was on duty in the main lab on a quiet afternoon. He noticed a young woman sitting in front of one of the workstations with her arms crossed across her chest and staring at the screen. After about 15 minutes he noticed that she was still in the same position only now she was impatiently tapping her foot. He asked if she needed help and she replied, ""It's about time!

"<p>A commercial traveler was driving through the Scottish Highlands when his car broke down. </p>
<p>There was a cottage nearby so he went up to it and knocked on the door. </p>
<p>The door opened to reveal a burly Highlander. ""My car has conked out,"" said the traveler, ""Where can I spend the night?""</p>
<p>""Why, right here of course!"" said the Scot, ""Come in and avail yourself of our world famous hospitality.""</p>
<p>The traveler duly entered the humble but cozy residence.</p>
<p>""Jeannie,"" shouted the host in the direction of the kitchen, and in response to his call his beautiful daughter appeared. ""Jeannie, make a meal for the gentleman and remember to uphold our great tradition of Highland hospitality.""</p>
<p>The traveler was soon tucking into an appetizing meal, and he saw that the girl had indeed spared no effort to extend Highland hospitality to the guest. </p>
<p>""And now,"" said the Highlander, ""I'm afraid I must go out and milk the cows, but just make yourself at home and take full advantage of our world famous Highland hospitality.""</p>
<p>No sooner had the door closed behind him than the traveler set about seducing the lovely daughter. In no time at all he had her on floor and was on the job. Suddenly the door opened and there stood the Highlander. </p>
<p>He took one look at what was going on and his face turned purple with rage. He dropped his two buckets of milk with a crash and gave verbal vent to his wrath.</p>
<p>""After all I have been saying about the Highland hospitality,"" he roared, ""Arch your back, woman, and take the poor man's balls off the cold floor."" </p>

"<p>One day a man was taking a tour of the Vatican, snapping<br /> pictures with his camera as he went. But suddenly, he had this<br /> urge to go to the washroom, but he held it in because the tour<br /> guide told the group that they were going to see the pope! And<br /> he was excited.</p>
<p>So they met the pope, and the man was very happy having met the<br /> pope. When the pope left, he decided to go to the washroom,<br /> finally, since he really had to go. He followed the signs to the<br /> washrooms, unknowingly following the pope as he went.</p>
<p>He entered the washroom not knowing that the pope had just<br /> entered the washroom. And since we all know that the pope is<br /> horny, as he always is, he is jacking off to a nudie-mag in the<br /> stall.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the man, he enters the same stall as the pope,<br /> who is jerkin' his gerkin. Completely astonished, the man snaps<br /> a picture.</p>
<p>""Whoa, wait"" pleads the pope, ""You can't let that picture get to<br /> the media. It will be spread all over the world, they would tear<br /> me apart! I will be ruined. You have to sell me that camera. I<br /> will give you $1000 for it.""</p>
<p>""Whoa, a thousand bucks!"" exclaims the man, ""That is more than<br /> five times what I paid for it! I will do it! Yeah!""</p>
<p>So he sells his camera to the pope, and leaves happy, but after<br /> he utilizes the facilities. The pope opens up the camera,<br /> exposing the film as to erase the discriminating evidence. While<br /> he was doing this he realizes that his new camera is quite nice,<br /> so he keeps it.</p>
<p>Later, the pope goes on a much needed and wanted vacation. He<br /> visits Amsterdam, and during his many travels, he goes on some<br /> tours.</p>
<p>One day he is snapping photos with his $1000 camera. Another<br /> tourist, not recognizing the pope, remarks: ""That is a really<br /> nice camera. How much did you spend on it?""</p>
<p>""Well, I bought it from this guy for a thousand dollars."" says<br /> the pope.</p>
<p>""Oh boy!"" remarks the other tourist, ""he must have seen you<br /> coming!""</p>
