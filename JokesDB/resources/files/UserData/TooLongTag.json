No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e2. There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since Santa doesn\u0027\u0027t (appear to) handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that\u0027\u0027s 91.8 million homes. One presumes there\u0027\u0027s at least one good child in each.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e3. Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purpose of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household, a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and so forth. This means that Santa\u0027\u0027s sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e4. The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized Lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that \"flying reindeer\" (see point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e5. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft reentering the earth\u0027\u0027s atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake.

I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.

One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother\u0027\u0027s. I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, \" I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don\u0027\u0027t stop thinking on the job, you\u0027\u0027ll have to find another job.\" This gave me a lot to think about.

As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. \"Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?\" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinkers Anonymous poster. Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was \"Porky\u0027\u0027s.\" Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI still have my job, and things are a lot better at home.

Being a bit bored with it all, and with a well-kept and wry sense of humor, he set a single question on the sheet: \"Is Hell endothermic or exothermic? Support your answer with proof.\"\u003cbr /\u003e He had little idea what to expect, or how to grade the results, but decided to reward any student who was able to come up with a reasonable and consistent reply to his query. One A was awarded. Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle\u0027\u0027s Law or some variant. The top student however wrote the following: \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle\u0027\u0027s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. There are two possible conditions: \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eCondition One: if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase exponentially until all hell breaks loose.\u003cbr /\u003e Conversely, Condition Two: if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe can solve this with the 1990 postulation of Theresa LeClair, the girl who lived across the hall from me during my first year residence. Since I have still not been successful in obtaining sexual relations with her, condition two above has not been met, and thus it can be concluded that condition one is true, and hell is exothermic.","Tired of boring old dog name like Ruff, Spot, Lassie, etc?\u003cbr /\u003e The next time you get a dog, name it: Mypenis\u003cbr /\u003e Why, you ask?

If you give me more than one job to do, don\u0027\u0027t tell me which is the priority. I am psychic.6. Do your best to keep me late. I adore this office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do. I have no life beyond work.7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. If that gets out, it could mean a promotion.8. If you don\u0027\u0027t like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in conversations. I was born to be whipped.9. If you have special instructions for a job, don\u0027\u0027t write them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done. No use confusing me with useful information.10. Never introduce me to the people you\u0027\u0027re with. I have no right to know anything. In the corporate food chain, I am plankton. When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them.11. Be nice to me only when the job I\u0027\u0027m doing for you could really change your life and send you straight to manager\u0027\u0027s hell.12. Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and it\u0027\u0027s nice to know someone is less fortunate. I especially like the story about having to pay so much taxes on the bonus check you received for being such a good manager.13. Wait until my yearly review and THEN tell me what my goals SHOULD have been. Give me a mediocre performance rating with a cost of living increase.

After a few drinks they started getting louder and louder until finally, the desk clerk couldn\u0027\u0027t take any more and kicked them out. The next morning the Manager called the clerk into his office and told him there had been many complaints about his being so rude to the hotel guests....instead of kicking them out, he should have just asked them to be less noisy.

While walking toward the subway for their return trip to the suburbs, they passed a bar. The alcoholic, hearing the loud music and seeing the lights, could not stop himself. His buddies accompanied him into the bar, where he had a shot of whiskey. No sooner had he replaced the shot glass on the bar, he fell off his stool, stone cold dead. His companions, somewhat shaken, left the bar, realising how seriously they must take the doctor\u0027\u0027s words.

It\u0027\u0027s the dreaded \"morning wood\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMost mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can\u0027\u0027t get that thing to bend, and if it don\u0027\u0027t bend you can\u0027\u0027t aim, well hell, if you can\u0027\u0027t aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the friggin\u0027\u0027 toilet seat won\u0027\u0027t stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control ourselves for that perfect aim.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow sometimes, when you\u0027\u0027re newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSo us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it\u0027\u0027s just not safe. I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her . . . look, it won\u0027\u0027t bend. She said, \"sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time.\" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with \"morning wood\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWell it\u0027\u0027s is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying superman position lying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it\u0027\u0027s the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSo you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027\u0027s not our fault, it\u0027\u0027s just Mother Nature.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if it was Father Nature,... there wouldn\u0027\u0027t have been a problem!!!","A kid called up his mom from his college and asked her for some money. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMom said, \"Sure, sweetie.

A committee will study the light-bulb situation for at least a year. Taxes will have to be raised. A fair and proportionate number of the light-bulb changers will be from minority groups. No Social Security funds will be used to change the bulb. Each state and congressional district will share in the benefits of changing the light bulb. The blame for the failure of the present bulb will be assigned to the other party. The new bulb will be twice as bright as the old bulb. Because the new bulb is twice as bright as the old bulb, it will cost 130 times as much. A Blue Ribbon Panel will investigate the light-bulb failures and issue a mega-page report to the congress. A fact-finding trip to all countries known to produce light bulbs will be made by most congressmen and their wives. The CIA will investigate the Russian light-bulb-changing system. Details of the Russian light-bulb-changing system will be sold to the Chinese by an American naval officer. The surgeon general will issue a report about the perils of over-bright light bulbs.

Amazingly, the the contents of the packet are in plain text which means that I didn\u0027\u0027t even have to break the primitive crypto algorithms they had in those days. The packet seems to be directed at what was termed a `web site\u0027\u0027 and an individual called bodacious-ta-tas@bambisbimbos.com. We are still trying determine what a `ta-tas\u0027\u0027 is.\"Anderson claims that the packet was trapped in a networking equivalent of suspended animation which preserved it for close to 150 years.\"The packet got trapped in a MPLS forwarding loop. It was widely believed at the time that packet life times were unnecessary because routing tables would converge and that misconfiguration would be rare. This was proven to be wrong and culminated in what has now known as the Network Panic of 2002 where a critical mass of packet entropy caused a worldwide collapse of the nascent Internet. Since then, all packets are marked with explicit lifetimes.\"More remarkable is that Anderson found the packet at all. The packet was found in an antique shop in Duluth run by Doris Davenport on relic hardware by a company once known as Cisco Systems. Cisco, we all remember, was the first company that officially disbanded in the early 2020\u0027\u0027s because all of the employees were worth enough to retire in comfort, some as young as 19 years old. The packet has been kept alive by the good fortune of battery backup and the bustling market for antique electronics.\"It\u0027\u0027s certainly fortunate that people are so fond of these relics,\" says Anderson, \"I guess it must be the blinking lights and the knowledge that our great-great grandfathers worked so hard on these simple little toys.\"As far as Anderson can tell this may be the earliest known packet yet. It dates to 1999 which was right at the cusp of wide spread MPLS usage.\"It\u0027\u0027s hard to imagine that we\u0027\u0027ll find anything that predates this packet, so we\u0027\u0027re examining it very carefully for clues as to what life was like so very long ago. Conventional wisdom has always held that it was digital media swapping that fueled the early Internet, but this packet brings that all into question because by all appearances it seems to be directed at some sort of pornography distribution point.\"Anderson will continue his search for more sources of ancient packets to bolster his new and disturbing theory about 20th Internet economics.","A small town prosecuting attorney called his first witness to\u003cbr /\u003e the stand in a trial--a grandmotherly, elderly woman.

I have always believed him. I believed him when he said he had never been drafted in the Vietnam War and I believed him when he said he had forgotten to mention that he had been drafted in the Vietnam War. I believed him when he said he hadn\u0027\u0027t had sex with Gennifer Flowers and I believe him now, when he reportedly says he did.I believe the president did not rent out the Lincoln Bedroom, did not sell access to himself and the vice president to hundreds of well-heeled special pleaders and did not supervise the largest, most systematic money-laundering operation in campaign finance history, collecting more than $ 3 million in illegal and improper donations. I believe that Charlie Trie and James Riady were motivated by nothing but patriotism for their adopted country.I believed Vice President Gore when he said that he had made dunning calls to political contributors \u0027\u0027on a few occasions\u0027\u0027 from his White House office, and I believed when he said that, actually, \u0027\u0027a few\u0027\u0027 meant 46. I believe in no controlling legal authority.I believe Bruce Babbitt when he says that the $ 286,000 contributed the DNC by Indian tribes opposed to granting a casino license to rival tribes had nothing to do with his denial of the license. I believed the secretary when he said that he had not been instructed this matter by then-White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. I believed him when he said that he had told lobbyist and friend Paul Eckstein that Ickes had told him to move on the casino decision, but that he had been lying to Eckstein. I agree with the secretary that it is an outrage that anyone would question his integrity. I believe in the Clinton Standard of adherence to the campaign finance and bribery laws, enunciated by the president on March 7, 1997: \u0027\u0027I don\u0027\u0027t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.\u0027\u0027 I note with approval the use of the word \u0027\u0027evidence\u0027\u0027 and also the use of the word \u0027\u0027solely.\u0027\u0027 I believe that it is proper to change government policy to address the concerns of people who have given the president money, as long as nobody can find evidence of this being the sole reason. I believe the president has lived up to his promise to preside over the most ethical administration in American history. I believe that indicted former agriculture secretary Mike Espy did not accept $35,000 in illegal favors from Tyson Foods and other regulated businesses. I believe that indicted former housing secretary Henry Cisneros did not lie to the FBI and tell others to lie to cover up $ 250,000 in blackmail payments to his former mistress.  I believe that convicted former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell was not involved in the obstruction of justice when the president\u0027\u0027s minions arranged for Hubbell to receive $ 400,000 in sweetheart consulting deals at a time when he was reneging on his promise to cooperate with Kenneth Starr\u0027\u0027s Whitewater investigation. I believe Paula Jones is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Kathleen Willey is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Monica Lewinsky is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Lewinsky was fantasizing in her 20 hours of conversation in which she reportedly detailed her sexual relationship with the president and begged Linda Tripp to join her in lying about the relationship. I believe that any gifts, correspondence, telephone calls and the 37 post-employment White House visits that may have passed between Lewinsky and the president are evidence only of a platonic relationship; such innocent intimate friendships are quite common between middle-aged married men and young single women, and also between presidents of the United States and White House interns. I see nothing suspicious in the report that the president\u0027\u0027s intimate, Vernon Jordan, arranged a $ 40,000-per-year job for Lewinsky shortly after she signed but before she filed an affidavit saying she had not had sex with the president. Nor do I read anything into the fact that the ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, visited Lewinsky at the Watergate to offer her a job. I believe the instructions Lewinsky gave Tripp informing her on how to properly perjure herself in the Willey matter simply wrote themselves.I believe that The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News \u0026amp; World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR are all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. Especially NPR.","How do you kill all the mexicans in the world?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBomb a swap meet.\u003cbr /\u003e *****************************\u003cbr /\u003e Why do all the mexicans go to a funeral?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFor the free food.\u003cbr /\u003e *****************************\u003cbr /\u003e What do you call a bunch of black people running down a hill?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eA mudslide.\u003cbr /\u003e *****************************\u003cbr /\u003e Why are black people afraid of motocycles?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBecause they sound like they\u0027\u0027re saying, \"Run niga niga niga, run niga niga niga...\"\u003cbr /\u003e *****************************\u003cbr /\u003e what do you call a bunch of white people in the middle of a larger group of black people?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eA Ho-Ho.\u003cbr /\u003e *****************************\u003cbr /\u003e What do you call a bunch of white people in a yellow bus?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eA twinkie.\u003cbr /\u003e *****************************\u003cbr /\u003e How do white people get away with breaking the law?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThey say \"Sorry officer.

But there was a problem. Everything the princess touched would melt. No matter what, metal, wood, plastic-anything she touched would melt!Because of this, men were afraid of her. Nobody would dare marry her. The king despaired. What could he do to help his daughter? He consulted his wizards and magicians. One wizard told the king, \"If your daughter touches one thing that does not melt in her hands, she will be cured,\"The king was overjoyed. The next day, he held a competition. Any man that could bring his daughter an object that would not melt would marry her and inherit the king\u0027\u0027s wealth.Three young princes took up the challenge. The first prince brought a very hard alloy of titanium. But alas, once the princess touched it, it melted. The prince went away sadly.The second prince brought a huge diamond, thinking that diamond is the hardest substance in the world and will not melt. But alas, once the princess touched it, it melted. He too went away disappointed.The third prince approached. He told the princess, \"Put your hand in my pocket and feel what is in there.\" The princess did as she was told, though she turned red. She felt something hard. She held it in her hand. And it did not melt!!! The king was overjoyed. Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed.

Prepare yourself, they are pretty amazing and sick (But all are true)               You have been warned!!!!!     -----------------------------------FEMALE SOFA: A 500-pound woman from Illinois was examined in the hospital. During the examination, an asthma inhaler fell from under her armpit, a dime was found under one of her breasts, and a remote control was found lodged between the folds of her vulva. OUCH!     ----------------------------------A couple hobbled into a Washington emergency room covered in bloodied restaurant towels. The man had his arms around his waist, and the woman had hers around her head. They eventually explained to doctors that they had gone out that evening for a romantic dinner. Overcome with passion, the woman crept under the table to administer oral sex to the man. While in the act, she had an epileptic fit, which caused her mouth to clamp down on the man\u0027\u0027s member and wrenched it from side to side. In agony and desperation, the man grabbed a fork and stabbed her in the head until she let go.       --------------------------------SEX EDUCATION: A Californian doctor examining a young woman with abdominal pains sked her if she was sexually active. She said that she wasn\u0027\u0027t. A later examination showed that she was pregnant. Asked why she said that she was not sexually active, the woman replied, \"I\u0027\u0027m not. I just lie there.\" When asked if she knew who the father was, with a puzzled look she replied, \"No, who?\"       --------------------------------BLIND DRUNK: A drunk staggered into a Pennsylvania ER complaining of severe pain while trying to remove his contact lenses. He said that they would come out halfway, but they always popped back in. A nurse tried to help using a suction pump, but without success. Finally, a doctor examined him and discovered that the man did not have his contact lenses in at all. He had been trying to rip out the membrane of his cornea.       --------------------------------GROWING SEASON: An old woman in a North Carolina ER complained of green vines growing from her vagina. Investigation revealed a large potato trapped in her womb. The woman then suddenly remembered that she had inserted it two weeks previously, because she thought that her uterus was falling out.       -------------------------------PRICKLY PAIR: In Michigan, a man came into the ER with lacerations to his penis. He complained that his wife had \"a rat in her vagina\" and it bit him during sex. After an examination of his wife, it was revealed that she had a surgical needle left inside her after a recent hysterectomy.       -------------------------------LAST STAND: A Cambridge man hobbled into the ER complaining of a permanent erection. He admitted to doctors that while on holiday in Cuba, he frequented many brothels, and in one he was given some erectile cream to keep him hard. He was told to use it sparingly. However, since he was aving so much fun, he kept using more and more. By the time he came to the ER, ll the blood vessels in his penis were swollen and his testicles had ballooned in size. Doctors could do nothing except prescribe pain killers, and told him that it would return to flaccidity in a few days. They also told him to enjoy his erection while it lasted, because it was going to be his last.       -------------------------------CALL THE BUM SQUAD! A World War II veteran came into a London clinic with a hemorrhoid problem. One painful pile would often hang down from the man\u0027\u0027s anus and he was in the habit of pushing it back up with an artillery shell. On this occasion, the shell got stuck. Doctors were going to remove it but the man told them the shell was still live. So the hospital called in the army bomb disposal squad, who built a lead box around the man\u0027\u0027s anus to defuse the shell so it could be removed.          ----------------------------------INNER SKELETON: A 63-year-old widow was admitted to the hospital in Recife, Brazil, suffering abdominal pains. X-rays showed that she was carrying a 20-inch long skeleton of a fetus which she conceived a decade earlier. It had ecome lodged outside the womb and was never expelled from her body.","Una pareja est�酶惟 celebrando su luna de miel y deciden ir a un hotel elegante de cinco estrellas.

But something you may not remember is what the show was  really about. As we\u0027\u0027ve gotten older, it has become more clear what Fred,  Shaggy, Daphne, Velma, and Scooby were actually doing as they traversed the  continent foiling crimes of all sorts in the Mystery Machine. WHAT WE  REMEMBER: Four teenagers and their trusted dog gallop across the country in  their purple and green van solving mysteries of all sorts -- and in the  process meet all kinds of interesting people. THE TRUTH: Four high-school  dropouts and their sentient dog ride around the country in their psychedelic  love machine, earning their way by selling drugs. Oh, and they occasionally  take some old guys mask off to solve a mystery. It may be hard to swallow,  but just take a look at the evidence... Take Shaggy for example. Not only is  he the inspiration for the current \u0027\u0027grunge\u0027\u0027 scene, with his sloppy dress and  facial hair, but Shaggy is obviously a \u0027\u0027burner\u0027\u0027, i.e., he smokes marijuana.  Why do you think he is constantly hungry? Shaggy can make a six foot hoagie  and swallow it whole. And then there is Scooby himself. While dogs do not  generally smoke joints, Scooby gets his \u0027\u0027high\u0027\u0027 from Scooby-Snacks, which are  in fact Hash-Brownies. Whenever Scooby, or Shaggy for that matter, eats a  Scooby-Snack, they go ape! It just blows their mind and they do whatever  they are told, because they are so lit! Scooby is also hungry all the time. The other characters do not actively take part in the stoner-fest that  Shaggy and Scooby do, but they do condone the selling of it because it helps  support their jaunts across the country (and the world -- they drove to  China once). These other characters do have their own peculiarities  however... Fred and Daphne are always splintering off from the group to go  \u0027\u0027solve the case\u0027\u0027 by themselves. It\u0027\u0027s no real mystery what these two are  really doing -- they\u0027\u0027re getting busy in the back of the Mystery Machine.  Daphne, with her pretty pink legs, and Fred are constantly bumping uglies. Fred is, by the way, pumped up on steroids. One thing that remains a mystery  though, is why he always wore that stupid scarf around his neck. And what  about Velma? Everyone\u0027\u0027s least favorite of the cast, was of course, a  lesbian. But, as it turned out in the later episodes, she was also into  beastiality. Where do you think Scrappy-Doo came from? Scrappy, who was a  dog yet spoke perfect English, was obviously a product of Velma and Scooby. So the kids spent their teenage years driving around the world, slangin\u0027\u0027  dope, shooting steroids, eating hash brownies, and fucking their dog, while  all the while looking for the perfect \u0027\u0027hit\u0027\u0027.

Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a holdup  and fired a few wild shots. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, promptly removing  him from the gene pool.

The Mormon\u0027\u0027s Guide to Avoiding Masturbation:1. Pray daily. Ask for the gifts of the spirit which    will strengthen you against temptation. Pray    fervently and out loud when the temptations are    strongest. When the temptation to masturbate is    strong, yell \u0027\u0027STOP\u0027\u0027 to those thoughts as loudly as    you can in your mind. Then recite a portion of the    Bible or sing a hymn.2. Set a goal of abstinence. Begin with a day, then a    week, a month and year. Finally, commit yourself to    never doing it again. Make a pocket calendar for a    month on a small card. Carry it with you but show it    to no one. If you masturbate, colour that day black.    Your goal will be to have no black days.  3. Set up a reward system. Each time you reach a goal    reward yourself with a quarter.4. When on the toilet or showering, leave the door    partly open.5. Avoid people, situations, and pictures and reading    material that might create sexual excitement. 6. Use physical restraints.7. Wear pajamas that are difficult to open, yet loose    and not binding. Put on several layers that would be    difficult to remove while half asleep. 8. In severe cases, tie your hands to the bed frame.9. Be aware of situations that depress you or that    cause you to feel lonely, bored, frustrated, or    discouraged. These emotional states can trigger the    desire to masturbate as a way of escape.  10. To cancel the pleasure of masturbating, associate    something very distasteful with the act. For    example, imagine bathing in a tub full of worms and    eating some of them.","Yo mama so ugly when she joined an ugly contest, they said\u003cbr /\u003e \"Sorry, no professionals.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly just after she was born, her mother said \"What a\u003cbr /\u003e treasure!\" and her father said \"Yes, let\u0027\u0027s go bury it.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly they push her face into dough to make gorilla\u003cbr /\u003e cookies. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly instead of putting the bungee cord around her\u003cbr /\u003e ankle, they put it around her neck \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly she gets 364 extra days to dress up for\u003cbr /\u003e Halloween. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly when she walks into a bank, they turn off the\u003cbr /\u003e surveillence cameras \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly her mom had to tie a steak around her neck to\u003cbr /\u003e get the dogs to play with her. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly the government moved Halloween to her birthday. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly that if ugly were bricks she\u0027\u0027d have her own\u003cbr /\u003e projects. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly she made an onion cry. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly when they took her to the beautician it took 12\u003cbr /\u003e hours for a quote!

Effective Monday the following revised procedures apply: Lodging All employees are encouraged to stay with relatives and friends while on business travel. If weather permits, public areas such as parks should be used as temporary lodging sites. Bus terminals, train stations, and office lobbies may provide shelter in periods of inclement weather. Transportation Hitchhiking is the preferred mode of travel in lieu of commercial transport. Luminescent safety vests will be issued to all employees prior to their departure on business trips. Bus transportation will be used only when work schedules require such travel. Airline tickets will be authorized in extreme circumstances and the lowest fares will be used. For example, if a meeting is scheduled in Seattle, but the lower fare can be obtained by traveling to Detroit, then travel to Detroit will be substituted for travel to Seattle. Meals Expenditures for meals will be limited to an absolute minimum. It should be noted that certain grocery and specialty chains, such as Hickory Farms, General Nutrition centers, and, Costco, Sams stores etc. often provide free samples of promotional items. Entire meals can be obtained in this manner. Travelers should also be familiar with indigenous roots, berries, and other protein sources available at their destinations. If restaurants must be utilized, travelers should use \"all you can eat\" salad bars. This is especially effective for employees traveling together as one plate can be used to feed the entire group. Employees are also encouraged to bring their own food on business travel. Cans of tuna fish, Spam, and Beefaroni can be consumed at your leisure without the necessary bother of heating or costly preparation. Miscellaneous All employees are encouraged to devise innovative techniques in effort to save company dollars. One enterprising individual has already suggested that money could be raised during airport layover periods which could be used to defray travel expenses. In support of this idea, red caps will be issued to all employees prior to their departure so that they may earn tips by helping others with their luggage. Small plastic roses and ball point pens will also be available to employees so that sales may be made as time permits.","Un zool�酶惟gico hab�酶惟a comprado una gorila hembra de una especie rara.

It all started on a Sunday mourning, bright and early, with boredom. We decided to spend a fun filled day with all the luxuries of our lives. We decided to start the day with a ride on his Harley, witch we both enjoy the freedom of the road. We road for a couple of hours and a took a well needed rest, so then we decided to take a cruise on my boat, which we also enjoy, because of all the quiet and alone time, with no one else around, not even a phone. We cruised for around a hour or so and decided it was time to get something to eat, so we returned home and jumped in the explorer and headed down the road to get something to eat. Well we hit the road and came across a Rite Aide, and I decided to ask him to pull in and get me some Captain Morgans, and he did just that. As he left the liquor store he put my alcohol in the back of the explore, now my day seemed to be complete. So with all he did with me and for me, I took it upon myself to make his day complete too. So I began to play with all his emotions, an got  quite carried away. The next thing I knew I heard a knock on the window and as I raised my head, I saw a Cop standing at the window, boy I couldn�酶惟t believe what was happening. As Randy�酶惟s eyes rolled back in his head, I didn�酶惟t know if he had seen the cop or was just enjoying the moment? Next thing I heard was the cop ask me to step out of the car, and as quick as I could pull myself back together I did what he asked. The next thing I new I was under arrest for  pubic drinking. Holy Crape I thought to myself. The officer explained this was better the being arrested for soliciting. At this time I wasn�酶惟t for sure what was any better than the other, but I calmly held my composure. Than the cop looked in the back seat of the explorer and saw the bottle of liquor, and without thinking Randy responded you can buy liquor on Sunday. O�酶惟boy the cop asked Randy to step out of the car, as he placed the handcuffs on me. He informed Randy, he also was under arrest for trying to sell his girlfriend to an officer. I believe the cop misunderstood Randy�酶惟s response, and thought he offered let him lick-her on Sunday so the officer placed handcuffs on Randy, and charged him with pandering. Shit o Shit what did we get ourselves into on such a beautiful Sunday afternoon? He then placed both of us in the back of the police car. Without thinking I said this really SUCKS. Then you won�酶惟t believe what happened next. The cop charged me with attempted bribery, or in other words sucking up to an officer. I knew we both were done for at this time, but it doesn�酶惟t end there, I again without thinking responded boy did I stick a foot in my mouth. The officer at this time lowered  his cheap sunglasses, and in amazement he laughed this crazy insane laugh I�酶惟ll never forget, believe that. He said to the both of us, I�酶惟m going to have to let you off on all charges, there was no way in hell he wanted to finish his police report ending with my statement, that I stuck 12 inches (a foot) in my mouth.  So with a sigh of relief we got back in the explorer and went on our way. Let this story be a warning to anyone considering pubic drinking, don�酶惟t try it unless you can swallow 12 inches. And if you can swallow that you probably swallowed this story too.","Two Indians and a Hillbilly were walking in the woods, all of a sudden one of the Indians ran up a hill to the mouth of a small cave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWooooo!

That insidious disease, modem fever, is exacting a tragically large toll from the cream of our society\u0027\u0027s computer users. Modem-mania is sweeping through the very foundations of our country and there seems to be no stopping it. This disease (yes, it is a social disease of almost epidemic proportions) is becoming a such calamity that soon there\u0027\u0027s even going to be a soap opera about on-line addiction named, \"All My Modems. \"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don\u0027\u0027t already own one of those evil instruments called a modem, take warning! Don\u0027\u0027t even think about buying one. Modem fever sets in very quietly; it sneaks up on you and then grabs you by the wallet, checkbook or, heaven forbid, credit cards.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you own a modem, you enter the insidious addictive trap by \"dialing up\" a friend who also has a modem. For some strange reason, typing messages to each other fascinates you. (Even if it is less than 10%of the speed that you can speak the same words over a normal voice phone link. )Of course, you make several attempts at hooking up before you finally figure out that at least one of you must be in the half-duplex mode; that discovery actually titillates you (sounds impossible, but it\u0027\u0027s true).\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThen your modem-buddy (friend is too good a term) sows another seed on the road to on-line addiction by giving you the number of a local RBBS (Remote Bulletin Board Service). Once you get an RBBS phone number, you\u0027\u0027ve taken the first fatal step in a journey that can only end in on-line addiction.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you take the next step by dialing up the RBBS your modem-buddy told you about, you find that it\u0027\u0027s very easy to \"log-on. \"This weird form of conversation with an unattended computer is strangely exciting, much more so than just typing messages when you\u0027\u0027re on-line with your modem-buddy. The initial bulletins scroll by and inform you about the board, but you\u0027\u0027re too \"up\" to comprehend most of it. Then you read some of the messages in the message section and maybe, in a tentative manner, you enter one or two of your own.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027\u0027s fun, but the excitement starts to wear off; you\u0027\u0027re calming down. Thinking that it might be worthwhile to go back and re-read the log-on bulletins, you return to the main RBBS menu.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThen it happens. The RBBS provides the bait that entices you all the way into the fiery hell of modem addiction. As you look at the RBBS main menu to learn how to return to the log-on bulletins, you find an item called FILES. By asking your host computer for FILES, you thread the bait onto the hook of corruption; the FILES SUBMENU sets the hook. You start running with the line when you LIST the files; you leap into the air with the sheer joy of the fight when all those public domain program title sand descriptions scroll by. They\u0027\u0027re FREE!!! All you have to do is tell the bulletin board to download (transmit) them to you. You download your first program and you\u0027\u0027re landed, in the creel, cleaned and ready for the cooking fires. In just 55 minutes after you logged-onto the board, you\u0027\u0027ve downloaded six programs, one of them is Andrew Fleugelman\u0027\u0027s PC-Talk, version 3 (truly an instrument for evil). \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBBS-LIST. DQC, which is also among the files you downloaded, contains a list of a great number of bulletin boards throughout the country. (There\u0027\u0027s evil all around us, constantly tempting us!) You print the list and find about 60 RBBS phone numbers. (Have mercy on our souls!) The list also gives you the hours of operation, communications parameters and informs you about each board\u0027\u0027s specialty. You decide to try PC-Talk and use it to dial-up an RBBS about three states away. Since the line is busy, you pass the time entering all those RBBS phone numbers into PC-Talk\u0027\u0027s voluminous dialing directory.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYou try the number again -- still busy. You think, \"Hey, there\u0027\u0027s one that specializes in Pascal programs. Maybe I\u0027\u0027ll try it. It\u0027\u0027s about half-way across the country, but it\u0027\u0027s after 5pm and the phone rates have changed. It won\u0027\u0027t be too expensive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pascal board answers. After 45 minutes you\u0027\u0027ve downloaded another five programs. Then you call another board --only this one\u0027\u0027s completely across the country from California, in Florida. And so it goes on into the night . . . and the next night. . . and the next. . . . Some days it gets to you. You begin to feel the dirtiness of modem addiction, particularly when your wife makes you feel like a child by berating you for those astronomical phone bills -- if she hasn\u0027\u0027t divorced you by then. Every time you sit down before your PC to do some work, you dial up another RBBS instead. If that one\u0027\u0027s busy, you call another, and another, until you connect. Then you feel OK, almost \"high.\" When you finally hang up, you still can\u0027\u0027t work; you can only dial up another RBBS.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYour downfall as an on-line addict is just another one of this society\u0027\u0027s terrible tragedies, such as polygamy or the compulsion to circle all the numbers on computer magazine \"bingo cards.\" Eventually your whole social life relies upon only the messages you find on electronic bulletin boards; your only happiness is the programs you have downloaded. (You never try any of them, you only collect them. )Hope exists, however. We, the dedicated but under-paid staff of Modems Anonymous, have done extensive research to find a cure for modem mania, which has been ruining hundreds of lives. And we have succeeded in our quest.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe cure is really quite simple, yet effective:  Set up your own remote bulletin board service. Then all the other modem addicts will phone you, and their wives can nag at them about $450 phone bills, and you can find peace -- at last.","A few choice 1-Liners.

Tell a girl that you\u0027\u0027re going to leave and when you come back, you want her naked, sprawled on the bed. Leave and go into her dad\u0027\u0027s room and tell him he should go check on his daughter. Then drive like hell (true story). \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e87. If a girl breaks up with you because you\u0027\u0027re in love with someone else, she has no right to be upset because, you know, SHE\u0027\u0027s the one who wanted to end the relationship. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e88. The best sex position is you, lying face up... and twenty girls on top. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e89. Practice your blank stare. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e90. Spend your spare time thinking of excuses and shove them up your ass. Then, whenever you need one, you can pull it out of your ass. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e91. If you\u0027\u0027re ever forced to show emotion, just pick random emotions like rage and lust and insanity and display them at random, inconvenient times. You won\u0027\u0027t be asked to do it again. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e92. If you are asked to do something you REALLY DON\u0027\u0027T want to do, first try your manly best to get out of it. If that doesn\u0027\u0027t work, go ahead and do what you were asked to do but complain that you don\u0027\u0027t know how to do it and continuously ask questions on how to do each little part. If no one rushes in to do it for you YET, finish the job in the most half-assed way you possibly can and then say: \"SEE? I TOLD you I couldn\u0027\u0027t do it.\" Eventually, people will stop asking you to do things. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e93. Work out day and night to make your body even more beautiful than it already is.

They set up a make-shift camp, hoping someone would come to their rescue, but to no avail. Soon the camel died.After several days of not being rescued, they agreed that they were not going to be rescued. They prayed a lot (of course), and they discussed their predicament in great depth. Finally the priest said to the nun, \"you know sister, I am about to die, and there\u0027\u0027s always been one thing I\u0027\u0027ve wanted here on earth--to see a woman naked. Would you mind taking off your clothes so I can look at you?\"The nun thought about his request for several seconds and then agreed to take off her clothes. As she was doing so, she remarked, \"well, Father, now that I think about it, I\u0027\u0027ve never seen a man naked, either. Would you mind taking off your clothes, too?\"With little hesitation, the priest also stripped. Suddenly the nun exclaimed, \"Father! What is that little thing hanging between your legs?\"The priest patiently answered, \"That, my child, is a gift from God. If I put it in you, it creates a new life.\"\"Well,\" responded the nun, \"forget about me. Stick it in the camel!\"","1. Only in America... can a pizza get to your house faster than an ambulance. 2.

A mail has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3 am on a Sunday morning, he will call and say, \u0027\u0027I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I\u0027\u0027ll never forgive you, and hate you, and you\u0027\u0027re a total floozy.

There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need.Sex: Women prefer 30 to 40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30 to 40 seconds of foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.Maturity: Women mature much faster than men do. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.Magazines: Men\u0027\u0027s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women\u0027\u0027s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman\u0027\u0027s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.Bathrooms: A man has five items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman\u0027\u0027s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.Groceries: A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampetts\u0027\u0027 car on The Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10?items?or?less lane.Cats: Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren\u0027\u0027t looking, men kick cats.Offspring: Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.Dressing Up: A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.Laundry: Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a van and take his mountain of clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by reruns of old American sitcoms.Eating Out: When the bill comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it\u0027\u0027s only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.Mirrors: Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror. Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any, shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, bald boyfriend\u0027\u0027s/father\u0027\u0027s heads.Menopause: When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, biological Changes. Nature provokes a uniform reaction in men. He buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.Richard Gere: Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because lie reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.Madonna: Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.Toys: Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical. Examples of men\u0027\u0027s toys: little miniature TVs. Cell phones. Complicated juicers and blenders. Graphic equalizers. Small robots that serve cocktails on command. Video games. Anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least six big batteries to operate.Locker Rooms: In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don\u0027\u0027t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about one thing in the locker room: sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.Movies: Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man. Men will only show their arse, because arse size doesn\u0027\u0027t really matter.Jewelry: Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that\u0027\u0027s it. Any more than that and he will look like a lounge singer named Ramone.Time: When a woman says she\u0027\u0027ll be ready to go out in five more minutes, she\u0027\u0027s using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football game just has five minutes left. Neither of them is counting time outs, commercials, or replays.Friends: Women on a \u0027\u0027girls\u0027\u0027 night out\u0027\u0027 talk the whole time. Men on a \u0027\u0027boys\u0027\u0027 night out\u0027\u0027 say about 20 words all night, most of which are \u0027\u0027Pass the chips\u0027\u0027 or \u0027\u0027Got am more beer?\u0027\u0027Toilets: Men use toilets for purely biological reasons. Women use toilets as social lounges. Men in toilets will never speak a word to each other. Women who\u0027\u0027ve never met will leave a toilet giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, \u0027\u0027Hey Tom, I, was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?\u0027\u0027","The boy who liked Jell-O\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThere once was a boy named Joe who loved to eat green Jell-O. On his 18th birthday his cake was made totally out of green Jell-O. His friend Billy Bob told Joe that if he ate the whole cake he would become a super-hero. Joe did this in hopes he could be like the power-puff-girls. When the cake was all gone Joe didn�酶惟t feel to good.

To his surprise he couldn�酶惟t fly, he flapped his arms and everything else he�酶惟d seen birds do, but nothing seemed to work. Now he was terrified and he put his hands into prayer position and began to pray, �酶惟Our father who does art in heaven, Howard be your name�酶惟.�酶惟 And on it went like that until he came to a thump.\u003cbr /\u003e He had landed in a lake, and in the lake where flying fish. Now Joe had a great idea, he would put a flying fish in each hand and have them fly him to the top of the cliff. He grabbed two fish and yelled, �酶惟Up, up, and away.�酶惟 The fish wouldn�酶惟t fly, puzzled why the fish were lying there, gasping for air; he put the fish back in the water. Now he had to find a new way to the top.\u003cbr /\u003e When he had walked for about an hour he met a man selling donkeys. �酶惟Donkeys for only 1699.00 pesos!�酶惟 Yelled the man. Joe was depressed they were so much, but he needed to get to the top of the cliff. �酶惟I only have $4000.00 in American money is that enough?�酶惟 asked Joe. The man leaped for joy, handed Joe the donkey and ran away singing.\u003cbr /\u003e Now Joe had a donkey he jumped on it and kicked it�酶惟s sides. The donkey jumped and started running up the cliff. Now Joe had made another mistake and jumped on the donkey backwards and couldn�酶惟t see a tree branch sticking out of the side of the cliff. He was hit by the branch and fell to the ground unconscious.\u003cbr /\u003e When he awoke he heard his name being screamed. He stood up and yelled back, �酶惟I�酶惟m alright!�酶惟 A man came running towards him, it was Billy Bob. �酶惟Joe, Joe are you O.K? Why didn�酶惟t you come back up to your party?�酶惟 asked Billy Bob. �酶惟Well,�酶惟 answered Joe, �酶惟I was stuck down here and couldn�酶惟t get back up.�酶惟 At this point Billy Bob was rolling on the ground, laughing so hard. �酶惟You only fell 5feet! You also got caught on a branch and we heard you praying! It�酶惟s a good thing you went to a catholic school for 13 years!�酶惟 Billy Bob laughed.","I was flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

Now, as you would guess, the population of the village decreased greatly after a few months of this, so, the chief of the village called forth the greatest hunter he could get and told him to hunt down and kill the medicrin.So, after much talk, the hunter finally agreed to kill the medicrine. But the hunter, being smart, decided he would have to trap the monster to kill it, figuring he would get eaten if he faced it head on.So he looked in his himalayan monster field book and found out that medicrins like sugar, so he ordered all the villagers to dig a deep hole and fill it with all the sugar in the village.Later that week, the medicrine came down to the village. When it went after it`s usual meal, it saw the pit of sugar, looked at it a moment, and then went after another villager.After the medicrin left, the chief called up the great hunter, and scolded the hunter for failing, but the hunter convinced the chief to give him another chance, and the chief agreed.The next day, the hunter looked back to his himalayan monster field book and found that medicrins like loons even more than sugar.So the great hunter went out, caught a loon, and placed it in the pit with the sugar. Now, it turns out that loons like sugar even more than medicrins, so the loon ate up all the sugar. So, a few days later the medicrine returned on time for it`s villager feast.But, as it was heading for the village, the medicrin saw the pit with the loon. The medicrin imediatly became hungry for loon, so it climbed down into the pit and at the loon. But, as soon as it finished the loon off, it fell over, deader than a doornail.The moral of the story? A loon full of sugar helps the medecrin go down.","A man walks to work every day.  On his way there he always passes the  local insane asylum.Well, one day when he was walking by the asylum. He heard all the  patients on the other side of the tall wood fence chanting \"Fifteen, Fifteen\".  He became very curious but had no way of knowing what was going on.The chanting became louder \"Fifteen, Fifteen, Fifteen\" , and his  curiosity became stronger.  What were they doing?  His imagination went  wild.... were they torturing fifteen people, were they counting something he  did not want to know about?  He could not stand the suspense.He finally saw a little knot whole in the fence, just big enough to look  through. He walked up to it cautiously and ducked down to look in it.All the sudden he got pocked in the eye with someone\u0027\u0027s finger.  The  chanting changed to \"Sixteen, Sixteen, Sixteen\".","After the Great Britain Beer Festival, in London, all the Presidents of the brewreys decide to go to the pub for a drink.

I\u0027\u0027m fairly certain it\u0027\u0027s some sort of photographic memory deal. Women take one quick look and memorize it for later reference.

Every time you ask a question, you are told you don\u0027\u0027t need to know, don\u0027\u0027t want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can\u0027\u0027t even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.

To this end, the investigators explored a number of possible approaches to continued marital relations in the zero-G orbital environment provided by the XXXXXX shuttle mission.Our primary conclusion is that satisfactory marital relations are within the realm of possibility in zero-G, but that many couples would have difficulty getting used to the approaches we found to be most satisfactory.-------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION The number of married couples currently involved in proposals for long- term projects on the US space station has grown considerably in recent years. This raises the serious question of how such couples will be able to carry out normal marital relations without the aid of gravity.Preliminary studies in the short-term weightless environment provided by aircraft flying on ballistic trajectories were sufficient to demonstrate that there were problems, but the duration of the zero-G environment on such flights is too short to reach any satisfactory conclusions. Similar experiments undertaken in a neutral buoyancy tank were equally inconclusive because of the awkwardness of the breathing equipment.The primary conclusion that could be drawn from these early experiments was that the conventional approach to marital relationships (sometimes described as the missionary approach) is highly dependent on gravity to keep the partners together. This observation lead us to propose the set of tests known as STS-75 Experiment 8.-------------------------------------------------------METHODOLOGYThe co-investigators had exclusive use of the lower deck of the shuttle XXXXXXXX for 10 intervals of 1 hour each during the orbital portion of the flight. A resting period of a minimum of 4 hours was included in the schedule between intervals. During each interval, the investigators erected a pneumatic sound deadening barrier between the lower deck and the flight deck (see NASA publication 12-571-3570) and carried out one run of the experiment.Each experimental run was planned in advance to test one approach to the problem. We made extensive use of a number of published sources in our efforts to find satisfactory solutions see Appendix I), arriving at an initial list of 20 reasonable solutions. Of these, we used computer simulation (using the mechanical dynamics simulation package from the CADSI company) to determine the 10 most promising solutions.Six solutions utilized mechanical restraints to simulate the effect of gravity, while the others utilized only the efforts of the experimenters to solve the problem. Mechanical and unassisted runs were alternated, and each experimental run was videotaped for later analysis. Immediately after each run, the experimenters separately recorded their observations, and then jointly reviewed the videotapes and recorded joint observations.The sensitive nature of the videotapes and first-hand observations pre- cludes a public release of the raw data. The investigators have pre- pared this paper to summarize their results, and they intend to release a training videotape for internal NASA use, constructed from selected segments of the videotapes and additional narrative material.The following summary is organized in two sections; the first covers the mechanical solutions, while the second covers the \"natural\" approaches. Each solution is described briefly, and then followed by a brief summary of the result. Some summaries are combined.-------------------------------------------------------SUMMARY OF RESULTS1) An elastic belt around the waist of the two    partners. The partners faced each other in the    standard or missionary posture.Entry was difficult and once it was achieved, it was difficult to maintain. With the belt worn around the hips, entry was easy, but it was difficult to obtain the necessary thrusting motion; as a result, this approach was not satisfactory.2) Elastic belts around the thighs of the two partners.    The female\u0027\u0027s buttocks were against the groin of the    male, with her back against his chest.An interesting experiment, but ultimately unsatisfactory because of the difficulty of obtaining the necessary thrusting motion.3) An elastic belt binding the thighs of the female to    the waist of the male. The female\u0027\u0027s buttocks were    against the male\u0027\u0027s groin, while her knees straddled    his chest.Of the approaches tried with an elastic belt, this was by far the most satisfactory. Entry was difficult, but after the female discovered how to lock her toes over the male\u0027\u0027s thighs, it was found that she could obtain the necessary thrusting motions. The male found that his role was unusually passive but pleasant.One problem both partners noticed with all three elastic belt solutions was that they reminded the partners of practices sometimes associated with bondage, a subject that neither found particularly appealing. For couples who enjoy such associations, however, and especially for those who routinely enjoy female superior relations, this solution should be recommended.4) An inflatable tunnel enclosing and pressing the    partners together. The partners faced each other in    the standard missionary posture. The tunnel enclosed    the partners roughly from the knees to waist and    pressed them together with an air pressure of    approximately 0.01 standard atmospheres.Once properly aroused, the uniform pressure obtained from the tunnel was sufficient to allow fairly normal marital relations, but getting aroused while in the tunnel was difficult, and once aroused outside the tunnel, getting in was difficult. This problem made the entire approach largely unusable.5) The same inflatable tunnel used in run 4, but    enclosing the partners legs only. The partners faced    each other in the missionary position.6) The same inflatable tunnel used in run 4, but with    the partners in the posture used for run 2.Foreplay was satisfactory with both approaches; in the second case, we found that it could be accomplished inside the tunnel, quite unlike our experience with run 4. Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve entry with either approach.A general disadvantage of the inflatable tunnel approach was that the tunnel itself tended to get sticky with sweat and other discharges. We feel that the difficulty of keeping a tunnel clean in zero-G makes these solutions most unsatisfactory.7) The standard missionary posture, augmented by having    the female hook her legs around the male\u0027\u0027s thighs    and both partners hug each other.8) The posture used in run 3, but with the female    holding herself against the male by gripping his    buttocks with her heels.Initially, these were very exciting and promising approaches, but as the runs approached their climaxes, an unexpected problem arose. One or the one or the other partner tended to let go, and the hold provided by the remaining partner was insufficient to allow continued thrusts. We think that partners with sufficient self-control might be able to use these positions, but we found them frustrating.9) The posture used in run 2, but with the male using    his hands to hold the female while the female used    her heels to hold the male\u0027\u0027s thighs.Most of the responsibility for success rested on the male here, and we were successful after a series of false starts, but we did not find the experience to be particularly rewarding.10) Each partner gripping the other\u0027\u0027s head between    their thighs and hugging the other\u0027\u0027s hips with their    arms.This was the only run involving non-procreative marital relations, and it was included largely because it provided the greatest number of distinct ways for each partner to hold the other. This 4 points redundant hold was good enough that we found this solution to be most satisfactory. In fact, it was more rewarding than analogous postures used in a gravitational field.-------------------------------------------------------RECOMMENDATIONWe recommend that married couples considering maintaining their marital relations during a space mission be provided with an elastic belt such as we used for run 3 (see Appendix II). In addition, we advise that a training program be developed that recommends the solutions used in runs 3 and 10 and warns against the problems encountered in runs 7 and 8.We recognize that any attempt by NASA to recommend approaches to marital relationships will be politically risky, but we feel that, especially in cases where long missions are planned, thought be given to screening couples applying to serve on such missions for their ability to accept or adapt to the solutions used in runs 3 and 10.------------------------------------------------------- NASA Contractor Report 3490A University of (NAME DELETED)IntroductionSupport for the commonsensical observation that male/female subjects can conduct normal marital relations in a zero G environment with mechanical assistance has been deemed feasible based on the experiments outlined in reports NASW-xxxx, NAS1-xxxx, and NASW-xxxx.-------------------------------------------------------MethodThe adaptation of current experiments in artificial eye-hand coordination through application of neural networks coupled with on going cooperating redundant wrist manipulators was performed. The basic paradigm involved attaching each subject to a manipulator and coordinating the motion of the subjects through a two hidden-layer back-error propagation neural network. The output of the neural network stage was fed into a backward- chaining rule based system in order to achieve optimal control of the manipulators. Two different configurations were tested. The first setting involved the application of a single hold manipulator attached via a rigid waist device. The second configuration, believed to be more stable, involved attachment via three bands that can be arranged in different configurations in order to match the local differences of the particular subjects.Attachment of the subjects to the harness was achieved through an electrically excited velcro-like coupling, VELEE-2, see reference NASW- 5641. This arrangement allowed the subject to experiment with different attachment points via vocal command to the manipulators\u0027\u0027 control system.-------------------------------------------------------ConclusionThe effectiveness of the system was validated through twelve experiments. During the course of these experiments it was determined that the use of the redundant manipulator allowed for single subject use of the system as a unisexual device. We believe that this could be of great importance for long duration flights were the subject can not find a suitable partner or the availability of a opposite configured SO is limited.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cdiv id\u003d\"nodevote result\"\u003eScore: 0.0, votes: 0\u003c/div\u003e\\n","Un joven, que practicaba el nudismo, recibi�酶惟 una carta de su abuela en la cual le ped�酶惟a que, por favor, le mandara una fotograf�酶惟a reciente de �酶惟l.

The most powerful force in the universe is gossip. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we all believe that we are above-average drivers. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to make a big deal about your birthday. That time is age 11. There is a very fine line between \"hobby\" and \"mental illness.\" If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that  word would be \"meetings.\" If there really is a God who created the entire universe with all of its glories, and he decides to deliver a message to humanity, he will not use as his  messenger a person on cable TV with a bad hairdo.

Larry\u0027\u0027s\u003cbr /\u003e boyhood dream was to fly.  When he graduated from high school, he\u003cbr /\u003e joined the Air Force in hopes of becoming a pilot.  Unfortunately, poor\u003cbr /\u003e eyesight disqualified him.  When he was finally discharged, he had to\u003cbr /\u003e satisfy himself with watching jets fly over his backyard.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, Larry, had a bright idea.  He decided to fly.  He went to the\u003cbr /\u003e local Army-Navy surplus store and purchased 45 weather balloons and\u003cbr /\u003e several tanks of helium.  The weather balloons, when fully inflated,\u003cbr /\u003e would measure more than four feet across.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBack home, Larry securely strapped the balloons to his sturdy lawn\u003cbr /\u003e chair. He anchored the chair to the bumper of his jeep and inflated the\u003cbr /\u003e balloons with the helium.  He climbed on for a test while it was still\u003cbr /\u003e only a few feet above the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSatisfied it would work, Larry packed several sandwiches and a six-pack\u003cbr /\u003e of Miller Lite, loaded his pellet gun-- figuring he could pop a few\u003cbr /\u003e balloons when it was time to descend-- and went back to the floating\u003cbr /\u003e lawn chair.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHe tied himself in along with his pellet gun and provisions. Larry\u0027\u0027s\u003cbr /\u003e plan was to lazily float up to a height of about 30 feet above his back\u003cbr /\u003e yard after severing the anchor and in a few hours come back down.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThings didn\u0027\u0027t quite work out that way.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he cut the cord anchoring the lawn chair to his jeep, he didn\u0027\u0027t\u003cbr /\u003e float lazily up to 30 or so feet. Instead  he streaked into the LA sky\u003cbr /\u003e as if shot from a cannon.  He didn\u0027\u0027t level off at 30 feet, nor did he\u003cbr /\u003e level off at 100 feet.  After climbing and climbing, he leveled off at\u003cbr /\u003e 11,000 feet. At that height he couldn\u0027\u0027t risk shooting any of the\u003cbr /\u003e balloons, lest he unbalance the load and really find himself in\u003cbr /\u003e trouble.

He found himself drifting into the the\u003cbr /\u003e primary approach corridor of Los Angeles International Airport. A\u003cbr /\u003e United pilot first spotted Larry.  He radioed the tower and described\u003cbr /\u003e passing a guy in a lawn chair with a gun.  Radar confirmed the\u003cbr /\u003e existence of an object floating 11,000 feet above the airport.

Night was\u003cbr /\u003e falling and the offshore breeze began to flow.  It carried Larry out to\u003cbr /\u003e sea with the helicopter in hot pursuit. Several miles out, the\u003cbr /\u003e helicopter caught up with Larry.  Once the crew determined that Larry\u003cbr /\u003e was not dangerous, they attempted to close in for a rescue but the\u003cbr /\u003e draft from the blades would push Larry away whenever they neared.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the helicopter ascended to a position several hundred feet\u003cbr /\u003e above Larry and lowered a rescue line.

As soon as Larry was hauled to earth, he was\u003cbr /\u003e arrested by waiting members of the LAPD for violating LAX airspace.  As\u003cbr /\u003e he was led away in handcuffs, a reporter dispatched to cover the daring\u003cbr /\u003e rescue asked why he had done it.

But I want you to know that there\u0027\u0027s always a chance for us\". This is known as the \"I Hate You / I Love You\" drunken phone call, that 99% if all men have made at least once.

The average number of items in the typical woman\u0027\u0027s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.\u003cbr /\u003e Most men take only 2-3 minutes to relieve themselves.

They\u0027\u0027ll shell out $4000 for state of the art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography classes. Women purchase Kodak Instamatics.  Of course, women always end up taking better pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eCats:\u003cbr /\u003e Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren\u0027\u0027t looking, men kick cats.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eCheerleaders:\u003cbr /\u003e Female cheerleaders are cute, sexy, fresh, and all-American.

Immediately, the men will get very excited; they will laugh uproariously, and even try to imitate the actions of Curly, man\u0027\u0027s favorite Stooge. The women will roll their eyes and groan and wait it out.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Letterman:\u003cbr /\u003e Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the Earth. Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always has a bad haircut.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDirections:\u003cbr /\u003e If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings, she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions. Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. Men will never stop and ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, \"Looks like I\u0027\u0027ve found a new way to get there.\" and, \"I know I\u0027\u0027m in the general neighborhood. I recognize that 7-11 store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDressing Up:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for: weddings, funerals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eEating out:\u003cbr /\u003e When the check comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it\u0027\u0027s only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller, and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their check, out come the pocket calculators.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGarages:\u003cbr /\u003e Women use garages to park their cars and store their lawnmowers. Men use garages for many things. They hang license plates in garages, they watch TV in garages, and they build useless lopsided benches in garages.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGoing Out:\u003cbr /\u003e When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she **will** be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earring, finishes putting on her makeup...\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGroceries:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reached the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter that the Clampett\u0027\u0027s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHandwriting:\u003cbr /\u003e To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken- scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their \"i\u0027\u0027s\" with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their \"p\u0027\u0027s\" and \"g\u0027\u0027s\". It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she\u0027\u0027s dumping you, she\u0027\u0027ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHats:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eJewelry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that\u0027\u0027s it. Any more than that, and he will look like a lounge singer named Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLaundry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul, and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of \"Love, American Style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLeg Warmers:\u003cbr /\u003e Leg warmers are sexy. A woman, even if she\u0027\u0027s walking the dog or doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers. She can wear them any time she wants. A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the \"Gimme the Ball\" number in \"A Chorus Line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLocker Rooms:\u003cbr /\u003e In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don\u0027\u0027t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one thing in the locker room, sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLow Blows:\u003cbr /\u003e Let\u0027\u0027s say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says \"Oh, gee. That must have hurt.\" The man groans and doubles over, and actually *feels* the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMagazines:\u003cbr /\u003e Men\u0027\u0027s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women\u0027\u0027s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman\u0027\u0027s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMaturity:\u003cbr /\u003e Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMenopause:\u003cbr /\u003e When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree ofthese changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction; he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather drivin gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMirrors:\u003cbr /\u003e Men are vain; they will always check themselves out in a mirror.  Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe Garagiola\u0027\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMoustaches:\u003cbr /\u003e Some men look good with moustaches. Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. There are no women who look good with moustaches.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMovies:\u003cbr /\u003e Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.  This is because most movies in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh\u003cbr /\u003e for the first time in \"Gone With the Wind\". For men, it\u0027\u0027s when Jimmy Cagney shoves grapefruit in May Clark\u0027\u0027s face in \"Public Enemy\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNicknames:\u003cbr /\u003e With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like \"Ultimate Pecs\" and \"Big Turk,\" women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dave, Rob, and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOffspring:\u003cbr /\u003e Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePlants:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePolitics:\u003cbr /\u003e Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such as voting. Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy\u0027\u0027s is growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign for them and cry on election night.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRestrooms:\u003cbr /\u003e Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms associal lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other. Womenwho\u0027\u0027ve never met will leave a restroom giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, \"Hey, Bob, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis difference may be due to the fact that women don\u0027\u0027t have to hold their genitals in the bathroom, which might make one feel self-conscious. Not having this problem, women can chat away quite comfortably while \"powdering their noses\". And yes, they are talking about men in their chats.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnother theory is that when women \"powder their noses\", all they have to do is sit there. What else is there for them to do but talk to other women. Men, however, must be much more attentive to such matters. If a male turns too much to talk to someone, he\u0027\u0027ll be leaking on his shoe. Men must be very serious and patient because heaven only knows if the stream of urine will suddenly change direction. And after all is done, men must try to remove any excess moisture unless he soils his underwear. And unlike women, there is no tissue paper nearby with which to wipe. A man must use his own skills at \"towel snapping\" to do the job. But no man wants to shake it forever because he might look like he\u0027\u0027s playing with himself. The shaking routine also varies culturally as most men inthe U.K. are \u0027\u0027pullers\u0027\u0027 as opposed to \u0027\u0027shakers\u0027\u0027. Of course, no matter how much a man shakes or pulls, chances are still good that he\u0027\u0027ll get that little dribble down the leg, which will expand to the size of Lake Ontario if he is wearing synthetics.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the shaking or pulling comes the tucking-it-all-back-in routine, where the male tries to not leave anything delicate in the path of the approaching zipper. As the men are all leaving the restroom, trying to button up their Levi\u0027\u0027s, they are still trying not to look as if they\u0027\u0027re playing with themselves. For a man, a trip to the bathroom is a very serious matter. You wouldn\u0027\u0027t gossip and chatter at a board meeting would you?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFor the male, there are also the considerations like seeing how far up the trough he can pee, bombing the cigarette butt, peeling off the killer fart that he didn\u0027\u0027t want to loose off at the bar and, his favorite, making that grunt/sigh noise as the first gush lets go, sort of a \"Nnnngwwwwwaaaaa\". Actually, that\u0027\u0027s about the time the first fart goes too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Gere:\u003cbr /\u003e Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMadonna:\u003cbr /\u003e Same as above, but reversed.  Same reason.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSex:\u003cbr /\u003e Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of\u003cbr /\u003e foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eShoes:\u003cbr /\u003e When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip on Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes all day.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSocks:\u003cbr /\u003e Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks. Socks that are cut way below the ankles, that have pictures of clouds on them, that have a big fuzzy ball on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSports Arenas:\u003cbr /\u003e Simply put, men can always find their way around stadiums and arenas. The women usually end up following men.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eTelephone:\u003cbr /\u003e Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eToys:\u003cbr /\u003e Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of men\u0027\u0027s toys: little miniature TV\u0027\u0027s, car phones, complicated juicers and blenders, graphic equalizers, small robots that serve cocktails on command, video games, anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least 6 \"D\" batteries to operate. However, the only toys women still keep around when they grow up still require batteries, only few in number and smaller in size.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUnderwear:\u003cbr /\u003e Colored underwear. Women are allowed, in fact encouraged, to wear colored underwear. There is no reason for a man to ever, ever, wear anything besides solid white.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWeddings:\u003cbr /\u003e When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about \"the ceremony\".

There was, of course, a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He would have a religious debate with a leader of the Jewish community. If the Jewish leader won the debate, the Jews would be permitted to stay in Italy. If the Pope won, the Jews would have to leave.The Jewish community met and picked an aged Rabbi, Moishe, to represent them in the debate. Rabbi Moishe, however, could not speak Latin and the Pope could not speak Yiddish. So it was decided that this would be a \"silent\" debate.On the day of the great debate, the Pope and Rabbi Moishe sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Rabbi Moishe looked back and raised one finger.    Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. Rabbi Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope then brought out a communion wafer and chalice of wine. Rabbi Moishe pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and said, \"I concede the debate. This man has bested me. The Jews can stay.\"Later, the Cardinals gathered around the Pope, asking him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us of our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?\"Meanwhile, the Jewish community crowded around Rabbi Moishe, asking what happened. \"Well,\" said Moishe, \"first he said to me, \u0027\u0027You Jews have three days to get out of here.\u0027\u0027 So I said to him, \u0027\u0027Up yours\u0027\u0027.

The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care, In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair.  The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds, While visions of perjury danced in their heads.  And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap, Had just settled in for a long evening\u0027\u0027s nap.When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter.  When what to their wondering eyes should appear But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer.  With a Presidential address, so lively and quick, They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick!More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came, And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:\u0027\u0027Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let\u0027\u0027s forget The Vixen!On Barney! On Maxine! I\u0027\u0027m no Richard Nixon!!!\u0027\u0027 \u0027\u0027From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall, Now dash away, dash away, dash away all !!!\u0027\u0027And then the Republicans heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  They scratched their heads and were turning around When resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound.  No longer would he eat from his humble pie, While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky.  A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq, It looked once again like Slick Willie was back.His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, His nose like a cherry.  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the hair on his head was as white as the snow.  The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.  He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf, And the Republicans wept, in spite of themselves.  And a wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave them to know they had something to dread.  He spoke the right words and went straight to his work Hard to believe Mon had called him \u0027\u0027The Jerk.\u0027\u0027And shaking his finger and thumbing his nose, By \u0027\u0027Wagging The Dog,\u0027\u0027 up the polls he rose.  He turned to his spinmeisters and gave them a whistle, Then they cheered-on Slick Willie as he launched another missile.  They all heard him exclaim, with Impeachment out of sight, \u0027\u0027Happy Ramadan to all, and to all a good night.\u0027\u0027","After Quasimodo\u0027\u0027s death, the bishop of the cathedral of  Notre Dame sent word\u003cbr /\u003e through the streets of Paris that a  new bell ringer was needed.

Someone who solves a problem you didn\u0027\u0027t know you had in a way you don\u0027\u0027t understand. What\u0027\u0027s the definition of a good tax accountant? Someone who has a loophole named after him. When does a person decide to become an accountant? When he realises he doesn\u0027\u0027t have the charisma to succeed as an undertaker. What does an accountant use for birth control? His personality. What\u0027\u0027s an extroverted accountant? One who looks at your shoes while he\u0027\u0027s talking to you instead of his own. What\u0027\u0027s an auditor? Someone who arrives after the battle and bayonets all the wounded. Why did the auditor cross the road? Because he looked in the file and that\u0027\u0027s what they did last year. There are three kinds of accountants in the world. Those who can count and those who can\u0027\u0027t. How do you drive an accountant completely insane? Tie him to a chair, stand in front of him and fold up a road map the wrong way. What do accountants suffer from that ordinary people don\u0027\u0027t? Depreciation. An accountant is someone who knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing. An accountant is having a hard time sleeping and goes to see his  doctor. \"Doctor, I just can\u0027\u0027t get to sleep at night.\" \"Have you tried counting sheep?\" \"That\u0027\u0027s the problem - I make a mistake and then spend three hours  trying to find it.\"","How on earth can you see the TV sitting so far back?\u003cbr /\u003e 1.Yeah, I used to cut class a lot too.\u003cbr /\u003e 2.Let me smell that shirt - don\u0027\u0027t worry, it\u0027\u0027s good for another week.\u003cbr /\u003e 3.Go ahead and keep that stray dog, honey.

Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The right honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:1. You should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up \"aluminium\". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up \"vocabulary\". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as \"like\" and \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up \"interspersed\".2. There is no such thing as \"US English\". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn\u0027\u0027t that hard.4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.5. You should relearn your original national anthem, \"God Save The Queen\", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.6. You should stop playing American \"football\". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American \"football\" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays \"American\" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American \"football\", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys.\"Merde\" is French for \"sh*t\".8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called \"Indecisive Day\".9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It\u0027\u0027s been driving us bonkers.Thank you for your co-operation.","One night at a bar, there was a Blonde and a Brunette sipping a beer and watching the news.

Allan, a 33-year-old computer technician, showed his competitive spirit by dying of competitive spirits. A Sydney, Australia hotel bar held a drinking competition, known as Feral Friday, with a 100-minute time limit and a sliding point scale ranging from 1 point for beer to 8 points for hard liquor. Allan stood and cheered his winning total of 236, (winners never quit!) which had also netted him the literally staggering blood alcohol level of 0.353, 7 times greater than Australia\u0027\u0027s legal driving limit of 0.05%. After several trips to the usual temple of overindulgence, the bathroom, Allan was helped back to his workplace to sleep it off, a condition that became permanent. A forensic pharmacologist estimated that after downing 34 beers, 4 bourbons, and 17 shots of tequila within 1 hour and 40 minutes, his blood alcohol level would have been 0.41 to 0.43, but Allan had vomited several times after the drinking stopped. The ost paid by Allan was much higher than that of the hotel, which was fined the equivalent of $13,100 US dollars for not intervening. It is not known whether Allan required any further embalming.","(We take you now to the Oval Office. \"W\" meets with Condalessa Rice)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge:  Condi!  Nice to see you.

It wasn\u0027\u0027t you entering the men\u0027\u0027s washroom that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the time. It\u0027\u0027s rare us guys ever hit what were aiming for. Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around; just so I\u0027\u0027ll make sure I hit something. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYou see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men\u0027\u0027s penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I\u0027\u0027m telling \u0027\u0027ya those little buggers can\u0027\u0027t be trusted. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I\u0027\u0027m no longer allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee-soaked toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my sleep. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow another thing us guys don\u0027\u0027t usually like to talk about, but because you and I have become such good friends and you think I\u0027\u0027m a classy guy, I might as well be candid with you because it\u0027\u0027s a real problem, and you ladies need to be understanding. It\u0027\u0027s the dreaded \"morning wood\". Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can\u0027\u0027t get that thing to bend, and if it won\u0027\u0027t bend you can\u0027\u0027t aim, well hell, if you can\u0027\u0027t aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wall paper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet. And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seatcovers, the friggin\u0027\u0027 toilet seat won\u0027\u0027t stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control our less-than-perfect aim. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow sometimes, when you\u0027\u0027re newly married, (and I know the guys! in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it\u0027\u0027s just not safe. I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her...look, it won\u0027\u0027t bend. She said, \"so sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time.\" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with \"morning wood\". Well it\u0027\u0027s is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee, the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet. I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it\u0027\u0027s the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee. So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027\u0027s not our fault, it\u0027\u0027s just Mother Nature. Now, if it was Father Nature, there wouldn\u0027\u0027t have been a problem!!!","Morris walks out into the street and manages to get a taxi just going by.

Well okay, that\u0027\u0027s actually completely untrue, but since we\u0027\u0027re on the subject I want to tell you about Lamaze class.Lamaze is a breathing technique whereby women feel no pain while having an object the size of a small watermelon claw its way out of their bodies.  Yes, this is utterly ridiculous, but Lamaze class has apparently become a prerequisite to giving birth:  in fact, a woman in East Jordan, Michigan was recently discovered by authorities to have given birth to a baby without having first attended Lamaze, and the courts actually made her put it back.Although pregnancy has been around for at least 100 years, most men don\u0027\u0027t understand anything about it.  It was news to me that pregnancy takes place in three trimesters (Trimester comes from the phrase, \u0027\u0027Don\u0027\u0027t you even TRY, MISTER,\u0027\u0027 uttered by women when men suggest that maybe they can\u0027\u0027t make it to Lamaze class one night.) The three trimesters are: Vomiting, Weight Gain, and Crying.The men at Lamaze class are there mainly as punishment for having caused their mates to swell up to the size of Marlin Brando.  I mean, realistically, how can we help someone else BREATHE?  (More to the point, I can testify truthfully that a woman in labor who is urged to \u0027\u0027breathe, honey, breathe\u0027\u0027 will respond in a tone for which \u0027\u0027pleasant\u0027\u0027 is an antonym.)The punishment begins with the first lesson, where everybody sits there and is supposed to be quiet while they watch a film of somebody else\u0027\u0027s baby being born.  This is where you learn you shouldn\u0027\u0027t have eaten before Lamaze class, even if your wife simply HAD to have a Pizza Hut Supreme with Double Cheese or she would pass out from hunger.  You give the other guys a \u0027\u0027can you believe this?\u0027\u0027 look, doing your Lamaze breathing so you won\u0027\u0027t blow pizza.  By the end of the movie they ought to usher in a urologist to perform vasectomies; they\u0027\u0027d make a couple of grand right on the spot.  The final frame depicts everyone standing around looking happy, except maybe the baby, who frankly appears more than a little pissed off at how his morning\u0027\u0027s going.The night I went, the movie was a horror double feature, with Night of the Living Cesarean Section immediately following Birth of the Pizza Baby.After the movie there is a short break so the men can get together and vow that the only way they\u0027\u0027re going to make it through this is if they\u0027\u0027re drunk. Then the group is reassembled to practice breathing, even though we\u0027\u0027ve been breathing all our lives and probably don\u0027\u0027t need any more practice.  What did pregnant women do before this Lamaze guy came along, hold their breaths for nine months?  And why do I have to practice?  Heck, I\u0027\u0027m so good at breathing I can even do it in my sleep!  During all this panting and gasping, the men are told to squeeze their mates\u0027\u0027 thighs to \u0027\u0027simulate labor.\u0027\u0027Squeeze her leg to simulate labor!  That\u0027\u0027s like simulating a concussion by getting a haircut.  If you want to simulate labor, you should run her lips through a pencil sharpener.  But you don\u0027\u0027t know this, so you dutifully squeeze while she dutifully breathes.  Men who make note of the fact that pregnancy has caused the thighs they are squeezing to maybe require two hands instead of one will be violently torn into small pieces by a bunch of crazed Lamaze women, and no female jury in the world would find anything in this other than justice.In Lamaze I learned there are several different stages of labor.  In none of them do you want your wife to have access to sharp objects. By about the third stage you both know that this breathing thing is a bunch of baloney--labor, it seems, HURTS, and you can pant like a race horse after the Kentucky Derby, but it won\u0027\u0027t alter the sensation of having a whole human being clamber out of your stomach and into the world.Often a man will run into a fellow Lamaze class husband at the hospital.

A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I\u0027\u0027m telling you those little buggers can\u0027\u0027t be trusted.Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can\u0027\u0027t get that thing to bend, and if it won\u0027\u0027t bend, you can\u0027\u0027t aim, well hell, if you can\u0027\u0027t aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wall paper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet.And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the frigging toilet seat won\u0027\u0027t stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control our less than perfect aim.Now sometimes, when you\u0027\u0027re newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it\u0027\u0027s just not safe.I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her... look, it won\u0027\u0027t bend. She said, \"so sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time.\" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with \"morning wood.\" Well, it\u0027\u0027s is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room.Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee, the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet. I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position -- lying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it\u0027\u0027s the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee.","A police officer pulls a guy over for speeding and has the following exchange: \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer: May I see your driver\u0027\u0027s license? \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDriver: I don\u0027\u0027t have one.

Examples: Milk Duds, buttered popcorn, Junior Mints,  Red Hots and Tootsie Rolls.\u003cbr /\u003e 7.  Cookie pieces contain no calories. The process of breaking  causes calorie leakage.\u003cbr /\u003e 8.  Things licked off knives and spoons have no calories if you are in the process of preparing something.\u003cbr /\u003e 9.  Foods that have the same color have the same number of calories. Examples are: spinach and pistachio ice cream; mushrooms and mashed potatoes.\u003cbr /\u003e 10.  Chocolate is a universal color and may be substituted for any other food color.\u003cbr /\u003e 11.  Anything consumed while standing has no calories.  This is due to gravity and the density of the caloric mass.\u003cbr /\u003e 12.

Avoid alliteration.  Always.2.  Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.3.  Avoid cliches like the plague.  (They\u0027\u0027re old hat.)4.  Employ the vernacular.5.  Eschew ampersands \u0026amp; abbreviations, etc.6.  Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.7.  It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.8.  Contractions aren\u0027\u0027t necessary.9.  Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.10. One should never generalize.11. Eliminate quotations.

One-word sentences?  Eliminate.17. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.18. The passive voice is to be avoided.19. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.20. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.21. Who needs rhetorical questions?22. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.","One night, a cabby picked up a nun.

An additional symptom provided was: whilst being carried from the customer\u0027\u0027s site to our service center, a \u0027\u0027sloshing\u0027\u0027 noise was heard within the machine. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has anything been split on this computer?\" I inquired, but no, nothing of the sort had happened, protested the client vehemently. Taking this with a grain of salt (no-one\u0027\u0027s going to admit doing something that totally invalidates their warranty and effectively wrecks their computer) I went about filling in the repair order. Back on the bench, I started the PowerBook up. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, an address error on startup, just after \u0027\u0027Welcome to Macintosh\u0027\u0027. I lowered my ear to the keyboard, at which point I heard a crackling noise (couldn\u0027\u0027t hear any sloshing noise though) and became aware of a rather \u0027\u0027sharp\u0027\u0027 odor which seemed to emanate from the inside of the machine.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFlicking the computer off and unplugging the adapter, I removed the battery from its compartment, only to observe that the entire battery casing was soaked in a fluid which appear to have a rainbow-like sheen (kind of like what a puddle of soapy water would look like -- oily and colorful). I also noticed that the same fluid was leaking out of the battery compartment onto the static mat, but appeared clear rather than multi-colored. My first thoughts were that the battery had somehow leaked acid out into the guts of the PowerBook, which would account for the sharp smell (which reminded me of ammonia), yet the battery terminals were about the one part of the battery that was dry. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNo, upon closer examination, I ruled the acid theory out. The battery was wet, but not leaking. Tipping the machine on its side, I watched more fluid run out and coagulate on the bench in a puddle about the size of a compact disc. It was definitely clear, and I observed that the \u0027\u0027rainbow\u0027\u0027 effect had been caused by the reaction of the plastic battery casing to this \u0027\u0027mystery liquid\u0027\u0027. I then unscrewed the computer and separated the two parts of the PowerBook. The smell suddenly became a LOT stronger. T\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ehe hard disk looked like a solid lump of rust, and the daughterboard appeared to have about three barbecued chips. Although I was quickly forming my own opinions on what had happened, I invited several of my workmates in to take a sniff and offer an opinion. We were unanimous in our decision. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI rang the customer, who seemed surprised when I asked the question: \"Do you have a cat?\" As it turned out, he didn\u0027\u0027t have a cat, but he did have a lovely fluffy bunny rabbit who was seen in the vicinity of the PowerBook only the day before. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there was no doubt about it, little fluffy had hopped up onto the keyboard and downloaded some incompatible data. I checked the warranty form, but there was no provision for failure due to rabbit urine anywhere. I advised the customer to get in touch with his insurance company. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the PowerBook was biffed and the customer upgraded to a 180c. I cleaned up the static mat and sprayed the service department with a healthy dosage of \"Fresh Field of Flowers.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI checked in with the customer about a week later, asked how was he enjoying the 180c, asked if he\u0027\u0027d managed to restore his data, and, of course, asked how was his rabbit? \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delicious,\" he said.","Attorney: So, doctor, you determined that a gunshot wound was the cause of\u003cbr /\u003e death of the patient?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDoctor: That\u0027\u0027s correct.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAttorney: Did you examine the patient when he came to the emergency room?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDoctor: No, I performed the autopsy.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAttorney: Okay, were you aware of his vital signs while he was at the\u003cbr /\u003e hospital?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDoctor: Yes, he came in to the emergency room in shock and died in the\u003cbr /\u003e emergency room a short time after arriving.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAttorney: Did you pronounce him dead at that time?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDoctor: No, I am the pathologist who performed the autopsy.

The farmer welcomed them in, but cautioned them that there were only two spare beds, and that one of them would have to sleep in the barn with the farm animals. After a short conference, the police chief agreed to take the barn. Shortly after retiring, a knock was heard on the door of the farmhouse. The party inside answered to find the police chief standing there, complaining that he could not sleep. There were pigs in the barn, he said, and he was reminded of the days when everyone called him a pig. The fire chief then volunteered to exchange with the police chief. A short time later, another knock was heard at the door. The fire chief complained that the cows in the barn reminded him of Mrs. O\u0027\u0027Leary\u0027\u0027s cow that started the Chicago fire, and that every time he started to go to sleep, he started to have a fireman\u0027\u0027s worst nightmare, that of burning to death. The city attorney, in desperation for sleep, then agreed to sleep in the barn. This seemed like a good idea until a few minutes later, when another knock was heard at the door. When the occupants answered the door, there stood the very indignant cows and pigs.","A mangy looking guy who goes into a bar and orders a drink. The bartender says: \"No way.

He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye! As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, no one was about.

The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have a real bummer of a day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.The next day at 12:01, the first person comes to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly says to the man, \u0027\u0027Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died.\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027No problem,\u0027\u0027 the man says. \u0027\u0027I came home to my 25th floor apartment in my lunch hour and caught my wife half-naked and appearing to be having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight.

But wouldn\u0027\u0027t you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn\u0027\u0027t die. This ticked me off even more. In a rage, I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him. Oddly enough, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony, and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 storeys and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.\u0027\u0027The angel sits back and thinks for a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day.

I had been under a lot of pressure so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side!\u0027\u0027Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, starts cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom that broke my fall so I didn\u0027\u0027t die right away. As I\u0027\u0027m laying there face up on the ground, unable to move, and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator of all things off the balcony.

Certainly, it represents a considerable undertaking, and many of your statements do merit serious consideration. Unfortunately, the Declaration as a whole fails to meet recently adopted specifications for proposals to the Crown, so we must return the document to you for further refinement. The questions which follow might assist you in your process of revision:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e1.In your opening paragraph you use the phrase \"the Laws of Nature and Nature\u0027\u0027s God.\" What are these laws? In what way are they the criteria on which you base your central arguments? Please document with citations from the recent literature.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e2.In the same paragraph you refer to the \"opinions of mankind.\" Whose polling data are you using? Without specific evidence, it seems to us the \"opinions of mankind\" are a matter of opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e3.You hold certain truths to be \"self-evident.\" Could you please elaborate. If they are as evident as you claim then it should not be difficult for you to locate the appropriate supporting statistics.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e4.\"Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" seem to be the goals of your proposal. These are not measurable goals. If you were to say that \"among these is the ability to sustain an average life expectancy in six of the 13 colonies of at last 55 years, and to enable newspapers in the colonies to print news without outside interference, and to raise the average income of the colonists by 10 percent in the next 10 years,\" these could be measurable goals. Please clarify.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e5.You state that \"Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Government....\" Have you weighed this assertion against all the alternatives? What are the trade-off considerations?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e6.Your description of the existing situation is quite extensive. Such a long list of grievances should precede the statement of goals, not follow it. Your problem statement needs improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e7.Your strategy for achieving your goal is not developed at all. You state that the colonies \"ought to be Free and Independent States,\" and that they are \"Absolved from All Allegiance to the British Crown.\" Who or what must change to achieve this objective? In what way must they change? What specific steps will you take to overcome the resistance? How long will it take? We have found that a little foresight in these areas helps to prevent careless errors later on. How cost-effective are your strategies?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e8.Who among the list of signatories will be responsible for implementing your strategy? Who conceived it? Who provided the theoretical research? Who will constitute the advisory committee? Please submit an organization chart and vitas of the principal investigators.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e9.You must include an evaluation design. We have been requiring this since Queen Anne\u0027\u0027s War. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10.What impact will your problem have?

The main danger, apparently, is  that the organic components of this aroma may break down ozone.I was horrified. When are we going to do something about  bread-induced global warming? Sure, we attack tobacco companies,  but when is the government going to go after Big Bread? Well,  I\u0027\u0027ve done a little research, and what I\u0027\u0027ve discovered should make  anyone think twice....THE FINDINGS1. More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread eaters.2. Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread-consuming  households score below average on standardized tests.3. In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in  the home, the average life expectancy was less than 50 years;  infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died  in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever and  influenza ravaged whole nations.4. More than 90 percent of violent crimes are committed  within 24 hours of eating bread.5. Bread is made from a substance called \u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027dough.\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027 It has been  proven that as little as one pound of dough can be used to  suffocate a mouse. The average person eats more bread than that  in one month!7. Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of  bread and given only water to eat begged for bread after only  two days.PROPOSED RESTRICTIONSMost bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish between significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical  babbling. In light of these frightening statistics, we  propose the following bread restrictions1. No sale of bread to minors.2. No advertising of bread within 1000 feet of a school.3. A 300 percent federal tax on all bread to pay for all  the societal ills we might associate with bread.4. No animal or human images, nor any primary colors (which may  appeal to children) may be used to promote bread usage.5. A $40.2 billion fine on the three biggest bread manufacturers.","1.

I\u0027\u0027m fairly certain it\u0027\u0027s some sort of photographic memory deal. Women take one quick look and memorize it for later reference.

Left to its own devices, it will just do the same damn dumb things it did before.It provides a way to interact with other people.  Some people take this interaction very seriously, others treat it as a lark.  Sometimes it\u0027\u0027s hard to tell what kind of person you\u0027\u0027re dealing with until it\u0027\u0027s too late.If you don\u0027\u0027t apply the appropriate protective measures, it can spread viruses.It has no brain of its own.  Instead, it uses yours.  If you use it too much, you\u0027\u0027ll find it becomes more and more difficult to think coherently.You think you\u0027\u0027re just playing around, but you can get involved in something that takes 9 months to finish.The part you see is actually just the front end of a very complicated system.If you\u0027\u0027re not careful what you do with it, it can get you in big trouble.It has its own agenda.

It\u0027\u0027s so easy to use, even a child can operate it. Compact and portable, it can be used anywhere -- even sitting in an armchair by the fire -- yet it is powerful enough to hold as much information as a CD-ROM disc. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0027\u0027s how it works: BOOK is constructed of sequentially numbered sheets of paper (recyclable), each capable of holding thousands of bits of information. The pages are locked together with a custom-fit device called a binder which keeps the sheets in their correct sequence. Opaque Paper Technology (OPT) allows manufacturers to use both sides of the sheet, doubling the information density and cutting costs. Experts are divided on the prospects for further increases in information density; for now, BOOKS with more information simply use more pages. Each sheet is scanned optically, registering information directly into your brain. A flick of the finger takes you to the next sheet. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBOOK may be taken up at any time and used merely by opening it. BOOK never crashes or requires rebooting, though, like other devices, it can become damaged if coffee is spilled on it and it becomes unusable if dropped too many times on a hard surface. The \"browse\" feature allows you to move instantly to any sheet, and move forward or backward as you wish. Many come with an \"index\" feature, which pin-points the exact location of any selected information for instant retrieval. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAn optional \"BOOKmark\" accessory allows you to open BOOK to the exact place you left it in a previous session -- even if the BOOK has been closed. BOOKmarks fit universal design standards; thus, a single BOOKmark can be used in BOOKs by various manufacturers. Conversely, numerous BOOK markers can be used in a single BOOK if the user wants to store numerous views at once. The number is limited only by the number of pages in the BOOK. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also make personal notes next to BOOK text entries with optional programming tools, Portable Erasable Nib Cryptic Intercommunication Language Styli (PENCILS). Portable, durable, and affordable, BOOK is being hailed as a precursor of a new entertainment wave. BOOK\u0027\u0027s appeal seems so certain that thousands of content creators have committed to the platform and investors are reportedly flocking to invest. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLook for a flood of new titles soon.","The Pope, Billy Graham and Oral Roberts were in a three-way plane crash\u003cbr /\u003e over the Atlantic Ocean.

(That is, of course, a lie. The only things you young persons think seriously about are loud music and sex. Trust me: these are closely related to college.)\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eCollege is basically a bunch of rooms where you sit for roughly two thousand hours and try to memorize things. The two thousand hours are spread out over four years; you spend the rest of the time sleeping and trying to get dates.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, you learn two kinds of things in college:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e* Things you will need to know in later life (two hours). These include how to make collect telephone calls and get beer and crepe-paper stains out of your pajamas.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e* Things you will not need to know in later life (1,998 hours). These are the things you learn in classes whose names end in -ology, - - -osophy, -istry, -ics, and so on. The idea is, you memorize these things, then write them down in little exam books, then forget them. If you fail to forget them, you become a professor and have to stay in college for the rest of your life.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027\u0027s very difficult to forget everything. For example, when I was in college, I had to memorize -- don\u0027\u0027t ask me why -- the names of three metaphysical poets other than John Donne. I have managed to forget one of them, but I still remember that the other two were named Vaughan and Crashaw. Sometimes, when I\u0027\u0027m trying to remember something important like whether my wife told me to get tuna packed in oil or tuna packed in water, Vaughan and Crashaw just pop up in my mind, right there in the supermarket. It\u0027\u0027s a terrible waste of brain cells.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you\u0027\u0027ve been in college for a year or so, you\u0027\u0027re supposed to choose a major, which is the subject you intend to memorize and forget the most things about. Here is a very important piece of advice: Be sure to choose a major that does not involve Known Facts and Right Answers.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis means you must *not* major in mathematics, physics, biology, or chemistry, because these subjects involve actual facts. If, for example, you major in mathematics, you\u0027\u0027re going to wander into class one day and the professor will say: \"Define the cosine integer of the quadrant of a rhomboid binary axis, and extrapolate your result to five significant vertices.\" If you don\u0027\u0027t come up with exactly the answer the professor has in mind, you fail. The same is true of chemistry: if you write in your exam book that carbon and hydrogen combine to form oak, your professor will flunk you. He wants you to come up with the same answer he and all the other chemists have agreed on. Scientists are extremely snotty about this.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSo you should major in subjects like English, philosophy, psychology, and sociology -- subjects in which nobody really understands what anybody else is talking about, and which involve virtually no actual facts. I attended classes in all these subjects, so I\u0027\u0027ll give you a quick overview of each:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eENGLISH: This involves writing papers about long books you have read little snippets of just before class. Here is a tip on how to get good grades on your English papers: Never say anything about a book that anybody with any common sense would say. For example, suppose you are studying Moby Dick. Anybody with any common sense would say that Moby Dick is a big white whale, since the characters in the book refer to it as a big white whale roughly eleven thousand times. So in your paper, you say Moby Dick is actually the Republic of Ireland. Your professor, who is sick to death of reading papers and never liked Moby-Dick anyway, will think you are enormously creative. If you can regularly come up with lunatic interpretations of simple stories, you should major in English.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePHILOSOPHY: Basically, this involves sitting in a room and deciding there is no such thing as reality and then going to lunch. You should major in philosophy if you plan to take a lot of drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePSYCHOLOGY: This involves talking about rats and dreams. Psychologists are *obsessed* with rats and dreams. I once spent an entire semester training a rat to punch little buttons in a certain sequence, then training my roommate to do the same thing. The rat learned much faster. My roommate is now a doctor. If you like rats or dreams, and above all if you dream about rats, you should major in psychology.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSOCIOLOGY: For sheer lack of intelligibility, sociology is far and away the number one subject. I sat through hundreds of hours of sociology courses, and read gobs of sociology writing, and I never once heard or read a coherent statement. This is because sociologists want to be considered scientists, so they spend most of their time translating simple, obvious observations into  scientific-sounding code. If you plan to major in sociology, you\u0027\u0027ll have to learn to do the same thing. For example, suppose you have observed that children cry when they fall down. You should write: \"Methodological observation of the sociometrical behavior tendencies of prematurated isolates indicates that a casual relationship exists between groundward tropism and lachrimatory, or \u0027\u0027crying,\u0027\u0027 behavior forms.\" If you can keep this up for fifty or sixty pages, you will get a large government grant.","A man suffered a serious heart attack and had an open heart bypass surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHe awakened from the surgery to find himself in the care of nuns at a Catholic Hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAs he was recovering, a nun asked him questions regarding how he was going to pay for his treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked if he had health insurance. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHe replied in a raspy voice, \"No health insurance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun asked if he had money in the bank.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHe replied, \"No money in  the  bank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun asked, \"Do you have a relative who could help you?\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I only have a spinster sister, who is a nun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe nun became agitated and announced loudly, \"Nuns are not spinsters!

This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole is maintained or even improved by the regular culling of the weakest members.In much the same way, the human brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells through which the electrical signals pass. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that while excessive intake of alcohol kills off brain cells, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. Thus, regular consumption of beer helps eliminate the weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.The result of this in-depth study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend parties and job-related performance. It also explains why, after a few short years of leaving university and getting married, most professionals cannot keep up with the performance of the new graduates.Only those few that stick to the strict regimen of voracious alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that they achieved during their university years.So, this is a call to arms. As our country is losing its technological edge we should not shudder in our homes. Get back into the bars. Quaff that pint. Your company and country need you to be at your peak, and you shouldn\u0027\u0027t deny yourself the career that you could have. Take life by the bottle and be all that you can be.","1.

One day soon afterward, Sol is sitting there feeding the pigeons by himself when he hears a voice whisper, \"Sol... Sol....\"Sol responds, \"Abe! Is that you?\"\"Yes it is Sol,\" whispers the spirit of Abe.Sol, still amazed, asks, \"So, is there baseball in heaven?\"\"Well,\" says Abe says, \"I got good news and I got bad news.\"\"Gimme the good news first,\" says Sol.Abe says, \"Well... there is baseball in heaven.\"Sol says, \"That\u0027\u0027s great!

The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle and somehow, the motorcycle slipped into gear. The man, still holding the handlebars, was dragged through a glass patio door and the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room, and found her husband laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle laying next to him and the patio door shattered. The wife ran to the phone and summoned an ambulance.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBecause they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of long steps to the street to direct the paramedics to her husband. After the ambulance arrived and transported the husband to the hospital, the wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas had spilled on the floor, the wife obtained some papers towels, blotted up the gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe husband was treated at the hospital and was released to come home. After arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband laying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone and called for an ambulance.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe same ambulance crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself. She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them tipped the stretcher and dumped the husband out. He fell down the remaining steps and broke his ankle!","At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death. Here is the story:On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide.He left a note to that effect indicating his despondency. As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned.Ordinarily, Dr. Mills continued, \"a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended\" is still defined as committing suicide. Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below at street level, but his suicide attempt probably would not have been successful because of the safety net. This caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.The room on the ninth floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus.When one intends to kill subject A, but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with the murder charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant. They both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded. The old man said it was his long standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her. Therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident, that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple\u0027\u0027s son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son\u0027\u0027s financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother.The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son was in fact Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent over both the loss of his financial support and the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother\u0027\u0027s murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth-story window.

The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound. Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one.

Every time you ask a question, you are told you don\u0027\u0027t need to know, don\u0027\u0027t want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can\u0027\u0027t even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.  Then they go on the runway and piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they\u0027\u0027re building.CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13 airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don\u0027\u0027t need to know where the airplane is or who it belongs to in order to fly it.

Since the couple has no guest room, he states his intention to find a nearby hotel, and be on his way in the morning.\"Nonsense,\" says the wife. \"Our bed is plenty big enough for all three of us, and we\u0027\u0027re all friends here.\" The husband concurs, and before long they\u0027\u0027re settled in: husband in the middle, wife on his left, friend on his right.After a while, the husband begins snoring, and the wife sneaks over to the friend\u0027\u0027s side of the bed, and invites him to have sex with her. Naturally, he\u0027\u0027d like to, but he\u0027\u0027s reluctant. \"We\u0027\u0027re in the same bed with your husband! He\u0027\u0027ll wake up, and he\u0027\u0027ll kill me.\"\"Don\u0027\u0027t worry about it,\" she says, \"he\u0027\u0027s such a sound sleeper, he\u0027\u0027ll never notice. If you don\u0027\u0027t believe me, just yank a hair off of his ass. He won\u0027\u0027t even wake up.\"So the friend yanks a hair off the husband\u0027\u0027s butt, and sure enough, she\u0027\u0027s right. Her husband sleeps right through having a hair yanked out of his ass. So, she and the friend have sex, and then she goes back to her side of the bed.After about twenty minutes, though, she\u0027\u0027s back on his side of the bed, asking him to do it again. The same argument follows, another hair is yanked from the husband\u0027\u0027s rear end, and again they have sex.This keeps up for about half the night, until after about the sixth time, when the wife goes back to her side.Then the husband rolls over, and whispers to his friend, \"I don\u0027\u0027t mind that you\u0027\u0027re shagging my wife, but do you really have to use my ass as your scoreboard?\"","It seems the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a unique device for testing the strength of windshields on airplanes. The device is a gun that launches a dead chicken at a plane\u0027\u0027s windshield at approximately the speed the plane flies.The theory is that if the windshield doesn\u0027\u0027t crack from the carcass impact, it\u0027\u0027ll survive a real collision with a bird during flight. It seems the British were very interested in this and wanted to test a windshield on a brand new, speedy locomotive they\u0027\u0027re developing.They borrowed the FAA\u0027\u0027s chicken launcher, loaded the chicken and fired. The ballistic chicken shattered the windshield, went through the engineer\u0027\u0027s chair, broke an instrument panel and embedded itself in the back wall of the engine cab. The British were stunned and asked the FAA to recheck the test to see if everything was done correctly.The FAA reviewed the test thoroughly and had one recommendation: \"Use a thawed chicken.\"","My Dear Husband, \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI am sending you this letter via this BBS communications thing, so that you will be sure to read it.
