A mail has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3 am on a Sunday morning, he will call and say, \u0027\u0027I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I\u0027\u0027ll never forgive you, and hate you, and you\u0027\u0027re a total floozy. But I want you to know that there\u0027\u0027s always a chance for us.\u0027\u0027 This is known as the \u0027\u0027I Hate You, I Love You\u0027\u0027 drunken phone call and 99 percent of all men have made it at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need.Sex: Women prefer 30 to 40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30 to 40 seconds of foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.Maturity: Women mature much faster than men do. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.Magazines: Men\u0027\u0027s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women\u0027\u0027s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman\u0027\u0027s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.Bathrooms: A man has five items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman\u0027\u0027s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.Groceries: A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampetts\u0027\u0027 car on The Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10?items?or?less lane.Cats: Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren\u0027\u0027t looking, men kick cats.Offspring: Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.Dressing Up: A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.Laundry: Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a van and take his mountain of clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by reruns of old American sitcoms.Eating Out: When the bill comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it\u0027\u0027s only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.Mirrors: Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror. Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any, shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, bald boyfriend\u0027\u0027s/father\u0027\u0027s heads.Menopause: When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, biological Changes. Nature provokes a uniform reaction in men. He buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.Richard Gere: Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because lie reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.Madonna: Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.Toys: Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical. Examples of men\u0027\u0027s toys: little miniature TVs. Cell phones. Complicated juicers and blenders. Graphic equalizers. Small robots that serve cocktails on command. Video games. Anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least six big batteries to operate.Locker Rooms: In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don\u0027\u0027t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about one thing in the locker room: sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.Movies: Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man. Men will only show their arse, because arse size doesn\u0027\u0027t really matter.Jewelry: Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that\u0027\u0027s it. Any more than that and he will look like a lounge singer named Ramone.Time: When a woman says she\u0027\u0027ll be ready to go out in five more minutes, she\u0027\u0027s using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football game just has five minutes left. Neither of them is counting time outs, commercials, or replays.Friends: Women on a \u0027\u0027girls\u0027\u0027 night out\u0027\u0027 talk the whole time. Men on a \u0027\u0027boys\u0027\u0027 night out\u0027\u0027 say about 20 words all night, most of which are \u0027\u0027Pass the chips\u0027\u0027 or \u0027\u0027Got am more beer?\u0027\u0027Toilets: Men use toilets for purely biological reasons. Women use toilets as social lounges. Men in toilets will never speak a word to each other. Women who\u0027\u0027ve never met will leave a toilet giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, \u0027\u0027Hey Tom, I, was just about to take a leak.

Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. Men will never stop and ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, \"Looks like I\u0027\u0027ve found a new way to get there.\" and, \"I know I\u0027\u0027m in the general neighborhood.

A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reached the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter that the Clampett\u0027\u0027s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHandwriting:\u003cbr /\u003e To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken- scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their \"i\u0027\u0027s\" with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their \"p\u0027\u0027s\" and \"g\u0027\u0027s\". It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she\u0027\u0027s dumping you, she\u0027\u0027ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHats:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eJewelry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look nice when they wear jewelry.

Any more than that, and he will look like a lounge singer named Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLaundry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul, and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of \"Love, American Style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLeg Warmers:\u003cbr /\u003e Leg warmers are sexy. A woman, even if she\u0027\u0027s walking the dog or doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers. She can wear them any time she wants. A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the \"Gimme the Ball\" number in \"A Chorus Line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLocker Rooms:\u003cbr /\u003e In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don\u0027\u0027t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one thing in the locker room, sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLow Blows:\u003cbr /\u003e Let\u0027\u0027s say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says \"Oh, gee. That must have hurt.\" The man groans and doubles over, and actually *feels* the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMagazines:\u003cbr /\u003e Men\u0027\u0027s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women\u0027\u0027s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman\u0027\u0027s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMaturity:\u003cbr /\u003e Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMenopause:\u003cbr /\u003e When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree ofthese changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction; he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather drivin gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMirrors:\u003cbr /\u003e Men are vain; they will always check themselves out in a mirror.  Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe Garagiola\u0027\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMoustaches:\u003cbr /\u003e Some men look good with moustaches. Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. There are no women who look good with moustaches.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMovies:\u003cbr /\u003e Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.  This is because most movies in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh\u003cbr /\u003e for the first time in \"Gone With the Wind\". For men, it\u0027\u0027s when Jimmy Cagney shoves grapefruit in May Clark\u0027\u0027s face in \"Public Enemy\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNicknames:\u003cbr /\u003e With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like \"Ultimate Pecs\" and \"Big Turk,\" women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dave, Rob, and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOffspring:\u003cbr /\u003e Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePlants:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePolitics:\u003cbr /\u003e Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such as voting. Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy\u0027\u0027s is growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign for them and cry on election night.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRestrooms:\u003cbr /\u003e Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms associal lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other. Womenwho\u0027\u0027ve never met will leave a restroom giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, \"Hey, Bob, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis difference may be due to the fact that women don\u0027\u0027t have to hold their genitals in the bathroom, which might make one feel self-conscious. Not having this problem, women can chat away quite comfortably while \"powdering their noses\". And yes, they are talking about men in their chats.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnother theory is that when women \"powder their noses\", all they have to do is sit there. What else is there for them to do but talk to other women. Men, however, must be much more attentive to such matters. If a male turns too much to talk to someone, he\u0027\u0027ll be leaking on his shoe. Men must be very serious and patient because heaven only knows if the stream of urine will suddenly change direction. And after all is done, men must try to remove any excess moisture unless he soils his underwear. And unlike women, there is no tissue paper nearby with which to wipe. A man must use his own skills at \"towel snapping\" to do the job. But no man wants to shake it forever because he might look like he\u0027\u0027s playing with himself. The shaking routine also varies culturally as most men inthe U.K. are \u0027\u0027pullers\u0027\u0027 as opposed to \u0027\u0027shakers\u0027\u0027. Of course, no matter how much a man shakes or pulls, chances are still good that he\u0027\u0027ll get that little dribble down the leg, which will expand to the size of Lake Ontario if he is wearing synthetics.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the shaking or pulling comes the tucking-it-all-back-in routine, where the male tries to not leave anything delicate in the path of the approaching zipper. As the men are all leaving the restroom, trying to button up their Levi\u0027\u0027s, they are still trying not to look as if they\u0027\u0027re playing with themselves. For a man, a trip to the bathroom is a very serious matter. You wouldn\u0027\u0027t gossip and chatter at a board meeting would you?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFor the male, there are also the considerations like seeing how far up the trough he can pee, bombing the cigarette butt, peeling off the killer fart that he didn\u0027\u0027t want to loose off at the bar and, his favorite, making that grunt/sigh noise as the first gush lets go, sort of a \"Nnnngwwwwwaaaaa\". Actually, that\u0027\u0027s about the time the first fart goes too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Gere:\u003cbr /\u003e Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMadonna:\u003cbr /\u003e Same as above, but reversed.  Same reason.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSex:\u003cbr /\u003e Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of\u003cbr /\u003e foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eShoes:\u003cbr /\u003e When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip on Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes all day.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSocks:\u003cbr /\u003e Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks. Socks that are cut way below the ankles, that have pictures of clouds on them, that have a big fuzzy ball on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSports Arenas:\u003cbr /\u003e Simply put, men can always find their way around stadiums and arenas. The women usually end up following men.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eTelephone:\u003cbr /\u003e Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eToys:\u003cbr /\u003e Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of men\u0027\u0027s toys: little miniature TV\u0027\u0027s, car phones, complicated juicers and blenders, graphic equalizers, small robots that serve cocktails on command, video games, anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least 6 \"D\" batteries to operate. However, the only toys women still keep around when they grow up still require batteries, only few in number and smaller in size.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUnderwear:\u003cbr /\u003e Colored underwear. Women are allowed, in fact encouraged, to wear colored underwear. There is no reason for a man to ever, ever, wear anything besides solid white.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWeddings:\u003cbr /\u003e When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about \"the ceremony\". Men talk about \"the bachelor party\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cdiv id\u003d\"nodevote result\"\u003eScore: 0.0, votes: 0\u003c/div\u003e\\n","An aircraft is about to crash.

Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The right honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:1. You should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up \"aluminium\". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up \"vocabulary\". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as \"like\" and \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up \"interspersed\".2. There is no such thing as \"US English\". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn\u0027\u0027t that hard.4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.5. You should relearn your original national anthem, \"God Save The Queen\", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.6. You should stop playing American \"football\". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American \"football\" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays \"American\" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American \"football\", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys.\"Merde\" is French for \"sh*t\".8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called \"Indecisive Day\".9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It\u0027\u0027s been driving us bonkers.Thank you for your co-operation.","A football coach walked into the locker room before a big game, looked over to his star player and said, \"I\u0027\u0027m not supposed to let you play since you failed math, but we really need you in there.

The redhead had a lot more endurance than the brunette, as she swam out 10 miles before she even got tired.  After 15 miles, she was too tired to go on, so she drowned. So the blonde thought to herself, \"I wonder if they made it!  I think I\u0027\u0027d better try to make it, too.\"  So she swam out 5 miles, ten miles, 15 miles, NINETEEN miles from the island.

Since the media won\u0027\u0027t give it a rest and move on, we recommend playing the following game during any network or local news shows, \"special reports,\" news magazines (i.e.,Dateline, 20/20, etc), talk shows, or any other appropriate TV shows.Guaranteed to make watching this story more entertaining or your money back!Beverages required to play the game: Each player must have a beer handy, a liquor appropriate for pouring shots is also required (tequila or rum is preferred).RULES OF PLAY- If a TV announcer says \"Castro\" everyone in the room must salute with their left hand. The last person to do so must take a shot. If anyone salutes with their right hand accidentally, they also have to take a shot.- If the photo of the SWAT \"gunman\" is shown, everyone must act scared. The last person to do so must take a shot and then go into a closet until he is \"rescued\" by another player.- If the TV announcer says \"fisherman,\" everyone must press their palms together and make a swimming move with their hands. The last person to do so must chug whatever beer remains in their glass.- If a child psychologist is interviewed, everyone must stroke his/her chin and say, \"I see.\" The first person to do so becomes the \"psychologist\" and gets to administer shots to any players he/she deems in need of mood improvement.- During any interview of a Member of Congress, everyone must shout, \"bullshit!\" The last person to do so drinks.- If the TV announcer says \"Miami relatives\" everyone must shout out either \"Lazaro\" or \"Marisleysis\". A count is made of how many players said each name. Everyone who called out the more popular name has to take a drink of beer.- Whenever the station goes \"live to Little Havana\" everyone must stand up and dance. The last person on their feet has to do a shot.- If Marisleysis is shown crying everyone must yell \"knock it off\" and then take a drink of beer.- If Juan Miguel Gonzales is shown carrying his \"other son\" everyone must yell \"wahhhhh\" like a baby for as long as they can on one breath. The last person to stop gets to pick a person to do a shot.- If Elian Gonzales returns to Cuba with his father, everyone shouts \"Thank God.\" The game is then over.","She fell in love...and broke it!!!
