You should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary.\u003cbr /\u003e Then look up \"aluminium\" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLook up \"vocabulary\". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as \"like\" and \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.

What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American\" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game.

We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde.

There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need.Sex: Women prefer 30 to 40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30 to 40 seconds of foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.Maturity: Women mature much faster than men do. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.Magazines: Men\u0027\u0027s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women\u0027\u0027s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman\u0027\u0027s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.Bathrooms: A man has five items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman\u0027\u0027s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.Groceries: A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampetts\u0027\u0027 car on The Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10?items?or?less lane.Cats: Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren\u0027\u0027t looking, men kick cats.Offspring: Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.Dressing Up: A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.Laundry: Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a van and take his mountain of clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by reruns of old American sitcoms.Eating Out: When the bill comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it\u0027\u0027s only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.Mirrors: Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror.

Nature provokes a uniform reaction in men.

Men hate Richard Gere because lie reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.Madonna: Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.Toys: Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical. Examples of men\u0027\u0027s toys: little miniature TVs. Cell phones. Complicated juicers and blenders. Graphic equalizers. Small robots that serve cocktails on command. Video games. Anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least six big batteries to operate.Locker Rooms: In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don\u0027\u0027t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about one thing in the locker room: sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.Movies: Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man. Men will only show their arse, because arse size doesn\u0027\u0027t really matter.Jewelry: Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that\u0027\u0027s it.

Neither of them is counting time outs, commercials, or replays.Friends: Women on a \u0027\u0027girls\u0027\u0027 night out\u0027\u0027 talk the whole time.

It demagnetizes the stripes on ALL of your credit cards. It reprograms your ATM access code, screws up the tracking on your VCR and uses subspace field harmonics to scratch any CD\u0027\u0027s you attempt to play. It will re-calibrate your refrigerator\u0027\u0027s coolness settings so all your ice cream melts and your milk curdles. It will program your phone\u0027\u0027s autodial to call only your mother-in-law\u0027\u0027s number. This virus will mix antifreeze into your fish tank. It will drink all your beer. It will leave dirty socks on the coffee table when you are expecting company. Its radioactive emissions will cause your toe jam and bellybutton fuzz (be honest, you have some)to migrate behind your ears. It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine, all while dating your current boy/girlfriend behind your back and billing their hotel rendezvous to your Visa card. It will cause you to run with scissors and throw things in a way that is only fun until someone loses an eye. It will give you Dutch Elm Disease and Tinea. It will rewrite your backup files, changing all your active verbs to passive tense and incorporating undetectable misspellings, which grossly change the interpretations of key sentences. If the \"Badtimes\" message is opened in a Windows95 environment, it will leave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously close to a full bathtub. It will not only remove the forbidden tags from your mattresses and pillows, but it will also refill your skim milk with whole milk. It will replace all your luncheon meat with Spam. It will molecularly rearrange your cologne or perfume, causing it to smell like dill pickles. It is insidious and subtle. It is dangerous and terrifying to behold.

Every time you ask a question, you are told you don\u0027\u0027t need to know, don\u0027\u0027t want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can\u0027\u0027t even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.  Then they go on the runway and piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they\u0027\u0027re building.CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13 airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don\u0027\u0027t need to know where the airplane is or who it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don\u0027\u0027t fly the airplane itself; you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don\u0027\u0027t go anywhere. But that\u0027\u0027s okay, because when the world is at your fingertips you never need to leave home.","whats better then winning the gold medal at the special olympics\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e Not being retarded","Two little boys go into the grocery store.

This is because most movies in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh\u003cbr /\u003e for the first time in \"Gone With the Wind\". For men, it\u0027\u0027s when Jimmy Cagney shoves grapefruit in May Clark\u0027\u0027s face in \"Public Enemy\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNicknames:\u003cbr /\u003e With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like \"Ultimate Pecs\" and \"Big Turk,\" women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dave, Rob, and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOffspring:\u003cbr /\u003e Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePlants:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePolitics:\u003cbr /\u003e Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such as voting. Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy\u0027\u0027s is growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign for them and cry on election night.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRestrooms:\u003cbr /\u003e Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms associal lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other. Womenwho\u0027\u0027ve never met will leave a restroom giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, \"Hey, Bob, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis difference may be due to the fact that women don\u0027\u0027t have to hold their genitals in the bathroom, which might make one feel self-conscious. Not having this problem, women can chat away quite comfortably while \"powdering their noses\". And yes, they are talking about men in their chats.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnother theory is that when women \"powder their noses\", all they have to do is sit there. What else is there for them to do but talk to other women. Men, however, must be much more attentive to such matters. If a male turns too much to talk to someone, he\u0027\u0027ll be leaking on his shoe. Men must be very serious and patient because heaven only knows if the stream of urine will suddenly change direction. And after all is done, men must try to remove any excess moisture unless he soils his underwear. And unlike women, there is no tissue paper nearby with which to wipe. A man must use his own skills at \"towel snapping\" to do the job. But no man wants to shake it forever because he might look like he\u0027\u0027s playing with himself. The shaking routine also varies culturally as most men inthe U.K. are \u0027\u0027pullers\u0027\u0027 as opposed to \u0027\u0027shakers\u0027\u0027. Of course, no matter how much a man shakes or pulls, chances are still good that he\u0027\u0027ll get that little dribble down the leg, which will expand to the size of Lake Ontario if he is wearing synthetics.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the shaking or pulling comes the tucking-it-all-back-in routine, where the male tries to not leave anything delicate in the path of the approaching zipper. As the men are all leaving the restroom, trying to button up their Levi\u0027\u0027s, they are still trying not to look as if they\u0027\u0027re playing with themselves. For a man, a trip to the bathroom is a very serious matter. You wouldn\u0027\u0027t gossip and chatter at a board meeting would you?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFor the male, there are also the considerations like seeing how far up the trough he can pee, bombing the cigarette butt, peeling off the killer fart that he didn\u0027\u0027t want to loose off at the bar and, his favorite, making that grunt/sigh noise as the first gush lets go, sort of a \"Nnnngwwwwwaaaaa\". Actually, that\u0027\u0027s about the time the first fart goes too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Gere:\u003cbr /\u003e Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMadonna:\u003cbr /\u003e Same as above, but reversed.

Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eShoes:\u003cbr /\u003e When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip on Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes all day.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSocks:\u003cbr /\u003e Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks.

The women usually end up following men.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eTelephone:\u003cbr /\u003e Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eToys:\u003cbr /\u003e Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of men\u0027\u0027s toys: little miniature TV\u0027\u0027s, car phones, complicated juicers and blenders, graphic equalizers, small robots that serve cocktails on command, video games, anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least 6 \"D\" batteries to operate. However, the only toys women still keep around when they grow up still require batteries, only few in number and smaller in size.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUnderwear:\u003cbr /\u003e Colored underwear. Women are allowed, in fact encouraged, to wear colored underwear. There is no reason for a man to ever, ever, wear anything besides solid white.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWeddings:\u003cbr /\u003e When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about \"the ceremony\".

Then she will get on with her life.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eA man has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will call and say, \"I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I\u0027\u0027ll never forgive you, and I hate you, and you\u0027\u0027re a total floozy. But I want you to know that there\u0027\u0027s always a chance for us\". This is known as the \"I Hate You / I Love You\" drunken phone call, that 99% if all men have made at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need; alas, these classes rarely prove effective.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAdmitting Mistakes:\u003cbr /\u003e Women will sometimes admit making a mistake.

The average number of items in the typical woman\u0027\u0027s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.\u003cbr /\u003e Most men take only 2-3 minutes to relieve themselves. Women\u0027\u0027s Restrooms always have long lines.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eCameras:\u003cbr /\u003e Men take photography very seriously. They\u0027\u0027ll shell out $4000 for state of the art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography classes. Women purchase Kodak Instamatics.  Of course, women always end up taking better pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eCats:\u003cbr /\u003e Women love cats.

Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. Men will never stop and ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, \"Looks like I\u0027\u0027ve found a new way to get there.\" and, \"I know I\u0027\u0027m in the general neighborhood.

Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. Men will never stop and ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, \"Looks like I\u0027\u0027ve found a new way to get there.\" and, \"I know I\u0027\u0027m in the general neighborhood.

A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reached the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter that the Clampett\u0027\u0027s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHandwriting:\u003cbr /\u003e To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken- scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their \"i\u0027\u0027s\" with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their \"p\u0027\u0027s\" and \"g\u0027\u0027s\". It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she\u0027\u0027s dumping you, she\u0027\u0027ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHats:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eJewelry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look nice when they wear jewelry.

Any more than that, and he will look like a lounge singer named Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLaundry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul, and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of \"Love, American Style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLeg Warmers:\u003cbr /\u003e Leg warmers are sexy. A woman, even if she\u0027\u0027s walking the dog or doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers. She can wear them any time she wants. A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the \"Gimme the Ball\" number in \"A Chorus Line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLocker Rooms:\u003cbr /\u003e In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don\u0027\u0027t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one thing in the locker room, sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLow Blows:\u003cbr /\u003e Let\u0027\u0027s say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV.

Women\u0027\u0027s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman\u0027\u0027s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMaturity:\u003cbr /\u003e Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMenopause:\u003cbr /\u003e When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree ofthese changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction; he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather drivin gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMirrors:\u003cbr /\u003e Men are vain; they will always check themselves out in a mirror.  Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe Garagiola\u0027\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMoustaches:\u003cbr /\u003e Some men look good with moustaches. Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. There are no women who look good with moustaches.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMovies:\u003cbr /\u003e Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.  This is because most movies in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh\u003cbr /\u003e for the first time in \"Gone With the Wind\". For men, it\u0027\u0027s when Jimmy Cagney shoves grapefruit in May Clark\u0027\u0027s face in \"Public Enemy\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNicknames:\u003cbr /\u003e With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like \"Ultimate Pecs\" and \"Big Turk,\" women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dave, Rob, and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOffspring:\u003cbr /\u003e Ah, children.

Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The right honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:1. You should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up \"aluminium\". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up \"vocabulary\". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as \"like\" and \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up \"interspersed\".2. There is no such thing as \"US English\". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn\u0027\u0027t that hard.4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.5. You should relearn your original national anthem, \"God Save The Queen\", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.6. You should stop playing American \"football\". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American \"football\" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays \"American\" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American \"football\", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys.\"Merde\" is French for \"sh*t\".8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called \"Indecisive Day\".9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It\u0027\u0027s been driving us bonkers.Thank you for your co-operation.","A man came home from work sporting two black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to you?\" asked his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027\u0027ll never understand women,\" he replied. \"I was riding up in an escalator behind this pretty young girl, and I noticed that her skirt was stuck in the crack of her ass.

He was rather large.Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf.  He was so deaf he wrote loud music.  He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was calling him.  I guess he could not hear so good.  Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died from this.Henry Purcell is a well known composer few people have ever heard of.Aaron Copland is one of your most famous contemporary composers.  It is unusual to be contemporary.  Most composers do not live until they are dead.An opera is a song of bigly size.In the last scene of Pagliacci, Canio stabs Nedda who is the one he really loves.  Pretty soon Silvio also gets stabbed, and they all live happily ever after.When a singer sings, he stirs up the air and makes it hit any passing eardrums.  But if he is good, he knows how to keep it from hurting.Music sung by two people at the same time is called a duel.I know what a sextet is but I had rather not say.Caruso was at first an Italian.

The real difference between fat and thin people is that thin people:avoid eating popcorn in the movies because it gets their hands greasy;split a large combination pizza with three friends;think Oreo cookies are for kids;nibble cashews one at a time;think that doughnuts are indigestible;read books they have to hold with both hands;become so absorbed in a weekend project they forget to have lunch;fill the candy dish on their desks with paper clips;counteract the midafternoon slump with a nap instead of a cinnamon Danish;exchange the deep-fryer they received for Christmas for a clock-radio;lose their appetites when they\u0027\u0027re depressed;think chocolate Easter bunnies are for kids;save leftovers that are too skimpy to use for another meal in order to make interesting soups;throw out stale potato chips;will eat only Swiss or Dutch chocolate, which cannot be found except in a special store;think it\u0027\u0027s too much trouble to stop at a special store just to buy chocolate;don\u0027\u0027t celebrate with a hot-fudge sundae every time they lose a pound;warm up after skiing with black coffee instead of hot chocolate and whipped cream;try all the salads at the buffet, leaving room for only one dessert;find iced tea more refreshing than an ice-cream soda;get into such interesting conversations at cocktail parties that they never quite work their way over to the hors-d\u0027\u0027oeuvre table;have no compulsion to keep the candy dish symmetrical by reducing the jelly beans to an equal number of each color;think that topping brownies with ice cream makes too rich a dessert;bring four cookies into the TV room instead of a box;think banana splits are for kids.","Callus Collection \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence Franklin of Peoria, IL, holds the record.

He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye! As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, no one was about. So the man proceeded to get a screwdriver and removed one of the deceased man\u0027\u0027s blue eyes, replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to have the replacement blue eye fitted. A few days later, the man was driving along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads. \u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027Excuse me, sir,\" said the policeman.\"Do you know anything about this at all?\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027No, constable\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027, said the man.\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027Well, we can\u0027\u0027t figure this out.

Finally, the lion had an idea.  \"I know a really exciting game that the humans play called football.  I\u0027\u0027ve seen it on T.V.\"He proceeded to describe it to the rest of the animals and they all got excited about it so they decided to play.  They went out to the field and chose up teams and were ready to begin.The lion\u0027\u0027s team received.  They were able to get two first downs and then had to punt.  The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick.  He caught the ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two rabbits.  He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to daylight, scoring six.Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0.Late in the first half the lion\u0027\u0027s team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked the extra point.  The lion\u0027\u0027s team led at halftime 7 - 6.  In the locker room, the lion gave a peptalk.\"Look you guys.  We can win this game.  We\u0027\u0027ve got the lead and they only have one real threat.  We\u0027\u0027ve got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he\u0027\u0027s a killer. Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino.\"The second half began.  Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino\u0027\u0027s team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino.  Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running.  First, he stomped two gazelles.  He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way.  It looked like he was home free.  Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead.  There were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened.  Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede.\"Did you do this?\" he asked the centipede.\"Yeah, I did.\" the centipede replied.The lion retorted, \"Where were you during the first half?\"\"I was putting on my shoes.\"","Actual bloopers found on church bulletin boards:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eScouts are saving aluminum cans, bottles and other items to be recycled.

Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound. Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one. Moses turned to Jesus and said, \"I hate playing with your Dad.\"","- Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, she couldn\u0027\u0027t fit in a satellite photo.\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, she\u0027\u0027s on both sides of the family.\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, when she fell over, she rocked herself asleep trying to get up again.\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, when she sat on a dollar bill, blood came out of George Washington\u0027\u0027s nose\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, the telephone company gave her two area codes\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, the back of her neck looks like a pack of hotdogs\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, when she goes to the beach, kids shout: \"Free Willy! free Willy!\"\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, she\u0027\u0027s got her own zip code\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, people jog around her for exercise\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, when she plays hopscotch, she goes New York, L.A., Chicago...\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, if she weighed 5 more pounds, she could get group insurance.\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, she jumped in air and got stuck.\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, when she wears Maclom X shirt, helicopters land on her.\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, when she bungee jumps, she brings down the bridge too.\u003cbr /\u003e - Yo Mama\u0027\u0027s so fat, the highway patrol made her wear a \"Caution!

Every time you ask a question, you are told you don\u0027\u0027t need to know, don\u0027\u0027t want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can\u0027\u0027t even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.  Then they go on the runway and piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they\u0027\u0027re building.CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13 airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don\u0027\u0027t need to know where the airplane is or who it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don\u0027\u0027t fly the airplane itself; you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don\u0027\u0027t go anywhere.

Since the media won\u0027\u0027t give it a rest and move on, we recommend playing the following game during any network or local news shows, \"special reports,\" news magazines (i.e.,Dateline, 20/20, etc), talk shows, or any other appropriate TV shows.Guaranteed to make watching this story more entertaining or your money back!Beverages required to play the game: Each player must have a beer handy, a liquor appropriate for pouring shots is also required (tequila or rum is preferred).RULES OF PLAY- If a TV announcer says \"Castro\" everyone in the room must salute with their left hand. The last person to do so must take a shot. If anyone salutes with their right hand accidentally, they also have to take a shot.- If the photo of the SWAT \"gunman\" is shown, everyone must act scared. The last person to do so must take a shot and then go into a closet until he is \"rescued\" by another player.- If the TV announcer says \"fisherman,\" everyone must press their palms together and make a swimming move with their hands. The last person to do so must chug whatever beer remains in their glass.- If a child psychologist is interviewed, everyone must stroke his/her chin and say, \"I see.\" The first person to do so becomes the \"psychologist\" and gets to administer shots to any players he/she deems in need of mood improvement.- During any interview of a Member of Congress, everyone must shout, \"bullshit!\" The last person to do so drinks.- If the TV announcer says \"Miami relatives\" everyone must shout out either \"Lazaro\" or \"Marisleysis\". A count is made of how many players said each name. Everyone who called out the more popular name has to take a drink of beer.- Whenever the station goes \"live to Little Havana\" everyone must stand up and dance. The last person on their feet has to do a shot.- If Marisleysis is shown crying everyone must yell \"knock it off\" and then take a drink of beer.- If Juan Miguel Gonzales is shown carrying his \"other son\" everyone must yell \"wahhhhh\" like a baby for as long as they can on one breath. The last person to stop gets to pick a person to do a shot.- If Elian Gonzales returns to Cuba with his father, everyone shouts \"Thank God.\" The game is then over.","She fell in love...and broke it!!!

He had been hearing quite a bit about \u0027\u0027courting\u0027\u0027 from\u003cbr /\u003e the older boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done.\u003cbr /\u003e One day he took his question to his mother, who became rather\u003cbr /\u003e flustered. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide\u003cbr /\u003e behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her\u003cbr /\u003e boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described\u003cbr /\u003e EVERYTHING to his mother. \"Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked\u003cbr /\u003e for a while, then he started kissing and hugging herI figured\u003cbr /\u003e \u0027\u0027Sis must be getting sickbecause her face started looking funny.\u003cbr /\u003e He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her\u003cbr /\u003e blouse to feel her heart, just \u0026gt; the way the doctor would.\u003cbr /\u003e Except he\u0027\u0027s not as smart as the docotr because he seemed to have\u003cbr /\u003e trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too,\u003cbr /\u003e because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all\u003cbr /\u003e out of breath. His other hand must have been cold because he put\u003cbr /\u003e it under her skirt. About this time \u0027\u0027Sis got worse and began to\u003cbr /\u003e moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of\u003cbr /\u003e the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a\u003cbr /\u003e fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. Finally, I\u003cbr /\u003e found out what was making them so sick -- a big eel had gotten\u003cbr /\u003e inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and\u003cbr /\u003e stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway he grabbed it\u003cbr /\u003e in one hand to keep it from getting away. When Sis saw it, she\u003cbr /\u003e got really scared -- her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open,\u003cbr /\u003e and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said\u003cbr /\u003e it was the biggest one she\u0027\u0027s ever seen; I should tell her about\u003cbr /\u003e the ones down at the lake by our house! Anyway, Sis got brave\u003cbr /\u003e and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a\u003cbr /\u003e sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he\u003cbr /\u003e took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel\u0027\u0027s\u003cbr /\u003e head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her\u003cbr /\u003e legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by\u003cbr /\u003e lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis\u003cbr /\u003e started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset\u003cbr /\u003e the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it\u003cbr /\u003e between them. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed\u003cbr /\u003e the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of\u003cbr /\u003e its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a\u003cbr /\u003e little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting\u003cbr /\u003e anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the\u003cbr /\u003e eel wasn\u0027\u0027t dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight\u003cbr /\u003e again.

I made it through all the interviews with flying colours, and the only thing left was the drug test.  I was confident in passing, but there was one slight problem: I have *very* shy kidneys.  I\u0027\u0027ve had to sneak out of the doctor\u0027\u0027s office on more than one occasion, because I can\u0027\u0027t \"go\" and fill up a cup on command.  Usually, this is a good thing, as I can go to a concert or football game, drink beer all day, and be fine until I get home, while my friends are standing in line in the bathrooms several times during the same time period.So, to prepare, on the morning I had to take the test, I drank my usual 10-cup pot of coffee, and several large glasses of water, and for the 20-minute trip to Kodak, I filled a plastic gallon jug with water, and finished it off on the way.   Now, Kodak has huge parking lots, each containg hundreds and hundreds of cars, and by the time I got there, the visitor\u0027\u0027s lots were pretty full, and I had to park way in the back.As soon as I got out of my car, I\u0027\u0027m thinking, \"Good, it worked, I think I can go!\"  By the time I\u0027\u0027d finished the 10-minute walk to the entrance, I was thinking, \"Boy, no problems now, I can *definitely* go!\"To get in, I had to go past a security hut.  I told them why I was there, and they told me where to report, about another 10-minute walk, a little ways into the plant.  I had to pass building after building before I got to the right one, every step of the way, becoming actually painful, and before I was there, I was looking at bushes and doorways and the like, thinking, \"Well, if it gets too bad, I could go there, or maybe there, or...\"By the time I got to the right building, I was just about in agony. I found the right area, and the receptionist told me to take a seat with about 8 other people.  I sat down, thinking that would help, but 10 seconds later I was up, walking around, trying to read stuff on the wall, anything to keep my mind occuppied, but managing to read 5 or 10 words, and then having to pace again.Finally, I couldn\u0027\u0027t take it anymore, and after having asked the girl a couple of times how long, I told her, \"look, either you get me in *now*, or I use the bathroom over there, and we reschedule!!\" She said she\u0027\u0027d see what she could do, and left.  I went back to sit down, and it took all of 5 seconds before I was up pacing again. She came back a few minutes later, and told me to go on in.When I got to the actual room, there were 4 people standing in line.  I hopped up and down a couple of times, before I passed the others, went to the nurses, and told them I have to go **NOW**!!! They asked the others in line if anyone objected, and they said no, so they said as soon as one of the 2 bathrooms come free, I could go.  I snatched the cup out of his hand, and practically raced down the aisle to the bathrooms and just stood waiting.  It couldn\u0027\u0027t have been more than 20 seconds or so, but they were some of the most agonizing seconds of my life!!Finally, one of the doors opened, and I nearly flattened some poor girl coming out in my rush to get in.  I closed the door, grabbed my pants, breathed in, and dropped them and then my underwear, and then the world caved in...  I started going.  And going.  And going. I could have knocked down the Berlin wall with the force!   But the problem was, that I couldn\u0027\u0027t \"grab\" it!!  It was whipping around like one of those Water Wiggle things.  I\u0027\u0027m trying like heck to reign it it in, but just couldn\u0027\u0027t.  I\u0027\u0027m dancing around in a circle, with my pants around my ankles, trying to grab it, and it was just about impossible for probably a good 15 seconds.  Finally, I did, and was able to aim in the toilet, just remembering at the end to put a shot or two in the cup to put on the little shelf.   By the time I\u0027\u0027d stopped, I was physically spent, and just leaned up against the wall, feeling like I\u0027\u0027d just run a marathon...It was then that was able to survey the bathroom.  It was a room, about 7x7, but my god...  I had finished the most intense pee of my life in the john, but before I\u0027\u0027d gained control, I\u0027\u0027d soaked the entire toilet, the sink, the floor, the walls.  You name it, it was drenched -- including my pants and underwear.  I tried soaking it up with toilet paper (using the whole roll as a sponge), but that was drenched and didn\u0027\u0027t work that well.  I\u0027\u0027d also soaked the extra rolls on the back of the toilet, the paper towel holder, and the extra roll of paper towels.  I went through the garbage, pulling out half-soaked old towels, just trying to make the place semi-presentable, as in the sink and the mirror, but it didn\u0027\u0027t do much good.  I was just ending up pushing the wet around, so I finally gave up.Steeling myself, I pulled up my wet underwear, then my wet pants, and pulled down my semi-wet shirt as much as possible, and went out. I whipped back up the aisle, thanking the nurse, without slowing down, and out the door as fast as my legs would carry me, imagining what the next person to use that bathroom would encounter. The silver lining:  I got the job!!","A married man and his secretary were having a torrid affair. One afternoon they couldn\u0027\u0027t contain their passion, so they rushed over to her place where they spent the afternoon making passionate love.

However,\u003cbr /\u003e the rafts start to sink, and half of their camera equipment is\u003cbr /\u003e lost. They come to the group of aborigines who will guide them\u003cbr /\u003e to the next group, and offer them money. They refuse, and the\u003cbr /\u003e explorers offer them some of their cameras. The aborigines\u003cbr /\u003e refuse that, as well. So, the famous explorer makes his\u003cbr /\u003e sacrifice, and offers the only female member of his crew, which\u003cbr /\u003e they accept. They are given a guide who leads them to the cliff.\u003cbr /\u003e One of the crewmen gets vertigo, and accidentally falls off the\u003cbr /\u003e cliff tom his death. The explorer and his one remaining crewman\u003cbr /\u003e set off across the desert, and his crewman drops because of heat\u003cbr /\u003e stroke.

Midway through the desert, however, one car hits a\u003cbr /\u003e rock and tips, and the other car couldn\u0027\u0027t turn in time, and\u003cbr /\u003e there\u0027\u0027s a horrible accident.

I was born in a log cabin\u003cbr /\u003e that I built with my own hands. I taught myself to read by candlelight and\u003cbr /\u003e helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a\u003cbr /\u003e Mississippi River steamboat.\u003cbr /\u003e My mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles\u003cbr /\u003e to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought I\u003cbr /\u003e never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration\u003cbr /\u003e for \"Huckleberry Finn.\"\u003cbr /\u003e Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens. One day, a\u003cbr /\u003e traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going\u003cbr /\u003e to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I\u003cbr /\u003e made an impression. You see, the minister\u0027\u0027s name was Martin Luther King, Jr.\u003cbr /\u003e My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and\u003cbr /\u003e said, \"Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a\u003cbr /\u003e hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school.\"\u003cbr /\u003e But life of privilege was not for me. After getting my high school diploma, I\u003cbr /\u003e took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the treatment of\u003cbr /\u003e the workers there that I organized a union. Later, that experience inspired a\u003cbr /\u003e movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me\u003cbr /\u003e \"Norma Rae.\"\u003cbr /\u003e When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called\u003cbr /\u003e and offered me a scholarship. I captained the hockey team to four consecutive\u003cbr /\u003e national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win\u003cbr /\u003e the Heisman Trophy.\u003cbr /\u003e During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing\u003cbr /\u003e lead guitar for a little rock band.

I\u0027\u0027m Al Gore, and I\u0027\u0027d like to tell you about myself.\u003cbr /\u003e I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black\u003cbr /\u003e child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I was born in a log cabin\u003cbr /\u003e that I built with my own hands. I taught myself to read by candlelight and\u003cbr /\u003e helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a\u003cbr /\u003e Mississippi River steamboat.\u003cbr /\u003e My mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles\u003cbr /\u003e to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought I\u003cbr /\u003e never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration\u003cbr /\u003e for \"Huckleberry Finn.\"\u003cbr /\u003e Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens. One day, a\u003cbr /\u003e traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going\u003cbr /\u003e to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I\u003cbr /\u003e made an impression. You see, the minister\u0027\u0027s name was Martin Luther King, Jr.\u003cbr /\u003e My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and\u003cbr /\u003e said, \"Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a\u003cbr /\u003e hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school.\"\u003cbr /\u003e But life of privilege was not for me. After getting my high school diploma, I\u003cbr /\u003e took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the treatment of\u003cbr /\u003e the workers there that I organized a union. Later, that experience inspired a\u003cbr /\u003e movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me\u003cbr /\u003e \"Norma Rae.\"\u003cbr /\u003e When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called\u003cbr /\u003e and offered me a scholarship. I captained the hockey team to four consecutive\u003cbr /\u003e national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win\u003cbr /\u003e the Heisman Trophy.\u003cbr /\u003e During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing\u003cbr /\u003e lead guitar for a little rock band.

Assume that I will come home with the wrong thing.3) When watching TV hugging is always fine because I can still see the screen. Kissing should only be done during timeouts and commercials. Questions should also be limited to this period as you stand a much better chance of getting an immediate response.4) When we are watching your show and I change the channels during a commercial do not hassle me that they are over to change the channel back. I always know when the timing is right. Also, when we are channel surfing do not ask me to go back, there was a good reason why I skipped it.5) If you need help with the laundry, I am more than willing to carry it from the bedroom to the washer. In my mind this is half the chore and I am now free to return to the couch.6) If I mention that a male friend of mine is allowed to do something it is not necessary for you to call his wife/girlfriend to discuss it.5) If you don\u0027\u0027t like the way I am driving close your eyes. And I would appreciate it if you would refrain from making that reverse inhaling alarmed noise. I haven\u0027\u0027t hit anything yet and if I do it will be your fault.6) I go clothes shopping to buy, never to look.7) Just tell me what you want me to wear before I get dressed. And remember that this takes me less than ten minutes no matter what the occasion is. After all I am getting dressed, not getting ready.8) Don\u0027\u0027t ask me if I prefer one outfit over another or if a certain accessory should be worn or not. I consider this a no win situation and would rather just wait for you to get dressed while watching TV.9) If you want me to put the seat down when I am finished then you should leave the seat up when you are finished.It\u0027\u0027s only fair. And stop giving me a hard time about missing the bowl. What do you expect from an organ that has a brain of its own.10) I will cook anything as long as it is on the BBQ.11) Yelling to me across the house sounds exactly like stadium crowd background noise to me. I am not ignoring you.","For years and years they told me, \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBe careful of your breasts. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027\u0027t ever squeeze or bruise them. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd give them monthly tests.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSo I heeded all their warnings, \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd protected them by law. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGuarded them very carefully, \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I always wore my bra.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter 30 years of astute care, \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy gyno, Dr. Pruitt, \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSaid I should get a Mammogram. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"O.K,\" I said, \"let\u0027\u0027s do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand up here real close\" she said, \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e(She got my boob in line) \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"And tell me when it hurts,\" she said, \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah yes!

In the unlikely event of my not having an orgasm after you\u0027\u0027ve drunkenly rolled on top of me and pumped away for five minutes, wheezing like an old man with emphysema, I shall politely fake one. And it\u0027\u0027ll be a really good act too, with me saying stuff like \"So THIS is screwing!\" and howling like a cat that\u0027\u0027s being repeatedly jabbed with a needle. 2. I fully understand that a woman\u0027\u0027s main role in any relationship is to take the blame. So when you stub your toe in the bathroom or your football teams lose, I agree that - by some complex scientific equation incomprehensible to woman - it will be my fault. Even if I wasn\u0027\u0027t there. 3. Whenever my friends and I get together for a girlie chat, I will tell them that you are better hung than a large-balled Himalayan yak. 4. And I will also mention this to YOUR friends. A lot. 5. After sex (which I will NEVER refer to as \"making love\"), I will not expect you to cuddle me for hours till your arm goes dead. Nor will I let my hair annoyingly get in your face. 6. I will never, ever give your penis a \"cute\" nickname. 7. In bed, I will be happy as can be to try any novel sexual position you fancy. Especially ones where I do all the work and you just lie there, grinning. 8. I will ruthlessly interrogate my attractive female friends and inform you if any of them have the slightest bisexual tendencies. Then I\u0027\u0027ll invite them around for dinner. And hide their car keys so they have to stay. 9. After we split up, I will never sleep with any of your friends or colleagues. Or anyone else you have ever met. Or may one day meet. And if men attempt to chat me up, I will solemnly inform them that you have \"ruined me for other men.\" 10. I understand that mechanical objects like cars, computers, and remote control devices are beyond the comprehension of women. I will only make a fool of myself if I attempt to operate them, so you\u0027\u0027re in charge of the lot. Except for the oven, iron and the washing machine, of course.

He decided to make big bucks out of the elephant. He trained the elephant not to jump no matter what then he set up a challenge to make the elephant jump. The prize money was 10 grand. To play this game, the challenger must pay 1 grand to the guy before playing. Lots of people came and tried all sorts of tricks to make the elephant jump but without success. Until the a guy show up and decided to take up this challenge. He paid the elephant owner 1 grand and went to his car and took out a golf club. He held the club behind him and walked around the elephant. After walking around the elephant a few times, he stopped right behind the elephant. He raised his club and swung as hard as he could right smack between the elephant\u0027\u0027s hind legs. Being a bull elephant, it leaped twenty feet into the air and landed with a crash. The elephant owner, disgusted with the elephant\u0027\u0027s performance, paid the guy with the golf club his 10 k. After that, the elephant owner decided to create another challenge. The prize money was now double but so was fee required to pay. This time, the challenge was to make the elephant shake it\u0027\u0027s head. Again, lots of people came to make the elephant shake it\u0027\u0027s head and they all failed until the same guy with the golf club came again. He paid the elephant owner 2 grand and once again took out his golf club. Once again, the guy with the golf club walked aroung the elephant. This time, he stopped in front of the elephant. \"Hello.\" The guy said. \"Remember me?\" The elephant nodded. \"Remember this golf club?\" The guy asked, showing the elephant his glof club. The elephant nodded. \"Remember what I did to you the last time?\" The elephant nodded nervously. Then the guy said \"DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT AGAIN?!\"","A man and wife were playing in their golf club\u0027\u0027s annual \"Guys and Dolls\" tournament. The man was not happy about having to play, but his wife had insisted. On the 12th tee, his patience had reached its limit. While his wife wasted time on the ladies tee, he decided to go ahead and hit his drive from the men\u0027\u0027s. Unfortunately, he misjudged his shot and his ball hit his wife in the back of the head, killing her instantly. At the hospital the doctor came to talk to the husband.\"Mr. Davies, we found a golf ball lodged 3 inches into your wife\u0027\u0027s brain, which was the cause of death. But, we have found something else that really puzzles us.\" \"What is it?\" asked Mr. Davies. \"Well,\" said the doctor, \"We also found a golf ball lodged 6 inches into her anal cavity.\" The husband dismissed the doctor with a wave of his hand \"Oh, that was just my Mulligan!\"","An old man of 87 went to the hospital to get a radical new surgical procedure done where they stretch the skin and pull all the wrinkles up onto the top of the scalp making you appear years younger.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOn his way out of the hospital, he met an old friend who didn\u0027\u0027t recognize him at first. \"Rob, is that really you?\" said the friend. \"You look years younger.

It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler\u0027\u0027s trainer came to him and said, \u0027\u0027Now don\u0027\u0027t forget all the research we\u0027\u0027ve done on this Russian. He\u0027\u0027s never  lost a match because of this pretzel hold he has. Whatever  you do, don\u0027\u0027t let him get you in this hold! If he does, you\u0027\u0027re finished!\u0027\u0027 The wrestler nodded in agreement. The American and the Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn\u0027\u0027t watch the ending. Suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian\u0027\u0027s back hit the mat with a  thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him,  getting the pin and winning the match. The trainer was  astounded! When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asks, \u0027\u0027How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!\u0027\u0027 The wrestler answered, \u0027\u0027Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. \u0027\u0027I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could; and you would be amazed how strong  you get when you bite your own balls!\u0027\u0027","chocolate oven and kettel\u003cbr /\u003e central heated fridge\u003cbr /\u003e dry water\u003cbr /\u003e central heated igloos\u003cbr /\u003e cordless bunjee rope\u003cbr /\u003e The water-proof towel\u003cbr /\u003e Glow in the dark sunglasses\u003cbr /\u003e Solar powered flashlights\u003cbr /\u003e Submarine screen doors\u003cbr /\u003e A book on how to read\u003cbr /\u003e Inflatable dart boards\u003cbr /\u003e A dictionary index\u003cbr /\u003e Powdered water\u003cbr /\u003e Pedal powered wheel chairs\u003cbr /\u003e Water proof tea bags\u003cbr /\u003e Watermelon seed sorter\u003cbr /\u003e Zero proof alchohol\u003cbr /\u003e Reusable ice cubes\u003cbr /\u003e See through tiolet tissue\u003cbr /\u003e Skinless bananas\u003cbr /\u003e Do it yourself roadmap\u003cbr /\u003e Helicopter ejector seat"]}
