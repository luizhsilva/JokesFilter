I have always believed him. I believed him when he said he had never been drafted in the Vietnam War and I believed him when he said he had forgotten to mention that he had been drafted in the Vietnam War. I believed him when he said he hadn\u0027\u0027t had sex with Gennifer Flowers and I believe him now, when he reportedly says he did.I believe the president did not rent out the Lincoln Bedroom, did not sell access to himself and the vice president to hundreds of well-heeled special pleaders and did not supervise the largest, most systematic money-laundering operation in campaign finance history, collecting more than $ 3 million in illegal and improper donations. I believe that Charlie Trie and James Riady were motivated by nothing but patriotism for their adopted country.I believed Vice President Gore when he said that he had made dunning calls to political contributors \u0027\u0027on a few occasions\u0027\u0027 from his White House office, and I believed when he said that, actually, \u0027\u0027a few\u0027\u0027 meant 46. I believe in no controlling legal authority.I believe Bruce Babbitt when he says that the $ 286,000 contributed the DNC by Indian tribes opposed to granting a casino license to rival tribes had nothing to do with his denial of the license. I believed the secretary when he said that he had not been instructed this matter by then-White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. I believed him when he said that he had told lobbyist and friend Paul Eckstein that Ickes had told him to move on the casino decision, but that he had been lying to Eckstein. I agree with the secretary that it is an outrage that anyone would question his integrity. I believe in the Clinton Standard of adherence to the campaign finance and bribery laws, enunciated by the president on March 7, 1997: \u0027\u0027I don\u0027\u0027t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.\u0027\u0027 I note with approval the use of the word \u0027\u0027evidence\u0027\u0027 and also the use of the word \u0027\u0027solely.\u0027\u0027 I believe that it is proper to change government policy to address the concerns of people who have given the president money, as long as nobody can find evidence of this being the sole reason. I believe the president has lived up to his promise to preside over the most ethical administration in American history. I believe that indicted former agriculture secretary Mike Espy did not accept $35,000 in illegal favors from Tyson Foods and other regulated businesses. I believe that indicted former housing secretary Henry Cisneros did not lie to the FBI and tell others to lie to cover up $ 250,000 in blackmail payments to his former mistress.  I believe that convicted former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell was not involved in the obstruction of justice when the president\u0027\u0027s minions arranged for Hubbell to receive $ 400,000 in sweetheart consulting deals at a time when he was reneging on his promise to cooperate with Kenneth Starr\u0027\u0027s Whitewater investigation. I believe Paula Jones is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Kathleen Willey is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Monica Lewinsky is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Lewinsky was fantasizing in her 20 hours of conversation in which she reportedly detailed her sexual relationship with the president and begged Linda Tripp to join her in lying about the relationship. I believe that any gifts, correspondence, telephone calls and the 37 post-employment White House visits that may have passed between Lewinsky and the president are evidence only of a platonic relationship; such innocent intimate friendships are quite common between middle-aged married men and young single women, and also between presidents of the United States and White House interns. I see nothing suspicious in the report that the president\u0027\u0027s intimate, Vernon Jordan, arranged a $ 40,000-per-year job for Lewinsky shortly after she signed but before she filed an affidavit saying she had not had sex with the president. Nor do I read anything into the fact that the ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, visited Lewinsky at the Watergate to offer her a job. I believe the instructions Lewinsky gave Tripp informing her on how to properly perjure herself in the Willey matter simply wrote themselves.I believe that The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News \u0026amp; World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR are all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy.

I\u0027\u0027m Al Gore, and I\u0027\u0027d like to tell you a\u003cbr /\u003e little about myself. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a\u003cbr /\u003e poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I\u003cbr /\u003e was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands. I taught\u003cbr /\u003e myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers\u003cbr /\u003e and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi\u003cbr /\u003e River steamboat. Frequently we would stop the ship and I would\u003cbr /\u003e cut and split five cords of wood for fuel overnight for the\u003cbr /\u003e steam engines. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother taught me the value of education, so every day, I\u003cbr /\u003e would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a\u003cbr /\u003e mischievous, fun loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one\u003cbr /\u003e day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for\u003cbr /\u003e \"Huckleberry Finn.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, we Jewish black folks in the south were second-class\u003cbr /\u003e citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I\u003cbr /\u003e asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee\u003cbr /\u003e civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an\u003cbr /\u003e impression. You see, the minister\u0027\u0027s name was Martin Luther King,\u003cbr /\u003e Jr. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his\u003cbr /\u003e knee and said, \"Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama,\u003cbr /\u003e someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to\u003cbr /\u003e an exclusive prep school.\" As a young Hindu boy, these were very\u003cbr /\u003e valuable lessons. But life of privilege was not for me. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBeing Chinese, after getting my high school diploma, I took a\u003cbr /\u003e job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the\u003cbr /\u003e treatment of the workers there that I organized a union. Later,\u003cbr /\u003e that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my\u003cbr /\u003e close friends at the AFL-CIO call me \"Norma Rae.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWhen word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done,\u003cbr /\u003e Harvard University called and offered me a scholarship. I\u003cbr /\u003e captained the hockey team to four consecutive national\u003cbr /\u003e championships, but I also played football and was good enough to\u003cbr /\u003e win the Heisman Trophy. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDuring my college years, I lived in a housing project and\u003cbr /\u003e moonlighted writing songs and playing lead guitar for a little\u003cbr /\u003e rock band. You may have heard of us - The Rolling Stones. I\u0027\u0027m\u003cbr /\u003e the one with the lips. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my\u003cbr /\u003e country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I\u003cbr /\u003e was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier\u003cbr /\u003e and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de\u003cbr /\u003e Guerre. My battlefield expertise is current requisite reading\u003cbr /\u003e material for Officers Candidates to this very day. My being a\u003cbr /\u003e wounded female officer serving in disguise as a journalist was a\u003cbr /\u003e full time project, but my military knowledge helped save tens of\u003cbr /\u003e thousands of lives. Many cities in Southeast Asia are named\u003cbr /\u003e after me to this very day. Statues of me are still commonplace\u003cbr /\u003e in many official Government buildings in Viet Nam. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of\u003cbr /\u003e ours.

I was, in fact, the third (still silent)\u003cbr /\u003e partner of Ben \u0026amp; Jerry with over half of the flavors personally\u003cbr /\u003e developed by Tipper and me in our own kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy extensive knowledge of Arctic Sea life keeps me busy in the\u003cbr /\u003e research laboratory, but those endangered species need love too!\u003cbr /\u003e Translating the dead sea scrolls is one of my favorite hobbies,\u003cbr /\u003e and my current volume is in print in over 73 languages and is\u003cbr /\u003e being studied in Seminaries worldwide. Being Indian, both Native\u003cbr /\u003e American and the Mid East kind, this is valuable experience for\u003cbr /\u003e me. Have towel and Tee Pee, will travel.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee\u003cbr /\u003e and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and\u003cbr /\u003e the Senate.

Then you must come to the same conclusion that every \u0027\u0027empty roll crapper\u0027\u0027 must face... pull up your daks, tighten your arse and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eA mate about to run the London Marathon lined up outside the dozens of portaloos on Blackheath to unload a nervous one and discovered when the business was done and he was ready to run a world record race, there was no paper.

Relatives, friends or workmates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects:\u003cbr /\u003e 1. Flush the toilet.\u003cbr /\u003e 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem.\u003cbr /\u003e 3.

You\u0027\u0027re getting impatient. Someone else wants to use the toilet. So you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water.

You run out of gas. That\u0027\u0027s right, you run out of propulsion. The crap is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You\u0027\u0027ve only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you\u0027\u0027re a proctologist and go after it yourself.

The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care, In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair.  The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds, While visions of perjury danced in their heads.  And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap, Had just settled in for a long evening\u0027\u0027s nap.When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter.  When what to their wondering eyes should appear But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer.  With a Presidential address, so lively and quick, They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick!More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came, And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:\u0027\u0027Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let\u0027\u0027s forget The Vixen!On Barney! On Maxine! I\u0027\u0027m no Richard Nixon!!!\u0027\u0027 \u0027\u0027From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall, Now dash away, dash away, dash away all !!!\u0027\u0027And then the Republicans heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  They scratched their heads and were turning around When resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound.  No longer would he eat from his humble pie, While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky.  A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq, It looked once again like Slick Willie was back.His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, His nose like a cherry.  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the hair on his head was as white as the snow.  The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.

In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had \"willingly and enthusiastically\" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting directly to Bill Gates.

He went on to say that Gates has a \"proven track record\", and that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their \"full support and confidence\". Clinton will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he has earned as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft. Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as \"silly\", though did say that he would make executive decisions for the U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters.

I made it through all the interviews with flying colours, and the only thing left was the drug test.  I was confident in passing, but there was one slight problem: I have *very* shy kidneys.  I\u0027\u0027ve had to sneak out of the doctor\u0027\u0027s office on more than one occasion, because I can\u0027\u0027t \"go\" and fill up a cup on command.  Usually, this is a good thing, as I can go to a concert or football game, drink beer all day, and be fine until I get home, while my friends are standing in line in the bathrooms several times during the same time period.So, to prepare, on the morning I had to take the test, I drank my usual 10-cup pot of coffee, and several large glasses of water, and for the 20-minute trip to Kodak, I filled a plastic gallon jug with water, and finished it off on the way.   Now, Kodak has huge parking lots, each containg hundreds and hundreds of cars, and by the time I got there, the visitor\u0027\u0027s lots were pretty full, and I had to park way in the back.As soon as I got out of my car, I\u0027\u0027m thinking, \"Good, it worked, I think I can go!\"  By the time I\u0027\u0027d finished the 10-minute walk to the entrance, I was thinking, \"Boy, no problems now, I can *definitely* go!\"To get in, I had to go past a security hut.  I told them why I was there, and they told me where to report, about another 10-minute walk, a little ways into the plant.  I had to pass building after building before I got to the right one, every step of the way, becoming actually painful, and before I was there, I was looking at bushes and doorways and the like, thinking, \"Well, if it gets too bad, I could go there, or maybe there, or...\"By the time I got to the right building, I was just about in agony. I found the right area, and the receptionist told me to take a seat with about 8 other people.  I sat down, thinking that would help, but 10 seconds later I was up, walking around, trying to read stuff on the wall, anything to keep my mind occuppied, but managing to read 5 or 10 words, and then having to pace again.Finally, I couldn\u0027\u0027t take it anymore, and after having asked the girl a couple of times how long, I told her, \"look, either you get me in *now*, or I use the bathroom over there, and we reschedule!!\" She said she\u0027\u0027d see what she could do, and left.  I went back to sit down, and it took all of 5 seconds before I was up pacing again. She came back a few minutes later, and told me to go on in.When I got to the actual room, there were 4 people standing in line.  I hopped up and down a couple of times, before I passed the others, went to the nurses, and told them I have to go **NOW**!!! They asked the others in line if anyone objected, and they said no, so they said as soon as one of the 2 bathrooms come free, I could go.  I snatched the cup out of his hand, and practically raced down the aisle to the bathrooms and just stood waiting.  It couldn\u0027\u0027t have been more than 20 seconds or so, but they were some of the most agonizing seconds of my life!!Finally, one of the doors opened, and I nearly flattened some poor girl coming out in my rush to get in.  I closed the door, grabbed my pants, breathed in, and dropped them and then my underwear, and then the world caved in...  I started going.  And going.  And going. I could have knocked down the Berlin wall with the force!   But the problem was, that I couldn\u0027\u0027t \"grab\" it!!  It was whipping around like one of those Water Wiggle things.  I\u0027\u0027m trying like heck to reign it it in, but just couldn\u0027\u0027t.  I\u0027\u0027m dancing around in a circle, with my pants around my ankles, trying to grab it, and it was just about impossible for probably a good 15 seconds.  Finally, I did, and was able to aim in the toilet, just remembering at the end to put a shot or two in the cup to put on the little shelf.   By the time I\u0027\u0027d stopped, I was physically spent, and just leaned up against the wall, feeling like I\u0027\u0027d just run a marathon...It was then that was able to survey the bathroom.  It was a room, about 7x7, but my god...  I had finished the most intense pee of my life in the john, but before I\u0027\u0027d gained control, I\u0027\u0027d soaked the entire toilet, the sink, the floor, the walls.  You name it, it was drenched -- including my pants and underwear.  I tried soaking it up with toilet paper (using the whole roll as a sponge), but that was drenched and didn\u0027\u0027t work that well.  I\u0027\u0027d also soaked the extra rolls on the back of the toilet, the paper towel holder, and the extra roll of paper towels.  I went through the garbage, pulling out half-soaked old towels, just trying to make the place semi-presentable, as in the sink and the mirror, but it didn\u0027\u0027t do much good.  I was just ending up pushing the wet around, so I finally gave up.Steeling myself, I pulled up my wet underwear, then my wet pants, and pulled down my semi-wet shirt as much as possible, and went out. I whipped back up the aisle, thanking the nurse, without slowing down, and out the door as fast as my legs would carry me, imagining what the next person to use that bathroom would encounter.

Young (27) at the Metallica concert last Friday. Uhlenake and Young were found dead at the Gorge Amphitheater after the show. Uhlenake was in pickup that was on top of Young at the bottom of a 20 ft drop. Young was found with severe lacerations, numerous fractures, contusions, and a branch in his anal cavity. He also had been stabbed and his pants were in a tree above him, some 15 ft off the ground; adding to the mystery of the heretofore unexplained scene. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Commissioner-In-Charge Inoye Appleton, Uhlenake and Young had tried to get tickets for the sold-out concert. When they were unable to get any tickets, the two decided to stay in the lot and drink. Once the show began, and after the two had consumed 18 beers between the two of them, they hit upon the idea of scaling the 7 foot wooden security fence around the perimeter of the site and sneak in. They apparently moved the truck up to the edge of the fence and decided that Young would go over first and assist Uhlenake later. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThey had not counted on the fact that while it was a 7 foot fence on the parking lot side, there was a 23 foot drop on the other side. Young, who weighed 255 lbs and was quite inebriated, had jumped up and over the fence and promptly fell about half the 23 foot distance before a large tree branch broke his fall AND his left forearm; unfortunately, he also managed to get his shorts caught on the branch. Since he was now in a lot of pain and with no way to extricate himself and his shorts from the tree, he decided, seeing bushes down below, to cut his shorts off and fall to the ground. Upon cutting the last bit of fabric from himself, he suddenly plummeted to earth, losing grip of the knife. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"soft\" bushes were actually holly bushes and landing in them caused a massive number of cuts. He also had the misfortune of landing squarely on a holly bush branch; effectively impaling himself. The knife, which he had accidentally released 15 ft up, now landed and stabbed him in his left thigh. Apparently, he was in a lot of pain. Enter his friend Robert. Uhlenake had apparently observed the last bit of this and, despite his inebriated state, realized that Young was in trouble. He hit upon the idea of lowering a rope to his friend and pull him up and over the fence. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis was complicated by the fact that Uhlenake was outweighed by his friend `y a good 100 lbs. Again, despite his state he realized he could use their truck to pull Young out. Unfortunately, because of his state, Uhlenake put the truck in reverse, rather than drive, broke through the fence, landed on Young (killing him), was thrown out of the truck and subsequently died of internal injuries. \"So that\u0027\u0027s how a dead 255 lb man with no pants on, with a truck on top of him and a stick up his ass came to be\" said Commissioner Appleton.","Good afternoon.

Grandpa:    In my day, we didn\u0027\u0027t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone    told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough  for  us. Aristotle:    It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. Karl Marx:     It was an historical inevitability. Saddam Hussein    This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified    in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.                       Ronald Reagan:    What chicken? Captain James T. Kirk:    To boldly go where no chicken has gone before. Fox Mulder:    You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more    chickens have to cross before you believe it? Machiavelli:    The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The    end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was. Freud:    The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the    road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. Bill Gates:    I have just released Chicken Coop 98, which will not only cross    roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance  your cheque book, and Explorer is an inextricable part of the operating  system. Einstein:    Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath    the chicken? Bill Clinton:    I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. However, I did ask    Vernon Jordan to find the chicken a job in New York.","15. Putting the HIP back in Hypocrisy \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e14.

You find this out by taking one for a walk. To take a\u003cbr /\u003e tiger for a walk, you first need a tiger. Tigers fresh from the bush are not\u003cbr /\u003e recommended for the inexperienced. What you need is one who\u0027\u0027s used to the\u003cbr /\u003e procedure. He or she is thus liable to be merely playful, rather than actively\u003cbr /\u003e irritated. You also need a friend, whom you really, really trust. The friend\u003cbr /\u003e carries an apple wood cane; apple, or some other wood, which will bend under\u003cbr /\u003e stress rather than shattering. This, friend, is your backup, and the cane is his\u003cbr /\u003e or her only tool for everything, from knocking stuff out of the way that the\u003cbr /\u003e tiger is liable to eat, to crowd control, to hooking on and madly hanging on if\u003cbr /\u003e things go wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWhat YOU carry is a ten-foot length of pass-link chain. This is your leash.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePass-link chain is the stuff where the links will fit through each other. This\u003cbr /\u003e is important. You need this so you can hook on a safety clip. The chain is\u003cbr /\u003e looped about the tiger\u0027\u0027s neck and acks as a giant choke chain, but the clip is\u003cbr /\u003e there to keep a loop of some sort in case things go badly wrong. You carry the\u003cbr /\u003e chain looped in one hand in a peculiar fashion, which permits the whole length\u003cbr /\u003e of chain to be dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with\u003cbr /\u003e it.

You gauge the\u003cbr /\u003e tiger\u0027\u0027s mood and put the leash on the tiger. There isn\u0027\u0027t a whole lot more to say\u003cbr /\u003e about this step except to say that that is why your friend is there, outside the\u003cbr /\u003e cage. On your side is the fact that the tiger knows what the leash is for by\u003cbr /\u003e this time and presumably is largely in favor of the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy.

Your friend walks in front with the cane\u003cbr /\u003e to clear the way. You walk with the tiger at your side, keeping pretty good\u003cbr /\u003e control and letting the tiger know that you are Paying Attention, because if the\u003cbr /\u003e tiger thinks you are not Paying Attention, it will do what housecats do, let you\u003cbr /\u003e know that you should be Paying Attention. Unlike housecats, the tiger is big\u003cbr /\u003e enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the situation.\u003cbr /\u003e Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your legs out from under you\u003cbr /\u003e is generally considered good enough by most tigers. They think this is\u003cbr /\u003e hilarious. To this extent, tigers differ from housecats in that they seem to\u003cbr /\u003e have a sense of humor.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants. In this case,\u003cbr /\u003e the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to stop it. Wrapping the\u003cbr /\u003e chain around something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away, generally\u003cbr /\u003e does this. This will slow it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you\u003cbr /\u003e and grab the chain as you go bulleting across the countryside.

Look bored and incredulous that anybody could be\u003cbr /\u003e so incompetent as the clerk tries unsuccessfully to scan the item. Turn to the\u003cbr /\u003e people in line behind you and say, \"Can you believe this is taking so long?\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, the clerk will attempt to enter the bar code information by\u003cbr /\u003e hand. Insist loudly that the item is yours and that since it didn\u0027\u0027t scan after\u003cbr /\u003e two attempts, it must be free. Get so worked up that your face starts to break\u003cbr /\u003e out. The clerk will still attempt to enter the bar code. At this point, bring\u003cbr /\u003e forward your first accomplice who will introduce herself as the Secretary of Bar\u003cbr /\u003e Code Scanning and say to the clerk, \"I\u0027\u0027ll give you two seconds to enter that bar\u003cbr /\u003e code.

Times up!\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk will probably call for the manager, and the two of them will insist\u003cbr /\u003e on manually entering the bar code into the cash register. Have dozens of your\u003cbr /\u003e accomplices run to the media talking about possible mistakes and mischief that\u003cbr /\u003e could arise from manually entering the bar code. Raise questions such as, \"How\u003cbr /\u003e can I make sure the price is being entered fairly when the clerk works for the\u003cbr /\u003e owner?\" Say, \"These items have been scanned and rescanned. They just want to\u003cbr /\u003e keep entering bar codes until they get the total they want.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, the owner might try to take you to court to get some more time\u003cbr /\u003e to manually enter the bar code.

The owner will now have to drive to the state capital to file a\u003cbr /\u003e lawsuit in which he will ask the judge to manually enter the bar code of the\u003cbr /\u003e item that would not scan. Invite some celebrities over for a photo op and\u003cbr /\u003e announce that you\u0027\u0027ll share the items with them once the items are found to be\u003cbr /\u003e rightfully yours. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile in court, the owner will ask the judge to transfer the item from the\u003cbr /\u003e checkout line to the courtroom.

The House Appropriations subcommittee on NASA oversight, in another effort to reduce the NASA budget, passed a resolution today to downsize the solar system. According to an unnamed congressional staffer, House Republicans felt there has been \"too much redundancy in the solar system\" and that streamlining the 4.5 billion year old planetary system is long overdue. Such action would give NASA fewer places to go and this would allow the agency to carry out its space exploration goals within the funding profile that the House proposed earlier this summer.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, we have three terrestrial planets\" said Congressman Rip U. Apart (R, Del.), \"and only one of them really works! So why not get rid of the other two and clean up the neighborhood?\" Most subcommittee members felt that while downsizing was definitely in the cards, eliminating both Mars and Venus was going too far. \"We have too many international commitments to Mars.\" said Rush N. Hater (R, Calif.). \"So I think we should keep Mars and dump Venus. Its too hot to live on, and liberal Democrats keep using it as an example of what global warming can do. So from a political and practical point of view, Venus has got to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAlso at risk is the planet Mercury which lacks support because of its small size and poor visibility from Earth. \"Who needs it?\" asked Congressman Newt Onian (R, N.C.). \"Have you ever seen it? I haven\u0027\u0027t. So what good is it? We just don\u0027\u0027t need useless planets. And speaking of useless planets, what about the asteroids? If you\u0027\u0027ve seen one, you\u0027\u0027ve seen them all. So I say we ought to get rid of the little boogers once and for all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the downsizing recommendations do not stop with the terrestrial planets. The resolution also calls for a reduction in the number of gas giants which contain most of the planetary mass in the solar system. Most subcommittee members favor retaining Jupiter and Saturn, and eliminating Uranus and Neptune. \"Jupiter employs the most molecules, and Saturn has those pretty little rings everyone likes.\" said Rep. Con Mann (R, Fla.). \"On the other hand, Uranus is a bore and its rings are dirty. And Neptune, for God\u0027\u0027s sake, is just too far away. So begone with those ugly bruisers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut the influential Wright I.M. Fornow from South Carolina has publicly announced he will fight to eliminate Saturn. Fornow is especially miffed by NASA\u0027\u0027s success thus far in keeping Cassini, the next mission to Saturn, alive which he feels is waste of taxpayers money. \"If there ain\u0027\u0027t no Saturn, then there ain\u0027\u0027t no Cassini\" he exclaimed. The congressman also expressed concern about sending back-to-back spacecraft bearing Italian surnames to the outer planets (The Galileo spacecraft arrives at Jupiter this December).\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe subcommittee was unanimous in its views towards Pluto which they deemed a moral misfit. \"Now here\u0027\u0027s a planet we can definitely do without.\" continued Fornow. \"A few years ago, it was farthest from the sun. Now its not. Its just too confusing. And now they tell me its really two planets instead of one. What the hell is going on here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe resolution must now be presented to the entire House, where it is expected to pass easily since only a minority of Representatives have constituents on the affected planets. NASA Administrator Golden has vowed to resist any further reductions to the solar system, saying that \"NASA has expended considerable effort to make the planets cheaper, faster, and better. Much of this work would be wasted if the solar system were downsized\" stated Golden.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eCritics say, however, that reducing the number of planets will not produce the expected savings to taxpayers. Textbooks, they note, would have to be revised to reflect the new arrangement, and facilities would need to be constructed to remove the planets themselves. The resolution is also likely to draw strong opposition from religious fundamentalists who have long opposed the elimination of any of the biblical planets. Thus, the matter is far from resolved.","Clinton died and went to heaven or to be more accurate, approached the Pearly Gates.
