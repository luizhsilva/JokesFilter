I have always believed him. I believed him when he said he had never been drafted in the Vietnam War and I believed him when he said he had forgotten to mention that he had been drafted in the Vietnam War. I believed him when he said he hadn\u0027\u0027t had sex with Gennifer Flowers and I believe him now, when he reportedly says he did.I believe the president did not rent out the Lincoln Bedroom, did not sell access to himself and the vice president to hundreds of well-heeled special pleaders and did not supervise the largest, most systematic money-laundering operation in campaign finance history, collecting more than $ 3 million in illegal and improper donations. I believe that Charlie Trie and James Riady were motivated by nothing but patriotism for their adopted country.I believed Vice President Gore when he said that he had made dunning calls to political contributors \u0027\u0027on a few occasions\u0027\u0027 from his White House office, and I believed when he said that, actually, \u0027\u0027a few\u0027\u0027 meant 46. I believe in no controlling legal authority.I believe Bruce Babbitt when he says that the $ 286,000 contributed the DNC by Indian tribes opposed to granting a casino license to rival tribes had nothing to do with his denial of the license. I believed the secretary when he said that he had not been instructed this matter by then-White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. I believed him when he said that he had told lobbyist and friend Paul Eckstein that Ickes had told him to move on the casino decision, but that he had been lying to Eckstein. I agree with the secretary that it is an outrage that anyone would question his integrity. I believe in the Clinton Standard of adherence to the campaign finance and bribery laws, enunciated by the president on March 7, 1997: \u0027\u0027I don\u0027\u0027t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.\u0027\u0027 I note with approval the use of the word \u0027\u0027evidence\u0027\u0027 and also the use of the word \u0027\u0027solely.\u0027\u0027 I believe that it is proper to change government policy to address the concerns of people who have given the president money, as long as nobody can find evidence of this being the sole reason. I believe the president has lived up to his promise to preside over the most ethical administration in American history. I believe that indicted former agriculture secretary Mike Espy did not accept $35,000 in illegal favors from Tyson Foods and other regulated businesses. I believe that indicted former housing secretary Henry Cisneros did not lie to the FBI and tell others to lie to cover up $ 250,000 in blackmail payments to his former mistress.  I believe that convicted former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell was not involved in the obstruction of justice when the president\u0027\u0027s minions arranged for Hubbell to receive $ 400,000 in sweetheart consulting deals at a time when he was reneging on his promise to cooperate with Kenneth Starr\u0027\u0027s Whitewater investigation. I believe Paula Jones is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Kathleen Willey is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Monica Lewinsky is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Lewinsky was fantasizing in her 20 hours of conversation in which she reportedly detailed her sexual relationship with the president and begged Linda Tripp to join her in lying about the relationship. I believe that any gifts, correspondence, telephone calls and the 37 post-employment White House visits that may have passed between Lewinsky and the president are evidence only of a platonic relationship; such innocent intimate friendships are quite common between middle-aged married men and young single women, and also between presidents of the United States and White House interns. I see nothing suspicious in the report that the president\u0027\u0027s intimate, Vernon Jordan, arranged a $ 40,000-per-year job for Lewinsky shortly after she signed but before she filed an affidavit saying she had not had sex with the president. Nor do I read anything into the fact that the ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, visited Lewinsky at the Watergate to offer her a job. I believe the instructions Lewinsky gave Tripp informing her on how to properly perjure herself in the Willey matter simply wrote themselves.I believe that The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News \u0026amp; World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR are all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. Especially NPR.","A first grade teacher in the conservative Midwest is explaining to her class that she is a Republican and how nice it is that a new Republican president has taken office.

I\u003cbr /\u003e was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands. I taught\u003cbr /\u003e myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers\u003cbr /\u003e and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi\u003cbr /\u003e River steamboat. Frequently we would stop the ship and I would\u003cbr /\u003e cut and split five cords of wood for fuel overnight for the\u003cbr /\u003e steam engines. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother taught me the value of education, so every day, I\u003cbr /\u003e would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a\u003cbr /\u003e mischievous, fun loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one\u003cbr /\u003e day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for\u003cbr /\u003e \"Huckleberry Finn.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, we Jewish black folks in the south were second-class\u003cbr /\u003e citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I\u003cbr /\u003e asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee\u003cbr /\u003e civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an\u003cbr /\u003e impression. You see, the minister\u0027\u0027s name was Martin Luther King,\u003cbr /\u003e Jr. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his\u003cbr /\u003e knee and said, \"Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama,\u003cbr /\u003e someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to\u003cbr /\u003e an exclusive prep school.\" As a young Hindu boy, these were very\u003cbr /\u003e valuable lessons. But life of privilege was not for me. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBeing Chinese, after getting my high school diploma, I took a\u003cbr /\u003e job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the\u003cbr /\u003e treatment of the workers there that I organized a union. Later,\u003cbr /\u003e that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my\u003cbr /\u003e close friends at the AFL-CIO call me \"Norma Rae.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWhen word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done,\u003cbr /\u003e Harvard University called and offered me a scholarship. I\u003cbr /\u003e captained the hockey team to four consecutive national\u003cbr /\u003e championships, but I also played football and was good enough to\u003cbr /\u003e win the Heisman Trophy. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDuring my college years, I lived in a housing project and\u003cbr /\u003e moonlighted writing songs and playing lead guitar for a little\u003cbr /\u003e rock band.

I\u003cbr /\u003e was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier\u003cbr /\u003e and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de\u003cbr /\u003e Guerre.

The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care, In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair.  The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds, While visions of perjury danced in their heads.  And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap, Had just settled in for a long evening\u0027\u0027s nap.When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter.  When what to their wondering eyes should appear But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer.  With a Presidential address, so lively and quick, They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick!More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came, And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:\u0027\u0027Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let\u0027\u0027s forget The Vixen!On Barney! On Maxine! I\u0027\u0027m no Richard Nixon!!!\u0027\u0027 \u0027\u0027From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall, Now dash away, dash away, dash away all !!!\u0027\u0027And then the Republicans heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  They scratched their heads and were turning around When resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound.  No longer would he eat from his humble pie, While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky.  A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq, It looked once again like Slick Willie was back.His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, His nose like a cherry.  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the hair on his head was as white as the snow.  The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.  He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf, And the Republicans wept, in spite of themselves.  And a wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave them to know they had something to dread.  He spoke the right words and went straight to his work Hard to believe Mon had called him \u0027\u0027The Jerk.\u0027\u0027And shaking his finger and thumbing his nose, By \u0027\u0027Wagging The Dog,\u0027\u0027 up the polls he rose.  He turned to his spinmeisters and gave them a whistle, Then they cheered-on Slick Willie as he launched another missile.

In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had \"willingly and enthusiastically\" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting directly to Bill Gates.

He went on to say that Gates has a \"proven track record\", and that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their \"full support and confidence\". Clinton will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he has earned as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft. Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as \"silly\", though did say that he would make executive decisions for the U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters.

The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have a real bummer of a day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.The next day at 12:01, the first person comes to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly says to the man, \u0027\u0027Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died.\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027No problem,\u0027\u0027 the man says. \u0027\u0027I came home to my 25th floor apartment in my lunch hour and caught my wife half-naked and appearing to be having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. I immediately began searching for him. My wife was yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. Just as I was about to giveup, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of that guy!\u0027\u0027Well, I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But wouldn\u0027\u0027t you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn\u0027\u0027t die. This ticked me off even more. In a rage, I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him. Oddly enough, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony, and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 storeys and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.\u0027\u0027The angel sits back and thinks for a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day. It was a crime of passion. So, the angel announces, \u0027\u0027OK sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,\u0027\u0027 and lets him in. A few seconds later the next guy comes up. \u0027\u0027Before I can let you in, I need to hear about what your day was like when you died.\u0027\u0027The man says, \u0027\u0027No problem. But you\u0027\u0027re not going to believe this. I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side!\u0027\u0027Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, starts cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom that broke my fall so I didn\u0027\u0027t die right away. As I\u0027\u0027m laying there face up on the ground, unable to move, and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator of all things off the balcony. It falls the 25 floors and lands on top of me, killing me instantly.\u0027\u0027The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. \u0027\u0027I could get used to this new policy,\u0027\u0027 he thinks to himself. \u0027\u0027Very well,\u0027\u0027 the angel announces, \u0027\u0027welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,\u0027\u0027 and he lets the man enter.A few seconds later, a third man comes up to the gate. The angel is warming up to his task. \u0027\u0027OK, please tell me what it was like the day you died.\u0027\u0027The man says, \u0027\u0027OK, picture this.

I made it through all the interviews with flying colours, and the only thing left was the drug test.  I was confident in passing, but there was one slight problem: I have *very* shy kidneys.  I\u0027\u0027ve had to sneak out of the doctor\u0027\u0027s office on more than one occasion, because I can\u0027\u0027t \"go\" and fill up a cup on command.  Usually, this is a good thing, as I can go to a concert or football game, drink beer all day, and be fine until I get home, while my friends are standing in line in the bathrooms several times during the same time period.So, to prepare, on the morning I had to take the test, I drank my usual 10-cup pot of coffee, and several large glasses of water, and for the 20-minute trip to Kodak, I filled a plastic gallon jug with water, and finished it off on the way.   Now, Kodak has huge parking lots, each containg hundreds and hundreds of cars, and by the time I got there, the visitor\u0027\u0027s lots were pretty full, and I had to park way in the back.As soon as I got out of my car, I\u0027\u0027m thinking, \"Good, it worked, I think I can go!\"  By the time I\u0027\u0027d finished the 10-minute walk to the entrance, I was thinking, \"Boy, no problems now, I can *definitely* go!\"To get in, I had to go past a security hut.  I told them why I was there, and they told me where to report, about another 10-minute walk, a little ways into the plant.  I had to pass building after building before I got to the right one, every step of the way, becoming actually painful, and before I was there, I was looking at bushes and doorways and the like, thinking, \"Well, if it gets too bad, I could go there, or maybe there, or...\"By the time I got to the right building, I was just about in agony. I found the right area, and the receptionist told me to take a seat with about 8 other people.  I sat down, thinking that would help, but 10 seconds later I was up, walking around, trying to read stuff on the wall, anything to keep my mind occuppied, but managing to read 5 or 10 words, and then having to pace again.Finally, I couldn\u0027\u0027t take it anymore, and after having asked the girl a couple of times how long, I told her, \"look, either you get me in *now*, or I use the bathroom over there, and we reschedule!!\" She said she\u0027\u0027d see what she could do, and left.  I went back to sit down, and it took all of 5 seconds before I was up pacing again. She came back a few minutes later, and told me to go on in.When I got to the actual room, there were 4 people standing in line.  I hopped up and down a couple of times, before I passed the others, went to the nurses, and told them I have to go **NOW**!!! They asked the others in line if anyone objected, and they said no, so they said as soon as one of the 2 bathrooms come free, I could go.  I snatched the cup out of his hand, and practically raced down the aisle to the bathrooms and just stood waiting.  It couldn\u0027\u0027t have been more than 20 seconds or so, but they were some of the most agonizing seconds of my life!!Finally, one of the doors opened, and I nearly flattened some poor girl coming out in my rush to get in.  I closed the door, grabbed my pants, breathed in, and dropped them and then my underwear, and then the world caved in...  I started going.  And going.  And going. I could have knocked down the Berlin wall with the force!   But the problem was, that I couldn\u0027\u0027t \"grab\" it!!  It was whipping around like one of those Water Wiggle things.  I\u0027\u0027m trying like heck to reign it it in, but just couldn\u0027\u0027t.  I\u0027\u0027m dancing around in a circle, with my pants around my ankles, trying to grab it, and it was just about impossible for probably a good 15 seconds.  Finally, I did, and was able to aim in the toilet, just remembering at the end to put a shot or two in the cup to put on the little shelf.   By the time I\u0027\u0027d stopped, I was physically spent, and just leaned up against the wall, feeling like I\u0027\u0027d just run a marathon...It was then that was able to survey the bathroom.  It was a room, about 7x7, but my god...  I had finished the most intense pee of my life in the john, but before I\u0027\u0027d gained control, I\u0027\u0027d soaked the entire toilet, the sink, the floor, the walls.  You name it, it was drenched -- including my pants and underwear.  I tried soaking it up with toilet paper (using the whole roll as a sponge), but that was drenched and didn\u0027\u0027t work that well.  I\u0027\u0027d also soaked the extra rolls on the back of the toilet, the paper towel holder, and the extra roll of paper towels.  I went through the garbage, pulling out half-soaked old towels, just trying to make the place semi-presentable, as in the sink and the mirror, but it didn\u0027\u0027t do much good.  I was just ending up pushing the wet around, so I finally gave up.Steeling myself, I pulled up my wet underwear, then my wet pants, and pulled down my semi-wet shirt as much as possible, and went out. I whipped back up the aisle, thanking the nurse, without slowing down, and out the door as fast as my legs would carry me, imagining what the next person to use that bathroom would encounter.

One statue was male and the other was female. They were positioned on opposite ends of the park, facing each other with their arms extended out as if to embrace. The wizard stood there for a long time examining their sad facial expressions until he got an idea.         He immediately opened up his bag of tricks and cast a spell on the statues to bring them to life. Once the statues realized they were human, they quickly ran up to him. The wizard, being very pleased with himself, told the statues that they could finally be together as a couple but there was one condition.

Young (27) at the Metallica concert last Friday. Uhlenake and Young were found dead at the Gorge Amphitheater after the show. Uhlenake was in pickup that was on top of Young at the bottom of a 20 ft drop. Young was found with severe lacerations, numerous fractures, contusions, and a branch in his anal cavity. He also had been stabbed and his pants were in a tree above him, some 15 ft off the ground; adding to the mystery of the heretofore unexplained scene. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Commissioner-In-Charge Inoye Appleton, Uhlenake and Young had tried to get tickets for the sold-out concert. When they were unable to get any tickets, the two decided to stay in the lot and drink. Once the show began, and after the two had consumed 18 beers between the two of them, they hit upon the idea of scaling the 7 foot wooden security fence around the perimeter of the site and sneak in. They apparently moved the truck up to the edge of the fence and decided that Young would go over first and assist Uhlenake later. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThey had not counted on the fact that while it was a 7 foot fence on the parking lot side, there was a 23 foot drop on the other side. Young, who weighed 255 lbs and was quite inebriated, had jumped up and over the fence and promptly fell about half the 23 foot distance before a large tree branch broke his fall AND his left forearm; unfortunately, he also managed to get his shorts caught on the branch. Since he was now in a lot of pain and with no way to extricate himself and his shorts from the tree, he decided, seeing bushes down below, to cut his shorts off and fall to the ground. Upon cutting the last bit of fabric from himself, he suddenly plummeted to earth, losing grip of the knife. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"soft\" bushes were actually holly bushes and landing in them caused a massive number of cuts. He also had the misfortune of landing squarely on a holly bush branch; effectively impaling himself. The knife, which he had accidentally released 15 ft up, now landed and stabbed him in his left thigh. Apparently, he was in a lot of pain. Enter his friend Robert. Uhlenake had apparently observed the last bit of this and, despite his inebriated state, realized that Young was in trouble. He hit upon the idea of lowering a rope to his friend and pull him up and over the fence. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis was complicated by the fact that Uhlenake was outweighed by his friend `y a good 100 lbs. Again, despite his state he realized he could use their truck to pull Young out. Unfortunately, because of his state, Uhlenake put the truck in reverse, rather than drive, broke through the fence, landed on Young (killing him), was thrown out of the truck and subsequently died of internal injuries. \"So that\u0027\u0027s how a dead 255 lb man with no pants on, with a truck on top of him and a stick up his ass came to be\" said Commissioner Appleton.","Good afternoon.
