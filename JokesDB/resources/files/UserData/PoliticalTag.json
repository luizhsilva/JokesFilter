I have always believed him. I believed him when he said he had never been drafted in the Vietnam War and I believed him when he said he had forgotten to mention that he had been drafted in the Vietnam War. I believed him when he said he hadn\u0027\u0027t had sex with Gennifer Flowers and I believe him now, when he reportedly says he did.I believe the president did not rent out the Lincoln Bedroom, did not sell access to himself and the vice president to hundreds of well-heeled special pleaders and did not supervise the largest, most systematic money-laundering operation in campaign finance history, collecting more than $ 3 million in illegal and improper donations. I believe that Charlie Trie and James Riady were motivated by nothing but patriotism for their adopted country.I believed Vice President Gore when he said that he had made dunning calls to political contributors \u0027\u0027on a few occasions\u0027\u0027 from his White House office, and I believed when he said that, actually, \u0027\u0027a few\u0027\u0027 meant 46. I believe in no controlling legal authority.I believe Bruce Babbitt when he says that the $ 286,000 contributed the DNC by Indian tribes opposed to granting a casino license to rival tribes had nothing to do with his denial of the license. I believed the secretary when he said that he had not been instructed this matter by then-White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. I believed him when he said that he had told lobbyist and friend Paul Eckstein that Ickes had told him to move on the casino decision, but that he had been lying to Eckstein. I agree with the secretary that it is an outrage that anyone would question his integrity. I believe in the Clinton Standard of adherence to the campaign finance and bribery laws, enunciated by the president on March 7, 1997: \u0027\u0027I don\u0027\u0027t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.\u0027\u0027 I note with approval the use of the word \u0027\u0027evidence\u0027\u0027 and also the use of the word \u0027\u0027solely.\u0027\u0027 I believe that it is proper to change government policy to address the concerns of people who have given the president money, as long as nobody can find evidence of this being the sole reason. I believe the president has lived up to his promise to preside over the most ethical administration in American history. I believe that indicted former agriculture secretary Mike Espy did not accept $35,000 in illegal favors from Tyson Foods and other regulated businesses. I believe that indicted former housing secretary Henry Cisneros did not lie to the FBI and tell others to lie to cover up $ 250,000 in blackmail payments to his former mistress.  I believe that convicted former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell was not involved in the obstruction of justice when the president\u0027\u0027s minions arranged for Hubbell to receive $ 400,000 in sweetheart consulting deals at a time when he was reneging on his promise to cooperate with Kenneth Starr\u0027\u0027s Whitewater investigation. I believe Paula Jones is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Kathleen Willey is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Monica Lewinsky is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Lewinsky was fantasizing in her 20 hours of conversation in which she reportedly detailed her sexual relationship with the president and begged Linda Tripp to join her in lying about the relationship. I believe that any gifts, correspondence, telephone calls and the 37 post-employment White House visits that may have passed between Lewinsky and the president are evidence only of a platonic relationship; such innocent intimate friendships are quite common between middle-aged married men and young single women, and also between presidents of the United States and White House interns. I see nothing suspicious in the report that the president\u0027\u0027s intimate, Vernon Jordan, arranged a $ 40,000-per-year job for Lewinsky shortly after she signed but before she filed an affidavit saying she had not had sex with the president. Nor do I read anything into the fact that the ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, visited Lewinsky at the Watergate to offer her a job. I believe the instructions Lewinsky gave Tripp informing her on how to properly perjure herself in the Willey matter simply wrote themselves.I believe that The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News \u0026amp; World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR are all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy.

I\u0027\u0027m Al Gore, and I\u0027\u0027d like to tell you a\u003cbr /\u003e little about myself. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a\u003cbr /\u003e poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I\u003cbr /\u003e was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands. I taught\u003cbr /\u003e myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers\u003cbr /\u003e and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi\u003cbr /\u003e River steamboat. Frequently we would stop the ship and I would\u003cbr /\u003e cut and split five cords of wood for fuel overnight for the\u003cbr /\u003e steam engines. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother taught me the value of education, so every day, I\u003cbr /\u003e would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a\u003cbr /\u003e mischievous, fun loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one\u003cbr /\u003e day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for\u003cbr /\u003e \"Huckleberry Finn.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, we Jewish black folks in the south were second-class\u003cbr /\u003e citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I\u003cbr /\u003e asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee\u003cbr /\u003e civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an\u003cbr /\u003e impression. You see, the minister\u0027\u0027s name was Martin Luther King,\u003cbr /\u003e Jr. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his\u003cbr /\u003e knee and said, \"Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama,\u003cbr /\u003e someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to\u003cbr /\u003e an exclusive prep school.\" As a young Hindu boy, these were very\u003cbr /\u003e valuable lessons. But life of privilege was not for me. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBeing Chinese, after getting my high school diploma, I took a\u003cbr /\u003e job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the\u003cbr /\u003e treatment of the workers there that I organized a union. Later,\u003cbr /\u003e that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my\u003cbr /\u003e close friends at the AFL-CIO call me \"Norma Rae.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWhen word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done,\u003cbr /\u003e Harvard University called and offered me a scholarship. I\u003cbr /\u003e captained the hockey team to four consecutive national\u003cbr /\u003e championships, but I also played football and was good enough to\u003cbr /\u003e win the Heisman Trophy. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDuring my college years, I lived in a housing project and\u003cbr /\u003e moonlighted writing songs and playing lead guitar for a little\u003cbr /\u003e rock band. You may have heard of us - The Rolling Stones. I\u0027\u0027m\u003cbr /\u003e the one with the lips. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my\u003cbr /\u003e country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I\u003cbr /\u003e was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier\u003cbr /\u003e and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de\u003cbr /\u003e Guerre. My battlefield expertise is current requisite reading\u003cbr /\u003e material for Officers Candidates to this very day. My being a\u003cbr /\u003e wounded female officer serving in disguise as a journalist was a\u003cbr /\u003e full time project, but my military knowledge helped save tens of\u003cbr /\u003e thousands of lives. Many cities in Southeast Asia are named\u003cbr /\u003e after me to this very day. Statues of me are still commonplace\u003cbr /\u003e in many official Government buildings in Viet Nam. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of\u003cbr /\u003e ours.

I was, in fact, the third (still silent)\u003cbr /\u003e partner of Ben \u0026amp; Jerry with over half of the flavors personally\u003cbr /\u003e developed by Tipper and me in our own kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy extensive knowledge of Arctic Sea life keeps me busy in the\u003cbr /\u003e research laboratory, but those endangered species need love too!\u003cbr /\u003e Translating the dead sea scrolls is one of my favorite hobbies,\u003cbr /\u003e and my current volume is in print in over 73 languages and is\u003cbr /\u003e being studied in Seminaries worldwide. Being Indian, both Native\u003cbr /\u003e American and the Mid East kind, this is valuable experience for\u003cbr /\u003e me. Have towel and Tee Pee, will travel.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee\u003cbr /\u003e and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and\u003cbr /\u003e the Senate.

Then you must come to the same conclusion that every \u0027\u0027empty roll crapper\u0027\u0027 must face... pull up your daks, tighten your arse and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eA mate about to run the London Marathon lined up outside the dozens of portaloos on Blackheath to unload a nervous one and discovered when the business was done and he was ready to run a world record race, there was no paper.

Relatives, friends or workmates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects:\u003cbr /\u003e 1. Flush the toilet.\u003cbr /\u003e 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem.\u003cbr /\u003e 3.

You\u0027\u0027re getting impatient. Someone else wants to use the toilet. So you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water.

You run out of gas. That\u0027\u0027s right, you run out of propulsion. The crap is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You\u0027\u0027ve only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you\u0027\u0027re a proctologist and go after it yourself.

The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care, In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair.  The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds, While visions of perjury danced in their heads.  And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap, Had just settled in for a long evening\u0027\u0027s nap.When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter.  When what to their wondering eyes should appear But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer.  With a Presidential address, so lively and quick, They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick!More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came, And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:\u0027\u0027Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let\u0027\u0027s forget The Vixen!On Barney! On Maxine! I\u0027\u0027m no Richard Nixon!!!\u0027\u0027 \u0027\u0027From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall, Now dash away, dash away, dash away all !!!\u0027\u0027And then the Republicans heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  They scratched their heads and were turning around When resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound.  No longer would he eat from his humble pie, While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky.  A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq, It looked once again like Slick Willie was back.His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, His nose like a cherry.  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the hair on his head was as white as the snow.  The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.

In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had \"willingly and enthusiastically\" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting directly to Bill Gates.

He went on to say that Gates has a \"proven track record\", and that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their \"full support and confidence\". Clinton will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he has earned as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft. Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as \"silly\", though did say that he would make executive decisions for the U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters.
