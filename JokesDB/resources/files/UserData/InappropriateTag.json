Being a bit bored with it all, and with a well-kept and wry sense of humor, he set a single question on the sheet: \"Is Hell endothermic or exothermic? Support your answer with proof.\"\u003cbr /\u003e He had little idea what to expect, or how to grade the results, but decided to reward any student who was able to come up with a reasonable and consistent reply to his query. One A was awarded. Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle\u0027\u0027s Law or some variant. The top student however wrote the following: \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle\u0027\u0027s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. There are two possible conditions: \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eCondition One: if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase exponentially until all hell breaks loose.\u003cbr /\u003e Conversely, Condition Two: if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe can solve this with the 1990 postulation of Theresa LeClair, the girl who lived across the hall from me during my first year residence. Since I have still not been successful in obtaining sexual relations with her, condition two above has not been met, and thus it can be concluded that condition one is true, and hell is exothermic.","A man lets call him bob was going out with a chinese\u003cbr /\u003e girl named Ping.

A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I\u0027\u0027m telling \u0027\u0027ya those little buggers can\u0027\u0027t be trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I\u0027\u0027m no longer allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow another thing us guys don\u0027\u0027t usually like to talk about, but because you and I have become such good friends and you think I\u0027\u0027m a classy guy, I might as well be candid with you because it\u0027\u0027s a real problem, and you ladies need to be understanding. It\u0027\u0027s the dreaded \"morning wood\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMost mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can\u0027\u0027t get that thing to bend, and if it don\u0027\u0027t bend you can\u0027\u0027t aim, well hell, if you can\u0027\u0027t aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the friggin\u0027\u0027 toilet seat won\u0027\u0027t stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control ourselves for that perfect aim.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow sometimes, when you\u0027\u0027re newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSo us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it\u0027\u0027s just not safe. I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her . . . look, it won\u0027\u0027t bend. She said, \"sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time.\" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with \"morning wood\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWell it\u0027\u0027s is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying superman position lying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it\u0027\u0027s the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSo you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame.

I have always believed him. I believed him when he said he had never been drafted in the Vietnam War and I believed him when he said he had forgotten to mention that he had been drafted in the Vietnam War. I believed him when he said he hadn\u0027\u0027t had sex with Gennifer Flowers and I believe him now, when he reportedly says he did.I believe the president did not rent out the Lincoln Bedroom, did not sell access to himself and the vice president to hundreds of well-heeled special pleaders and did not supervise the largest, most systematic money-laundering operation in campaign finance history, collecting more than $ 3 million in illegal and improper donations. I believe that Charlie Trie and James Riady were motivated by nothing but patriotism for their adopted country.I believed Vice President Gore when he said that he had made dunning calls to political contributors \u0027\u0027on a few occasions\u0027\u0027 from his White House office, and I believed when he said that, actually, \u0027\u0027a few\u0027\u0027 meant 46. I believe in no controlling legal authority.I believe Bruce Babbitt when he says that the $ 286,000 contributed the DNC by Indian tribes opposed to granting a casino license to rival tribes had nothing to do with his denial of the license. I believed the secretary when he said that he had not been instructed this matter by then-White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. I believed him when he said that he had told lobbyist and friend Paul Eckstein that Ickes had told him to move on the casino decision, but that he had been lying to Eckstein. I agree with the secretary that it is an outrage that anyone would question his integrity. I believe in the Clinton Standard of adherence to the campaign finance and bribery laws, enunciated by the president on March 7, 1997: \u0027\u0027I don\u0027\u0027t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.\u0027\u0027 I note with approval the use of the word \u0027\u0027evidence\u0027\u0027 and also the use of the word \u0027\u0027solely.\u0027\u0027 I believe that it is proper to change government policy to address the concerns of people who have given the president money, as long as nobody can find evidence of this being the sole reason. I believe the president has lived up to his promise to preside over the most ethical administration in American history. I believe that indicted former agriculture secretary Mike Espy did not accept $35,000 in illegal favors from Tyson Foods and other regulated businesses. I believe that indicted former housing secretary Henry Cisneros did not lie to the FBI and tell others to lie to cover up $ 250,000 in blackmail payments to his former mistress.  I believe that convicted former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell was not involved in the obstruction of justice when the president\u0027\u0027s minions arranged for Hubbell to receive $ 400,000 in sweetheart consulting deals at a time when he was reneging on his promise to cooperate with Kenneth Starr\u0027\u0027s Whitewater investigation. I believe Paula Jones is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Kathleen Willey is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Monica Lewinsky is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Lewinsky was fantasizing in her 20 hours of conversation in which she reportedly detailed her sexual relationship with the president and begged Linda Tripp to join her in lying about the relationship. I believe that any gifts, correspondence, telephone calls and the 37 post-employment White House visits that may have passed between Lewinsky and the president are evidence only of a platonic relationship; such innocent intimate friendships are quite common between middle-aged married men and young single women, and also between presidents of the United States and White House interns. I see nothing suspicious in the report that the president\u0027\u0027s intimate, Vernon Jordan, arranged a $ 40,000-per-year job for Lewinsky shortly after she signed but before she filed an affidavit saying she had not had sex with the president. Nor do I read anything into the fact that the ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, visited Lewinsky at the Watergate to offer her a job. I believe the instructions Lewinsky gave Tripp informing her on how to properly perjure herself in the Willey matter simply wrote themselves.I believe that The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News \u0026amp; World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR are all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. Especially NPR.","A blonde was walking along the beach when she finds an old bottle floating in the water. The blonde goes over and picks it up and notices a cork in the top of the bottle.

During the examination, an asthma inhaler fell from under her armpit, a dime was found under one of her breasts, and a remote control was found lodged between the folds of her vulva. OUCH!     ----------------------------------A couple hobbled into a Washington emergency room covered in bloodied restaurant towels. The man had his arms around his waist, and the woman had hers around her head. They eventually explained to doctors that they had gone out that evening for a romantic dinner. Overcome with passion, the woman crept under the table to administer oral sex to the man. While in the act, she had an epileptic fit, which caused her mouth to clamp down on the man\u0027\u0027s member and wrenched it from side to side. In agony and desperation, the man grabbed a fork and stabbed her in the head until she let go.       --------------------------------SEX EDUCATION: A Californian doctor examining a young woman with abdominal pains sked her if she was sexually active. She said that she wasn\u0027\u0027t. A later examination showed that she was pregnant. Asked why she said that she was not sexually active, the woman replied, \"I\u0027\u0027m not.

After an examination of his wife, it was revealed that she had a surgical needle left inside her after a recent hysterectomy.       -------------------------------LAST STAND: A Cambridge man hobbled into the ER complaining of a permanent erection. He admitted to doctors that while on holiday in Cuba, he frequented many brothels, and in one he was given some erectile cream to keep him hard. He was told to use it sparingly. However, since he was aving so much fun, he kept using more and more. By the time he came to the ER, ll the blood vessels in his penis were swollen and his testicles had ballooned in size. Doctors could do nothing except prescribe pain killers, and told him that it would return to flaccidity in a few days.

However, since he was aving so much fun, he kept using more and more. By the time he came to the ER, ll the blood vessels in his penis were swollen and his testicles had ballooned in size.

THE TRUTH: Four high-school  dropouts and their sentient dog ride around the country in their psychedelic  love machine, earning their way by selling drugs. Oh, and they occasionally  take some old guys mask off to solve a mystery. It may be hard to swallow,  but just take a look at the evidence... Take Shaggy for example. Not only is  he the inspiration for the current \u0027\u0027grunge\u0027\u0027 scene, with his sloppy dress and  facial hair, but Shaggy is obviously a \u0027\u0027burner\u0027\u0027, i.e., he smokes marijuana.

Pray    fervently and out loud when the temptations are    strongest. When the temptation to masturbate is    strong, yell \u0027\u0027STOP\u0027\u0027 to those thoughts as loudly as    you can in your mind. Then recite a portion of the    Bible or sing a hymn.2. Set a goal of abstinence. Begin with a day, then a    week, a month and year. Finally, commit yourself to    never doing it again. Make a pocket calendar for a    month on a small card. Carry it with you but show it    to no one. If you masturbate, colour that day black.    Your goal will be to have no black days.  3. Set up a reward system. Each time you reach a goal    reward yourself with a quarter.4. When on the toilet or showering, leave the door    partly open.5. Avoid people, situations, and pictures and reading    material that might create sexual excitement. 6. Use physical restraints.7. Wear pajamas that are difficult to open, yet loose    and not binding. Put on several layers that would be    difficult to remove while half asleep. 8. In severe cases, tie your hands to the bed frame.9. Be aware of situations that depress you or that    cause you to feel lonely, bored, frustrated, or    discouraged. These emotional states can trigger the    desire to masturbate as a way of escape.  10. To cancel the pleasure of masturbating, associate    something very distasteful with the act.

Set a goal of abstinence. Begin with a day, then a    week, a month and year. Finally, commit yourself to    never doing it again. Make a pocket calendar for a    month on a small card. Carry it with you but show it    to no one. If you masturbate, colour that day black.    Your goal will be to have no black days.  3. Set up a reward system. Each time you reach a goal    reward yourself with a quarter.4. When on the toilet or showering, leave the door    partly open.5. Avoid people, situations, and pictures and reading    material that might create sexual excitement. 6. Use physical restraints.7. Wear pajamas that are difficult to open, yet loose    and not binding. Put on several layers that would be    difficult to remove while half asleep. 8. In severe cases, tie your hands to the bed frame.9. Be aware of situations that depress you or that    cause you to feel lonely, bored, frustrated, or    discouraged. These emotional states can trigger the    desire to masturbate as a way of escape.  10. To cancel the pleasure of masturbating, associate    something very distasteful with the act. For    example, imagine bathing in a tub full of worms and    eating some of them.","Yo mama so ugly when she joined an ugly contest, they said\u003cbr /\u003e \"Sorry, no professionals.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly just after she was born, her mother said \"What a\u003cbr /\u003e treasure!\" and her father said \"Yes, let\u0027\u0027s go bury it.\" \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly they push her face into dough to make gorilla\u003cbr /\u003e cookies. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly instead of putting the bungee cord around her\u003cbr /\u003e ankle, they put it around her neck \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly she gets 364 extra days to dress up for\u003cbr /\u003e Halloween. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly when she walks into a bank, they turn off the\u003cbr /\u003e surveillence cameras \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly her mom had to tie a steak around her neck to\u003cbr /\u003e get the dogs to play with her. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly the government moved Halloween to her birthday. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly that if ugly were bricks she\u0027\u0027d have her own\u003cbr /\u003e projects. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly she made an onion cry. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYo mama so ugly when they took her to the beautician it took 12\u003cbr /\u003e hours for a quote!

We decided to spend a fun filled day with all the luxuries of our lives. We decided to start the day with a ride on his Harley, witch we both enjoy the freedom of the road. We road for a couple of hours and a took a well needed rest, so then we decided to take a cruise on my boat, which we also enjoy, because of all the quiet and alone time, with no one else around, not even a phone. We cruised for around a hour or so and decided it was time to get something to eat, so we returned home and jumped in the explorer and headed down the road to get something to eat. Well we hit the road and came across a Rite Aide, and I decided to ask him to pull in and get me some Captain Morgans, and he did just that. As he left the liquor store he put my alcohol in the back of the explore, now my day seemed to be complete. So with all he did with me and for me, I took it upon myself to make his day complete too. So I began to play with all his emotions, an got  quite carried away. The next thing I knew I heard a knock on the window and as I raised my head, I saw a Cop standing at the window, boy I couldn�酶惟t believe what was happening. As Randy�酶惟s eyes rolled back in his head, I didn�酶惟t know if he had seen the cop or was just enjoying the moment? Next thing I heard was the cop ask me to step out of the car, and as quick as I could pull myself back together I did what he asked. The next thing I new I was under arrest for  pubic drinking. Holy Crape I thought to myself. The officer explained this was better the being arrested for soliciting. At this time I wasn�酶惟t for sure what was any better than the other, but I calmly held my composure. Than the cop looked in the back seat of the explorer and saw the bottle of liquor, and without thinking Randy responded you can buy liquor on Sunday. O�酶惟boy the cop asked Randy to step out of the car, as he placed the handcuffs on me. He informed Randy, he also was under arrest for trying to sell his girlfriend to an officer. I believe the cop misunderstood Randy�酶惟s response, and thought he offered let him lick-her on Sunday so the officer placed handcuffs on Randy, and charged him with pandering. Shit o Shit what did we get ourselves into on such a beautiful Sunday afternoon? He then placed both of us in the back of the police car. Without thinking I said this really SUCKS. Then you won�酶惟t believe what happened next. The cop charged me with attempted bribery, or in other words sucking up to an officer. I knew we both were done for at this time, but it doesn�酶惟t end there, I again without thinking responded boy did I stick a foot in my mouth. The officer at this time lowered  his cheap sunglasses, and in amazement he laughed this crazy insane laugh I�酶惟ll never forget, believe that. He said to the both of us, I�酶惟m going to have to let you off on all charges, there was no way in hell he wanted to finish his police report ending with my statement, that I stuck 12 inches (a foot) in my mouth.  So with a sigh of relief we got back in the explorer and went on our way. Let this story be a warning to anyone considering pubic drinking, don�酶惟t try it unless you can swallow 12 inches. And if you can swallow that you probably swallowed this story too.","1) When clicking through the channels, you don\u0027\u0027t have to stall at every shot\u003cbr /\u003e of somebody crying.\u003cbr /\u003e 2) Your butt is never a factor in job interviews.\u003cbr /\u003e 3) All your orgasms are real.\u003cbr /\u003e 4) A beer gut doesn\u0027\u0027t make you invisible to the opposite sex.\u003cbr /\u003e 5) Guy in hockey masks doesn�酶惟t attack you (unless you smash \u0027\u0027em into the\u003cbr /\u003e boards).\u003cbr /\u003e 6) You don\u0027\u0027t have to lug a bag of useful stuff around everywhere you go.\u003cbr /\u003e 7) You understand why Stripes is funny.\u003cbr /\u003e 8) You can go to the bathroom without a support group.\u003cbr /\u003e 9) Your last name stays put.\u003cbr /\u003e 10) You can leave the hotel bed unmade.","Why did the 3 blondes jump off the building? \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThey wanted to see if their maxi-pads really had wings.","Did you hear about the new blonde paint?\u003cbr /\u003e It\u0027\u0027s not real bright, but its cheap, and spreads easy.","Ever hear about the blonde coyote who got a leg stuck in a trap -\u003cbr /\u003e she chewed off three legs and was still stuck!","yo mamas so fat when she gave me her wieght I thought it was her phone number","1) Is it in? \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e2) That\u0027\u0027s it? \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e3) You\u0027\u0027ve got to be kidding me. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e4) *phone rings* Hello?

A general rule: if whatever you\u0027\u0027re doing does not satisfy you completely in 5 minutes, it\u0027\u0027s really not worth it. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e45. Diss your girlfriend.

Tell a girl that you\u0027\u0027re going to leave and when you come back, you want her naked, sprawled on the bed. Leave and go into her dad\u0027\u0027s room and tell him he should go check on his daughter. Then drive like hell (true story). \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e87. If a girl breaks up with you because you\u0027\u0027re in love with someone else, she has no right to be upset because, you know, SHE\u0027\u0027s the one who wanted to end the relationship. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e88.

Spend your spare time thinking of excuses and shove them up your ass. Then, whenever you need one, you can pull it out of your ass. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e91. If you\u0027\u0027re ever forced to show emotion, just pick random emotions like rage and lust and insanity and display them at random, inconvenient times. You won\u0027\u0027t be asked to do it again. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e92. If you are asked to do something you REALLY DON\u0027\u0027T want to do, first try your manly best to get out of it. If that doesn\u0027\u0027t work, go ahead and do what you were asked to do but complain that you don\u0027\u0027t know how to do it and continuously ask questions on how to do each little part. If no one rushes in to do it for you YET, finish the job in the most half-assed way you possibly can and then say: \"SEE? I TOLD you I couldn\u0027\u0027t do it.\" Eventually, people will stop asking you to do things. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e93. Work out day and night to make your body even more beautiful than it already is.

A mail has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3 am on a Sunday morning, he will call and say, \u0027\u0027I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I\u0027\u0027ll never forgive you, and hate you, and you\u0027\u0027re a total floozy. But I want you to know that there\u0027\u0027s always a chance for us.\u0027\u0027 This is known as the \u0027\u0027I Hate You, I Love You\u0027\u0027 drunken phone call and 99 percent of all men have made it at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need.Sex: Women prefer 30 to 40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30 to 40 seconds of foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.Maturity: Women mature much faster than men do. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.Magazines: Men\u0027\u0027s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women\u0027\u0027s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman\u0027\u0027s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.Bathrooms: A man has five items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman\u0027\u0027s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.Groceries: A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampetts\u0027\u0027 car on The Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10?items?or?less lane.Cats: Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren\u0027\u0027t looking, men kick cats.Offspring: Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.Dressing Up: A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.Laundry: Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a van and take his mountain of clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by reruns of old American sitcoms.Eating Out: When the bill comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it\u0027\u0027s only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.Mirrors: Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror. Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any, shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, bald boyfriend\u0027\u0027s/father\u0027\u0027s heads.Menopause: When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, biological Changes. Nature provokes a uniform reaction in men. He buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.Richard Gere: Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because lie reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.Madonna: Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.Toys: Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical. Examples of men\u0027\u0027s toys: little miniature TVs. Cell phones. Complicated juicers and blenders. Graphic equalizers. Small robots that serve cocktails on command. Video games. Anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least six big batteries to operate.Locker Rooms: In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don\u0027\u0027t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about one thing in the locker room: sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.Movies: Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man. Men will only show their arse, because arse size doesn\u0027\u0027t really matter.Jewelry: Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that\u0027\u0027s it. Any more than that and he will look like a lounge singer named Ramone.Time: When a woman says she\u0027\u0027ll be ready to go out in five more minutes, she\u0027\u0027s using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football game just has five minutes left. Neither of them is counting time outs, commercials, or replays.Friends: Women on a \u0027\u0027girls\u0027\u0027 night out\u0027\u0027 talk the whole time. Men on a \u0027\u0027boys\u0027\u0027 night out\u0027\u0027 say about 20 words all night, most of which are \u0027\u0027Pass the chips\u0027\u0027 or \u0027\u0027Got am more beer?\u0027\u0027Toilets: Men use toilets for purely biological reasons. Women use toilets as social lounges. Men in toilets will never speak a word to each other. Women who\u0027\u0027ve never met will leave a toilet giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, \u0027\u0027Hey Tom, I, was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?\u0027\u0027","Yo mama so bald when she whears a turtel neck she looks like a used condom.","A man suspects his wife is having an affair, so he goes to a pet shop to buy a parrot.

The average number of items in the typical woman\u0027\u0027s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.\u003cbr /\u003e Most men take only 2-3 minutes to relieve themselves.

Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always has a bad haircut.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDirections:\u003cbr /\u003e If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings, she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions. Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. Men will never stop and ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, \"Looks like I\u0027\u0027ve found a new way to get there.\" and, \"I know I\u0027\u0027m in the general neighborhood. I recognize that 7-11 store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDressing Up:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for: weddings, funerals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eEating out:\u003cbr /\u003e When the check comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it\u0027\u0027s only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller, and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their check, out come the pocket calculators.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGarages:\u003cbr /\u003e Women use garages to park their cars and store their lawnmowers. Men use garages for many things. They hang license plates in garages, they watch TV in garages, and they build useless lopsided benches in garages.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGoing Out:\u003cbr /\u003e When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she **will** be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earring, finishes putting on her makeup...\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGroceries:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reached the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter that the Clampett\u0027\u0027s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHandwriting:\u003cbr /\u003e To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken- scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their \"i\u0027\u0027s\" with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their \"p\u0027\u0027s\" and \"g\u0027\u0027s\". It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she\u0027\u0027s dumping you, she\u0027\u0027ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHats:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eJewelry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that\u0027\u0027s it. Any more than that, and he will look like a lounge singer named Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLaundry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul, and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of \"Love, American Style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLeg Warmers:\u003cbr /\u003e Leg warmers are sexy. A woman, even if she\u0027\u0027s walking the dog or doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers. She can wear them any time she wants. A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the \"Gimme the Ball\" number in \"A Chorus Line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLocker Rooms:\u003cbr /\u003e In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don\u0027\u0027t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one thing in the locker room, sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLow Blows:\u003cbr /\u003e Let\u0027\u0027s say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says \"Oh, gee. That must have hurt.\" The man groans and doubles over, and actually *feels* the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMagazines:\u003cbr /\u003e Men\u0027\u0027s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women\u0027\u0027s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman\u0027\u0027s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMaturity:\u003cbr /\u003e Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMenopause:\u003cbr /\u003e When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree ofthese changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction; he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather drivin gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMirrors:\u003cbr /\u003e Men are vain; they will always check themselves out in a mirror.  Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe Garagiola\u0027\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMoustaches:\u003cbr /\u003e Some men look good with moustaches. Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. There are no women who look good with moustaches.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMovies:\u003cbr /\u003e Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.  This is because most movies in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh\u003cbr /\u003e for the first time in \"Gone With the Wind\". For men, it\u0027\u0027s when Jimmy Cagney shoves grapefruit in May Clark\u0027\u0027s face in \"Public Enemy\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNicknames:\u003cbr /\u003e With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like \"Ultimate Pecs\" and \"Big Turk,\" women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dave, Rob, and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOffspring:\u003cbr /\u003e Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePlants:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePolitics:\u003cbr /\u003e Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such as voting. Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy\u0027\u0027s is growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign for them and cry on election night.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRestrooms:\u003cbr /\u003e Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms associal lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other. Womenwho\u0027\u0027ve never met will leave a restroom giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, \"Hey, Bob, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis difference may be due to the fact that women don\u0027\u0027t have to hold their genitals in the bathroom, which might make one feel self-conscious. Not having this problem, women can chat away quite comfortably while \"powdering their noses\". And yes, they are talking about men in their chats.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnother theory is that when women \"powder their noses\", all they have to do is sit there. What else is there for them to do but talk to other women. Men, however, must be much more attentive to such matters. If a male turns too much to talk to someone, he\u0027\u0027ll be leaking on his shoe. Men must be very serious and patient because heaven only knows if the stream of urine will suddenly change direction. And after all is done, men must try to remove any excess moisture unless he soils his underwear. And unlike women, there is no tissue paper nearby with which to wipe. A man must use his own skills at \"towel snapping\" to do the job. But no man wants to shake it forever because he might look like he\u0027\u0027s playing with himself. The shaking routine also varies culturally as most men inthe U.K. are \u0027\u0027pullers\u0027\u0027 as opposed to \u0027\u0027shakers\u0027\u0027. Of course, no matter how much a man shakes or pulls, chances are still good that he\u0027\u0027ll get that little dribble down the leg, which will expand to the size of Lake Ontario if he is wearing synthetics.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the shaking or pulling comes the tucking-it-all-back-in routine, where the male tries to not leave anything delicate in the path of the approaching zipper. As the men are all leaving the restroom, trying to button up their Levi\u0027\u0027s, they are still trying not to look as if they\u0027\u0027re playing with themselves. For a man, a trip to the bathroom is a very serious matter. You wouldn\u0027\u0027t gossip and chatter at a board meeting would you?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFor the male, there are also the considerations like seeing how far up the trough he can pee, bombing the cigarette butt, peeling off the killer fart that he didn\u0027\u0027t want to loose off at the bar and, his favorite, making that grunt/sigh noise as the first gush lets go, sort of a \"Nnnngwwwwwaaaaa\". Actually, that\u0027\u0027s about the time the first fart goes too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Gere:\u003cbr /\u003e Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMadonna:\u003cbr /\u003e Same as above, but reversed.  Same reason.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSex:\u003cbr /\u003e Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of\u003cbr /\u003e foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eShoes:\u003cbr /\u003e When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip on Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes all day.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSocks:\u003cbr /\u003e Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks. Socks that are cut way below the ankles, that have pictures of clouds on them, that have a big fuzzy ball on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSports Arenas:\u003cbr /\u003e Simply put, men can always find their way around stadiums and arenas. The women usually end up following men.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eTelephone:\u003cbr /\u003e Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people.

But I want you to know that there\u0027\u0027s always a chance for us\". This is known as the \"I Hate You / I Love You\" drunken phone call, that 99% if all men have made at least once.

The average number of items in the typical woman\u0027\u0027s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.\u003cbr /\u003e Most men take only 2-3 minutes to relieve themselves.

Of course, women always end up taking better pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eCats:\u003cbr /\u003e Women love cats.

The women will roll their eyes and groan and wait it out.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Letterman:\u003cbr /\u003e Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the Earth. Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always has a bad haircut.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDirections:\u003cbr /\u003e If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings, she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions. Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. Men will never stop and ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, \"Looks like I\u0027\u0027ve found a new way to get there.\" and, \"I know I\u0027\u0027m in the general neighborhood. I recognize that 7-11 store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eDressing Up:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for: weddings, funerals.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eEating out:\u003cbr /\u003e When the check comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it\u0027\u0027s only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller, and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their check, out come the pocket calculators.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGarages:\u003cbr /\u003e Women use garages to park their cars and store their lawnmowers. Men use garages for many things. They hang license plates in garages, they watch TV in garages, and they build useless lopsided benches in garages.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eGoing Out:\u003cbr /\u003e When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out.

A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reached the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter that the Clampett\u0027\u0027s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHandwriting:\u003cbr /\u003e To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken- scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their \"i\u0027\u0027s\" with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their \"p\u0027\u0027s\" and \"g\u0027\u0027s\". It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she\u0027\u0027s dumping you, she\u0027\u0027ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHats:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eJewelry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that\u0027\u0027s it. Any more than that, and he will look like a lounge singer named Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLaundry:\u003cbr /\u003e Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul, and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of \"Love, American Style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLeg Warmers:\u003cbr /\u003e Leg warmers are sexy. A woman, even if she\u0027\u0027s walking the dog or doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers. She can wear them any time she wants. A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the \"Gimme the Ball\" number in \"A Chorus Line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLocker Rooms:\u003cbr /\u003e In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don\u0027\u0027t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one thing in the locker room, sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLow Blows:\u003cbr /\u003e Let\u0027\u0027s say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says \"Oh, gee. That must have hurt.\" The man groans and doubles over, and actually *feels* the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMagazines:\u003cbr /\u003e Men\u0027\u0027s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women\u0027\u0027s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman\u0027\u0027s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMaturity:\u003cbr /\u003e Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMenopause:\u003cbr /\u003e When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree ofthese changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction; he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather drivin gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMirrors:\u003cbr /\u003e Men are vain; they will always check themselves out in a mirror.  Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe Garagiola\u0027\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMoustaches:\u003cbr /\u003e Some men look good with moustaches. Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. There are no women who look good with moustaches.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMovies:\u003cbr /\u003e Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.  This is because most movies in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh\u003cbr /\u003e for the first time in \"Gone With the Wind\". For men, it\u0027\u0027s when Jimmy Cagney shoves grapefruit in May Clark\u0027\u0027s face in \"Public Enemy\".\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNicknames:\u003cbr /\u003e With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like \"Ultimate Pecs\" and \"Big Turk,\" women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dave, Rob, and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eOffspring:\u003cbr /\u003e Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePlants:\u003cbr /\u003e A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePolitics:\u003cbr /\u003e Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such as voting. Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy\u0027\u0027s is growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign for them and cry on election night.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRestrooms:\u003cbr /\u003e Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms associal lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other. Womenwho\u0027\u0027ve never met will leave a restroom giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, \"Hey, Bob, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis difference may be due to the fact that women don\u0027\u0027t have to hold their genitals in the bathroom, which might make one feel self-conscious. Not having this problem, women can chat away quite comfortably while \"powdering their noses\". And yes, they are talking about men in their chats.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnother theory is that when women \"powder their noses\", all they have to do is sit there. What else is there for them to do but talk to other women. Men, however, must be much more attentive to such matters. If a male turns too much to talk to someone, he\u0027\u0027ll be leaking on his shoe. Men must be very serious and patient because heaven only knows if the stream of urine will suddenly change direction. And after all is done, men must try to remove any excess moisture unless he soils his underwear. And unlike women, there is no tissue paper nearby with which to wipe. A man must use his own skills at \"towel snapping\" to do the job. But no man wants to shake it forever because he might look like he\u0027\u0027s playing with himself. The shaking routine also varies culturally as most men inthe U.K. are \u0027\u0027pullers\u0027\u0027 as opposed to \u0027\u0027shakers\u0027\u0027. Of course, no matter how much a man shakes or pulls, chances are still good that he\u0027\u0027ll get that little dribble down the leg, which will expand to the size of Lake Ontario if he is wearing synthetics.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the shaking or pulling comes the tucking-it-all-back-in routine, where the male tries to not leave anything delicate in the path of the approaching zipper. As the men are all leaving the restroom, trying to button up their Levi\u0027\u0027s, they are still trying not to look as if they\u0027\u0027re playing with themselves. For a man, a trip to the bathroom is a very serious matter. You wouldn\u0027\u0027t gossip and chatter at a board meeting would you?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eFor the male, there are also the considerations like seeing how far up the trough he can pee, bombing the cigarette butt, peeling off the killer fart that he didn\u0027\u0027t want to loose off at the bar and, his favorite, making that grunt/sigh noise as the first gush lets go, sort of a \"Nnnngwwwwwaaaaa\". Actually, that\u0027\u0027s about the time the first fart goes too.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Gere:\u003cbr /\u003e Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMadonna:\u003cbr /\u003e Same as above, but reversed.  Same reason.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSex:\u003cbr /\u003e Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of\u003cbr /\u003e foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eShoes:\u003cbr /\u003e When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip on Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes all day.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSocks:\u003cbr /\u003e Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks. Socks that are cut way below the ankles, that have pictures of clouds on them, that have a big fuzzy ball on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSports Arenas:\u003cbr /\u003e Simply put, men can always find their way around stadiums and arenas. The women usually end up following men.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eTelephone:\u003cbr /\u003e Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eToys:\u003cbr /\u003e Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of men\u0027\u0027s toys: little miniature TV\u0027\u0027s, car phones, complicated juicers and blenders, graphic equalizers, small robots that serve cocktails on command, video games, anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least 6 \"D\" batteries to operate. However, the only toys women still keep around when they grow up still require batteries, only few in number and smaller in size.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eUnderwear:\u003cbr /\u003e Colored underwear.

Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around; just so I\u0027\u0027ll make sure I hit something. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eYou see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men\u0027\u0027s penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I\u0027\u0027m telling \u0027\u0027ya those little buggers can\u0027\u0027t be trusted. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I\u0027\u0027m no longer allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee-soaked toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my sleep. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow another thing us guys don\u0027\u0027t usually like to talk about, but because you and I have become such good friends and you think I\u0027\u0027m a classy guy, I might as well be candid with you because it\u0027\u0027s a real problem, and you ladies need to be understanding. It\u0027\u0027s the dreaded \"morning wood\". Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can\u0027\u0027t get that thing to bend, and if it won\u0027\u0027t bend you can\u0027\u0027t aim, well hell, if you can\u0027\u0027t aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wall paper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet. And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seatcovers, the friggin\u0027\u0027 toilet seat won\u0027\u0027t stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control our less-than-perfect aim. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow sometimes, when you\u0027\u0027re newly married, (and I know the guys! in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it\u0027\u0027s just not safe. I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her...look, it won\u0027\u0027t bend. She said, \"so sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time.\" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with \"morning wood\". Well it\u0027\u0027s is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee, the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet. I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it\u0027\u0027s the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee. So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027\u0027s not our fault, it\u0027\u0027s just Mother Nature.

A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I\u0027\u0027m telling you those little buggers can\u0027\u0027t be trusted.Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can\u0027\u0027t get that thing to bend, and if it won\u0027\u0027t bend, you can\u0027\u0027t aim, well hell, if you can\u0027\u0027t aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wall paper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet.And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the frigging toilet seat won\u0027\u0027t stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control our less than perfect aim.Now sometimes, when you\u0027\u0027re newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it\u0027\u0027s just not safe.I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her... look, it won\u0027\u0027t bend. She said, \"so sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time.\" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with \"morning wood.\" Well, it\u0027\u0027s is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room.Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee, the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet. I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position -- lying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it\u0027\u0027s the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee.","yo mammas so fat she sat on Walmart and lowerd all the prices.","What does a smart blonde have in common with UFOs?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eWe keep hearing about them, but we never see any.","WORDS OF THE WISE1.

Being guys, of course they pressed on even when road conditions were totally white-out, and they ended up in a ditch.  Try as they might, they couldn\u0027\u0027t get the car un-stuck.   One of the travelers spotted a light on the hill next to the road and said, \u0027\u0027That looks like a farm up there, lets go up and see if we can get out of this blizzard.\u0027\u0027 The other guy agrees and up the hill they go. When they got to the farm they found the occupant was  a real nice lady and they asked if they can stay in  the barn until the storm blows over, and they can  dig their car out.   The lady invites them in and makes them some hot coffee, as clearly they\u0027\u0027re very chilled.. During the conversation over the warm brew, they learn that she is a widow, living alone.After several cups of coffee, she announces that she sees no reason for such nice guys to sleep in the barn when she has this big empty comfortable 4 bedroom house and it won\u0027\u0027t be necessary for them to stay in the barn as there is plenty of room in the house.After some more pleasant conversation everyone turns in.

Sometimes, when I\u0027\u0027m trying to remember something important like whether my wife told me to get tuna packed in oil or tuna packed in water, Vaughan and Crashaw just pop up in my mind, right there in the supermarket. It\u0027\u0027s a terrible waste of brain cells.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you\u0027\u0027ve been in college for a year or so, you\u0027\u0027re supposed to choose a major, which is the subject you intend to memorize and forget the most things about. Here is a very important piece of advice: Be sure to choose a major that does not involve Known Facts and Right Answers.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis means you must *not* major in mathematics, physics, biology, or chemistry, because these subjects involve actual facts. If, for example, you major in mathematics, you\u0027\u0027re going to wander into class one day and the professor will say: \"Define the cosine integer of the quadrant of a rhomboid binary axis, and extrapolate your result to five significant vertices.\" If you don\u0027\u0027t come up with exactly the answer the professor has in mind, you fail. The same is true of chemistry: if you write in your exam book that carbon and hydrogen combine to form oak, your professor will flunk you. He wants you to come up with the same answer he and all the other chemists have agreed on. Scientists are extremely snotty about this.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSo you should major in subjects like English, philosophy, psychology, and sociology -- subjects in which nobody really understands what anybody else is talking about, and which involve virtually no actual facts. I attended classes in all these subjects, so I\u0027\u0027ll give you a quick overview of each:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eENGLISH: This involves writing papers about long books you have read little snippets of just before class. Here is a tip on how to get good grades on your English papers: Never say anything about a book that anybody with any common sense would say. For example, suppose you are studying Moby Dick. Anybody with any common sense would say that Moby Dick is a big white whale, since the characters in the book refer to it as a big white whale roughly eleven thousand times. So in your paper, you say Moby Dick is actually the Republic of Ireland. Your professor, who is sick to death of reading papers and never liked Moby-Dick anyway, will think you are enormously creative. If you can regularly come up with lunatic interpretations of simple stories, you should major in English.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePHILOSOPHY: Basically, this involves sitting in a room and deciding there is no such thing as reality and then going to lunch. You should major in philosophy if you plan to take a lot of drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003ePSYCHOLOGY: This involves talking about rats and dreams. Psychologists are *obsessed* with rats and dreams. I once spent an entire semester training a rat to punch little buttons in a certain sequence, then training my roommate to do the same thing. The rat learned much faster. My roommate is now a doctor. If you like rats or dreams, and above all if you dream about rats, you should major in psychology.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSOCIOLOGY: For sheer lack of intelligibility, sociology is far and away the number one subject. I sat through hundreds of hours of sociology courses, and read gobs of sociology writing, and I never once heard or read a coherent statement. This is because sociologists want to be considered scientists, so they spend most of their time translating simple, obvious observations into  scientific-sounding code. If you plan to major in sociology, you\u0027\u0027ll have to learn to do the same thing. For example, suppose you have observed that children cry when they fall down. You should write: \"Methodological observation of the sociometrical behavior tendencies of prematurated isolates indicates that a casual relationship exists between groundward tropism and lachrimatory, or \u0027\u0027crying,\u0027\u0027 behavior forms.\" If you can keep this up for fifty or sixty pages, you will get a large government grant.","Your momma is so fat that when she wears a yellow dress people yell \"TAXI,TAXI!\"","There was a guy walking down the street and he bumped into an old\u003cbr /\u003e buddy, Steve.

It had one question:  \"Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or\u003cbr /\u003e endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof.\"\u003cbr /\u003e Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle\u0027\u0027s Law (gas\u003cbr /\u003e cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant.\u003cbr /\u003e One student, however, wrote the following:\u003cbr /\u003e \"First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need\u003cbr /\u003e to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.\u003cbr /\u003e I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not\u003cbr /\u003e leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell,\u003cbr /\u003e let\u0027\u0027s look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of\u003cbr /\u003e these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will\u003cbr /\u003e go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do\u003cbr /\u003e not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all\u003cbr /\u003e souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the\u003cbr /\u003e number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of\u003cbr /\u003e change of the volume in Hell because Boyle\u0027\u0027s Law states that in order for the\u003cbr /\u003e temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to\u003cbr /\u003e expand as souls are added.\u003cbr /\u003e This gives two possibilities:\u003cbr /\u003e 1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter\u003cbr /\u003e Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell\u003cbr /\u003e breaks loose.\u003cbr /\u003e 2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls\u003cbr /\u003e in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.\u003cbr /\u003e So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan\u003cbr /\u003e during my Freshman year, \u0027\u0027That it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep\u003cbr /\u003e with you,\u0027\u0027 and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in\u003cbr /\u003e having sexual relations with her, then 2 cannot be true, and so Hell is\u003cbr /\u003e exothermic.\"\u003cbr /\u003e This student got the only A.","Your momma is so fat she took you to the zoo and a little kid tried to feed her a peanut.","While nursing a drink at a bar, a young woman was distressed to see a drunken unkept man sit down next to her. \"Say, honey-baby ...

BOEING MANAGED FRIENDSHIP Welcome to Boeing Managed Friendship, a whole new way of thinking about friends and relationships at work. With all the recent mergers and buyouts, it is difficult for most people to determine who their real friends are anymore. The Managed Friendship Plan (MFP) combines all the advantages of a traditional friendship network with company-approved representation and important cost-saving features. How Does It Work? Under the Plan, you choose your friends from a network of pre-screened accredited Friendship Providers (FPs). All your friendship needs are met by members of your Managed Friendship Staff. What\u0027\u0027s Wrong with my Current Friends? If you\u0027\u0027re like most people, you are receiving friendship services from a network of friendship providers haphazardly patched together from your old neighborhoods, jobs, and schools. The result is often costly duplication, inefficiency, and conflict. Many of your current friends may not meet national standards, responding to your needs with inappropriate, outmoded, or even experimental acts of friendship. Under Managed Friendship, your friendship needs are coordinated by your designated Best Friend, who will ensure the quality and goodness of fit of all your friendly relationships. How Do I Know That the Plan\u0027\u0027s Panel of Friends Is Not Made Up of a Bunch of Losers Who Can\u0027\u0027t Make Friends on Their Own? Many of today\u0027\u0027s most dedicated and highly trained Friendship Providers are as concerned as we are about delivering Quality Friendship in a cost-effective manner. They have joined our network because they want to focus on acting like a friend rather than doing the paperwork and paying the high bad-friendship premiums that have caused the cost of traditional friendship to skyrocket. Our Friendship Providers have met our rigorous standards of companionship and loyalty. What If I Need a Special Friend, Say, for Poker or Fishing? Special Friends are responsible for most of the unnecessary and expensive activities that burden already costly relationships. Under the Managed Friendship Plan, your Best Friend is qualified to pre-approve your referral to a Special Friend within the Managed Friendship Network should your needs fall outside of the scope of his/her friendship. Suppose I Want to See Friends Outside the Managed Friendship Network? You may make friends outside of the Managed Friendship Network only in the event of a Friendship Emergency. What is a Friendship Emergency? The Managed Friendship Plan covers your friendship needs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, even if you need a friend out of town, after regular business hours, or when your Best Friend is with someone else. You might be on a business trip, for instance, and suddenly find that you feel lonely. In such cases, you may make a New Friend, and all approved friendly activities will be covered under the Plan, provided you notify the Managed Friendship Office (our 24-hour Friendship Hotline) within two business days. What Friendly Activities Are Covered Under the Plan?  Friendly Activities that are typically covered include: - - Agreeing with you - Appearing sympathetic - Chewing the fat - Dropping by - Feeling your pain - Gossiping - Hanging out - Holding your hand (up to 5 minutes per activity)* - Joshing - Kidding around - Listening to you whine - Partying - Passing the time - Patting your back - Ribbing - Sharing a meal - Shooting the breeze - Slinging the bull - Teasing *up to 15 minutes under the Premium Gold Friendship Plan What Friendly Activities are not covered by the plan? Activities that would not be pre-approved include (but are not limited to): - Bar hopping - Bending over backwards - Drinking to excess - Giving a hoot - Going the extra mile - Lending money - Real empathy - Sexual favors - Truly caring - Using illicit drugs How Can I Find Out More About the Managed Friendship Plan?

Drink: Blender Drinks Personality: Flaky, whiny, annoying; a pain in the buttocks. Your Approach: Avoid her, unless you want to be her cabin boy. Drink: Mixed Drinks Personality: Older, more refined, high maintenance, has very picky tastes; knows exactly what she wants. Your Approach: You won\u0027\u0027t have to approach her, if she is interested, she\u0027\u0027ll send YOU a drink. Drink: Wine - (does not include White Zinfandel, see below) Personality: Conservative and classy; sophisticated yet giggles. Your Approach: Tell her you love to travel and spend quiet evenings with friends. Drink: White Zinfandel Personality: Easy; thinks she is classy and sophisticated, actually has no clue. Your approach: Make her feel smarter than she is... this should be an easy target. Drink: Shots Personality: Likes to hang with frat-boy pals and looking to get totally drunk... and naked. Your Approach: Easiest hit in the joint. You have been blessed this evening. Nothing to do but wait. However, be careful not to make her mad! Then there is the MALE addendum. The deal with guys is, as always, very simple and clear cut: Domestic Beer: He\u0027\u0027s poor and wants to get laid. Imported Beer: He likes good beer and wants to get laid. Wine: He\u0027\u0027s hoping that the wine thing will give him a sophisticated image to help him get laid. Whiskey: He doesn\u0027\u0027t give a hoot about anything but getting laid. Tequila: He is thinking he has a chance with the toothless waitress.

And I will also mention this to YOUR friends. A lot. 5. After sex (which I will NEVER refer to as \"making love\"), I will not expect you to cuddle me for hours till your arm goes dead. Nor will I let my hair annoyingly get in your face. 6. I will never, ever give your penis a \"cute\" nickname. 7. In bed, I will be happy as can be to try any novel sexual position you fancy. Especially ones where I do all the work and you just lie there, grinning. 8. I will ruthlessly interrogate my attractive female friends and inform you if any of them have the slightest bisexual tendencies. Then I\u0027\u0027ll invite them around for dinner. And hide their car keys so they have to stay. 9. After we split up, I will never sleep with any of your friends or colleagues. Or anyone else you have ever met. Or may one day meet. And if men attempt to chat me up, I will solemnly inform them that you have \"ruined me for other men.\" 10. I understand that mechanical objects like cars, computers, and remote control devices are beyond the comprehension of women. I will only make a fool of myself if I attempt to operate them, so you\u0027\u0027re in charge of the lot. Except for the oven, iron and the washing machine, of course.

Avoiding her lips and diving straight for the erogenous zones makes her feel like you\u0027\u0027re paying by the hour and trying to get your money\u0027\u0027s worth by cutting out nonessentials. A properly passionate kiss is the ultimate form of foreplay. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e2) BLOWING TOO HARD IN HER EAR. Admit it, some kid at school told you girls love this. Well, there\u0027\u0027s a difference between being erotic and blowing as if you\u0027\u0027re trying to extinguish the candles on your 50th birthday cake. That hurts. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e3) NOT SHAVING. You often forget you have a porcupine strapped to your chin which you rake repeatedly across your partner\u0027\u0027s face and thighs. When she turns her head from side to side, it\u0027\u0027s not passion, it\u0027\u0027s avoidance. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e4) SQUEEZING HER BREAST. Most men act like a housewife testing a melon for ripeness when they get their hands on a pair. Stroke, caress, and smooth them. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e5) BITING HER NIPPLES. Why do men fasten onto a woman\u0027\u0027s nipples, then clamp down like they\u0027\u0027re trying to deflate her body via her breasts? Nipples are highly sensitive. They can\u0027\u0027t stand up to chewing. Lick and suck them gently. Flicking your tongue across them is good. Pretending they\u0027\u0027re a doggie toy isn\u0027\u0027t. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e6) TWIDDLING HER NIPPLES. Stop doing that thing where you twiddle the nipples between finger and thumb like you\u0027\u0027re trying to find a radio station in a hilly area. Focus on the whole breasts, not just the exclamation points. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e7) IGNORING THE OTHER PARTS OF HER BODY. A woman is not a highway with just three turnoffs: Breastville East and West, and the Midtown Tunnel. There are vast areas of her body which you\u0027\u0027ve ignored far too often as you go bombing straight into downtown Vagina. So start paying them some attention. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e8) GETTING THE HAND TRAPPED. Poor manual dexterity in the underskirt region can result in tangled fingers and underpants. If you\u0027\u0027re going to be that aggressive, just ask her to take the damn things off. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e9) LEAVING HER A LITTLE PRESENT. Condom disposal is the man\u0027\u0027s responsibility. You wore it, you store it. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e10) ATTACKING THE CLITORIS. Direct pressure is very unpleasant, so gently rotate your fingers along side of the clitoris. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e11) STOPPING FOR A BREAK. Women, unlike men, don\u0027\u0027t pick up where they left off. If you stop, they plummet back to square one very fast. If you can tell she\u0027\u0027s not there, keep going at all costs, numb jaw or not. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e12) UNDRESSING HER AWKWARDLY. Women hate looking stupid, but stupid she will look when naked at the waist with a sweater stuck over her head. Unwrap her like an elegant present, not a kid\u0027\u0027s toy. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e13) GIVING HER A WEDGIE DURING FOREPLAY. Stroking her gently through her panties can be very sexy. Pulling the material up between her thighs and yanking it back and forth is not. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e14) BEING OBSESSED WITH THE VAGINA. Although most men can find the clitoris without maps, they still believe that the vagina is where it\u0027\u0027s all at. No sooner is your hand down there than you\u0027\u0027re trying to stuff stolen banknotes up a chimney. This is okay in principle, but if you\u0027\u0027re not careful, it can hurt - so don\u0027\u0027t get carried away. It\u0027\u0027s best to pay more attention to her clitoris and the exterior of her vagina at first, then gently slip a finger inside her and see if she likes it. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e15) MASSAGING TOO ROUGHLY. You\u0027\u0027re attempting to give her a sensual, relaxing massage to get her in the mood. Hands and fingertips are okay; elbows and knees are not. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e16) UNDRESSING PREMATURELY. Don\u0027\u0027t force the issue by stripping before she\u0027\u0027s at least made some move toward getting your stuff off, even if it\u0027\u0027s just undoing a couple of buttons. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e17) TAKING YOUR PANTS OFF FIRST. A man in socks and underpants is the worst. Lose the socks fist. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e18) GOING TOO FAST. When you get to the penis-in-vagina situation, the worst thing you can do is pump away like an industrial power tool - she\u0027\u0027ll soon feel like an assembly-line worker made obsolete by your technology. Build up slowly, with clean, straight, regular thrusts. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e19) GOING TOO HARD. If you bash your great triangular hip bones into her thigh or stomach, the pain is equal to two weeks of horseback riding concentrated into a few seconds. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e20) COMING TOO SOON. Every man\u0027\u0027s fear. With reason. If you shoot before you see the whites of her eyes, make sure you have a backup plan to ensure her pleasure too. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e21) NOT COMING SOON ENOUGH. It may appear to you that humping for an hour without climaxing is the mark of a sex god, but to her it\u0027\u0027s more likely the mark of a numb vagina. At least buy some intriguing wall hangings, so she has something to hold her interest while you\u0027\u0027re playing Marathon Man. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e22) ASKING IF SHE HAS COME. You really ought to be able to tell. Most women make noise. But if you really don\u0027\u0027t know, don\u0027\u0027t ask. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e23) PERFORMING ORAL SEX TOO GENTLY. Don\u0027\u0027t act like a giant cat at a saucer of milk. Get your whole mouth down there, and concentrate on gently rotating or flicking your tongue on her clitoris. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e24) NUDGING HER HEAD DOWN. Men persist in doing this until she\u0027\u0027s eyeball-to-penis, hoping that it will lead very swiftly to mouth-to-penis. All women hate this. It\u0027\u0027s about three steps from being dragged to a cave by their hair. If you want her to use her mouth, use yours; try talking seductively to her. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e25) NOT WARNING HER BEFORE YOU CLIMAX. Sperm tastes like sea water mixed with egg white. Not everybody likes it. When she\u0027\u0027s performing oral sex, warn her before you come so she can do what\u0027\u0027s necessary. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e26) MOVING AROUND DURING FELLATIO. Don\u0027\u0027t thrust. She\u0027\u0027ll do all the moving during fellatio. You just lie there. And don\u0027\u0027t grab her head. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e27) TAKING ETTIQUETTE ADVISE FROM PORN MOVIES. In X-rated movies, women seem to love it when men ejaculate over them. In real life, it just means more laundry to do. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e28) MAKING HER RIDE ON TOP FOR AGES. Asking her to be on top is fine. Lying there grunting while she does all the hard work is not. Caress her gently, so that she doesn\u0027\u0027t feel quite so much like the captain of a schooner. And let her have a rest. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e29) ATTEMPTING ANAL SEX AND PRETENDING IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. This is how men earn a reputation for not being able to follow directions. If you want to put it there, ask her first. And don\u0027\u0027t think that being drunk is an excuse. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e30) TAKING PICTURES. When a man says, \"Can I take a photo of you?\" she\u0027\u0027ll hear the words \"__to show my buddies.\" At least let her have custody of them. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e31) NOT BEING IMAGINATIVE ENOUGH. Imagination is anything from drawing patterns on her back to pouring honey on her and licking it off. Fruit, vegetables, ice and feathers are all handy props; hot candle wax and permanent dye are a no no. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e32) SLAPPING YOUR STOMACH AGAINT HERS. There is no less erotic noise. It\u0027\u0027s as sexy as a belching contest. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e33) ARANGING HER IN STUPID POSES. If she wants to do advanced yoga in bed, fine, but unless she\u0027\u0027s a Romanian gymnast, don\u0027\u0027t get too ambitious. Ask yourself if you want a sexual partner with snapped hamstrings. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e34) LOOKING FOR HER PROSTATE. Read this carefully: Anal stimulation feels good for men because they have a prostate. Women don\u0027\u0027t. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e35) GIVING LOVE BITES. It is highly erotic to exert some gentle suction on the sides of the neck, if you do it carefully. No woman wants to have to wear turtlenecks and jaunty scarves for weeks on end. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e36) BARKING INSTRUCTIONS. Don\u0027\u0027t shout encouragement like a coach with a megaphone. It\u0027\u0027s not a big turn-on. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e37) TALKING DIRTY. It makes you sound like a lonely magazine editor calling a 1-900 line. If she likes nasty talk, she\u0027\u0027ll let you know. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e38) NOT CARING WHETHER SHE COMES. You have to finish the job. Keep on trying until you get it right, and she might even do the same for you. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e39) SQUASHING HER. Men generally weigh more than women, so if you lie on her a bit too heavily, she will turn blue. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e40) THANKING HER. Never thank a woman for having sex with you. Your bedroom is not a soup kitchen.","Take notes, all you Casanovas...\u003cbr /\u003e 1) NOT KISSING FIRST. Avoiding her lips and diving straight for the erogenous zones makes her feel like you\u0027\u0027re paying by the hour and trying to get your money\u0027\u0027s worth by cutting out nonessentials.

Get your whole mouth down there, and concentrate on gently rotating or flicking your tongue on her clitoris. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e24) NUDGING HER HEAD DOWN. Men persist in doing this until she\u0027\u0027s eyeball-to-penis, hoping that it will lead very swiftly to mouth-to-penis. All women hate this. It\u0027\u0027s about three steps from being dragged to a cave by their hair. If you want her to use her mouth, use yours; try talking seductively to her. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e25) NOT WARNING HER BEFORE YOU CLIMAX. Sperm tastes like sea water mixed with egg white. Not everybody likes it. When she\u0027\u0027s performing oral sex, warn her before you come so she can do what\u0027\u0027s necessary. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e26) MOVING AROUND DURING FELLATIO. Don\u0027\u0027t thrust. She\u0027\u0027ll do all the moving during fellatio. You just lie there. And don\u0027\u0027t grab her head. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e27) TAKING ETTIQUETTE ADVISE FROM PORN MOVIES. In X-rated movies, women seem to love it when men ejaculate over them. In real life, it just means more laundry to do. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e28) MAKING HER RIDE ON TOP FOR AGES. Asking her to be on top is fine. Lying there grunting while she does all the hard work is not. Caress her gently, so that she doesn\u0027\u0027t feel quite so much like the captain of a schooner. And let her have a rest. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e29) ATTEMPTING ANAL SEX AND PRETENDING IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. This is how men earn a reputation for not being able to follow directions. If you want to put it there, ask her first. And don\u0027\u0027t think that being drunk is an excuse. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e30) TAKING PICTURES. When a man says, \"Can I take a photo of you?\" she\u0027\u0027ll hear the words \"__to show my buddies.\" At least let her have custody of them. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e31) NOT BEING IMAGINATIVE ENOUGH. Imagination is anything from drawing patterns on her back to pouring honey on her and licking it off. Fruit, vegetables, ice and feathers are all handy props; hot candle wax and permanent dye are a no no. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e32) SLAPPING YOUR STOMACH AGAINT HERS. There is no less erotic noise. It\u0027\u0027s as sexy as a belching contest. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e33) ARANGING HER IN STUPID POSES. If she wants to do advanced yoga in bed, fine, but unless she\u0027\u0027s a Romanian gymnast, don\u0027\u0027t get too ambitious. Ask yourself if you want a sexual partner with snapped hamstrings. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e34) LOOKING FOR HER PROSTATE. Read this carefully: Anal stimulation feels good for men because they have a prostate. Women don\u0027\u0027t. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e35) GIVING LOVE BITES. It is highly erotic to exert some gentle suction on the sides of the neck, if you do it carefully. No woman wants to have to wear turtlenecks and jaunty scarves for weeks on end. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e36) BARKING INSTRUCTIONS. Don\u0027\u0027t shout encouragement like a coach with a megaphone. It\u0027\u0027s not a big turn-on. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e37) TALKING DIRTY. It makes you sound like a lonely magazine editor calling a 1-900 line. If she likes nasty talk, she\u0027\u0027ll let you know. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e38) NOT CARING WHETHER SHE COMES. You have to finish the job. Keep on trying until you get it right, and she might even do the same for you. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e39) SQUASHING HER. Men generally weigh more than women, so if you lie on her a bit too heavily, she will turn blue. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e40) THANKING HER. Never thank a woman for having sex with you. Your bedroom is not a soup kitchen.","An accountant decided to leave his wife one day.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHe left her a note saying:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear Jane, I am 54 years old and I have never done anything wild. So I\u0027\u0027m leaving you for an 18 year old blonde model.  We\u0027\u0027ll be staying at the Sheraton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eHe then packed his things and went there. When he arrived at the Sheraton, there was a message for him from his wife. It read:\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear John. I too am 54 years old. I have followed your example and am staying at the Hyatt with an 18 year old Italian hunk. And I\u0027\u0027m sure that you, as an accountant, will appreciate that 18 goes into 54 many many more times than 54 goes into 18!\""]}
