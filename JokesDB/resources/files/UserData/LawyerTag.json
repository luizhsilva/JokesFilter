A company president was trying to buy some land in Louisiana for a plant expansion, and he wanted to finance this new facility with a government loan. His lawyer filled out all the necessary forms and applications and sent them appropriately. The government reviewed his application and abstract and sent the following reply: \"We received today your letter enclosing application for your client supported by abstract of title. We have observed, however, that you have not traced the title previous to 1803, and before final approval, it will be necessary that the title be traced previous to that year. Yours truly, etc.\"As a result, the lawyer sent the following letter to the government:\"Gentlemen, your letter regarding title received. I note you wish said title to be claimed back further than I have done it. I was unaware that any educated man failed to know that Louisiana was purchased by the United States from France in 1803. The title of the land was acquired by France by right of conquest of Spain.  The land came into possession of Spain in 1492 by right of discovery by a Spanish-Portuguese sailor named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by Queen Isabella of Spain. The good queen, being a pious woman and careful about title, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope of Rome upon Columbus\u0027\u0027 voyage before she sold her jewels to help him. Now the Pope, as you know, is the emissary of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God. And God, it is commonly accepted, made the world.  Therefore, I believe it is safe to assume that He also made that part of the United States called Louisiana, and I hope to hell you\u0027\u0027re satisfied.\"","Q: How do you know when a lawyer is lying?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eA: When his lips are moving!","16\u0026gt; \"I\u0027\u0027m voting for Nader.

He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The title to the property dated backto 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down. After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following reply:\"Upon review of your letter adjoining your client\u0027\u0027s loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral proper back to 1803. Before final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin.\"Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows:\"Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been received. I notethat you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application. I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application. For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain. The land came into possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the then reigning monarch, Isabella. The good queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles, almost as much as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to fund Columbus\u0027\u0027 expedition. Now the Pope, as I\u0027\u0027m sure you know, is the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And God, it is commonly accepted, created this world. Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that He also made that part of the world called Louisiana. He, therefore, would be the owner of origin. I hope to you find His original claim to be satisfactory.Now, may we have the lousy loan?","The real estate boss got a hot new secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAfraid of sexual harrassment issues he held himself off for a week, but\u003cbr /\u003e finally overcome with lust, he decided to put some moves on her. \u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut within a few weeks, he is feeling displeased at the way she is working, not caring, coming to work late, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSo, he pulls her aside, and has a little talk with her.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, baby, we may have gone to bed together a few times, but who said you could start coming in late and slacking off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eLooking him in the eyes, she replied, \"My lawyer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eSubmitted by Curtis","One evening after attending the theater two gentlemen were walking down the street when they observed a well-dressed, attractive young lady walking just ahead of them.

The British? Yes, and keeping well abreast of the latest science, judging by a new exhibition of -- er -- underwear at London\u0027\u0027s Design Museum. Here, the nation famed for its reserve has raised its hem, offering a peep at sheepskin corsets, barely-there cashmere vests and a glow-in-the-dark bra.Should all the titillation prove too much, there\u0027\u0027s also a bra that detects a racing heartbeat and a pair of panties that protects against radiation. ``This exhibit is a compelling statement about British design -- but it\u0027\u0027s also quite saucy,\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027 said Dame Helena Kennedy, a leading lawyer and chairwoman of the British Council, which launched the show Wednesday.``The perception of British people as being strait-laced is no longer real,\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027 Kennedy said. To prove it, the displays are almost as provocative as the garments. Vivienne Westwood\u0027\u0027s blue sheepskin corset and ditzy, star-patterned mini-crinoline and Alexander McQueen\u0027\u0027s pink satin corset crusted with black Swarovski crystal are suspended inside giant inflatable women\u0027\u0027s legs in transparent plastic. Vacuum-packed thongs and Clements Ribeiro\u0027\u0027s red silk chiffon panties with polka dots hang from pegs on a washline. Near the entrance, a mannequin sprawls seductively on her back, a vision in pink fishnet stockings and the briefest green teddy and panties by the aptly named Agent Provocateur.And everywhere there are bras to make even 1950s ``sweater girl\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027 Lana Turner envious -- from Gossard\u0027\u0027s new padded Ultrabra Super Boost in patriotic red-white-and-blue, to Stella McCartney\u0027\u0027s tassels and gray beads, to Agent Provocateur\u0027\u0027s sliced-away style in sheer black net.For the traditionally minded, there are the more substantial constructions of Rigby and Peller (they put the foundation in foundation garments), suppliers of spine-stiffening unmentionables to the royal family since the 1960s. Owner June Kenton, personal bra fitter to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Mother Elizabeth, believes 80 percent of all women are wearing the wrong size bra ``and have two drawers-full of bras that they don\u0027\u0027t wear.\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027Rigby and Peller\u0027\u0027s offerings contrast with the futuristic Techno Bra, made of conductive textile with silicon gel inserts that contain electronic devices to detect heartbeat changes. A British industrial design company is developing the piece for the commercial market and designer Kirsty Falconer hopes it may one day incorporate a personal alarm that will sound if the wearer is attacked. Constructed in a dun-colored conductive nylon and silver fabric, the anti-radiation panties are no thing of beauty. But if, as their makers claim, they drain electricity from the body -- thereby protecting it from magnetic radiation -- can you afford to be without them? The exhibition runs through July 2, then tours Japan and Australia.","What do you say to a busload of lawyers crashing over a five hundred foot cliff?

Beelzebub has issued subpoenas to several angels who are rumoured to have acted as go-betweens in the affair.Critics have pointed out that these allegations have little to do with the charges that Beelzebub was originally appointed to investigate, that God had created large-scale flooding in order to cover up evidence of a failed land deal.In recent months, Beelzebub\u0027\u0027s investigation has already been expanded to cover questions surrounding the large number of locusts that plagued God\u0027\u0027s political opponents in the last election, as well as to claims that the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah was to divert attention away from a scandal involving whether the give-away of a parcel of public land in Promised County to a Jewish special interest group was quid pro quo for political contributions.If these allegations prove to be true, then this could be a huge blow to God\u0027\u0027s career, much of which has been spent crusading for stricter moral standards and harsher punishments for wrongdoers.

And that is why I am speaking to you tonight and not ducking questions while the Marine Band plays loudly and drowns out the media.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAs you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While I, a compulsive liar, deemed my answers legally accurate, I was not stupid enough to volunteer any information that might help prove what I did to Paula.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, since I got caught, I can see it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part to destroy all evidence linking me to the events, for which I am solely and completely responsible, but for which I refuse to apologize.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBut I told the grand jury today, and I say to you now, that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence, or to take any other unlawful action. I was a lawyer before becoming your President and I know better than to do these things. I have less important people to do these things whenever I indicate that I would like to see something go away.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression, and that is what I intended. How could I know this thing would spin out of control or that my spin doctors would be too worn out from the plethora of scandals to be effective.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that, because Hillary is a better lawyer and will clean me out in any divorce settlement.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI regret misleading my friends because most of them have evidence of other wrongdoing that may hurt me.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. I was also very concerned about protecting myself from my family.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that these questions were being asked in a politically inspired lawsuit about my tendency to expose my private parts to women, which my lies and obstruction of justice has since caused to be dismissed, was a consideration, too. I could not allow the truth to be known until after the statute of limitations expires.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, I had real and serious concerns about an independent counsel investigation that began with private business dealings 20 years ago. Dealings, I might add, about which an independent federal agency, staffed with my political appointees and friends, found none of the evidence of wrongdoing by me, or my wife, over two years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe independent counsel investigation has enough evidence of wrongdoing on my part to move on to my staff and friends, now into my private life with interns in the oval office. And now the investigation itself is under investigation, because my very large staff of lawyers found a gullible judge who is stupid enough to help me by requiring the independent counsel to prove he didn\u0027\u0027t leak the things that we leaked.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThis has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people, and is getting much to close to the evidence I have worked so hard to conceal. I call upon all of my friends in the sympathetic media to join with me in stopping this out-of-control situation before they get enough evidence to impeach me.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow, this matter is among me, the two people I love most -- my wife and our daughter -- and our God. I must put it right, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so. Even the bombing of terrorist camps that we have known about for ten years.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNothing is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim my family life for my family. It\u0027\u0027s nobody\u0027\u0027s business but ours, and the focus groups indicated that there were enough stupid people to believe this nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eEven presidents have private lives with interns in the oval office. It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into my sex addiction and get on with our national life.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eMy stonewalling and lying has caused this country to be distracted by this matter for too long, and I take my responsibility for my part in all of this, even though I did it because of Ken Starr. That is all I can get away with.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eNow it is time -- in fact, it is past time -- to move on. We have important work to do -- new women to seduce, new interns to chase, and real terrorist camps to bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so tonight, I ask you to turn away from the spectacle I have created for the past seven months by lying to the American People, to repair the fabric of our national discourse, to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next American century, and to help me shut down the independent counsel before he closes the trap on me in such a manner that I can no longer lie my way out of this mess.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for watching and good night.","A lawyer got married to a woman who had previously been married 12 times.

The manufacturer will not be responsible for any damages or inconveniences that may result.READ THIS BEFORE OPENING PACKAGE: According to certain suggested versions of the Grand Unified Theory, the primary particles constituting this product may decay to nothingness within the next four hundred million years.THIS IS A 100% MATTER PRODUCT: In the unlikely event that this merchandise should contact antimatter in any form, a catastrophic explosion will result.PUBLIC NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY LAW: Any use of this product, in any manner whatsoever, will increase the amount of disorder in the universe. Although no liability is implied herein, the consumer is warned that this process will ultimately lead to the heat death of the universe.NOTE: The most fundamental particles in this product are held together by a \"gluing\" force about which little is currently known and whose adhesive power can therefore not be permanently guaranteed.ATTENTION: Despite any other listing of product contents found hereon, the consumer is advised that, in actuality, this product consists of 99.9999999999% empty space.NEW GRAND UNIFIED THEORY DISCLAIMER: The manufacturer may technically be entitled to claim that this product is ten-dimensional. However, the consumer is reminded that this confers no legal rights above and beyond those applicable to three-dimensional objects, since the seven new dimensions are \"rolled up\" into such a small \"area\" that they cannot be detected.PLEASE NOTE: Some quantum physics theories suggest that when the consumer is not directly observing this product, it may cease to exist or will exist only in a vague and undetermined state.COMPONENT EQUIVALENCY NOTICE: The subatomic particles (electrons, protons, etc.) comprising this product are exactly the same in every measurable respect as those used in the products of other manufacturers, and no claim to the contrary may legitimately be expressed or implied.HEALTH WARNING: Care should be taken when lifting this product, since its mass, and thus its weight, is dependent on its velocity relative to the user.IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PURCHASERS: The entire physical universe, including this product, may one day collapse back into an infinitesimally small space.

One dog belonged to a doctor. One dog belonged to an engineer. And, one dog belonged to a lawyer. For the finals each dog was given a bag of bones to see what it could make. The doctor said, \"Stethascope, go!\" The dog built a human skeleton. The judges were ready to award the trophy right then. But, they decided to give the other dogs a try. The engineer said, \"Slide-rule, go!\" (So, its an old joke.) The dog built a suspension bridge. The judges were beside themselves. Which dog would they pick? The lawyer said.\"Loop-hole, go!\" The dog ate the bones, got a percentage of all the tolls from the bridge and screwed the other two dogs.","This one big lawyer from the city decided to take time away from his busy day and went out to the farm and shot a duck.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eThe farmer walks out Of his building upon hearing the shot and screams at the city guy - \"HEY You Cant shoot that duck on my property.

The physician said, \"Remember, on the sixth day God took a rib from Adam and fashioned Eve, making him the first surgeon. Therefore, medicine is the oldest profession.\"The engineer replied, \"But, before that, God created the heavens and earth from chaos and confusion, and thus he was the first engineer.
