[She spent the first day packing her belongings into boxes, crates and suitcases. </p>\n<p>On the second day, she had the movers come and collect her things. </p>\n<p>On the third day, she sat down for the last time at their beautiful dining room table by candlelight, put on some soft background music and feasted on a pound of shrimp, a jar of caviar and a bottle of Chardonnay.. </p>\n<p>When she had finished, she went into each and every room and deposited a few half-eaten shrimp shells dipped in caviar, into the hollow of the curtain rods. She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. </p>\n<p>When the husband returned with his new girlfriend, all was bliss for the first few days. Then slowly, the house began to smell. They tried everything; cleaning, mopping and airing the place out. Vents were checked for dead rodents and carpets were steam cleaned. Air fresheners were hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in to set off gas canisters, during which they had to move out for a few days, and in the end they even paid to replace the expensive wool carpeting. </p>\n<p>Nothing worked. People stopped coming over to visit. Repairmen refused to work in the house. The maid quit. </p>\n<p>Finally, they could not take the stench any longer and decided to move.  A month later, even though they had cut their price in half, they could not find a buyer for their stinky house. Word got out and eventually even the local realtors refused to return their calls. Finally, they had to borrow a huge sum of money from the bank to purchase a new place. </p>\n<p>The ex-wife called the man and asked how things were going. He told her the saga of the rotting house. She listened politely and said that she missed her old home terribly, and would be ! willing to reduce her divorce settlement in exchange for getting the house back. Knowing his ex-wife had no idea how bad the smell was, he agreed on price that was about 1/10th of what the house had been worth, but only if she were to sign the papers that very day. She agreed and within the hour his lawyers delivered the paperwork. </p>\n<p>A week later the man and his girlfriend stood smiling as they watched the moving company pack everything to take to their new home, including the curtain rods.]

[One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend<br /> suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything<br /> quicker and cheaper than a doctor.<br /> ''''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your<br /> problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10." Bill figured<br /> he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the<br /> drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.<br /> The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.<br /> After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: "You<br /> have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be<br /> better in two weeks."<br /> Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how<br /> it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine<br /> could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog<br /> and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into<br /> the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in<br /> the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and<br /> printed out the following message:<br /> "Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him<br /> vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren''t yours. Get a lawyer.

[An elderly woman walked into the main office of Chase Manhattan<br /> Bank building, holding a large paper bag in her hand. She told<br /> the young man at the teller''s window that she wished to deposit<br /> the $3 million in the bag and open an account at the bank. She<br /> said that first, though, she wished to meet the president of the<br /> bank due to the amount of money involved. The teller thought<br /> that to be a reasonable request, and, after opening the bag and<br /> seeing bundles of $1000 bills, which amounted to approximately<br /> $3,000,000, telephoned the bank president''s secretary for an<br /> appointment for the lady.</p>\n<p>The woman was escorted upstairs and ushered into the president''s<br /> office. Introductions were made, and she stated that she liked<br /> to get to know people she did business with on a more personal<br /> basis. The president then asked her how she came into such a<br /> large sum of cash. "Was it inherited?" he asked. "No," she<br /> replied. He was quiet for several seconds, trying to think of<br /> where this elderly lady could possibly have come into $3 million.</p>\n<p>"I bet," she offered. "As in horses?". "No," she replied, "as in<br /> people". Seeing his confusion, she explained that she just bet<br /> on different things with people. Suddenly, she said, "I''ll bet<br /> you 25,000 that by 10 o''clock tomorrow morning your balls will<br /> be square."</p>\n<p>The bank president figured she must be off her rocker and<br /> decided to take her up on the bet.

There was no change in his<br /> scrotal appearance. He looked the same as always. He went to his<br /> office and waited for the woman to come in at 10AM, humming as<br /> he went. He knew this was his lucky day. How often did he get<br /> handed $25,000 for doing nothing?</p>\n<p>At 10 o''clock sharp, the woman was shown into his office. With<br /> her was a man. When the bank president asked her what the other<br /> man was with her for, she informed the president that he was her<br /> lawyer and she always took him along when there was this much<br /> money involved in her betting.</p>\n<p>"Well," she asked, "what about our bet?" "I don''t know how to<br /> tell you this," he said, "but I''m the same as I''ve always been,<br /> only $25,000 richer." The old lady asked him to drop his pants<br /> so they could all see. The president complied. The old lady<br /> peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel<br /> them. "Well, okay," said the president, "$25,000 is a lot of<br /> money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure." Just then, he<br /> noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the<br /> wall. The president asked the old lady, "What''s wrong with him?"<br /> She replied, "Nothing, except that I bet him $100,000 that by<br /> 10am today I''d have the Chase Manhattan Bank''s president''s balls<br /> in my hand."]

[Some years ago, a New Orleans lawyer sought a direct Veterans Administration loan for a client. He was told that the loan would be approved if he could provide proof of clear title to the property offered as collateral. </p>\n<p>The title for the property in question was complicated and he spent a considerable amount of time reviewing all pertinent documents back to 1803. Satisfied with the depth and expanse of his examination, he submitted the information to the VA. </p>\n<p>He soon received a reply from the VA.: "We received your letter today enclosing application for a loan for your client, supported by abstract of title. The application forms are complete, but you have not cleared the title before the year 1803. Therefore, before full review and possible approval can a be accorded the application, it will be necessary that the title be cleared back before that year." </p>\n<p>Annoyed, the lawyer wrote the V.A.: "Your letter regarding titles in case #9378329 received. I note that you wish titles extended further back than I have presented. Your attention is invited to the following information to update your records for the property prior to 1803: </p>\n<p>a) I was unaware that any educated person would not know that the United States gained clear title to Louisiana from France in 1803. This title transfer was a result of a real estate transaction known as The Louisiana Purchase. </p>\n<p>b) France gained clear title to Louisiana by right of conquest from Spain under the Treaty of San Ildefonso (1800). </p>\n<p>c) The land came into the possession of Spain by right of discovery in 1492 by a sailor named Christopher Columbus. He was acting on behalf of Isabella, Queen of Spain, and had her permission to claim newly discovered lands for Spain. </p>\n<p>d) The good Queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles - almost as careful as the V.A.- took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before authorizing the voyage. </p>\n<p>e) The Pope is a servant of God; God created the world. </p>\n<p>f) Therefore, I believe that it is safe to presume that God created title that part of the world called Louisiana and thus was the original holder of the property in question.]

[A little old lady walked into the head branch of the Chase Manhattan<br /> Bank holding a large paper bag in her hand.  She told the young man<br /> at the window that she wished to take the 3 million she had in the<br /> bag and open an account with the bank.  She said that first, though,<br /> she wished to meet the president of Chase Manhattan Bank due to the<br /> amount of money involved.</p>\n<p>The teller seemed to think that was a reasonable request and after<br /> opening the paper bag and seeing the bundles of 1,000 bills which<br /> amounted to right around 3 million, telephoned the bank''s secretary<br /> to obtain an appointment for the lady.</p>\n<p>The lady was escorted upstairs and ushered into the president''s<br /> office.  Introductions were made and she stated that she would like<br /> to get to know the people she did business with on a more personal<br /> level.  The bank president then asked her where she came into such a<br /> large amount of money. "Was it an inheritance?" he asked. "No." she<br /> answered.  "Was it from playing the stock market?"  "No." she<br /> replied.</p>\n<p>He was quiet for a minute, trying to think of where this little old<br /> lady could possibly come into 3 million.  "I bet." she stated.  "You<br /> bet?" repeated the bank president.  "As in horses?"  "No." she<br /> replied, "I bet people."</p>\n<p>Seeing his confusion, she explained that she justs bets on different<br /> things with different people.  All of a sudden she said, "I''ll bet<br /> you $25,<br /> 000.00 that by 10:00 o''clock tomorrow morning, your balls will be<br /> square."</p>\n<p>The bank president figured she must be off her rocker and decided to<br /> take her up on the bet.  He didn''t see how he could lose.  For the<br /> rest of the day, the bank president was very careful.  He decided to<br /> stay home that evening and take no chances; there was $25,<br /> 000.00 at stake.</p>\n<p>When he got up in the morning and took his shower, he checked to<br /> make sure everything was okay.  There was no difference- he looked<br /> the same as he always had.  He went to work and waited for the<br /> little old lady to come in at 10:00 o''clock, humming as he went.  He<br /> knew this would be a good day- how often do you get handed $25,<br /> 000.00 for doing nothing.  At 10:00 o''clock sharp the little old<br /> lady was shown into his office.  With her was a younger man. When he<br /> inquired as to the man''s purpose for being there, she informed him<br /> that he was her lawyer and she always took him along when there was<br /> this much money involved.</p>\n<p>"Well," she asked, "what about our bet?"  "I don''t know how to tell<br /> you this," he replied, "but I am the same as I''ve always been only<br /> $25,<br /> 000.00 richer."  The lady seemed to accept this, but requested that<br /> she be able to see for herself.  The bank president thought this was<br /> reasonable and dropped his trousers. She instructed him to bend over<br /> and then grabbed a hold of him.  Sure enough, everything was fine.<br /> The bank president then looked up and saw her lawyer standing across<br /> the room banging his head against the wall.</p>\n<p>"What'' wrong with him?" he inquired.  "Oh him,"  she replied, "I bet<br /> him $100,<br /> 000.00 that by 10:00 o''clock this morning that I''d have the<br /> president of Chase Manhattan Bank by the balls."]

[A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA loan for a client. He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The title to the property dated backto 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down. After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following reply:"Upon review of your letter adjoining your client''s loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral proper back to 1803. Before final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin."Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows:"Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been received. I notethat you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application. I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application. For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain. The land came into possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the then reigning monarch, Isabella. The good queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles, almost as much as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to fund Columbus'' expedition. Now the Pope, as I''m sure you know, is the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And God, it is commonly accepted, created this world. Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that He also made that part of the world called Louisiana. He, therefore, would be the owner of origin. I hope to you find His original claim to be satisfactory.Now, may we have the lousy loan?]

[A man walked into a curio shop and began to browse. He was attracted to a brass rat on a shelf behind the counter. He asked the shopkeeper for a price, and was told to make an offer. Presently they agreed on a price, and the brass rat changed hands. The shopkeeper warned the customer as he took the money, "This sale is final. If you leave the shop with the brass rat, I won''t take it back under any circumstances." The customer agreed and left with the rat. As he walked home, he noticed that a live rat came scurrying out of an alley and began to follow him. Soon there were more, all following him and milling bout his feet. The man began to run, but the rats kept up, and more joined the procession. After a few minutes, thousands of rats were chasing after the man.

[Scott Hanson is a news reporter and anchor with WESH-Channel 2 in Orlando.</p>\n<p>My father died on Jan 02, 1995. He left no forwarding address.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it fell to me to collect his mail. I didn''t expect much really, since my sisters and I had been careful to notify his bank, insurance agent and a host of other businesses that one of their customers was no more. You would think a death notice would cut down on the amount of correspondence from those firms. Quite the contrary. Instead -- for months, mind you -- my deceased father continued to receive mail from companies that had been told of his passing but<br /> pressed on, determined to con tact him anyway. The first to hope for a reply from beyond the grave was my father''s bank.</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Our records indicate payment is due for overdraft protection on your checking account. Efforts to contact you have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, we are automatically withdrawing your monthly $28.00 service charge from you account. Please adjust your records accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> The Phoenix Branch</p>\n<p>Dear Phoenix Branch,<br /> This is to notify you once again that Mr. Hanson died Jan 02, 1995. It is therefore unlikely he will be overdrawing his account. Please close his account, and adjust your books accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>\n<p>Later that same week, I receive this note from Dad''s insurance company. Again, this is a firm that had been told in no uncertain terms of his death.</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> It''s time to renew your auto insurance policy! To continue your coverage, you must send $54.17 to this office immediately. Failure to do so will result in the cancellation of your policy, and interruption of your coverage.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Insurance Agent</p>\n<p>Dear Insurance Agent,<br /> This is to remind you that Mr. Hanson has been dead since January. As such, the odds he''ll be involved in a collision are quite minimal. Please cancel the policy, and adjust your books<br /> accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson.</p>\n<p>The next day, I went to my mailbox to find this:</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Let me introduce myself. I am a psychic reader, and it is very important that you contact me immediately. I sense that you are about to enter a time of unprecedented financial prosperity. Please call the enclosed 900 number immediately, so I can tell you how best to take full advantage of the opportunities that are coming your way.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Psychic Reader</p>\n<p>Dear Psychic Reader,<br /> My father regrets he will be unable to call you 900 number. As a psychic reader, I''m sure you already know my father is dead, and had been for more than three weeks when you mailed your letter to him. I sense my father would be more than happy to take you up on your offer of a psychic reading, should you care to meet with him personally.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson<br /> P.S. Should you be in contact with my father in the future, please ask him if he''d like to renew his car insurance.</p>\n<p>A few months of calm passed, and then these arrived:</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Our records indicate a balance of $112 has accrued for overdraft protection on your checking account.

We appreciate your business and look forward to serving all of your future borrowing needs.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Bank''s San Diego District Office</p>\n<p>Dear San Diego District Office, I am writing to you for the third time now to tell you my father died in January. Since then, the number of checks he''s written has dropped dramatically. Being dead, he has no plans to use his overdraft protection or pay even the minimum amount due for a service he no longer needs. As for future borrowing needs, well, don''t hold your breath.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Records show you owe a balance of $54.17 to your insurance agent. Efforts to contact you have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, the matter has been turned over to us for collection. Please remit the amount of $54.17 to our office or we will be forced to take legal action to collect the debt.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Insurance Agent''s Collection Agency</p>\n<p>Dear Collection Agency,<br /> I told your client. Now I''m telling you. Dad''s dead. He doesn''t need insurance. He''s dead. Dead, dead, dead. I doubt even your lawyers can change that. Please adjust your books accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>\n<p>A few more months, and:</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Our records show an unpaid balance of $224 has accrued for overdraft protection on your checking account. Our efforts to contact you have proven unsuccessful. Please remit the amount in full to this office, or the matter will be turned over to a collection agency. Such action will adversely affect your credit history.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Bank''s Los Angeles Regional Office</p>\n<p>Dear Los Angeles Regional Office,<br /> I am writing for the fourth time to the fourth person at the fourth address to tell your bank that my father passed away in January. Since that time, I''ve watched with a mixture of amazement and amusement as your bank continues to transact business with him. Now, you are even threatening his credit history. It should come as no surprise that you have received little response from my deceased father. It should also be small news that his credit history is of minor importance to him now. For the fourth and final time, please adjust your books accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> This is your final notice of payment due to your insurance agent. If our firm does not receive payment of $54.17, we will commence legal action on the matter. Please contact us at once.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Insurance Agent''s Collection Agency</p>\n<p>Dear Insurance Agent''s Collection Agency, You may contact my father via the enclosed 900 number.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>\n<p>It has now been a couple of months since I''ve heard from these firms. Either the people writing these letters finally believe my father is Dead, or they themselves have died and are now receiving similar correspondence. Actually, there has been a lesson in these letters. Any one of them would be cause for great worry, if sent to a living person. The dead are immune from corporate bullying. There''s nothing like dying to put business correspondence in its proper perspective. Perhaps that''s the best reason not to fear death. There''s no post office there.</p>\n<p>By Scott Hanson, from the Orlando Sentinel Star newspaper]

[Looking for savings this holiday season? When you''re out shopping, take<br /> advantage of the George W. Bush discount. You will need unmitigated gall and<br /> several accomplices. Here''s how it works. </p>\n<p>Load up with all sorts of items that you want and take them to the checkout.<br /> When the clerk gets to an item that will not scan on the first attempt say,<br /> petulantly, "My brother says that all these items are mine." The clerk will<br /> insist on rescanning the item. Look bored and incredulous that anybody could be<br /> so incompetent as the clerk tries unsuccessfully to scan the item. Turn to the<br /> people in line behind you and say, "Can you believe this is taking so long?" </p>\n<p>At this point, the clerk will attempt to enter the bar code information by<br /> hand. Insist loudly that the item is yours and that since it didn''t scan after<br /> two attempts, it must be free. Get so worked up that your face starts to break<br /> out. The clerk will still attempt to enter the bar code. At this point, bring<br /> forward your first accomplice who will introduce herself as the Secretary of Bar<br /> Code Scanning and say to the clerk, "I''ll give you two seconds to enter that bar<br /> code. Ready... Set... Times up!" </p>\n<p>The clerk will probably call for the manager, and the two of them will insist<br /> on manually entering the bar code into the cash register. Have dozens of your<br /> accomplices run to the media talking about possible mistakes and mischief that<br /> could arise from manually entering the bar code. Raise questions such as, "How<br /> can I make sure the price is being entered fairly when the clerk works for the<br /> owner?" Say, "These items have been scanned and rescanned. They just want to<br /> keep entering bar codes until they get the total they want." </p>\n<p>At this point, the owner might try to take you to court to get some more time<br /> to manually enter the bar code. He''s really playing right into your hands. </p>\n<p>While he''s getting a time extension from the court, call the office of<br /> Congressman Tom DELAY and ask him to send down a couple of henchmen to lead a<br /> crowd of angry demonstrators into the store to shout and bang on the doors. </p>\n<p>Simultaneously, file an appeal with the Supreme Court asking the highest court<br /> in the land to bring a halt to all manual entry of bar codes. </p>\n<p>In the midst of this confusion, have your first accomplice declare that all<br /> the items are legally yours and that if the owner doesn''t like it, he can take<br /> you to court. The owner will now have to drive to the state capital to file a<br /> lawsuit in which he will ask the judge to manually enter the bar code of the<br /> item that would not scan. Invite some celebrities over for a photo op and<br /> announce that you''ll share the items with them once the items are found to be<br /> rightfully yours. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile in court, the owner will ask the judge to transfer the item from the<br /> checkout line to the courtroom. Have your lawyer tell the judge that that is<br /> simply not enough, that the judge needs to move the entire inventory from the<br /> store lock, stock and barrel to his courtroom. </p>\n<p>When the owner contemplates that this will tie up all his merchandise till<br /> well after the holidays, he will surely give up. But just to be safe, have the<br /> legislature pass a law giving the entire store to you. </p>\n<p>Some people will tell you that you won''t enjoy the goodies you''ve thus<br /> obtained because they are not really yours.]
[LONDON (AP) -- Saucy? The British? Yes, and keeping well abreast of the latest science, judging by a new exhibition of -- er -- underwear at London''s Design Museum. Here, the nation famed for its reserve has raised its hem, offering a peep at sheepskin corsets, barely-there cashmere vests and a glow-in-the-dark bra.Should all the titillation prove too much, there''s also a bra that detects a racing heartbeat and a pair of panties that protects against radiation. ``This exhibit is a compelling statement about British design -- but it''s also quite saucy,'''' said Dame Helena Kennedy, a leading lawyer and chairwoman of the British Council, which launched the show Wednesday.``The perception of British people as being strait-laced is no longer real,'''' Kennedy said. To prove it, the displays are almost as provocative as the garments. Vivienne Westwood''s blue sheepskin corset and ditzy, star-patterned mini-crinoline and Alexander McQueen''s pink satin corset crusted with black Swarovski crystal are suspended inside giant inflatable women''s legs in transparent plastic. Vacuum-packed thongs and Clements Ribeiro''s red silk chiffon panties with polka dots hang from pegs on a washline. Near the entrance, a mannequin sprawls seductively on her back, a vision in pink fishnet stockings and the briefest green teddy and panties by the aptly named Agent Provocateur.And everywhere there are bras to make even 1950s ``sweater girl'''' Lana Turner envious -- from Gossard''s new padded Ultrabra Super Boost in patriotic red-white-and-blue, to Stella McCartney''s tassels and gray beads, to Agent Provocateur''s sliced-away style in sheer black net.For the traditionally minded, there are the more substantial constructions of Rigby and Peller (they put the foundation in foundation garments), suppliers of spine-stiffening unmentionables to the royal family since the 1960s. Owner June Kenton, personal bra fitter to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Mother Elizabeth, believes 80 percent of all women are wearing the wrong size bra ``and have two drawers-full of bras that they don''t wear.''''Rigby and Peller''s offerings contrast with the futuristic Techno Bra, made of conductive textile with silicon gel inserts that contain electronic devices to detect heartbeat changes. A British industrial design company is developing the piece for the commercial market and designer Kirsty Falconer hopes it may one day incorporate a personal alarm that will sound if the wearer is attacked. Constructed in a dun-colored conductive nylon and silver fabric, the anti-radiation panties are no thing of beauty. But if, as their makers claim, they drain electricity from the body -- thereby protecting it from magnetic radiation -- can you afford to be without them? The exhibition runs through July 2, then tours Japan and Australia.]

Each summer, the lawyer would<br /> invite a different friend of his (no, that''s not the punch line) to spend a week<br /> or two at this home, which happened to be in a backwoods. On one particular<br /> occasion, he invited a Czechoslovakian friend to stay with him. The friend,<br /> eager to get a freebee off of the lawyer, agreed. They had a splendid time in<br /> the country -- rising early and living in the great outdoors. Early one morning,<br /> the lawyer and his Czechoslovakian companion went out to pick berries for their<br /> morning breakfast. As they went around the berry patch, gathering blueberries<br /> and raspberries in tremendous quantities, along came two huge Bears -- a large<br /> male and a smaller female. The lawyer, seeing the two bears and sensing danger,<br /> immediately dashed for cover. His friend, however, being ignorant of nature, was<br /> not so lucky. The male bear charged the paralyzed Czechoslovakian, and then<br /> swallowed him whole. The lawyer, instilled with fright, rushed back to his car<br /> and sped into town to get the local sheriff.

[A tourist wanders into a back-alley antique shop in San Francisco''s Chinatown. Picking through the objects on display he discovers a detailed, life-sized bronze sculpture of a rat. The sculpture is so interesting and unique that he picks it up and asks the shop owner what it costs. "Twelve dollars for the rat, sir," says the shop owner, "and a thousand dollars more for the story behind it." "You can keep the story, old man," he replies, "but I''ll take the rat." </p>\n<p>The transaction complete, the tourist leaves the store with the bronze rat under his arm. As he crosses the street in front of the store, two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall into step behind him. Nervously looking over his shoulder, he begins to walk faster, but every time he passes another sewer drain, more rats come out and follow him. </p>\n<p>By the time he''s walked two blocks, at least a hundred rats are at his heels, and people begin to point and shout. He walks even faster, and soon breaks into a trot as multitudes of rats swarm from sewers, basements, vacant lots, and abandoned cars. Rats by the thousands are at his heels, and as he sees the waterfront at the bottom of the hill, he panics and starts to run for the bridge. </p>\n<p>Making a mighty leap, he jumps up onto a light post, grasping it with one arm while he hurls the bronze rat into San Francisco Bay with the other, as far as he can heave it. Pulling his legs up and clinging to the light post, he watches in amazement as the seething tide of rats surges over the breakwater into the sea, where they drown. </p>\n<p>Shaken and mumbling, he makes his way back to the antique shop. "Ah, so you''ve come back for the rest of the story," says the owner. </p>\n<p>"No," says the tourist, "but I was wondering if you have any bronze lawyers!"]

[A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA (Federal Housing Administration) loan<br /> for a client.  He was told that the loan would be granted if he could prove<br /> satisfactory title to property offered as collateral.  The title dated back to<br /> 1803, and he had to spend three months running it down.  After sending the<br /> information to FHA, he got this reply: "We received your letter today enclosing<br /> application for loan for your client, supported by abstract of title.  Let us<br /> compliment you on the able manner in which you prepared and presented the<br /> application.  However, you have not cleared the title before the year 1802, and<br /> therefore, before final approval can be accorded the application, it will be<br /> necessary that the title be cleared back to that year."</p>\n<p>    Annoyed, the lawyer replied: "Your letter regarding titles in Case No.<br /> 189156 received.  I note that you wish titles extended further back than I have<br /> presented them.  I was unaware that any educated man in the world failed to<br /> know that Louisiana was purchased from France in 1803.  The title to the land<br /> was acquired by France by right of conquest from Spain.  The land came into<br /> possession of Spain by right of discovery made in 1492 by a sailor named<br /> Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route<br /> to India by the then reigning monarch, Isabella.  The good Queen, being a pious<br /> woman and careful about titles, almost as much I might say, as the FHA, took<br /> the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope for the voyage before she<br /> sold her jewels to help Columbus.  Now the Pope, as you know, is the emissary<br /> of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and God, it is commonly accepted, made the<br /> world.  Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that He also made that part<br /> of the world called Louisiana, and I hope to hell you are satisfied."]

[A little old lady goes into the Chase Manhattan Bank, and says she wants to open a savings account. The accounts person asks her how much she would like to deposit to open the account and the little old lady says, "Three million dollars."The accounts person is startled, and says, "In what form?"and the little old lady says, "Cash. I''ve got it here in this bag..."The accounts person looks and, sure enough, the lady has a big grocery bag just chock full of green stuff in big denominations. This is a highly unusual event, and the accounts person excuses herself to get the president of the bank to handle this one. He arrives, and escorts the little old lady to his office to handle it personally. Once in his office, he asks the little old lady where she got so much money. She says, "Gambling.""Gambling?," he says."What sort of gambling?""Oh, I make bets with people on all sorts of things, and I usually win. For example, I''ve got $100,000 right here that says that by noon tomorrow your balls will be square, and I''ll even give you 4:1 odds. You got $25,000 you''d be willing to wager on that?"The bank president is shocked at this sort of thing coming from a sweet little old lady, but he didn''t get to be the president of the Chase Manhattan Bank without knowing something about money."I suppose I could come up with enough to cover that sort of wager, but I wouldn''t feel right taking it from you...there''s no way you can win a bet like that!" The little old lady just shook the bag, and said, "I know what I''m doing...and I can afford to lose, though I''m not going to. Is it a bet?""Ok, have it your way," said the president, and they shook hands on it."See you at 11:55 tomorrow morning," said the little old lady, and with that she left. Next morning at 11:55 the little old lady arrives with a younger man in a three-piece suit, and is escorted to the bank president''s office. The president is a nervous wreck, though a happy one. He''d gotten almost no sleep the night before, waking every few minutes to feel his balls to check for impending squareness, but nothing happened all night. He had checked hundreds of times that morning, but still nothing; perfectly normal. When the little old lady arrived he started to relax, knowing he had won."Come in, please have a seat! Who might this gentleman be?"said the president."He''s my lawyer. For a bet of this size I want to have a witness. Any objections?""No, perfectly understandable," said the president."Well, it''s now noon, and I''m still unchanged, so I guess I win!" he said happily."Not so fast!" said the little old lady."For a hundred grand I want to verify things personally! Please drop your pants."The bank president is a bit flustered, but agrees that in her position he''d want proof as well, so he drops his pants. The little old lady goes over to him and reaches out to feel the organs in question."Ok, you win, here''s your $100,000," says the little old lady, handing over a bag of bills. As she does so, her lawyer starts banging his head against the wall and moaning."What''s wrong with him?"asks the bank president."Oh, he''s just upset. Poor loser if you ask me. You see, I had a bet for $1,000,000 with him that I would have the President of the Chase Manhattan Bank by the balls by noon today."]

[1991 -- A Montana State University chemistry professor claimed in March that he was wrongfully accused of being drunk after an accident (which occurred while he was on work-release for a previous (drunk driving sentence).

For the entire duration of the trial, the man''s lawyer was able to suppress from the jurors'' ears another fact about his client: At the time of the collision, for some reason, he was wearing a condom. </p>\n<p>1991 -- St. Louis juror Frederick Pinkins was sentenced to three days in jail and a $700 fine for contempt of court in April after he missed final deliberations in a murder trial. He told the judge that the jury''s discussion (in a lover''s triangle case) depressed him so much that he got drunk and overslept. </p>\n<p>1995 -- In May, over the opposition of state Sen.

[A little old lady goes into the Chase Manhattan Bank, and says she wants to open a savings account. The accounts person asks her how much she would like to deposit to open the account and the little old lady says, "Three million dollars." The accounts person is startled, and says, "In what form?" and the little old lady says, "Cash. I''ve got it here in this bag..." The accounts person looks and, sure enough, the lady has a big grocery bag just chock full of green stuff in big denominations. This is a highly unusual event, and the accounts person excuses herself to get the president of the bank to handle this one. He arrives, and escorts the little old lady to his office to handle it personally. Once in his office, he asks the little old lady where she got so much money. She says, "Gambling." "Gambling?," he says."What sort of gambling?" "Oh, I make bets with people on all sorts of things, and I usually win. For example, I''ve got $100,000 right here that says that by noon tomorrow your balls will be square, and I''ll even give you 4:1 odds. You got $25,000 you''d be willing to wager on that?" The bank president is shocked at this sort of thing coming from a sweet little old lady, but he didn''t get to be the president of the Chase Manhattan Bank without knowing something about money."I suppose I could come up with enough to cover that sort of wager, but I wouldn''t feel right taking it from you...there''s no way you can win a bet like that!" The little old lady just shook the bag, and said, "I know what I''m doing...and I can afford to lose, though I''m not going to. Is it a bet?" "Ok, have it your way," said the president, and they shook hands on it."See you at 11:55 tomorrow morning," said the little old lady, and with that she left. Next morning at 11:55 the little old lady arrives with a younger man in a three-piece suit, and is escorted to the bank president''s office. The president is a nervous wreck, though a happy one. He''d gotten almost no sleep the night before, waking every few minutes to feel his balls to check for impending squareness, but nothing happened all night. He had checked hundreds of times that morning, but still nothing; perfectly normal. When the little old lady arrived he started to relax, knowing he had won."Come in, please have a seat! Who might this gentleman be?" said the president."He''s my lawyer. For a bet of this size I want to have a witness. Any objections?" "No, perfectly understandable," said the president."Well, it''s now noon, and I''m still unchanged, so I guess I win!" he said happily."Not so fast!" said the little old lady."For a hundred grand I want to verify things personally! Please drop your pants." The bank president is a bit flustered, but agrees that in her position he''d want proof as well, so he drops his pants. The little old lady goes over to him and reaches out to feel the organs in question."Ok, you win, here''s your $100,000," says the little old lady, handing over a bag of bills. As she does so, her lawyer starts banging his head against the wall and moaning."What''s wrong with him?" asks the bank president."Oh, he''s just upset. Poor loser if you ask me. You see, I had a bet for $1,000,000 with him that I would have the President of the Chase Manhattan Bank by the balls by noon today."]

St. Peter lets him through the gate.</p>\n<p>St. Peter turns to the Garbage man, and, figuring that Heaven doesn''t<br /> REALLY need all the stink that this guy would bring into heaven, decides<br /> to make the question a little harder: "How many people died on the ship?"</p>\n<p>The garbage man guesses: "1228" "That happens to be right. Go ahead."</p>\n<p>St. Peter turns to the Lawyer: "Name them."]

[A truck driver used to amuse himself by running over lawyers he would see walking down the side of the road. (As he''d had a bad time in divorce court recently, and blamed the lawyers.) Every time he would see a lawyer walking along the road, he would swerve to hit him, and there would be a loud "THUMP" and then he would swerve back on the road.One day, as the truck driver was driving along he saw a priest hitch hiking. He thought he would do a good turn and pulled the truck over.He asked the priest, "Where are you going, Father?"."I''m going to the church 5 miles down the road!", replied the priest."No problem, Father! I''ll give you a lift. Climb in the truck".The happy priest climbed into the passenger seat and the truck driver continued down the road. Suddenly the truck driver saw a lawyer walking down the road and instinctively he swerved to hit him. But then he remembered there was a priest in the truck with him, so at the last minute he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the lawyer. However even though he was certain he missed the lawyer, he still heard a loud "THUD". Not understanding where the noise came from he glanced in his mirrors and when he didn''t see anything, he turned to the priest and said, "I''m sorry Father. I almost hit that lawyer"."That''s okay", replied the priest."I got him with the door!]

[At the height of a political corruption trial, the prosecuting attorney attacked a witness."Isn''t it true," he bellowed, "that you accepted five thousand dollars to compromise this case?"

[An attorney had just finished a consultation with an elderly, nearly blind widow, for which he charged her $100. The widow opened her purse and removed a $100 bill. When the lawyer accepted it, he noticed there was another 100 stuck to it. Immediately the lawyers keen legal mind realized he was faced with a vital ethical question: Should he tell his partner?]
[After a long life, dutifully serving his parishioners, the elderly priest<br /> died. He found himself in Heaven, where he was warmly greeted by St. Peter.<br /> "Welcome," St. Peter said, "You have lived a good life. Let me take you to your<br /> quarters, and then I''ll show you around Heaven."</p>\n<p>St. Peter took the man to a rather plain building, and escorted him to a small<br /> room. The room was humbly furnished, but was functional. The priest was a bit<br /> surprised, having expected Heaven to be a bit more extravagent, but he was happy<br /> to be there.</p>\n<p>They then began their tour of Heaven, and it was absolutely beautiful. The<br /> priest felt silly for his initial resentment over his room.</p>\n<p>Finally, they came upon an enormous mansion. A butler opened the door to the<br /> mansion and a man came out, dressed to the nines, and proceeded down a long<br /> walkway to the front gate, as servants rolled a red carpet before him. When he<br /> reached the gate, a chauffeured limousine pulled up, and the man got in. It<br /> drove off.</p>\n<p>"Was that God," the priest asked, stunned by the display.</p>\n<p>"Oh heavens no," replied St. Peter. "That was a lawyer."</p>\n<p>"I don''t want to seem ungrateful, but can you answer a question for me?" The<br /> priest continued, "I spent my entire life devoted to my parishioners, and<br /> teaching the gospel, and I have very humble quarters in Heaven. I just don''t<br /> understand what that lawyer did, which would merit such a beautiful mansion."</p>\n<p>"It isn''t what he did," St. Peter replied. "You see, we have thousands upon<br /> thousands of priests up here. But he''s our first lawyer."]

[An old preacher was dying. He sent a message for his banker and his lawyer, both church members, to come to his home.When they arrived, they were ushered up to his bedroom. As they entered the room, the preacher held out his hands and motioned for them to sit on each side of the bed. The preacher grasped their hands, sighed contentedly, smiled, and stared at the ceiling. For a time, no one said anything.Both the banker and lawyer were touched and flattered that the preacher would ask them to be with him during his final moments. They were also puzzled; the preacher had never given them any indication that he particularly liked either of them. They both remembered his many long, uncomfortable sermons about greed, covetousness, and avaricious behavior that made them squirm in their seats.Finally, the banker said, "Preacher, why did you ask us to come?"The old preacher mustered up his strength and then said weakly, "Jesus died between two thieves, and that''s how I want to go."]

[A physician walked into an antique store, and began to look around. Suddenly,<br /> he spied a large BRASS RAT in the corner. He fell in love with it, and so he<br /> brought it up to the cashier.<br /> "The rat, eh?" said the wizened old cashier.<br /> "That''s right, how much," replied the doctor.<br /> "Well, five dollars for the rat--but 200 dollars for the story," he answered<br /> with a grin.<br /> "I''ll just take the rat, without the story," laughed the physician.<br /> He left the store, his precious brass rat tucked under his arm.<br /> Soon he began to hear a scurrying and squeaking noise behind him.  When he<br /> looked back, he noticed that a few rats were following him.  After he had walked<br /> a few more blocks, the number of rats behind him increased.  This continued,<br /> until there were virtually millions of rats behind him.<br /> The physician panicked, ran to a pier overlooking the sea, and threw the rat<br /> in.

[The prostitute''s lawyer addressed the court first, "Your Honor, my client,<br /> this lady here, is the owner of a piece of property, a garden spot surrounded by<br /> a profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she agreed to rent to the<br /> defendant for a specific length of time for the sum of $500.00. The defendant<br /> obtained exclusive possession of the property, using it extensively for the<br /> purpose for which it was rented. However, upon evacuating the premises, he paid<br /> only one-half of the amount agreed upon. The rent was not excessive since it is<br /> restricted and exclusive property and we ask that judgment be granted for<br /> plaintiff and against defendant in the amount of $250.00.<br />     The defendant''s lawyer, thrown back by what he had just heard, pondered<br /> the opening remarks for a moment and stood to present his off-the-cuff version<br /> of the case, "Your Honor, my client agrees that the young lady has a fine piece<br /> of property, and that he rented such property for a period of time, and that he<br /> even derived a degree of pleasure from the transaction. However, my client found<br /> a well on the property upon which he placed his own stones, sunk a shaft, and<br /> erected a pump. All equipment belonging to my client and all labor being<br /> performed by him. We allege that these improvements to the property were<br /> sufficient to affect an offset of the unpaid portion of rent and further allege<br /> that the plaintiff was adequately compensated for the fair market rental value<br /> of such property. We, therefore, ask that judgment not be granted for plaintiff<br /> and that the defendant be awarded his attorney''s fees and costs incurred in the<br /> defense of this frivolous action."<br />     The prostitute''s lawyer replied, "If it pleases the court your Honor, my<br /> client agrees that the defendant did find a well on the property, and that he<br /> made the improvements to the property as alleged. However, had the defendant not<br /> known the well existed; he would have never rented the property. Furthermore,<br /> upon evacuating the premises, the defendant removed the stones, pulled out the<br /> shaft, and took the pump with him. In doing so, he not only dragged his<br /> equipment through the well-manicured shrubbery, but also left the well with a<br /> hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, making it easily accessible<br /> to small children, thereby creating a possible danger to the health and general<br /> welfare of the public.

HARDING, Director HOLLISTER BUILDING,  PO BOX 30473,  LANSING MI 48909-7973 http://www.deq.state.mi December 17, 1997   CERTIFIEDMr. Ryan DeVries 2088 Dagget Pierson, MI 49339Dear Mr. DeVries:SUBJECT: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023-1   T11N, R10W,  Sec.  20, Montcalm CountyIt has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of property.  You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor who did the following unauthorized activity: Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond.  A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  A review of the Department''s files show that no permits have been issued.Therefore, the Department has determined that this activity is in violation of Part 301,.  Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated.  The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially, failed during a recent rain event, causing debris dams and flooding at downstream locations.  We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted.  The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist all unauthorized activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the strewn channel. All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 1998. Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff.Failure to comply with this request, or any further unauthorized activity on the site, may result in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter.Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.Sincerely,David L. Price District Representative Land and Water Management Division        ----Reply Letter----Dear Mr. Price:Re: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023;  T11N, R10W, Sec 20; Montcalm CountyYour certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to.  You sent out a great deal of carbon copies to a lot of people, but you neglected to include their addresses.  You will, therefore, have to send them a copy of my response.First of all, Mr. Ryan DeVries is not the legal landowner and/or contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson, Michigan - I am the legal owner and a couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of constructing and maintaining two wood ''debris'' dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond.  While I did not pay for, nor authorize their dam project, I think they would be highly offended you call their skillful use of natural building materials ''debris.''  I would like to challenge you to attempt to emulate their dam project any dam time and/or any dam place you choose.  I believe I can safely state there is no dam way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.As to your dam request the beavers first must fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity, my first dam question to you is: are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers or do you require all dam beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam request?  If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, please send me completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam permits.  Perhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated.My first concern is - aren''t the dam beavers entitled to dam legal representation?The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said dam representation - so the State will have to provide them with a dam lawyer.  The Department''s dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing dam flooding is proof we should leave the dam Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling their dam names.  If you want the dam stream ''restored'' to a dam free-flow condition - contact the dam beavers - but if you are going to arrest them (they obviously did not pay any dam attention to your dam letter-being unable to read English) - be sure you read them their dam Miranda rights first.  As for me, I am not going to cause more dam flooding or dam debris jams by interfering with these dam builders.  If you want to hurt these dam beavers - be aware I am sending a copy of your dam letter and this response to PETA. If your dam Department seriously finds all dams of this nature inherently hazardous and truly will not permit their existence in this dam State - I seriously hope you are not selectively enforcing this dam policy - or once again both I and the Spring Pond Beavers will scream prejudice!In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their dam unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water flows downstream.  They have more dam right than I to live and enjoy Spring Pond.  So, as far as I and the beavers are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more dam elevated enforcement action now.  Why wait until 1/31/98?  The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then, and there will be no dam way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then.In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention a real environmental quality (health) problem; bears are actually defecating in our woods.  I definitely believe you should be persecuting the defecating bears and leave the dam beavers alone.  If you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step!  (The bears are not careful where they dump!)Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office. Sincerely,Stephen L. Tvedtenxc: PETA--]

[A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA loan for a client. He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. </p>\n<p>The title to the property dated back<br /> to 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down. </p>\n<p>After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following reply:<br /> "Upon review of your letter adjoining your client''s loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral proper back to 1803.

I note<br /> that you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application. </p>\n<p>I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application. </p>\n<p>For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain. </p>\n<p>The land came into possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the then reigning monarch, Isabella. </p>\n<p>The good queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles, almost as much as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to fund Columbus'' expedition. </p>\n<p>Now the Pope, as I''m sure you know, is the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

[A man was looking around a small gift shop when he came across an amazingly<br /> ugly statue of a rat.

The rats followed the statue,<br /> sinking into the waves like stones.<br /> The man then rushed back to the shop, elated, panicked, and still in shock.<br /> When he burst through the door, the shopkeeper gave a little chuckle. He had a<br /> smug grin on his face as he said,<br /> "I expect you''ve come back to buy the story." The shopkeeper held out his hand<br /> for the fifty dollars. The customer looked confused for a second, then said.<br /> "Hell no! I want to know if you''ve got a statue of a lawyer!"]

Your daughter is<br /> using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is<br /> pregnant with twin girls. They aren''t yours. Get a lawyer.

[For those of you who have had to deal with governmental<br /> agencies, this will strike a familiar and then satisfying<br /> chord.....</p>\n<p>A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA loan for a client. He was<br /> told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory<br /> title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The<br /> title to the property dated back to 1803, which took the lawyer<br /> three months to track down.</p>\n<p>After sending the information to the FHA, he received the<br /> following reply (actual letter):</p>\n<p>"Upon review of your letter adjoining your client''s loan<br /> application, we note that the request is supported by an<br /> Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which<br /> you have prepared and presented the application, we must point<br /> out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral<br /> proper back to 1803. Before final approval can be accorded, it<br /> will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin."</p>\n<p>Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows (actual letter):</p>\n<p>"Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been<br /> received. I note that you wish to have title extended further<br /> than the 194 years covered by the present application. I was<br /> unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly<br /> those working in the property area, would not know that<br /> Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the<br /> year of origin identified in our application. For the<br /> edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land<br /> prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had<br /> acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain. The land came into<br /> possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492<br /> by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been<br /> granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the<br /> then reigning monarch, Isabella.</p>\n<p>The good queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles,<br /> almost as much as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the<br /> blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to fund<br /> Columbus'' expedition. Now the Pope, as I''m sure you know, is the<br /> emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And God, it is<br /> commonly accepted, created this world.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that He also made<br /> that part of the world called Louisiana. He, therefore, would be<br /> the owner of origin. I hope you find His original claim to be<br /> satisfactory. Now, may we have our loan?"</p>\n<p>They got it.]

[Somewhere in America this week the following conversation is taking place:</p>\n<p>Dad - Son, come in here, we need to talk.<br /> Son - What''s up, Dad?</p>\n<p>D- There''s a scratch down the side of the car. Did you do it?</p>\n<p>S- I don''t believe, if I understand the definition of "scratch the car", that<br /> I can say, truthfully, and that I scratched the car.</p>\n<p>D- Well, it wasn''t there yesterday, and you drove the car last night, and no<br /> one else has driven it since. How can you explain the scratch?</p>\n<p>S- Well, as I''ve said before, I have no recollection of scratching the car.<br /> While it is true that I did take the car out last night, I did not scratch it.</p>\n<p>D- But your sister, Monica, has told me she saw you back the car against the<br /> mailbox at the end of the driveway, heard a loud scraping sound, saw you get out<br /> to examine the car, and then drive away. So again I''ll ask you, yes or no, did<br /> you scratch the car?</p>\n<p>S- Oh, you mean you think you have evidence to prove I scratched it. Well, you<br /> see, I understood you to mean did "I" scratch the car. I stand by my earlier<br /> statement, that I did not scratch the car.</p>\n<p>D- Are you trying to tell me you didn''t drive the car into the mailbox?</p>\n<p>S- Well, you see sir, I was trying to drive the car into the street. I<br /> mishandled the steering of the car, and it resulted in direct contact with the<br /> mailbox, though that was clearly not my intent.</p>\n<p>D- So you are then saying that you did hit the mailbox?</p>\n<p>S- No sir, that''s not my statement. I''ll refer you back to my original<br /> statement that I did not scratch the car.</p>\n<p>D- But the car did hit the mailbox, and the car did get scratched as a result<br /> of this contact?</p>\n<p>S- Well, yes, I suppose you could look at it that way.</p>\n<p>D- So you lied to me when you said you did not scratch the car?</p>\n<p>S- No. No, that''s not correct. Your question was "Did I scratch the car?".<br /> From a strict legal definition, as I understood the meaning of that sentence, I<br /> did not scratch the car... the mailbox did... I was merely present when the<br /> scratching occurred. So my answer of No" when you asked "Did I scratch the car"<br /> was legally correct, although I did not volunteer information.</p>\n<p>D- Son, you are such a slick talker you''re either gonna wind up as a lawyer or<br /> President....]

[REDMOND, WA--In what CEO Bill Gates called''an unfortunate but necessary step to protect our intellectual property from theft and exploitation by competitors,'' the Microsoft Corporation patented the numbers one and zero Monday.With the patent, Microsoft''s rivals are prohibited from manufacturing or selling products containing zeroes and ones--the mathematical building blocks of all computer languages and programs--unless a royalty fee of 10 cents per digit used is paid to the software giant.''Microsoft has been using the binary system of ones and zeroes ever since its inception in 1975,'' Gates told reporters. ''For years, in the  interest of the overall health of the computer industry, we permitted the  free and unfettered use of our proprietary numeric systems. However,  changing marketplace conditions and the increasingly predatory practices of  certain competitors now leave us with no choice but to seek compensation for  the use of our numerals.''A number of major Silicon Valley players, including Apple Computer, Netscape and Sun Microsystems, said they will challenge the Microsoft patent  as monopolistic and anti-competitive, claiming that the 10-cent-per-digit  licensing fee would bankrupt them instantly.''While, technically, Java is a complex system of algorithms used to create a platform-independent programming environment, it is, at its core,  just a string of trillions of ones and zeroes,'' said Sun Microsystems CEO  Scott McNealy, whose company created the Java programming environment used  in many Internet applications. ''The licensing fees we''d have to pay  Microsoft every day would be approximately 327,000 times the total net worth  of this company.''''If this patent holds up in federal court, Apple will have no choice but to convert to analog,'' said Apple interim CEO Steve Jobs, ''and I have  serious doubts whether this company would be able to remain competitive  selling pedal-operated computers running software off vinyl LPs.''As a result of the Microsoft patent, many other companies have begun radically revising their product lines: Database manufacturer Oracle has  embarked on a crash program to develop ''an abacus for the next millennium.''  Novell, whose communications and networking systems are also subject to  Microsoft licensing fees, is working with top animal trainers on a  chimpanzee-based message-transmission system. Hewlett-Packard is developing  a revolutionary new steam-powered printer.Despite the swarm of protest, Gates is standing his ground, maintaining that ones and zeroes are the undisputed property of Microsoft.       ''We will vigorously enforce our patents of these numbers, as they are  legally ours,'' Gates said. ''Among Microsoft''s vast historical archives are Sanskrit cuneiform tablets from 1800 B.C. clearly showing ones and a symbol known as ''sunya,'' or nothing.  ''We also own: papyrus scrolls written by Pythagoras himself in which he  explains the idea of singular notation, or ''one''; early tracts by Mohammed  ibn Musa al Kwarizimi explaining the concept of al-sifr, or ''the cipher'';  original mathematical manuscripts by Heisenberg, Einstein and Planck; and a  signed first-edition copy of Jean-Paul Sartre''s Being And Nothingness.  Should the need arise, Microsoft will have no difficulty proving to the  Justice Department or anyone else that we own the rights to these numbers.''Added Gates: ''My salary also has lots of zeroes. I''m the richest man in the world.''According to experts, the full ramifications of Microsoft''s patenting of one and zero have yet to be realized.''Because all integers and natural numbers derive from one and zero, Microsoft may, by extension, lay claim to ownership of all mathematics and  logic systems, including Euclidean geometry, pulleys and levers, gravity,  and the basic Newtonian principles of motion, as well as the concepts of  existence and nonexistence,'' Yale University theoretical mathematics  professor J. Edmund Lattimore said. ''In other words, pretty much  everything.''Lattimore said that the only mathematical constructs of which Microsoft may not be able to claim ownership are infinity and transcendental  numbers like pi. Microsoft lawyers are expected to file liens on infinity  and pi this week.Microsoft has not yet announced whether it will charge a user fee to individuals who wish to engage in such mathematically rooted motions as  walking, stretching and smiling.In an address beamed live to billions of people around the globe Monday, Gates expressed confidence that his company''s latest move will,  ultimately, benefit all humankind.''Think of this as a partnership,'' Gates said. ''Like the ones and zeroes of the binary code itself, we must all work together to make the  promise of the computer revolution a reality. As the world''s richest, most  powerful software company, Microsoft is number one. And you, the millions of  consumers who use our products, are the zeroes.'']

Doc, you''ve gotta help me, I''m going<br /> crazy!"<br /> "Just put you in my hands for two years," said the psychiatrist. "Come to me<br /> three times a week, and I''ll cure your fears."<br /> "How much do you charge?"<br /> "My fee is per visit."<br /> "That''s awfully expensive, Doc," reckoned Shakey.

Then, he poured the urine sample into the computer<br /> and deposited bucks. The computer started making some noise and a number of<br /> lights started flashing. After a brief moment, out popped a small slip of paper<br /> which read:<br /> ''You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy labor. It<br /> will be better in two weeks.''<br /> That evening, while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it<br /> would change medical science forever, Paul began to wonder if the computer could<br /> be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a<br /> stool sample from his pet dog, and urine samples from both his wife and<br /> daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the mix.<br /> The next day, Paul returned to drug store and poured the sample into the<br /> computer. Next, he deposited bucks. The computer started making some noise and a<br /> number of lights started flashing. After a brief moment, out popped a small slip<br /> of paper which read:<br /> ''Your tap water is too hard... getting a water softener.

[Why lawyers should never ask a witness a question if they aren''t prepared for the answer: In a trial in a small town in the South, the prosecuting attorney called his first witness to the stand - a grandmotherly, elderly woman.<br /> He approached her and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know me?" </p>\n<p>She responded, "Why, yes I do know you, Mr. Williams.I''ve known you since you were a young boy, and frankly, you''ve been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you''re a big shot when you haven''t the brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you." The lawyer was stunned. </p>\n<p>Not knowing what else to do,he pointed across the room and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?" She again replied, "Why yes, I do. I''ve known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He''s lazy and bigoted and he has a drinking problem. He can''t build a normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he has cheated on his wife with three different women. Yes, I know him." The defense attorney almost died. </p>\n<p>The judge asked both lawyers to approach the bench, and in a very quiet voice, said, "If either of you bastards asks her if she knows me, you''ll be jailed for contempt."]

[A big shot city lawyer and a redneck got into a car wreck on a hot summer day.<br /> The lawyer got out of his BMW and the redneck got out of his pickup to survey<br /> the damage, and the redneck realized he was at fault... "YOU STUPID HICK!"<br /> shouted the lawyer, looking with contempt at the redneck in his dirty overalls<br /> and tangled beard. "Hick, huh?" though the redneck. "How am I going to get out<br /> this?" After looking over the handsome, impeccably dressed and dignified city<br /> lawyer in his $2,000 navy blue pinstriped suit, carefully knotted red silk tie,<br /> starched white shirt, silver cufflinks and black dress shoes polished like<br /> mirrors, $1,000 briefcase and hundred dollar haircut, the redneck walked back to<br /> his car, got out a bottle, and brought it back. Mister Hotshot was checking his<br /> suit and shoes to make sure they were not dirty. He handed it to the lawyer, and<br /> said, "Here, you look pretty shook up. I think you ought to take a nip of this.<br /> It''ll steady your nerves....IT''S HOMEMADE..." Mister Pinstripes did, but was so<br /> angry about the wreck, he refused to speak. The redneck then said, "You still<br /> look a little bit pale. How about another?" And the smug, pompous lawyer took<br /> another swallow. After a few minutes, he began to feel the heat of the sun<br /> through his wool suit. Then the redneck said �酶惟It�酶惟s mighty hot today. Folks<br /> �酶惟round here don�酶惟t usually wear shoes on a day like this. Why don�酶惟t you take off<br /> them fancy shoes, and the socks, too?�酶惟 </p>\n<p>The lawyer frowned: "Take off my shoes and socks? Do I LOOK like someone who<br /> would walk around barefoot? That''s fine for rednecks, but not for a professional<br /> like ME! These are $500 shoes!" </p>\n<p>But after a few more sips, the redneck asked him again, and then again, and<br /> finally the lawyer let out a drunken laugh, and took off his polished shoes and<br /> socks. Then the redneck said: �酶惟Why don�酶惟t you take off that fancy tie?" "Take off<br /> my tie?" said the lawyer with a sneer and slur in his voice. "I''m a lawyer!!!"<br /> But then he looked down at his bare feet and took off his tie... </p>\n<p>The redneck said: "And the suit? You look kind of funny standing there<br /> barefoot in a suit! I got another pair of overalls you can wear while we fogger<br /> out what to do about this situation!" </p>\n<p>The lawyer tried to give him an arrogant look, but he was feeling the heat of<br /> the sun and the liquor. He tried to resist, but... </p>\n<p>Off came the jacket of the $2,000 pinstriped suit. Then the white shirt.<br /> Finally, the trousers, too, and the lawyer pulled on the overalls. </p>\n<p>At the urging of the redneck, the lawyer then took another sip, and another,<br /> and another. </p>\n<p>The suspenders and the cufflinks and the briefcase were all in a heap now, and<br /> the lawyer was having a hard time standing up. After another half hour, the<br /> lawyer said he was feeling pretty good, and asked the redneck if he didn''t think<br /> that he ought to have a little nip, too. Then he realized he couldn''t find the<br /> redneck... or his expensive clothes. </p>\n<p>"Not me", the redneck replied, stepping out from behind a tree and wearing the<br /> lawyer''s clothes and holding the keys to his BMW. He looked at the formerly<br /> well-dressed and dignified lawyer, barefoot in overalls and drunk as a skunk and<br /> looking like a true redneck, "Here''s the keys to my pickup. Now that I''ve cut ya<br /> down to size, I''m waiting for the state trooper!"]
