As part of the Oslo agreement with the<br /> Palestinians in 1993, Israel had to agree to release so-called "political<br /> prisoners." However, the Israelis would not release any with blood on their<br /> hands.<br /> The American President at the time, Bill Clinton, and his Secretary of<br /> State, Warren Christopher, "insisted" that all prisoners be released.

A neighbor suggested that she cut the tail of one horse and that worked great until the other horse got his tail caught in a bush.

Democrats make plans and then do something else. Republicans follow the plans their grandfathers made. Republicans sleep in twin beds--some even in separate rooms. </p>\n<p>That is why there are more Democrats.
