[Some things I''ve learned from my children:</p>\n<p>Super glue "is" forever.</p>\n<p>No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can''t walk on water. Pool filters "do not like Jell-O!"</p>\n<p>A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot house 4 inches deep.</p>\n<p>Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.</p>\n<p>Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.</p>\n<p>If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough however to spread paint on all four walls of 20 by 20 foot room.</p>\n<p>You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. And the glass in windows (even double pane) doesn''t stop a<br /> baseball hit by a ceiling fan.</p>\n<p>Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four year old.</p>\n<p>VCR''s do not eject peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, even though TV commercials show they do.</p>\n<p>Always look in the oven before you turn it on. It''s been proven that plastic toys do not like ovens.<br /> Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence.</p>\n<p>If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades, they can ignite.</p>\n<p>The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms dizzy. It will however make cats dizzy. Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy.]
[To the citizens of the United States of America: </p>\n<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. </p>\n<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. </p>\n<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: </p>\n<p>1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up "aluminium" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. </p>\n<p>Look up "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed". </p>\n<p>2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. </p>\n<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn''t that hard. </p>\n<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. </p>\n<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through. </p>\n<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. </p>\n<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. </p>\n<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for "shit" </p>\n<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day. </p>\n<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. </p>\n<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It''s been driving us crazy. </p>\n<p>Thank you for your cooperation.]
[It is the Olympic men''s figure skating. Out comes the Russian competitor, he<br /> skates around to some classical music in a slightly dull costume, performs some<br /> excellent leaps but without any great artistic feel for the music. </p>\n<p>The Judges'' scores read: Britain 5.8: Russia 5.9: United States 5.5: Ireland<br /> 6.0 </p>\n<p>Next comes the American competitor in a sparkling stars and stripes costume,<br /> skating to some rock and roll music. He gets the crowd clapping, but is not<br /> technically as good as the Russian. He slightly misses landing a triple Salchow<br /> and loses the center during a spin. But, artistically, it is a more satisfying<br /> performance. </p>\n<p>The Judges'' scores read: Britain 5.8: Russia 5.5: United States 5.9: Ireland<br /> 6.0 </p>\n<p>Finally out comes the Irish competitor wearing a tatty old donkey jacket, with<br /> his skates tied over his wellies. He reaches the ice, trips straight away and<br /> bangs his nose which starts bleeding. He tries to get up, staggers a few paces<br /> then slips again. He spends his entire ''routine'' getting up then falling over<br /> again. Finally he crawls off the ice a tattered and bleeding mess. </p>\n<p>The Judges'' scores read: Britain 0.0: Russia 0.0: United States 0.0: Ireland<br /> 6.0 </p>\n<p>The other 3 judges turn to the Irish judge and demand in unison, "How the hell<br /> can you give that mess 6.0?!" </p>\n<p>To which the Irish judge replies "You''ve gotta remember, it''s damn slippery<br /> out there."]

[Ryan rents an apartment in New York and goes to the lobby to put his name on the group mailbox. While he is there, an attractive young lady comes out of the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing a robe. Ryan smiles at the young girl and she strikes up a conversation with him. As they talk, her robe slips open, and it''s quite obvious that she has nothing under the robe. Poor Ryan breaks out into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact. After a few minutes, she places her hand on his arm and says, "Let''s go in my apartment, I can hear someone coming."</p>\n<p>He proceeds with her into the apartment, and after she closes the door, she leans against it allowing her robe to fall off completely. Being completely nude, she purrs at him, "What would you say is my best feature?"</p>\n<p>The flustered, embarrassed Ryan stammers, clears his throat several times, and finally squeaks out, "Oh, it''s got to be your ears!"</p>\n<p>She''s astounded! "Why my ears? Look at these breasts! They are full, don''t sag and they''re 100% natural! My buns -- they are firm and do not sag and have no cellulite! Look at this skin -- no blemishes, or scars! Why in heaven''s name would you say my ears are the best part of my body?!"</p>\n<p>Clearing his throat once again, Ryan stammers, "Outside when you said you heard someone coming -- that was me."]

[The five toughest questions women ask - and their answers:<br /> 1. `What are you thinking?''<br /> 2. `Do you love me?''<br /> 3. `Do I look fat?''<br /> 4. `Do you think she''s prettier than me?''<br /> 5. `What would you do if I died?''</p>\n<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example:</p>\n<p>1. `What are you thinking?''<br /> The proper answer to this question, of course, is: ''I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you.'' Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things:<br /> a - football.<br /> b - baseball.<br /> c - How fat you are.<br /> d - How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>The best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married with Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. His answer: ''If I wanted you to know I''d be talking instead of thinking''</p>\n<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers:</p>\n<p>2. ''Do you love me?''<br /> The correct answer to this question is, ''Yes.''<br /> For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer. ''Yes dear.'' </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I suppose so.<br /> b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> c - That depends on what you mean by ''love''.<br /> d - Does it matter?<br /> e - Who, me?</p>\n<p>3. ''Do I look fat?''<br /> The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state,<br /> ''No, of course not'' and then quickly leave the room. </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either.<br /> b - Compared to what?<br /> c - A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d - I''ve seen fatter.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>\n<p>4. ''Do you think she''s prettier than me?''<br /> The ''she'' in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passerby you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw.<br /> In any case, the correct response is: ''No, you are much prettier.'' </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.<br /> b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things.<br /> c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.<br /> d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>\n<p>5. ''What would you do if I died?'' </p>\n<p>Correct answer: ''Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first truck that came my way.''</p>\n<p>This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke:</p>\n<p>''Dear,'' said the wife, `what would you do if I died?'' </p>\n<p>''why, dear, I would be extremely upset,'' said the husband.

[Dear Tech Support:</p>\n<p>I am desperate for some help. I recently upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that the new program began unexpected child processing and also took up a lot of space and valuable resources. This wasn''t mentioned in the product brochure.</p>\n<p>In addition Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialisation where it monitors all other system activity.</p>\n<p>Applications such as Boys Night Out 2.5, and Golf 5.3 no longer run and crash the system whenever selected. Attempting to operate Sunday Football 6.3 always fails but Saturday Shopping 7.1 runs instead. I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background whilst attempting to run any of my favourite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0 but de-install doesn''t work on this program.</p>\n<p>Can you please help!<br /> Joe.</p>\n<p>Dear Joe,</p>\n<p>This is a very common problem resulting from a basic misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>Many men upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 thinking that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT program. Whereas Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM designed by its creator to run everything.</p>\n<p>You are unlikely to be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0 as Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this and it is impossible to de-install, delete or purge the program files from the system once installed.</p>\n<p>Some people have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0, but have<br /> ended up with even more problems. (See in manual under Alimony/Child Support and Solicitors Fees). Having Wife 1.0 installed myself I recommend you keep it installed and deal with the difficulties as best you can.</p>\n<p>When any faults or problems occur, whatever you think has caused them, you must run the C: IAPOLOGISE program and avoid attempting to use the *Esc-key. It may be necessary to run C: I APOLOGISE a number of times, but hopefully eventually the operating system will return to normal.</p>\n<p>Wife 1.0 although a very high maintenance program can be very rewarding. To get the most out of it consider buying additional software such as Flowers 2.0 and Chocolates 5.0.</p>\n<p>Do not under any circumstances install Secretary (Short Skirt version) as this is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and the system will almost certainly crash.</p>\n<p>Best of luck!<br /> Tech Support]

But<br /> before I let you into heaven, I have to ask you a couple of questions. Make sure<br /> you tell the truth because if you don''t, we''ll have to ask you to visit the<br /> beast below. Your answers will also determine what kind of car you will get. You<br /> have to have a car here in heaven because it is so huge!"<br /> St. Peter asked the first man, "How long were you married?"<br /> The guy replied, "24 years."<br /> St. Peter then asked, "Did you ever cheat on your wife?"<br /> The guy said, "Yeah, about 10 times... but you said I was forgiven."<br /> Peter said, "Yes, but that''s not too good. Here''s a Pinto for you to drive."<br /> The second guy got the same questions from Peter to whom he replied, "I was<br /> married for 41 years and cheated on her only once, but that was during our first<br /> year and we worked it out. I was faithful thereafter."<br /> Peter said, "I''m pleased to hear that. Here''s a Mercedes SUV for you to<br /> drive."<br /> The third guy said, "Peter, I know what you''re going to ask. I was married for<br /> 63 years and didn''t even look at another woman! I treated my wife like a queen!" </p>\n<p>Peter said, "Now that''s what I like to hear! Here''s a Jaguar for you to<br /> drive."<br /> A little while later, the two guys with the Lincoln and the Pinto saw the guy<br /> with the Jaguar crying on the golden sidewalk, so they went to see what the<br /> matter was.

[An Erie, Pennsylvania executive with a new young wife and a yen for golf<br /> decided about December one year that he couldn''t take it any longer.

We''ll get a condo on the golf course and I''m going to play<br /> golf all weekend."</p>\n<p>"That sounds fine," she purred.  And, sure enough, next Saturday morning at 6<br /> a.m., found him on the golf course, all alone.  After playing two holes, he<br /> noticed a man carrying a golf bag walking toward him across a fairway.  The<br /> exec. waited, and the other man arrived, saying, "Mind if I play along?"</p>\n<p>The exec. said, "Fine.  Glad to have the company."</p>\n<p>All went well for a couple of holes, until each approached the sixth green.<br /> When the new fellow laid down his clubs, the cover came off one club.

"I''m not out to cause any trouble.  If you want me<br /> to leave, I will.  No hard feelings."</p>\n<p>"No. No," said the exec.  "I''m just curious as to why you have a high-powered<br /> rifle in your bag."</p>\n<p>The other man pondered for a moment and then said, "Well, I''ll tell you.  It''s<br /> my business.  It''s what I do for a living."</p>\n<p>"Wow," said the other.  "I''ve heard about guys like you, but I''ve never met one<br /> before."</p>\n<p>"Still want me to play?" said the other.</p>\n<p>"Sure," said the Erie exec.  "As a matter of fact, you know, I do a little<br /> hunting.  Would you mind if I look at it?"</p>\n<p>The other man showed him the rifle.  It was beautiful--an inlaid Weatherby with<br /> a huge powerful scope mounted on it.</p>\n<p>The exec. picked it up, looked through the scope, and said, "Gee, I can see the<br /> window of my condo with this thing.  Matter of fact, there''s my wife."  He<br /> lowered the gun for a moment and said, "she doesn''t have any clothes on."  He<br /> looked through the scope again.  "Damn, there''s a guy with her."</p>\n<p>The Erie exec. lowered the rifle and looked at the other man.  "How much do you<br /> charge?"</p>\n<p>"$10,000 a bullet," said the man.</p>\n<p>The Erie man thought for a moment, and said, "Do it."</p>\n<p>"Which one?" said the hit man.</p>\n<p>"Both," said the exec.</p>\n<p>"That''s $20,000, you know."</p>\n<p>"I don''t care.  hit ''em both."</p>\n<p>The hit man took two cartridges from his bag and loaded the rifle.

[Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses<br /> pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in<br /> the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly<br /> Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the<br /> other side, safe and sound.</p>\n<p>Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one<br /> directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the<br /> center of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus<br /> casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the<br /> green.</p>\n<p>The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed<br /> out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street.<br /> It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it<br /> bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into<br /> the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and<br /> straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond,<br /> the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily<br /> pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog<br /> jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth.<br /> Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew<br /> away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with<br /> fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup<br /> for a hole in one.</p>\n<p>Moses turned to Jesus and said, "I hate playing with your Dad."]

[The big-game hunter walked into the bar and bragged to everyone<br /> about his skills as a hunter. The man was undoubtedly a good<br /> shot and no one could dispute that. But then he said that he<br /> could recognize any animal''s skin by feeling it, and he could<br /> tell what caliber rifle was used to shoot it by locating the<br /> bullet hole. This was a bit too much for the other customers,<br /> and soon a heated argument started.</p>\n<p>The hunter said that he was willing to prove it if they would<br /> put up the drinks, and the bet was on. They blindfolded him and<br /> took him to his first animal skin.</p>\n<p>After feeling it for a few moments, he announced, "Springbok."<br /> Then he felt for the bullet hole and declared, "And it was shot<br /> with a .22 rifle." He was right! The others could not believe it<br /> and the argument was even hotter than before. When someone<br /> suggested that he must have peeped, he said that he was prepared<br /> to do it again for another round.</p>\n<p>So they blindfolded him again, very thoroughly this time, and<br /> they brought a skin that someone happened to have in the trunk<br /> of his car. He took a bit longer this time and then said,<br /> "Kalahari Lion." Fingering the bullet hole, he added, "The rifle<br /> was a .308." He was right again! This only made the crowd more<br /> curious, and he had to prove his skills over and over again,<br /> every time winning a round of drinks.</p>\n<p>Finally he staggered home, bombed out of his mind, and went to<br /> sleep. The next morning he got up and saw in the mirror that he<br /> had one hell of a shiner.

[When you''re 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: "Just because you''ve reached middle age, that doesn''t mean you shouldn''t take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it." </p>\n<p>This is the voice of Satan. </p>\n<p>I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales. </p>\n<p>I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. "I''ll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets" is a typical breakfast order for me these days. </p>\n<p>This is because I went snowboarding. </p>\n<p>For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough. </p>\n<p>These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, "Cool." </p>\n<p>People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together. </p>\n<p>We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill). </p>\n<p>If anybody asks if you''re OK, you say, "I''m just catching my breath!" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you''re going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you''re planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw. </p>\n<p>At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance. </p>\n<p>So I thought I''d take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing. </p>\n<p>In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range. </p>\n<p>Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can''t stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you. </p>\n<p>Skiers hate snowboarders. It''s a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc. </p>\n<p>Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd. </p>\n<p>I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope. </p>\n<p>Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who''s going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete. </p>\n<p>You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.) </p>\n<p>We learned snowboarding via a two step method: </p>\n<p>STEP ONE: Watching Brad do something. </p>\n<p>STEP TWO: Trying to do it ourselves. </p>\n<p>I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics. </p>\n<p>I''d struggle to my feet, and I''d be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot. </p>\n<p>"Keep your knees bent!" Brad would yell, helpfully. </p>\n<p>Have you noticed that whatever sport you''re trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if THAT would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, "FORGET MY KNEES! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE GRAVITY CHUNKS!" </p>\n<p>Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me. </p>\n<p>If I hadn''t gotten out of there, they''d have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding. </p>\n<p>So I think, when my body heals, I''ll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you''ll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.]

[One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend<br /> suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything<br /> quicker and cheaper than a doctor.<br /> ''''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your<br /> problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10." Bill figured<br /> he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the<br /> drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.<br /> The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.<br /> After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: "You<br /> have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be<br /> better in two weeks."<br /> Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how<br /> it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine<br /> could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog<br /> and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into<br /> the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in<br /> the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and<br /> printed out the following message:<br /> "Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him<br /> vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren''t yours. Get a lawyer. And if<br /> you don''t stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better."]

Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you&nbsp; noticed.</p>\n<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:</p>\n<p>1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up "aluminium" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.</p>\n<p>Look up "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed".</p>\n<p>2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.</p>\n<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn''t that hard.</p>\n<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.</p>\n<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.</p>\n<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football.</p>\n<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.</p>\n<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde.

Apparently, this one is pretty nasty.</p>\n<p>It will not only erase everything on your hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your computer. It demagnetizes the stripes on ALL of your credit cards. It reprograms your ATM access code, screws up the tracking on your VCR and uses subspace field harmonics to scratch any CD''s you attempt to play. It will re-calibrate your refrigerator''s coolness settings so all your ice cream melts and your milk curdles. It will program your phone''s autodial to call only your mother-in-law''s number. This virus will mix antifreeze into your fish tank. It will drink all your beer. It will leave dirty socks on the coffee table when you are expecting company. Its radioactive emissions will cause your toe jam and bellybutton fuzz (be honest, you have some)to migrate behind your ears. It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine, all while dating your current boy/girlfriend behind your back and billing their hotel rendezvous to your Visa card. It will cause you to run with scissors and throw things in a way that is only fun until someone loses an eye. It will give you Dutch Elm Disease and Tinea. It will rewrite your backup files, changing all your active verbs to passive tense and incorporating undetectable misspellings, which grossly change the interpretations of key sentences. If the "Badtimes" message is opened in a Windows95 environment, it will leave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously close to a full bathtub.

[Here are some basic descriptions of what may happen if airplanes had different operating systems running them.DOS: Everybody pushes it till it glides, then jumps on and lets it coast till it skids, then jumps off, pushes, jumps back on, etc.DOS with QEMM:  Same as DOS, but with more leg room for pushing.Macintosh:  All the flight attendants, captains and baggage handlers look the same, act the same and talk the same.  Every time you ask a question, you are told you don''t need to know, don''t want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can''t even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.  Then they go on the runway and piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they''re building.CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13 airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don''t need to know where the airplane is or who it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don''t fly the airplane itself; you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don''t go anywhere.

[NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCETo the citizens of the United States of America,In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today.Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The right honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up "aluminium". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed".2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn''t that hard.4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.6. You should stop playing American "football". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays "American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American "football", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys."Merde" is French for "sh*t".8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called "Indecisive Day".9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It''s been driving us bonkers.Thank you for your co-operation.]

[I took some clients out to dinner last week, and I noticed a spoon in the<br /> shirt pocket of our waiter as he handed us the menus. It seemed a little odd,<br /> but I dismissed it as a random thing. Until our busboy came with water and<br /> tableware; he too, sported a spoon in his breast pocket. I looked around the<br /> room, and all the waiters and busboys had spoons in their pockets. When our<br /> waiter returned to take our order, I just had to ask, "Why the spoons?" </p>\n<p>"Well," he explained, "our parent company recently hired some Andersen<br /> Consulting efficiency experts to review all our procedures, and after months of<br /> statistical analyses, they concluded that our patrons drop spoons on the floor<br /> 73% more often than any other utensil, at a frequency of 3 spoons per hour per<br /> workstation. By preparing our workers for this contingency in advance, we can<br /> cut our trips to the kitchen down and save time... nearly 1.5 extra man-hours<br /> per shift." Just as he concluded, a "ch-ching" came from the table behind him,<br /> and he quickly replaced the fallen spoon with the one from his pocket."I''ll grab<br /> another spoon the next time I''m in the kitchen instead of making a special<br /> trip," he proudly explained. </p>\n<p>I was impressed. "Thanks, I had to ask." </p>\n<p>"No problem," he answered. Then he continued to take our orders. As the<br /> members of our dinner party took their turns, my eyes darted back and forth from<br /> each person ordering and my menu. That''s when, out of the corner of my eye, I<br /> spotted a thin black thread protruding from our waiter''s fly. Again, I dismissed<br /> it; yet I had to scan the room and, sure enough, there were other waiters and<br /> busboys with strings hanging out of their trousers. My curiosity overrode<br /> discretion at this point, so before he could leave I had to ask. "Excuse me,<br /> but...uh...why, or what about that string?" </p>\n<p>"Oh, yeah," he began, in a quieter tone, "not many people are that observant.<br /> That same efficiency group found we could save time in the Men''s Room, too." </p>\n<p>"How''s that?" I asked. </p>\n<p>"You see, by tying a string to the end of our, uh, selves, we can pull it out<br /> at the urinals literally hands-free and thereby eliminate the need to wash our<br /> hands, cutting time spent in the washroom by over 93%!" </p>\n<p>"Hey, wait a minute. If the string helps you pull it out, how do you get it<br /> back in?" </p>\n<p>"Well," he whispered, "I don''t know about the other guys, but I use the<br /> spoon."]

[Here are answers to 5 of the toughest questions women ask men. </p>\n<p>1 - "What are you thinking?" </p>\n<p>2 - "Do you love me?" </p>\n<p>3 - "Do I look fat?" </p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she is prettier than me?" </p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example:</p>\n<p>1 - "What are you thinking?" </p>\n<p>The proper answer to this question, of course is, "I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you." </p>\n<p>Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things: </p>\n<p>a - Baseball </p>\n<p>b - Football </p>\n<p>c - How fat you are </p>\n<p>d - How much prettier she is than you </p>\n<p>e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. "If I wanted you to know," Al said, "I''d be talking instead of thinking." </p>\n<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers: </p>\n<p>2 - "Do you love me?" </p>\n<p>The correct answer to this question is, "Yes." For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, "Yes, dear." </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - I suppose so. </p>\n<p>b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes? </p>\n<p>c - That depends on what you mean by "love". </p>\n<p>d - Does it matter? </p>\n<p>e - Who, me? </p>\n<p>3 - "Do I look fat?" </p>\n<p>The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, "No, of course not" and then quickly leave the room. </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either. </p>\n<p>b - Compared to what? </p>\n<p>c - A little extra weight looks good on you. </p>\n<p>d - I''ve seen fatter. </p>\n<p>e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she''s prettier than me?" </p>\n<p>The "she" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, "No, you are much prettier." </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. </p>\n<p>b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things. </p>\n<p>c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality. </p>\n<p>d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner. </p>\n<p>e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>Correct answer: "Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino''s Pizza truck that came my way." </p>\n<p>This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid exchange: </p>\n<p>"Dear," said the wife. "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>"Why, dear, I would be extremely upset," said the husband. "Why do you ask such a question?" </p>\n<p>"Would you remarry?" persevered the wife. </p>\n<p>"No, of course not, dear" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Don''t you like being married?" said the wife. </p>\n<p>"Of course I do, dear" he said. </p>\n<p>"Then why wouldn''t you remarry?" </p>\n<p>"Alright," said the husband, "I''d remarry." </p>\n<p>"You would?" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>\n<p>"Yes" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Would you sleep with her in our bed?" said the wife after a long pause. </p>\n<p>"Well yes, I suppose I would." replied the husband. </p>\n<p>"I see," said the wife indignantly. </p>\n<p>"And would you let her wear my old clothes?" </p>\n<p>"I suppose, if she wanted to" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Really," said the wife icily. </p>\n<p>"And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?" </p>\n<p>"Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do." </p>\n<p>"Is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet. </p>\n<p>"And I suppose you''d let her play with my golf clubs, too." </p>\n<p>"Of course not, dear," said the husband. "She''s left-handed..."]

[A traveling salesman was driving down a farm road when his car suddenly<br /> stopped and wouldn''t start again. A farmer on a tractor was passing by and<br /> stopped to help the salesman fix his car. By the time they were finished, it was<br /> almost sundown, so the farmer told the salesman he could spend the night at his<br /> home if he didn''t mind sharing the bed with his twin daughters. The salesman<br /> thought the twins were kids, so he said it was okay. They farmer took the<br /> salesman to his home and went into the house.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes of talking and cleaning up, the men were called to the<br /> dinner table by the farmer''s wife. As they sat down, the salesman saw the two<br /> most beautiful young ladies he had ever seen. The farmer introduced them as his<br /> twin daughters. During the entire meal all the salesman thought about was he was<br /> sleeping in the same bed as the girls and he was going to have a good time that<br /> night. They all finished their supper and the men went and talked while the<br /> women finished cleaning up. The salesman couldn''t keep his mind off what was to<br /> be a good time. Finally it was time to go to bed and the salesman anxiously got<br /> prepared. The twins got into the bed, one on each side of the salesman. Just as<br /> the lights were going to be turned off, the farmer came into the bedroom and<br /> placed one egg on both sides of the salesman. The farmer said, "This is to make<br /> sure you don''t do anything with my daughters tonight!! If I come in tomorrow<br /> morning and find one or both eggs broken, I''ll know you did something and I''ll<br /> shoot you!! You understand? Well, the salesman looked at the eggs, the farmer,<br /> and the shotgun in the farmer''s hand and quietly replied that he understood.<br /> With that, the farmer told them goodnight and turned off the light.</p>\n<p>During the night, the salesman turned over and accidentally broke one of the<br /> eggs. "What the hell," he thought, "I''m dead anyway," and screwed the first<br /> twin. After several minutes of bliss, he rolled off of her and broke the other<br /> egg. "Might as well go out smiling," he thought and had his way with the second<br /> twin. When he was finished, he noticed that it was almost sunup and the farmer<br /> was starting to stir. Thinking quickly, he looked into his sales bag and got out<br /> a tube of superglue and glued the eggs back together. The glue dried quickly and<br /> the salesman jumped back into the bed and had just put both eggs back when the<br /> farmer entered.</p>\n<p>"I see the eggs are alright, so I guess I won''t shoot you. Want some<br /> breakfast?"</p>\n<p>"What are you making?" the salesman asked.</p>\n<p>Holding up the eggs, he said, "Eggs."</p>\n<p>"No thanks, I''ll eat later, I got to get going!!!" the salesman quickly said<br /> and grabbed his clothes and left.</p>\n<p>The farmer went to the stove and broke the first egg over the skillet, but<br /> nothing came out. He then broke the second egg and again, nothing came out.<br /> Extremely pissed off, the farmer walked out to the hen house and shouted,<br /> "Alright...which one of you roosters is wearing a rubber???"]
[By Barbara Florio GrahamFrom McCall''s, June, 1983I read every diet I can get my hands on.  I even follow their suggestions.  But eventually, inevitably, I always get fat again.

After living for almost 14 years with a man who never gains an ounce no matter what I serve him, I''ve found out what it is that keeps him thin: He thinks differently.  The real difference between fat and thin people is that thin people:avoid eating popcorn in the movies because it gets their hands greasy;split a large combination pizza with three friends;think Oreo cookies are for kids;nibble cashews one at a time;think that doughnuts are indigestible;read books they have to hold with both hands;become so absorbed in a weekend project they forget to have lunch;fill the candy dish on their desks with paper clips;counteract the midafternoon slump with a nap instead of a cinnamon Danish;exchange the deep-fryer they received for Christmas for a clock-radio;lose their appetites when they''re depressed;think chocolate Easter bunnies are for kids;save leftovers that are too skimpy to use for another meal in order to make interesting soups;throw out stale potato chips;will eat only Swiss or Dutch chocolate, which cannot be found except in a special store;think it''s too much trouble to stop at a special store just to buy chocolate;don''t celebrate with a hot-fudge sundae every time they lose a pound;warm up after skiing with black coffee instead of hot chocolate and whipped cream;try all the salads at the buffet, leaving room for only one dessert;find iced tea more refreshing than an ice-cream soda;get into such interesting conversations at cocktail parties that they never quite work their way over to the hors-d''oeuvre table;have no compulsion to keep the candy dish symmetrical by reducing the jelly beans to an equal number of each color;think that topping brownies with ice cream makes too rich a dessert;bring four cookies into the TV room instead of a box;think banana splits are for kids.]

If you eat something and no one sees you eat it, it has no calories.<br /> 2.  If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, the calories in the candy jar are canceled out by the diet soda.<br /> 3.  When you eat with someone else, calories don''t count if you do not eat more than they do.<br /> 4.  Food used for medicinal purposes NEVER count, such as hot chocolate, toast and Sara Lee Cheesecake.<br /> 5.  If you fatten up everyone else around you, then you look thinner.<br /> 6.  Movie related foods do not have additional calories because they are part of the entertainment package and not part of one''s personal fuel.  Examples: Milk Duds, buttered popcorn, Junior Mints,  Red Hots and Tootsie Rolls.<br /> 7.  Cookie pieces contain no calories. The process of breaking  causes calorie leakage.<br /> 8.  Things licked off knives and spoons have no calories if you are in the process of preparing something.<br /> 9.  Foods that have the same color have the same number of calories. Examples are: spinach and pistachio ice cream; mushrooms and mashed potatoes.<br /> 10.  Chocolate is a universal color and may be substituted for any other food color.<br /> 11.  Anything consumed while standing has no calories.  This is due to gravity and the density of the caloric mass.<br /> 12.  Anything consumed from someone else''s plate has no calories since the calories rightfully belong to the other person and will cling to his/her plate.

[One day, a man had an accident at work, which resulted in him getting his eye gouged out. He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency operation, was told by the doctor that he''d been given a glass eye. The man looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his original eye colour was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged. ''''I can''t walk around like this!!""Sir," the doctor said, "there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.'''' A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the road before finally hitting a tree. The man screeched to a halt, and ran down the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye! As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, no one was about. So the man proceeded to get a screwdriver and removed one of the deceased man''s blue eyes, replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to have the replacement blue eye fitted. A few days later, the man was driving along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads. ''''Excuse me, sir," said the policeman."Do you know anything about this at all?''''''''No, constable'''', said the man.''''Well, we can''t figure this out. Somehow, this bloke managed to drive 40 miles with two glass eyes!'''']

[Dear Mom and Dad, </p>\n<p>It has been three months since I left for college. I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay? </p>\n<p>Well, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and I now can see almost normally and I only get those sick headaches once a week. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm and he was the one who called the fire department and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dorm, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It''s really a basement room, but it''s kind of cute. </p>\n<p>He is a very fine boy and we have falled deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven''t exactly set the date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show. Yes, Mom and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me as a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boy friend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am taking daily.</p>\n<p>I know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind, and although not well educated, has ambitions. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know oft-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good, too, for I hear that his father is an important gun-bearer in the village in Africa from which he comes.</p>\n<p>Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no dormitory fire. I do not have a concussion or a skull fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged, I do not have syphilis and there is no colored man in my life. </p>\n<p>However, I am getting a ''D'' in history and an ''F'' in science class and I wanted you to see these marks in their proper perspective. </p>\n<p>Your loving daughter, </p>\n<p>Trish]

[The animals were bored.  Finally, the lion had an idea.  "I know a really exciting game that the humans play called football.  I''ve seen it on T.V."He proceeded to describe it to the rest of the animals and they all got excited about it so they decided to play.  They went out to the field and chose up teams and were ready to begin.The lion''s team received.  They were able to get two first downs and then had to punt.  The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick.  He caught the ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two rabbits.  He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to daylight, scoring six.Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0.Late in the first half the lion''s team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked the extra point.  The lion''s team led at halftime 7 - 6.  In the locker room, the lion gave a peptalk."Look you guys.  We can win this game.  We''ve got the lead and they only have one real threat.  We''ve got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he''s a killer. Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino."The second half began.  Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino''s team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino.  Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running.  First, he stomped two gazelles.  He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way.  It looked like he was home free.  Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead.  There were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened.  Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede."Did you do this?" he asked the centipede."Yeah, I did." the centipede replied.The lion retorted, "Where were you during the first half?""I was putting on my shoes."]
[An elderly couple were killed in an accident and found themselves being given a tour of heaven by Saint Peter.  "Here is your oceanside condo, over there are the tennis courts, swimming pool, and two golf courses.

[There were two old guys, Abe and Sol, sitting on a bench in a park feeding pigeons and talking about baseball, just like they did every day. Abe turns to Sol and says, "Do you think there''s baseball in heaven?"Soloman thinks about it for a minute and replies, "I dunno, Abe. But let''s make a deal: If I die first, I will come back and tell you -- and if you die first, you come back and tell me -- if there is baseball in heaven."They shake on it and, sadly, a few months later poor Abe passes on. One day soon afterward, Sol is sitting there feeding the pigeons by himself when he hears a voice whisper, "Sol... Sol...."Sol responds, "Abe! Is that you?""Yes it is Sol," whispers the spirit of Abe.Sol, still amazed, asks, "So, is there baseball in heaven?""Well," says Abe says, "I got good news and I got bad news.""Gimme the good news first," says Sol.Abe says, "Well... there is baseball in heaven."Sol says, "That''s great! What news could be bad enough to ruin that!?"Abe sighs and whispers, "You''re pitching on Friday."]
[Here are some basic descriptions of what may happen if airplanes had different<br /> operating systems running them.</p>\n<p>DOS: Everybody pushes it till it glides, then jumps on and lets it coast till<br /> it skids, then jumps off, pushes, jumps back on, etc.</p>\n<p>DOS with QEMM: Same as DOS, but with more leg room for pushing.</p>\n<p>Macintosh: All the flight attendants, captains and baggage handlers look the<br /> same, act the same and talk the same. Every time you ask a question, you are<br /> told you don''t need to know, don''t want to know and everything will be done for<br /> you without your knowing, so just shut up.</p>\n<p>OS/2: To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times<br /> by standing in 10 different lines. Then you fill out a form asking how you want<br /> your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger<br /> train or a bus. If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a<br /> wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have<br /> time to say your prayers before you crash.</p>\n<p>Windows: Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to<br /> a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up<br /> without any warning whatsoever.</p>\n<p>NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane<br /> uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare.<br /> Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want<br /> and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach<br /> tickets can''t even get aboard.</p>\n<p>Unix: Everyone brings one piece of the plane. Then they go on the runway and<br /> piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they''re<br /> building.</p>\n<p>CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13<br /> airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain<br /> hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don''t need to know where the airplane is or who<br /> it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don''t fly the airplane itself;<br /> you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don''t<br /> go anywhere. But that''s okay, because when the world is at your fingertips you<br /> never need to leave home.]

[If you are not familiar with golf, you probably won''t get these. Ask your closest golf player.</p>\n<p>1. Never try to keep more than 300 separate thoughts in your mind during your swing.</p>\n<p>2. When your shot has to carry over a water hazard, you can either hit one more club or two more balls.</p>\n<p>3. If you are afraid a full shot might reach the green while the group ahead are still putting, you have two options: you can immediately shank a lay-up, or you can wait until the green is clear and top a ball halfway there.</p>\n<p>4. The less skilled the player, the more likely he is to share his ideas about the golf swing.</p>\n<p>5. If it isn''t broke, try changing your grip.</p>\n<p>6. Golfers who claim they don''t cheat also lie.</p>\n<p>7. Everyone replaces his divot after a perfect approach shot.</p>\n<p>8. A golf match is a test of your skill against your opponent''s luck.</p>\n<p>9. It''s surprisingly easy to sink a 50 foot putt when you lie.</p>\n<p>10. Counting on your opponent to inform you when he breaks a rule is like expecting him to make fun of his own haircut.</p>\n<p>11. Nonchalant putts count the same as chalant putts.</p>\n<p>12. It''s not a gimme putt if you''re still away.</p>\n<p>13. The shortest distance between any two points on a golf course is a straight line that passes directly through the large tree.</p>\n<p>14. There are two kinds of bounces: unfair bounces and bounces just the way you intended to play it.</p>\n<p>15. You can hit a two-acre fairway 10% of the time and a 2-inch branch on a tree 90% of the time.</p>\n<p>16. Every time a golfer makes a birdie he must subsequently make three triple bogeys to restore the fundamental equilibrium of the universe.</p>\n<p>17. If you want to hit a 7-iron as far as Tiger Woods try to hit just short of a water hazard.</p>\n<p>18. To calculate the speed of a player''s downswing, multiply the speed of his backswing by his handicap. Example, backswing 20 miles per hour, handicap, 15, downswing 300<br /> m.p.h.</p>\n<p>19. There are two things you can learn by stopping your backswing at the top and checking the position of your hands: how many hands you have, and which hand is wearing<br /> the golf glove.</p>\n<p>20. Hazards attract; Fairways repel.</p>\n<p>21. You can put "draw" on the ball, you can put "fade" on the ball, but no golfer can put "straight" on the ball.</p>\n<p>22. A ball you can see in the rough from 50 yards away is not yours.</p>\n<p>23. If there is a ball in the fringe and a ball in the bunker, your ball is in the bunker.</p>\n<p>24. If both balls are in the sand, yours is in the footprint.</p>\n<p>25. Don''t buy a putter until you have had a chance to throw it.</p>\n<p>26. The inevitable result of any golf lesson is the instant elimination of the one critical unconscious motion that allowed you to compensate for all your errors.]

[It has become pretty obvious to us Southerners that our present<br /> astrological signs have served their purpose and that we should get rid of<br /> them.  When I''m out driving around I''ll see bulls, and once in a great<br /> while I suppose I''ll even see a ram.  Up the street from me there''s some<br /> twins, but I don''t see them much. The rest of these things are just too<br /> obscure.  You only see crabs on vacation. There are no lions or scorpions,<br /> not many archers and no damn water bearers.  Virgins? The neighborhood''s<br /> not crawling with them either.  SO, what we need here is some relevance.

Stay away from Moon Pies.</p>\n<p>CHITLIN  Jan 21 - Feb 19</p>\n<p>Chitlins often come from humble backgrounds.  Many times they''re<br /> uncomfortable talking about just where they came from. A chitlin, however,<br /> can make something of himself if he''s motivated and has plenty of<br /> seasoning. When it comes to dealing with Chitlins, be very careful.<br /> Chitlins can burn and then erupt like Vesuvius, and this can make for a<br /> really terrible mess. Chitlins are best with Catfish and Okra.  Remember<br /> that when marriage time rolls around.</p>\n<p>BOLL WEEVIL  Feb 20 - Mar 20</p>\n<p>You have an overwhelming curiosity. You''re unsatisfied with the surface of<br /> things, and you feel the need to bore deep into the interior of everything.<br /> Needless to say, you are very intense and driven as if you had some inner<br /> hunger. Nobody in their right mind is going to marry you, so don''t worry<br /> about it.</p>\n<p>MOON PIE  Mar 21 - Apr 20</p>\n<p>You''re the type that spends a lot of time on the front porch. It''s a cinch<br /> to recognize the physical appearance of Moon Pies. "Big" and "round" are<br /> the key words here. You should marry anybody who you can get remotely<br /> interested in the idea.

[Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound. Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one. Moses turned to Jesus and said, "I hate playing with your Dad."]

[Here are some basic descriptions of what may happen if airplanes had different operating systems running them.DOS: Everybody pushes it till it glides, then jumps on and lets it coast till it skids, then jumps off, pushes, jumps back on, etc.DOS with QEMM:  Same as DOS, but with more leg room for pushing.Macintosh:  All the flight attendants, captains and baggage handlers look the same, act the same and talk the same.  Every time you ask a question, you are told you don''t need to know, don''t want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can''t even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.  Then they go on the runway and piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they''re building.CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13 airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don''t need to know where the airplane is or who it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don''t fly the airplane itself; you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don''t go anywhere. But that''s okay, because when the world is at your fingertips you never need to leave home.</p>\n<p>Joke found on http://www.ahajokes.com]

The lesser player was very proud, and never wanted to take any strokes to even up the game.<br /> One Saturday morning, he shows up with a gorilla at the first tee. He says to his friend, "I''ve been trying to beat you for so long that I''m about ready to give up. But, I heard about this golfing gorilla, and I was wondering if it would be alright if he plays for me today. In fact if you''re game, I''d like to try to get back all the money I''ve lost to you this year. I figure comes to about a thousand bucks. Are you willing?" </p>\n<p>The other guy thought about it for a minute, and then decided to play the gorilla. "After all, how good could a gorilla be at golf?" he thought. </p>\n<p>Well, the first hole was a straightaway par 4 of 450 yards. The guy hits a beautiful tee shot, 275 yards down the middle, leaving himself a 6 iron to the green. The gorilla takes a few powerful practice swings and then laces the ball 450 yards, right at the pin, stopping about 6 inches away from the hole. </p>\n<p>The guy turns to his friend and says "That''s incredible, I would have never believed it if I hadn''t seen it with my own eyes. But, you know what, I''ve seen enough. I''ve got no interest in being totally humiliated by this gorilla golfing machine. You send this frigging gorilla back to where he comes from.

[Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound.<br /> Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the center of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. </p>\n<p>The third guy got up and sort of randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree.

On the way to the pond, the ball hit a little stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away.

[It seems that The Count on Sesame Street was giving a lecture on his<br /> thoughts on Godel''s Theorem and there was a great need for extra transportation<br /> services to this event. After all, people like Gordon, Bob, Maria, Mr. Hooper,<br /> and all can only take so much of the "Which is not like the other" mentality.<br /> Anyway, since the Speedy Delivery Service run by Mr.McFeeley (what a name for<br /> a character on a children''s show!) was being pushed out of Mr. Roger''s<br /> Neighborhood by Federal Express, he thought he would sign on as a bus driver<br /> for the Sesame Street Bus Company. Besides, he was do for another trip to the<br /> Magic Kingdom and that was getting expensive these days. </p>\n<p>        On the morning of the big event he kissed his wife goodbye and hopped<br /> onto his bus and began driving his route. At the first stop there were two<br /> rather plump twins, so he stopped. As they got on he said "Hi there! Welcome to<br /> the Sesame St. bus! I''m Mr. McFeeley, who are you?" The twins said "We''re<br /> named Patty" and they then waddled to their seats. He started to drive and at<br /> the next stop he saw a rather dejected looking man and stopped to pick him up.<br /> "Hi there", said Mr. McFeeley,"why do you look so said?" The man said, " I have<br /> no friends and I''m terribly lonely." With that Mr. Mcfeeley replied,"what is<br /> your name?" The man replied, "Saul". "Well, you can be my special friend Saul",<br /> said Mr. McFeeley. The man looked much happier and skipped to his seat. Mr.<br /> McFeeley then went on his way to the next bus stop and saw two men waiting,<br /> though one looked rather familiar. He stopped and gave his greeting to the<br /> first man. Mr. McFeeley learned that his name was Lester Cheese. Mr. McFeeley<br /> then recognized the other man to be Don Rickles. Apparently he looked to be<br /> in some kind of pain. "Welcome to the Sesame Street Bus Mr. Rickles! You look<br /> like you''re in a lot of pain." "That''s right, I''ve got bunyons you hockey puck!"<br /> And with that Mr. McFeeley completed his route to the symposium.</p>\n<p> When Mr. McFeeley returned home his wife said, "How did it go today<br /> dear?"

The referee will always be looking the other way when you score. The day you leave work early to make it to class on time, the sensei will be sick. The sensei will only use you during demonstrations for joint-locking techniques. If you have to use your training in self-defense, your attacker''s father will be a lawyer.

[A woman was having a daytime affair while her husband was at work. One wet and dreary day she was in bed with her boyfriend when, to her horror, she heard her husband''s car pull into the driveway. "Oh My God hurry! Grab your clothes," she yelled to her lover, "and jump out the window. My husband''s home early!""I can''t jump out the window!" came the strangled reply from beneath the sheets, "It''s raining out there!""If my husband catches us in here, he''ll kill us both!" she replied. "He''s got a very quick temper and a very large gun! The rain is the least of your problems."So the boyfriend scoots out of bed, grabs his clothes and jumps out the window! As he begins running down the street in the pouring rain, he quickly discovers he has run right into the middle of the town''s annualmarathon. So he starts running along beside the others, about 300 of them.Being naked, with his clothes tucked under his arm, he tries to "blend in" as best he can. After a little while, a small group of runners, who had been studying him with some curiosity, jogged closer. "Do you always run in the nude?" one asked."Oh yes" he replied, gasping in air. "It feels so wonderfully free having the air blow over all your skin while you''re running."Another runner moved alongside. "Do you always run carrying your clothes with you under your arm?""Oh, yes" our friend answered breathlessly. "That way I can get dressed right at the end of the run and get in my car to go home!"Then a third runner cast his eyes a little lower and queried. "Do you always wear a condom when you run?""Only if it''s raining."]
[Johnny was 8 years old and like other boys his age rather<br /> curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about ''courting'' from<br /> the older boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done.<br /> One day he took his question to his mother, who became rather<br /> flustered. </p>\n<p>Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide<br /> behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her<br /> boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described<br /> EVERYTHING to his mother. "Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked<br /> for a while, then he started kissing and hugging herI figured<br /> ''Sis must be getting sickbecause her face started looking funny.<br /> He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her<br /> blouse to feel her heart, just &gt; the way the doctor would.<br /> Except he''s not as smart as the docotr because he seemed to have<br /> trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too,<br /> because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all<br /> out of breath. His other hand must have been cold because he put<br /> it under her skirt. About this time ''Sis got worse and began to<br /> moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of<br /> the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a<br /> fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. Finally, I<br /> found out what was making them so sick -- a big eel had gotten<br /> inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and<br /> stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway he grabbed it<br /> in one hand to keep it from getting away. When Sis saw it, she<br /> got really scared -- her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open,<br /> and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said<br /> it was the biggest one she''s ever seen; I should tell her about<br /> the ones down at the lake by our house! Anyway, Sis got brave<br /> and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a<br /> sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he<br /> took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel''s<br /> head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her<br /> legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by<br /> lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis<br /> started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset<br /> the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it<br /> between them. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed<br /> the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of<br /> its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a<br /> little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting<br /> anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the<br /> eel wasn''t dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight<br /> again. I guess eels are like cats -- they have nine lives or<br /> something. This time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill it by<br /> sitting on it. After about a 35 minute struggle, they finally<br /> killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because I saw Sis''s<br /> boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet.]

[Osama bin Laden has a heart attack and dies. He immediately goes<br /> to hell, where the devil is waiting for him.<br /> "I don''t know what to do here," the devil says. "You''re on my<br /> list, but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to<br /> stay here, so I''ll tell you what I''m going to do: I''ve got a<br /> couple of people here who weren''t quite as bad as you.

I''m not a good swimmer<br /> and I don''t think I could do that all day long." </p>\n<p>So the devil led him to the next room. In it was the Ayatollah<br /> Khomeini with a sledgehammer and a huge pile of rocks. All he<br /> did was swing that hammer, time after time after time. </p>\n<p>"No, I''ve got this problem with my shoulder. I''d be in constant<br /> agony if all I did was break rocks all day," bin Laden<br /> commented. </p>\n<p>So the devil opened a third door.

[''The Xmas-Files''by Frank Cammuso and Hart Seely  57 Elm Street Bethlehem, Pa. 11:51 p.m., December 24th.''We''re too late! It''s already been here.'' ''Mulder, I hope you know what you''re doing.'' ''Look, Scully, just like the other homes: Douglas fir, truncated, mounted, transformed into a shrine; halls decked with boughs of holly; stockings hung by the chimney, with care.'' ''You really think someone''s been here?'' ''Someone, or something.'' ''Mulder, over here--it''s a fruitcake.'' ''Don''t touch it! Those things can be lethal.'' ''It''s O.K. There''s a note attached: ''Gonna find out who''s naughty and nice.'''' ''It''s judging them, Scully. It''s making a list.'' ''Who? What are you talking about?'' ''Ancient mythology tells of an obese humanoid entity who could travel at  great speed in a craft powered by antlered servants. Once a year, near the winter solstice, this creature is said to descend from the heavens to reward its followers and punish disbelievers with jagged chunks of anthracite.'' ''But that''s legend, Mulder--a story told by parents to frighten children. Surely you don''t believe it?'' ''Something was here tonight, Scully. Check out the bite marks on this gingerbread man. Whatever tore through this plate of cookies was massive--and in a hurry.'' ''It left crumbs everywhere. And look, Mulder, this milk glass has been completely drained.'' ''It gorged itself, Scully. It fed without remorse.'' ''But why would they leave it milk and cookies?'' ''Appeasement. Tonight is the Eve, and nothing can stop its wilding.'' ''But if this thing does exist, how did it get in? The doors and windows were locked. There''s no sign of forced entry.'' ''Unless I miss my guess, it came through the fireplace.'' ''Wait a minute, Mulder. If you''re saying some huge creature landed on the roof and came down this chimney, you''re crazy. The flue is barely six inches wide. Nothing could get down there.'' ''But what if it could alter its shape, move in all directions at once?'' ''You mean, like a bowl full of jelly?'' ''Exactly. Scully, I''ve never told anyone this, but when I was a child my home was visited. I saw the creature. It had long white shanks of fur surrounding its ruddy, misshapen head. Its bloated torso was red and white. I''ll never forget the horror. I turned away, and when I looked back it had somehow taken on the facial features of my father.'' ''Impossible.'' ''I know what I saw. And that night it read my mind. It brought me a Mr. Potato Head, Scully. It knew that I wanted a Mr. Potato Head!'' ''I''m sorry, Mulder, but you''re asking me to disregard the laws of physics. You want me to believe in some supernatural being who soars across the skies and brings gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen to what you''re saying. Do you understand the repercussions? If this gets out, they''ll close the X-files.'' ''Scully, listen to me: It knows when you''re sleeping. It knows when you''re awake.'' ''But we have no proof.'' ''Last year, on this exact date, SETI radio telescopes detected bogeys in the airspace over twenty-seven states. The White House ordered a Condition Red.'' ''But that was a meteor shower.'' ''Officially. Two days ago, eight prized Scandinavian reindeer vanished from the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C. Nobody--not even the zookeeper--was told about it. The government doesn''t want people to know about Project Kringle. They fear that if this thing is proved to exist the public will stop spending half its annual income in a holiday shopping frenzy.

[DETROIT--With third-quarter sales sluggish and its share of the domestic<br /> market down 11 percent since 1993, General Motors unveiled a new instant-win<br /> airbag contest Monday. The new airbags, which award fabulous prizes upon<br /> violent, high-speed impact with another car or stationary object, will come<br /> standard in all of the company''s 1997 cars.</p>\n<p>    "Auto accidents have never been so exciting," said GM vice-president of<br /> marketing Roger Jenkins, who expects the contest to boost 1997 sales<br /> significantly. "When you play the new GM Instant Win Airbag Game, your next<br /> fatal collision could mean a trip for two to Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans. Or<br /> a year''s worth of free Mobil gasoline."</p>\n<p>    Though it does not officially begin until Jan. 1, 1997, the airbag<br /> promotion is already being tested in select cities, with feedback overwhelmingly<br /> positive. "As soon as my car started to skid out of control, I thought to<br /> myself, ''Oh, boy, this could be it--I could be a big winner!''" said Cincinnati''s<br /> Martin Frelks, who lost his wife but won $50 Sunday when the Buick LeSabre they<br /> were driving hit an oil slick at 60 mph and slammed into an oncoming truck.<br /> "When the car stopped rolling down the embankment, I knew Ellen was dead, but<br /> all I could think about was getting the blood and glass out of my eyes so I<br /> could read that airbag!"</p>\n<p>    Hartford, CT, resident Jonathan Ryerson was killed Sunday when his 1997<br /> Pontiac LeMans hit a freight train. Ryerson won $50 in the accident. "It''s<br /> really addictive," said Sacramento, CA, resident Marjorie Kamp, speaking from<br /> her hospital bed, where she is listed in critical condition with severe brain<br /> hemorrhaging and a punctured right lung. "I''ve already crashed four cars trying<br /> to win those Super Bowl tickets, but I still haven''t won. I swear, I''m going to<br /> win those tickets--even if it kills me!" </p>\n<p>    Kamp said that as soon as she is well enough, she plans to buy a new<br /> Pontiac Bonneville and drive it into a tree.  GM officials are not surprised the<br /> airbag contest has been so well received. "In the past, nobody really liked car<br /> wrecks, and that''s understandable. After all, they''re scary and dangerous and,<br /> sometimes, even fatal," GM CEO Paul Offerman said. "But now, when you drive a<br /> new GM car or truck, your next serious crash could mean serious cash. Who<br /> wouldn''t like that?" </p>\n<p>    Offerman added that in the event a motorist wins a prize but is killed,<br /> that prize will be awarded to the next of kin.   According to GM''s official<br /> contest rules, odds of winning the grand prize, a brand-new 1997 Cutlass<br /> Supreme, are 1 in 43,000,000. Statistical experts, however, say the real chances<br /> of winning are significantly worse. "If you factor in the odds of getting in a<br /> serious car accident in the first place--approximately 1 in 720,000--the actual<br /> odds of winning a prize each time you step in your car are more like 1 in 31<br /> trillion."  Further, even if one is in an accident, there is no guarantee the<br /> airbag will inflate. "I was recently broadsided by a drunk driver in my new<br /> Chevy Cavalier," said Erie, PA, resident Jerry Polaner. "My car was totaled, and<br /> because it was the side of my car that got hit, my airbag didn''t even inflate.<br /> But what really gets me is the fact that the drunk driver, who rammed my side<br /> with the front of his 1997 Buick Regal, won a $100 Office Depot gift<br /> certificate. That''s just wrong."]

[A few years ago, I applied for a job at Kodak.  I made it through all the interviews with flying colours, and the only thing left was the drug test.  I was confident in passing, but there was one slight problem: I have *very* shy kidneys.  I''ve had to sneak out of the doctor''s office on more than one occasion, because I can''t "go" and fill up a cup on command.  Usually, this is a good thing, as I can go to a concert or football game, drink beer all day, and be fine until I get home, while my friends are standing in line in the bathrooms several times during the same time period.So, to prepare, on the morning I had to take the test, I drank my usual 10-cup pot of coffee, and several large glasses of water, and for the 20-minute trip to Kodak, I filled a plastic gallon jug with water, and finished it off on the way.   Now, Kodak has huge parking lots, each containg hundreds and hundreds of cars, and by the time I got there, the visitor''s lots were pretty full, and I had to park way in the back.As soon as I got out of my car, I''m thinking, "Good, it worked, I think I can go!"  By the time I''d finished the 10-minute walk to the entrance, I was thinking, "Boy, no problems now, I can *definitely* go!"To get in, I had to go past a security hut.  I told them why I was there, and they told me where to report, about another 10-minute walk, a little ways into the plant.  I had to pass building after building before I got to the right one, every step of the way, becoming actually painful, and before I was there, I was looking at bushes and doorways and the like, thinking, "Well, if it gets too bad, I could go there, or maybe there, or..."By the time I got to the right building, I was just about in agony. I found the right area, and the receptionist told me to take a seat with about 8 other people.  I sat down, thinking that would help, but 10 seconds later I was up, walking around, trying to read stuff on the wall, anything to keep my mind occuppied, but managing to read 5 or 10 words, and then having to pace again.Finally, I couldn''t take it anymore, and after having asked the girl a couple of times how long, I told her, "look, either you get me in *now*, or I use the bathroom over there, and we reschedule!!" She said she''d see what she could do, and left.  I went back to sit down, and it took all of 5 seconds before I was up pacing again. She came back a few minutes later, and told me to go on in.When I got to the actual room, there were 4 people standing in line.  I hopped up and down a couple of times, before I passed the others, went to the nurses, and told them I have to go **NOW**!!! They asked the others in line if anyone objected, and they said no, so they said as soon as one of the 2 bathrooms come free, I could go.  I snatched the cup out of his hand, and practically raced down the aisle to the bathrooms and just stood waiting.  It couldn''t have been more than 20 seconds or so, but they were some of the most agonizing seconds of my life!!Finally, one of the doors opened, and I nearly flattened some poor girl coming out in my rush to get in.  I closed the door, grabbed my pants, breathed in, and dropped them and then my underwear, and then the world caved in...  I started going.  And going.  And going. I could have knocked down the Berlin wall with the force!   But the problem was, that I couldn''t "grab" it!!  It was whipping around like one of those Water Wiggle things.  I''m trying like heck to reign it it in, but just couldn''t.  I''m dancing around in a circle, with my pants around my ankles, trying to grab it, and it was just about impossible for probably a good 15 seconds.  Finally, I did, and was able to aim in the toilet, just remembering at the end to put a shot or two in the cup to put on the little shelf.   By the time I''d stopped, I was physically spent, and just leaned up against the wall, feeling like I''d just run a marathon...It was then that was able to survey the bathroom.  It was a room, about 7x7, but my god...  I had finished the most intense pee of my life in the john, but before I''d gained control, I''d soaked the entire toilet, the sink, the floor, the walls.  You name it, it was drenched -- including my pants and underwear.  I tried soaking it up with toilet paper (using the whole roll as a sponge), but that was drenched and didn''t work that well.  I''d also soaked the extra rolls on the back of the toilet, the paper towel holder, and the extra roll of paper towels.  I went through the garbage, pulling out half-soaked old towels, just trying to make the place semi-presentable, as in the sink and the mirror, but it didn''t do much good.  I was just ending up pushing the wet around, so I finally gave up.Steeling myself, I pulled up my wet underwear, then my wet pants, and pulled down my semi-wet shirt as much as possible, and went out. I whipped back up the aisle, thanking the nurse, without slowing down, and out the door as fast as my legs would carry me, imagining what the next person to use that bathroom would encounter. The silver lining:  I got the job!!]
[A married man and his secretary were having a torrid affair. One afternoon they couldn''t contain their passion, so they rushed over to her place where they spent the afternoon making passionate love. When they were finished, they fell asleep, not waking until 8 o''clock. They got dressed quickly. Then the man asked his secretary to take his shoes outside and rub them on the lawn. Bewildered, she did as he asked thinking him pretty weird.</p>\n<p>The man finally got home and his wife met him at the door. Upset, she asked where he''d been.

[Veteran Pillsbury spokesman Pop N. Fresh died yesterday of a severe yeast<br /> infection. He was 71. Known to friends as Brown-n-Serve, Fresh was an avid<br /> gardener and tennis player. Fresh was buried in one of the largest funeral<br /> ceremonies in recent years. Dozens of celebrities turned out including Mrs.<br /> Butter worth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Aunt Jemima, Betty Crocker,<br /> the Hostess Twinkies, and Skippy. The graveside was piled high with flours as<br /> longtime friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing fresh as a man who<br /> "never knew how much he was kneaded."</p>\n<p>Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with many<br /> turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough<br /> on half-baked schemes -- conned by those who puttered him up. Still, even as a<br /> crusty old man, he was a roll model for millions. His second wife survives<br /> fresh. They have two children and another bun in the oven. The funeral was held<br /> at 350 for about 20 minutes.]

[There was this guy who bought an elderly circus elephant. Alas, he couldn''t afford to feed it. He''d never seen an elephant jump with all 4 feet off the ground. So he started a contest: entry was $10, and the first person to get the elephant to jump with all 4 feet off the ground would get $50,<br /> 000.</p>\n<p>All sorts of people tried, but nobody could get the elephant to jump. Finally, this little guy arrives in a limousine. He''s carrying a baseball bat. He walks up to the elephant, swings the bat, and crunches the elephants balls pretty badly. Needless to say, the elephant jumps, and the owner pays out the $50,<br /> 000. Unfortunately, the owner had barely collected enough to cover the prize, so he ran another contest.</p>\n<p>He''d never seen an elephant swing its head back and forth as if to say, "no." Same deal as before: $10 per entry, $50,000 prize. Lots of people try and fail. Then the little guy shows up in his limousine again, pulls out his bat, and walks up to the elephant. He says, "Remember me?" The elephant nods yes.</p>\n<p>The man then holds up his bat and says, "Want me to use this again?" The elephant nods his head rather emphatically no....]

[In downtown Roanoke, at a crowded bus stop, a good friend of mine was waiting for her bus. She''s very attractive and was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt  with matching tight leather boots and jacket. As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.</p>\n<p>Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again she tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover she still couldn''t!</p>\n<p>So, a little more embarrassed she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, much to her chagrin she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.</p>\n<p>So, with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.</p>\n<p>About this time a big burly man that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus.

[What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>1 - "What are you thinking?"</p>\n<p>The proper answer to this question, of course is, "I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you." Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things:</p>\n<p>a -  Baseball b -  Football c -  How fat you are d -  How much prettier she is than you e -  How he would spend the insurance money if you died</p>\n<p>According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. "If I wanted you to know," Al said, "I''d be talking instead of thinking."</p>\n<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers:</p>\n<p>2 - "Do you love me?"</p>\n<p>The correct answer to this question is, "Yes." For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, "Yes, dear." Wrong answers include:</p>\n<p>a - I suppose so. b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes? c - That depends on what you mean by "love". d - Does it matter? e - Who, me?</p>\n<p>3 - "Do I look fat?"</p>\n<p>The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, "No, of course not" and then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include:</p>\n<p>a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either. b - Compared to what? c - A little extra weight looks good on you. d - I''ve seen fatter. e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she''s prettier than me?"</p>\n<p>The "she" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, "No, you are much prettier." Wrong answers include:</p>\n<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things. c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality. d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner. e - Could you repeat the question?  I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?"</p>\n<p>Correct answer: "Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino''s Pizza truck that came my way." This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid exchange:</p>\n<p>"Dear," said the wife. "What would you do if I died?" "Why, dear, I would be extremely upset," said the husband."Why do you ask such a question?" "Would you remarry?" persevered the wife. "No, of course not, dear" said the husband. "Don''t you like being married?" said the wife. "Of course I do, dear" he said. "Then why wouldn''t you remarry?" "Alright," said the husband, "I''d remarry." "You would?" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. "Yes" said the husband. "Would you sleep with her in our bed?" said the wife after a long pause. "Well yes, I suppose I would." replied the husband. "I see," said the wife indignantly. "And would you let her wear my old clothes? "I suppose, if she wanted to" said the husband. "Really," said the wife icily. "And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?" "Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do." "Is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet. "And I suppose you''d let her play with my golf clubs, too." "Of course not, dear," said the husband. "She''s left-handed..."]

[Murphy''s Laws Of Law Enforcement</p>\n<p>1. Bullet Proof vests aren''t. </p>\n<p>2. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.  They also punch, kick and<br /> choke harder too. </p>\n<p>3. The speed at which you respond to a fight call is inversely proportional to how long you''ve been a cop. </p>\n<p>4. Tear gas works on cops too, and regardless of wind direction, will always blow back in your face. </p>\n<p>5. High speed chases will always proceed from an area of light traffic to an area of extremely heavy traffic. </p>\n<p>6. If you know someone who tortures animals and wets the bed, he is either a serial killer or he works for Internal Affairs. </p>\n<p>7. Placing a gun back in a shoulder holster with your finger on the trigger will cause you to walk with a limp. </p>\n<p>8. Flash hiders don''t really. </p>\n<p>9. If you have cleared all the rooms and met no resistance, you and your entry team have probably kicked in the door of the wrong house.</p>\n<p>10. If a cop swings a baton in a fight, he will hit other cops more often than he will hit the bad guys he swings at. </p>\n<p>11. Domestic arguments will always migrate from an area of few available weapons (living room), to an area with many available weapons (kitchen). </p>\n<p>12. If you have just punched out a handcuffed prisoner for spitting at you, you are about to become a star on Eyewitness News.</p>\n<p>13. Bullets work on veteran cops too.  They also work on weight lifters, martial arts experts, department marksmen, Vice cops, S.W.A.T. jocks, and others who consider themselves immortal. </p>\n<p>14. When a civilian sees a blue light approaching at a high rate of speed,<br /> he will always pull into the lane the cop needs to use. </p>\n<p>15. If you drive your patrol car to the geometric center of the Gobi Desert, within five minutes a dumb-ass civilian will pull along side you and ask for directions. </p>\n<p>16. You can never drive slow enough to please the citizens who don''t need a cop, and you can never drive fast enough to please the ones who do. </p>\n<p>17. Any suspect with a rifle is a better shot than any cop with a pistol. </p>\n<p>18. From behind you, the bad guys can see your night sights as well as you<br /> can. </p>\n<p>19. On any call, there will always be more bad guys than there are good guys, and the farther away your back-up, the more there will be.</p>\n<p>20. The longer you''ve been a cop, the shorter your flashlight and your temper gets. </p>\n<p>21. Whatever you are about to do, if there is a good chance it will get you killed, you probably shouldn''t do it. </p>\n<p>22. You should never do a shotgun search of a dark warehouse with a cop whose nickname is "Boomer". </p>\n<p>23. The better you do your job, the more likely you are to be shot, injured, complained on, sued, investigated, or subpoenaed on your day off. </p>\n<p>24.

[There was once a famous explorer who would travel around the<br /> world videotaping exotic things from around the world.

So, he and his film crews spent 5 years roaming around<br /> the world taping any exotic dance they could come across. They<br /> ended up in Australia after videotaping the last dance they had<br /> ever heard of. Suddenly, an old lady comes up to them and says<br /> "Have you gotten the Butcher dance?"</p>\n<p>The explorers did not know what the Butcher dance was, so they<br /> asked the old lady.</p>\n<p>"Well, there''s a very secretive tribe of Aborigines in the<br /> outback that only do this dance called the Butcher dance once a<br /> year.

"Do you know where we can<br /> find this tribe?"</p>\n<p>The lady replied "Yes I do, and if you leave tomorrow, you<br /> should just make it in time. First, you need to travel 2 hours<br /> west into the outback, then 5 hours north. You will come to a<br /> mountain range. You must leave your vehicles at the range. Then,<br /> you climb over the mountain range, which is very treacherous.<br /> Then, you will need to ford a river at the bottom of the<br /> mountains. There should be a tribe of aborigines on the other<br /> side that will guide you to the next tribe for something<br /> valuable in return. They will lead you to a cliff on a plateau.<br /> You must scale down the cliff, and then it is an hour walk<br /> across a desert to a group of small hills, and over those hills<br /> will be the aborigines with the dance you seek."</p>\n<p>Well, the explorer knows that he must get this dance to complete<br /> his taping. So, he and his crew set off. 2 hours west, and then<br /> after 4 hours north, their cars break down, so they''re forced to<br /> walk the remaining distance with all their equipment across the<br /> hot landscape. When they finally come to the mountains, 2 of the<br /> group lose their footing and fall to their deaths. They finally<br /> make it over the mountains, but the river has been engorged with<br /> a flood. 1 crewman drowns while he tries to swim across, so the<br /> remaining people are forced to build makeshift rafts. However,<br /> the rafts start to sink, and half of their camera equipment is<br /> lost. They come to the group of aborigines who will guide them<br /> to the next group, and offer them money. They refuse, and the<br /> explorers offer them some of their cameras. The aborigines<br /> refuse that, as well. So, the famous explorer makes his<br /> sacrifice, and offers the only female member of his crew, which<br /> they accept. They are given a guide who leads them to the cliff.<br /> One of the crewmen gets vertigo, and accidentally falls off the<br /> cliff tom his death. The explorer and his one remaining crewman<br /> set off across the desert, and his crewman drops because of heat<br /> stroke. So, the explorer picks up a small camera, and drags his<br /> ragged self across the desert, up the hills, and he can hear<br /> drums!</p>\n<p>He pulls himself up the top of the hill, and the drums stop. He<br /> stumbles down to the village elder, and once they have found a<br /> translator, proceeds to ask him when the Butcher dance will take<br /> place.</p>\n<p>"I''m very sorry, but we have just finished with our Butcher<br /> dance." "Well, can''t you please do it again, for me? It''s very<br /> important! You don''t know what we''ve been through!" "We cannot<br /> do that. It would anger our gods, and we need them to watch over<br /> our livestock and our crops and our water.</p>\n<p>So, the explorer heads back to where he started from, and<br /> finally makes it back and resolves to try again next year. So he<br /> spends the year renting out a house in Australia and gathering<br /> everything he''ll need. He gets mountain climbing gear, an<br /> inflatable raft, blow-up dolls, and a car repair kit. He takes<br /> all the precautions, and with a new crew, sets off. </p>\n<p>When they arrive at the mountains, one of his crew notices a<br /> path in the mountains that wasn''t apparent, so they drive<br /> through, and make it to the river, which has dried up. They<br /> cross the dried-up riverbed, and the aborigines have moved away<br /> because of a lack of water. So, they carry on from the memory of<br /> their leader. Midway through the desert, however, one car hits a<br /> rock and tips, and the other car couldn''t turn in time, and<br /> there''s a horrible accident. By sheer willpower, the explorer<br /> climbs bloodied and beaten from the wreckage, finds one camera<br /> that still works, and stumbles on into the village. He is<br /> immediately recognized by the elder.</p>\n<p>"Oh, you! You have come just in time to see the Butcher dance!<br /> We will delay it for a little bit so that you can be healed of<br /> your wounds!" "No, I don''t want to waste that time. I''ll be<br /> fine. Just start the Butcher dance!"</p>\n<p>This is the time he''s been waiting for two years. Finally, his 7<br /> year work will be complete. He fires up his camera and watches<br /> the dancers as they come out. They form a circle, and start to<br /> sing:</p>\n<p>"You butcher right hand in, you butcher right hand out..."]

[By Barbara Florio GrahamFrom McCall''s, June, 1983I read every diet I can get my hands on.  I even follow their suggestions.  But eventually, inevitably, I always get fat again.  Now, at last, I''ve found The Answer.  After living for almost 14 years with a man who never gains an ounce no matter what I serve him, I''ve found out what it is that keeps him thin: He thinks differently.  The real difference between fat and thin people is that thin people:avoid eating popcorn in the movies because it gets their hands greasy;split a large combination pizza with three friends;think Oreo cookies are for kids;nibble cashews one at a time;think that doughnuts are indigestible;read books they have to hold with both hands;become so absorbed in a weekend project they forget to have lunch;fill the candy dish on their desks with paper clips;counteract the midafternoon slump with a nap instead of a cinnamon Danish;exchange the deep-fryer they received for Christmas for a clock-radio;lose their appetites when they''re depressed;think chocolate Easter bunnies are for kids;save leftovers that are too skimpy to use for another meal in order to make interesting soups;throw out stale potato chips;will eat only Swiss or Dutch chocolate, which cannot be found except in a special store;think it''s too much trouble to stop at a special store just to buy chocolate;don''t celebrate with a hot-fudge sundae every time they lose a pound;warm up after skiing with black coffee instead of hot chocolate and whipped cream;try all the salads at the buffet, leaving room for only one dessert;find iced tea more refreshing than an ice-cream soda;get into such interesting conversations at cocktail parties that they never quite work their way over to the hors-d''oeuvre table;have no compulsion to keep the candy dish symmetrical by reducing the jelly beans to an equal number of each color;think that topping brownies with ice cream makes too rich a dessert;bring four cookies into the TV room instead of a box;think banana splits are for kids.</p>\n<p>Joke found on http://www.ahajokes.com]

[French-Bashing to Be Olympic Sport</p>\n<p>2/18/2003 - William Grim</p>\n<p>Geneva - At its annual meeting, the International Olympic Committee has decided to add French-Bashing to its roster of medal sports in both the Summer and Winter Games.</p>\n<p>"We thought it was about time," said Jesus de Manuel y Corazon, Chairman of the IOC and the 1968 European French-Bashing Champion. "Everbody hates those little lying, cowardly, collaborating, garlic-eating, never-bathing, nose-picking French bastards. It''s time that French-Bashing was recognized for the truly international sport that it is, one, I might add, that is much more popular than soccer."</p>\n<p>In Summer French-Bashing the Basher runs along a 25 meter path to the Bashee (or the Pierre as it is sometimes called), a typical French sissy picked randomly from the Paris phone book. The first phase of the Bash is called Verbal Bashing in which the Basher has 20 seconds to hurl insults at the Bashee until he starts to cry like a little girl. Then comes the second phase, or Physical Bashing in which the Basher whacks the Bashee over the head with a baseball bat. Play continues until the Bashee surrenders, which in most cases happens immediately because the Bashee is a scairdy-cat Frog after all. Scoring is similar to that in diving in which points are awarded on style, technique and degree of </p>\n<p>difficulty.</p>\n<p>Winter French-Bashing resembles its Summer counterpart with the exception that the Basher approaches the Bashee on skis.</p>\n<p>Sports writers are predicting French-Bashing to be the biggest spectator sport of all time, with the potential of billions of dollars in TV revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in endorsement contracts for world-class bashers.</p>\n<p>The United States and Great Britain are already being touted as gold medal contenders for the 2006 Games, with Canada (the only country to produce both world-class bashers and bashees) a very serious challenger.]

[What''s the difference between 3 golf balls and a period?</p>\n<p>You can''t gargle 3 golf balls!!!]
[Good afternoon. I''m Al Gore, and I''d like to tell you about myself.<br /> I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black<br /> child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I was born in a log cabin<br /> that I built with my own hands. I taught myself to read by candlelight and<br /> helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a<br /> Mississippi River steamboat.<br /> My mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles<br /> to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought I<br /> never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration<br /> for "Huckleberry Finn."<br /> Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens. One day, a<br /> traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going<br /> to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I<br /> made an impression. You see, the minister''s name was Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /> My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and<br /> said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a<br /> hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school."<br /> But life of privilege was not for me. After getting my high school diploma, I<br /> took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the treatment of<br /> the workers there that I organized a union. Later, that experience inspired a<br /> movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me<br /> "Norma Rae."<br /> When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called<br /> and offered me a scholarship. I captained the hockey team to four consecutive<br /> national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win<br /> the Heisman Trophy.<br /> During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing<br /> lead guitar for a little rock band. You may have heard of it-the Rolling<br /> Stones.<br /> But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country. So<br /> I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I was deeply opposed to the<br /> war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the Medal of Honor<br /> and the Croix de Guerre.<br /> When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours. I''ve<br /> crossed the deserts bare, man, I''ve breathed the mountain air, man, I''ve<br /> traveled, I''ve done my share, man, I''ve been everywhere. And the people I met at<br /> truck stops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the<br /> same thing: "Al, we need you in Washington."<br /> I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other<br /> business---building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon Society, doing<br /> the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the<br /> recipe for Mrs. Field''s chocolate chip cookies.<br /> Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and allowed them<br /> to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate, where I established<br /> the US Strategic Oil Reserve. And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for<br /> no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once again and took the<br /> oath of office as Vice President of the United States.<br /> Since then, I''ve been part of the most successful administration in American<br /> history. And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet. Many times Bill Clinton<br /> has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do. And when I<br /> would give him my thoughts, he would invariable say, "Of course. That''s<br /> brilliant. Why didn''t I think of that?"<br /> During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he<br /> only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away form that dark-haired<br /> intern. So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked<br /> if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign. And Bill Clinton<br /> gave me a few simple words of advice-words I''ll never forget.<br /> He looked me in the eye and he said, "Al, just tell the truth, it''s always<br /> worked for me."]

[A man traveling down a country road was forced to stop before a giant puddle<br /> covering the entire road. Looking to the side of the road, the man noticed a<br /> farmer leaning on a fence. "Think it''s safe to cross?" the man asked. </p>\n<p>"I reckon so," replied the farmer. </p>\n<p>The puddle immediately swallowed the car as the man drove in.

[RECOUNT DEMANDED BY METS</p>\n<p>NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference earlier today. They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union. "We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers," said the Mets batting coach. "We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."</p>\n<p>One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>"The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit," said the Mets batting coach.</p>\n<p>"The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely. "Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game. "While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series," the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.</p>\n<p>"It''s clear that we were on-base slightly more often than the Yankees," said a Mets spokesman. "The World Series crown is rightly ours. "The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise. He has stated that he believes "we need to let the process run its course without a rush to judgment."]

A 3 year olds voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded<br /> restaurant. </p>\n<p>4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong<br /> enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman<br /> cape.  It is strong enough, however, if tied to a paint can, to spread<br /> paint on all four walls of a 20 by 20 foot room.</p>\n<p>5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When<br /> using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times<br /> before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. </p>\n<p>6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn''t stop a baseball hit by<br /> a ceiling fan. </p>\n<p>7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words "Uh-oh," it''s already too<br /> late. </p>\n<p>8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. </p>\n<p>9. A six year old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36<br /> year old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying glass<br /> can start a fire even on an overcast day.</p>\n<p>10. Certain LEGOs will pass through the digestive tract of a four year<br /> old. </p>\n<p>11. Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence. </p>\n<p>12. Super glue is forever. </p>\n<p>13.

[Let''s say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else. </p>\n<p>And then, one evening when they''re driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: ''''Do you realize that, as of tonight, we''ve been seeing each other for exactly six months?'''' </p>\n<p>And then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Gee, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he''s been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I''m trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn''t want, or isn''t sure of. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I''m not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I''d have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward . . . I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person? </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: . . . so that means it was . . . let''s see. .. February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer''s, which means . . . lemme check the odometer . . . Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I''m reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that''s it. That''s why he''s so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He''s afraid of being rejected. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: And I''m gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don''t care what those morons say, it''s still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It''s 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s angry. And I don''t blame him. I''d be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can''t help the way I feel. I''m just not sure. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: They''ll probably say it''s only a 90-day warranty. That''s exactly what they''re gonna say, the rats. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: maybe I''m just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I''m sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I''ll give them a warranty. I''ll take their warranty and stick it right up their ... </p>\n<p>''''Roger,'''' Elaine says aloud. </p>\n<p>''''What?'''' says Roger, startled. </p>\n<p>''''Please don''t torture yourself like this,'''' she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. ''''Maybe I should never have . . . I feel so . . ." (She breaks down, sobbing.) </p>\n<p>''''What? '' says Roger. </p>\n<p>''''I''m such a fool,'''' Elaine sobs. ''''I mean, I know there''s no knight. I really know that. It''s silly. There''s no knight, and there''s no horse.'''' </p>\n<p>''''There''s no horse?'''' says Roger. </p>\n<p>''''You think I''m a fool, don''t you?'''' Elaine says. </p>\n<p>''''No!'''' says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer. </p>\n<p>''''It''s just that . . . It''s that I . . . I need some time,'''' Elaine says. (There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.) </p>\n<p>''''Yes,'''' he says. (Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.) </p>\n<p>''''Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?'''' she says. </p>\n<p>''''What way?'''' says Roger. </p>\n<p>''''That way about time,'''' says Elaine. </p>\n<p>''''Oh,'''' says Roger. </p>\n<p>''''Yes.'''' (Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.) </p>\n<p>''''Thank you, Roger,'''' she says. </p>\n<p>''''Thank you,'''' says Roger. </p>\n<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechs he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it''s better if he doesn''t think about it. (This is also Roger''s policy regarding world hunger.) </p>\n<p>The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine''s, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: ''''Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?'''']

[One day in the future, Bill Clinton has a heart attack, dies prematurely --<br /> and goes straight to Hell. The Devil greets him, but says "I don''t know<br /> exactly what to do with you.

[SEATTLE''S TURKEY DAY ETIQUETTE It''s been 145 years since the first white settlers landed at Alki Beach at Thanksgiving time, took one look at the overcast skies and the sodden, rain-soaked West Seattle terrain, and burst into tears.(History, alas, doesn''t record the response of the Native Americans when they spotted those tear-drenched settlers. But they probably were too polite to laugh out loud.)In the intervening years, the first residents and the settlers have worked out the rules for Thanksgiving, Puget Sound style. Here they are, recently updated by an ad hoc Turkey Day committee:DRESS CODE. Thanksgiving Day guests will arrive wearing Seattle tuxes: clean jeans, turtleneck sweaters and down jackets with weathered ski-lift tags. Hiking boots are optional.CONVERSATION''S GAMBIT. Topics will include: 1) the election; 2) previous elections; and, 3) the next election. Several arguments will ensue before the host or hostess declares politics ''off-limits.''CLEANERS'' COROLLARY. Spills will happen in direct proportion to the staining capacity of the dish (cranberry sauce rates high) and the expense of dry cleaning the garment.CHRISTMAS CONVENTION. If you are attending a family gathering, expect this reminder: ''Don''t forget to bring your Christmas list to Thanksgiving dinner.''MEOW''S MOMENT. The family cat will appear long enough to 1) shed hair on anyone wearing a black or navy-blue sweater; 2) perch on the lap of whoever most dislikes cats; and, 3) insist on sharing the smoked-salmon hors d''oeuvres.OLD-TIMERS'' LAMENT. Some oldster in the group will remark that it''s a rotten shame there''s no longer a Turkey Day football game between Puget Sound and Seattle high-school champs.ELBOW''S LAW. Local custom calls for every left-handed diner to be seated to the right of a right-handed diner, maximizing chances for spills.PORCELAIN''S PROGRESS. At least two different patterns of dinnerware must be visible on Puget Sound tables during every course.SALAD LAW. Tossed salads supplied by guests will arrive with an excess of moisture, supplied by ambient rainfall.  If the day is merely overcast, the host or hostess should add water before serving.MOLDED SALAD LAW. Guaranteed to do one of three things: contain miniature marshmallows, fail to unmold properly, or slide off the serving plate onto the lap of one of the diners.GRAVY''S CONSTANT. The silver gravy boat -- a wedding present from Great Aunt Emma and Uncle Ed -- will vanish before the meal. It will show up next summer when you''re searching for beach towels.TURKEY''S GRIPE. One vegetarian guest will complain about the fare, saying, ''Why can''t we ever have tofu au gratin?''PIE''S PARADOX. Provide two kinds of pie and diners will either decline or ask for ''a sliver of both.''POLLYANNA''S PRINCIPLE. Guests will include one orphan, someone from out of town who can''t make it home. If no orphan is available, the family oddball can substitute.REFRIGERATOR''S RULE. After all guests depart, at least one never-served dish will turn up in the refrigerator.DEPARTURE''S RULE. Some guests will arrive very early; some will show up late. But they''ll all leave at the same time.]

[Little Johnny was 12 years old and, like other boys his age, was rather<br /> curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about "courting" from older boys and he<br /> wondered what it was like and how it was done. One day he took his question to<br /> his mother who became rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny,<br /> his mother told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older<br /> sister and her boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described<br /> everything to his mom. "Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile then he<br /> turned off most of the lights. He then started hugging and kissing her. I<br /> figured Sis must be getting sick because her face started to look funny. He must<br /> have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart<br /> just like the doctor would do. He was not as smart as a doctor because he seemed<br /> to be having trouble finding it. "I guess he was getting sick too because pretty<br /> soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand<br /> must have been cold because he put it in her skirt. About this time Sis got<br /> worse and began to moan and groan and squirm around and slide down towards the<br /> end of the couch. This is when the fever started. "I knew it was the fever<br /> because Sis said she felt real hot. Finally I found out what was making them so<br /> sick. A big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his<br /> pants and stood there, about 10 inches long, honest. Anyway, he grabbed it in<br /> one hand to keep it from getting away. "When Sis saw it, she got real scared,<br /> her eyes got big and her mouth fell open and started calling to God and stuff.<br /> She said it was the biggest one she ever saw...... I should have told her about<br /> the one down at the lake. "Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its<br /> head off. All of a sudden she made a noise and let the eel go. I guess it bit<br /> her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while her<br /> boyfriend took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel`s head to<br /> keep it from biting again. "Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a<br /> scissor lock on it and he helped by laying on top of the eel. The eel put up a<br /> hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost<br /> upset the couch. I guess he wanted to kill it by squeezing it between them.<br /> "After a while they both quit moving and a great sigh came forth. Her boyfriend<br /> got up, and sure enough, the eel was dead. I knew it was dead because it just<br /> hung there limp with some of its insides hanging out. "Sis and her boyfriend<br /> were a little tired from the battle but they went on courting anyways. He<br /> started hugging and kissing her again. By golly the eel wasn`t dead after all.<br /> It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats<br /> with 9-lives. "This time Sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on<br /> it. After 35 minutes of struggling, they finally killed it. I knew it was dead<br /> because I saw Sis`s boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the<br /> toilet....."]

He trained the elephant not to jump no matter what then he set up a challenge to make the elephant jump. The prize money was 10 grand. To play this game, the challenger must pay 1 grand to the guy before playing. Lots of people came and tried all sorts of tricks to make the elephant jump but without success.

[Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event. It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler''s trainer came to him and said, ''Now don''t forget all the research we''ve done on this Russian. He''s never  lost a match because of this pretzel hold he has. Whatever  you do, don''t let him get you in this hold! If he does, you''re finished!'' The wrestler nodded in agreement. The American and the Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn''t watch the ending. Suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian''s back hit the mat with a  thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him,  getting the pin and winning the match. The trainer was  astounded! When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asks, ''How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!'' The wrestler answered, ''Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. ''I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could; and you would be amazed how strong  you get when you bite your own balls!'']

[This 85 year old couple, having been married almost 60 years, had died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years mainly due to her interest in health food, and exercise.

They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. </p>\n<p>The old man asked, "what are the green fees?". </p>\n<p>Peter''s reply, "This is heaven, you play for free." </p>\n<p>Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine''s of the world laid out. "How much to eat?" asked the old man. </p>\n<p>"Don''t you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!" Peter replied with some exasperation. </p>\n<p>"Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?" the old man asked timidly. </p>\n<p>Peter lectured, "That''s the best part...you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven." </p>\n<p>With that the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and shrieking wildly.

[The 5 questions most feared by men are:<br /> 1...What are you thinking about?<br /> 2...Do you love me?<br /> 3...Do I look fat?<br /> 4...Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5...What would you do if I died?</p>\n<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly(i.e., tells the truth).</p>\n<p>As a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible Responses.</p>\n<p>Question # 1:  What are you thinking about?</p>\n<p>The proper answer to this, of course, is: "I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you."<br /> This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer,which most likely is one of the following:<br /> a...Baseball.<br /> b...Football.<br /> c...How fat you are.<br /> d...How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e...How I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, "If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!"</p>\n<p>Question # 2:  Do you love me?</p>\n<p>The proper response is: "YES!" or, if you feel a more detailed  answer is in order, "Yes, dear." Inappropriate responses include:<br /> a...Oh Yeah, crap loads.<br /> b...Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> c...That depends on what you mean by love.<br /> d...Does it matter?<br /> e...Who, me?</p>\n<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat?</p>\n<p>The correct answer is an emphatic: "Of course not!"<br /> Among the incorrect answers are:<br /> a...Compared to what?<br /> b...I wouldn''t call you fat, but you''re not exactly thin.<br /> c...A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d...I''ve seen fatter.<br /> e...Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question # 4: Do you think she''s prettier than me?</p>\n<p>Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: "Of course not!"<br /> Incorrect responses include:</p>\n<p>a...Yes, but you have a better personality.<br /> b...Not prettier, but definitely thinner.<br /> c...Not as pretty as you when you were her age.<br /> d...Define pretty.<br /> e...Could you repeat the question?  I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question # 5: What would you do if I died?</p>\n<p>A definite no-win question.(The real answer, of course, is "Buy a Corvette and a Boat").<br /> WARNING: No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:</p>\n<p>WOMAN: Would you get married again?<br /> MAN: Definitely not!<br /> WOMAN: Why not-don''t you like being married?<br /> MAN: Of course I do.<br /> WOMAN: Then why wouldn''t you remarry?<br /> MAN: Okay, I''d get married again.<br /> WOMAN: You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)<br /> WOMAN: Would you sleep with her in our bed?<br /> MAN: Where else would we sleep?<br /> WOMAN: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?<br /> MAN: That would seem like the proper thing to do.<br /> WOMAN: And would you let her use my golf clubs?<br /> MAN: She can''t use them; she''s left-handed<br /> WOMAN: - - - silence - - -<br /> MAN: Oh  ( expletive deleted).]

[NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCETo the citizens of the United States of America,In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of yourindependence, effective today.Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections.Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will becirculated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.Then look up "aluminum". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed".2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.It really isn''t that hard.4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.6. You should stop playing American "football". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays "American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American "football", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. "Merde" is French for "sh!t".8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a newnational holiday, but only in England. It will be called "Indecisive Day".9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It''s been driving us crazy.Thank you for your cooperation.]

[It was a glorious day for the tribe. Three of their women had gone into<br /> labor at the same time, and so the entire tribe decided to gather and<br /> watch the birth.</p>\n<p>They spread some animal skins on the ground and laid the three women upon<br /> them. The first woman, who was laying on a deer skin, moaned and groaned<br /> and gave birth to a beautiful 5 pound baby boy. The entire tribe oohed and<br /> ahhed appeciatively.</p>\n<p>The second woman, who was lying on a buffalo skin, then moaned and groaned<br /> and gave birth to a beautiful 6 pound baby boy. Again there was a chorus<br /> of ooohs and ahhs from the tribe.</p>\n<p>Then the third woman, who was lying on a hippopotamus skin the tribe had<br /> traded for, moaned and groaned and began to yell in pain. Finally with a<br /> last giant push, the woman gave birth to an astonishing 11 pound baby boy.</p>\n<p>The entire tribe was stunned and amazed at the size of this baby.<br /> Everyone, that is, except the village elder. When pressed for a reason as<br /> to why he was not impressed with an 11 pound baby, he simply answered,<br /> "Everyone knows that the son of the squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to<br /> the sons of the squaws on the other two hides."</p>\n<p>(If you don''t get it, ask a math major!)]

[This man goes to confession and says, "Forgive me father for I have sinned."<br /> The priest asks if he would like to confess his sins and the man replies that he<br /> used the "F-word" over the weekend. The priest says, "Oh okay, just say three<br /> Hail Marys and try to watch your language. </p>\n<p>The man replies that he would like to confess as to why he said the "F-word".<br /> The priest sighs and tells him to continue. Well father I played golf on Sunday<br /> with my buddies instead of going to church. The priest says, "And you got upset<br /> over that and swore?" The man replied, "No, that wasn''t why I swore. On the<br /> first tee I duck-hooked my drive well left into the trees." The priest said,<br /> "And that''s when you swore." </p>\n<p>The man replied, a little testily because of the constant interruptions, "No,<br /> it wasn''t. When I walked up the fairway, I noticed my ball got a lucky bounce<br /> and I had a clear shot to the green. However, before I could hit the ball, a<br /> squirrel ran by and grabbed my ball and scurried up a tree." The priest asked,<br /> "Is that when you said the ''F-word''?" </p>\n<p>The man replied, "No, because an eagle then flew by and caught the squirrel in<br /> its sharp talons and flew away." </p>\n<p>The priest let out a breath and queried, "Is that when you swore?" </p>\n<p>The man replied, "No, because the eagle flew over the green and the dying<br /> squirrel let go of my golf ball and it landed within 5 inches of the hole." </p>\n<p>The priest screamed, "Don''t tell me you missed the f***ing putt!!!"]

[This one woman who was in her late 40''s went to the plastic surgen. She wanted<br /> an entire face lift and so the doctor said he had this new technique. The woman<br /> asked how it was done so the doctor explained it. He said that he would cut two<br /> slits on top of her head and tie them into a knot. The woman asked why he would<br /> put a knot, and the doctor said that it was so if her face felt a little droopy,<br /> when she twisted it to the right, it would tighten the skin on her face. The<br /> woman decided to get the surgery done.The doctor told her to come back in four<br /> months so he could check up on how she was doing.

[There are five things that women should never, ever ask a guy, according to an article in an issue of Sassy magazine. The five questions are:<br /> 1 - "What are you thinking?"<br /> 2 - "Do you love me?"<br /> 3 - "Do I look fat?"<br /> 4 - "Do you think she is prettier than me?"<br /> 5 - "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example: </p>\n<p>1 - "What are you thinking?" The proper answer to this question, of course is, "I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you." Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things: </p>\n<p>a - Football<br /> b - Baseball<br /> c - How fat you are.<br /> d - How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died. </p>\n<p>According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. "If I wanted you to know," Al said, "I''d be talking instead of thinking." </p>\n<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers: </p>\n<p>2 - "Do you love me?" The correct answer to this question is, "Yes." For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, "Yes, dear." </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - I suppose so.<br /> b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes.<br /> c - That depends on what you mean by "love".<br /> d - Does it matter?<br /> e - Who, me? </p>\n<p>3 - "Do I look fat?" The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, "No, of course not" and then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either.<br /> b - Compared to what?<br /> c - A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d - I''ve seen fatter.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she''s prettier than me?" The "she" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, "No, you are much prettier." Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.<br /> b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things.<br /> c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.<br /> d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?" Correct answer: "Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino''s Pizza truck that came my way." This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke: </p>\n<p>"Dear," said the wife. "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>"Why, dear, I would be extremely upset," said the husband. "Why do you ask such a question?" </p>\n<p>"Would you remarry?" persevered the wife. </p>\n<p>"No, of course not, dear" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Don''t you like being married?" said the wife. </p>\n<p>"Of course I do, dear" he said. </p>\n<p>"Then why wouldn''t you remarry?" </p>\n<p>"Alright," said the husband, "I''d remarry." </p>\n<p>"You would?" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>\n<p>"Yes" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Would you sleep with her in our bed?" said the wife after a long pause. </p>\n<p>"Well yes, I suppose I would." replied the husband. </p>\n<p>"I see," said the wife indignantly. "And would you let her wear my old clothes?" </p>\n<p>"I suppose, if she wanted to" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Really," said the wife icily. "And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?" </p>\n<p>"Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do." </p>\n<p>"Is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet. "And I suppose you''d let her play with my golf clubs, too." </p>\n<p>"Of course not, dear," said the husband. "She''s left-handed."]

With a little effort you can get your shit together, find a place for your shit or decide to shit or get off the pot. You can smoke shit,buy shit, sell shit, lose shit, find shit, forget shit, and tell others to eat shit and die. You can shit or go blind, have a shit fit or just shit your life away.

You can take a shit, give a shit, or serve shit on a shingle. You can find yourself in deep shit, or be happier than a pig in shit. Some days are colder than shit, some days are hotter than shit, and some days are just plain shitty. Some music sounds like shit, things can look like shit, and there are times when you feel like shit. </p>\n<p>You can have too much shit, not enough shit, the right shit, the wrong shit or a lot of weird shit. You can carry shit, have a mountain of shit, or find yourself up shit creek without a paddle. Sometimes you really need this shit and sometimes you don''t want any shit at all.

[The other day I went to the local religious book store, where I saw a<br /> HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back<br /> bumper of my car, and I''m really glad I did. What an uplifting experience<br /> followed.<br /> I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought<br /> about the Lord, and didn''t notice that the light had changed. That bumper<br /> sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy<br /> behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love the lord because<br /> pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, "Jesus Christ!" as loud as<br /> he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, "GO JESUS CHRIST,<br /> GO!!!"<br /> Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved<br /> and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from<br /> Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny<br /> beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck<br /> up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed,<br /> looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck<br /> sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.<br /> Several cars behind, a very nice black man stepped out of his car and<br /> yelled something. I couldn''t hear him very well, but it sounded like,<br /> "Mother trucker," or "Mother''s from there." Maybe he was from Florida, too.<br /> He must really love the lord. A couple of the people were so caught up in<br /> the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking<br /> toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the<br /> light had changed, and stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because<br /> I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them<br /> standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held<br /> up the Hawaiian good luck sign, as I drove away.<br /> Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks.]

[Back in 1947 the government was experimenting with a Marine''s ability to<br /> complete his mission after suffering a serious head injury.<br /> They took a well trained, physically-fit, hard-charging Cpl. and told him to<br /> row a canoe up a river.  The Cpl. jumped in the canoe, started rowing up stream<br /> with ease and began singing, "From the Halls of Montezuma, To the Shores of<br /> Tripoli."<br /> The next day a team of surgeons performed a frontal lobotomy on the<br /> Marine.   Again, they took him to the river and said'' "row."<br /> Again the Cpl. jumped in, took a second to find his seat, started rowing with<br /> a little difficulty and began singing.  It took a little more effort this time,<br /> "From     Da   Hallls   of    Montayuma,     Two   Da   Stores    in<br /> Tripoli."  But he made it up river and completed the task.<br /> The next day the surgeons removed the majority of the Marines brain and took<br /> him to the river.<br /> The Cpl. jumped in, fell out, and began swimming up stream, singing "For    Da<br />   Hails  of  Monte puma,  to  ''e  hall inn  monopoly."  But again, he made it up<br /> river and completed his task.<br /> The next day the surgeons removed the remainder of the Marines brain.  He had<br /> no brain what-so-ever and no way to think logically.  They took him to the<br /> river.   He fell out of the car and began singing, "Hear we go, Into the wild<br /> blue yonder...."]

[1. Women love to shop. It is the one area of the world where they feel like they''re actually in control.</p>\n<p>2. Women especially love a bargain. The question of "need" is irrelevant, so don''t bother pointing it out. Anything on sale is fair game.</p>\n<p>3. Women never have anything to wear. Don''t question the racks of clothes in the closet; you "just don''t understand".</p>\n<p>4. Women need to cry. And they won''t do it alone unless they know you can hear them.</p>\n<p>5. Women will always ask questions that have no right answer, in an effort to trap you into feeling guilty.</p>\n<p>6. Women love to talk. Silence intimidates them and they feel a need to fill it, even if they have nothing to say.</p>\n<p>7. Women need to feel like there are people worse off than they are. That''s why soap operas and Oprah Winfrey-type shows are so successful.</p>\n<p>9. Women hate bugs. Even the strong-willed ones need a man around when<br /> there''s a spider or a wasp involved.</p>\n<p>10. Women can''t keep secrets. They eat away at them from the inside. And they don''t view it as being untrustworthy, providing they only tell two or three people.</p>\n<p>11. Women always go to public restrooms in groups. It gives them a chance to gossip.</p>\n<p>12. Women can''t refuse to answer a ringing phone, no matter what she''s doing. It might be the lottery calling.</p>\n<p>13. Women never understand why men love toys. Men understand that they wouldn''t need toys if women had an "on/off" switch.</p>\n<p>14. Women think all beer is the same.</p>\n<p>15. Women keep three different shampoos and two different conditioners in the shower.</p>\n<p>16. After a woman showers, the bathroom will smell like a tropical rain forest.</p>\n<p>17. Women don''t understand the appeal of sports. Men seek entertainment that allows them to escape reality. Women seek entertainment that reminds them of how horrible things *could* be.</p>\n<p>18. If a man goes on a seven-day trip, he''ll pack five days worth of clothes and will wear some things twice; if a woman goes on a seven-day trip she''ll pack 21 outfits because she doesn''t know what she''ll feel like wearing each day.</p>\n<p>19. Women brush their hair *before* bed.</p>\n<p>21. Women are paid less than men, except for Modeling.</p>\n<p>22. Women are *never* wrong. Apologizing is the mans responsibility, "It''s there in the bible". hmmm who was it that gave Adam the apple?</p>\n<p>23. Women do *not* know anything about cars. "Oil-stick, oil doesn''t stick?"</p>\n<p>24. Women have better rest rooms. They get the nice chairs and red carpet.</p>\n<p>25. The average number of items in a typical woman''s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.</p>\n<p>26. Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren''t looking, men kick cats.</p>\n<p>27. Women love to talk on the phone. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will callthe same friend and they will talk for three hours.</p>\n<p>28. A woman will dress up to go shopping, to water the plants, to empty the garbage, to answer the phone, to read a book, or to get the mail.</p>\n<p>30. Women will drive miles out of their way to avoid the possibility of getting lost using a shortcut.</p>\n<p>31. Women do NOT want an honest answer to the question, ''How do I look?''</p>\n<p>32. PMS stands for: Permissible Man-Slaughter. (Or at least men think it means that. PMS also stands for Punish My Spouse.)</p>\n<p>33. The first naked man that woman see is "Ken".</p>\n<p>36. Women will make three right-hand turns to avoid making one left-hand turn.</p>\n<p>37. "Oh, nothing," has an entirely different meaning in woman-language than it does in man-language.</p>\n<p>38. Lewis Carroll''s Caterpillar had nothing on women.</p>\n<p>39. Women cannot use a map without turning the map to correspond to the direction that they are heading.</p>\n<p>40a All women are overweight by definition, don''t argue with them about it.</p>\n<p>40b All women are overweight by definition, don''t agree with them about it.</p>\n<p>41. If it is not Valentines day, and you see a man in a flower shop, you can probably start up a conversation by asking, "What did you do?"</p>\n<p>42. Women want equal rights, but you rarely hear them clamoring to be let into the draft to cover the responsibilities that go with those rights.</p>\n<p>43. Only women understand the reason for "guest towels" and the "good china".</p>\n<p>46. Women can get out of speeding tickets by pouting. This will get men arrested.</p>\n<p>47. Women don''t really care about a sense of humor in a guy despite claims to the contrary. You don''t see women trampling over Tom Cruise to get to Gilbert Gottfried do you?]

My seat wasn''t the greatest, so when I<br /> noticed a vacant seat on the fifty yard line 10 rows up, I<br /> headed towards it. I asked the man sitting next to it if<br /> the seat was taken.

[Dear Santa: </p>\n<p>Listen you fat little troll, I''ve been helping you out every year, playing at being the perfect Christmas present, wearing skimpy bathing suits in frigid weather, and drowning in fake tea from one too many tea parties, and I hate to break it to ya Santa, but IT''S DEFINITELY PAYBACK TIME! There had better be some changes around here by next Christmas, or I''m gonna call for a nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you won''t wanna be around to smell it). So, here''s my holiday wish list for 1997: </p>\n<p>1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized sweatshirt. I''m sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these bathing suits gonna get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have nylon and Velcro crawling up your butt? </p>\n<p>2. Real underwear that can be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What bonehead at Mattel decided to cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my skin?!? It looks like cellulite! </p>\n<p>3. A REAL man...maybe G.I. Joe. Hell, I''d take Tickle-Me Elmo over that wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend Ken. And what''s with that earring anyway? If I''m gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him (and me) anatomically correct. </p>\n<p>4. Arms that actually bend so I can push the aforementioned Ken-wimp away once he is anatomically correct. </p>\n<p>5. Breast reduction surgery. I don''t care whose arm you have to twist, just get it done. </p>\n<p>6. A jogging bra. To wear until I get the surgery. </p>\n<p>7. A new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don''t cut it. How about a systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account exec! </p>\n<p>8. A new, more 90''s persona. Maybe "PMS Barbie", complete with a miniature container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips; "Animal Rights Barbie", with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake fur coat and handcuffs; or "Stop Smoking Barbie", sporting a removable Nicotrol patch and equipped with several packs of gum. </p>\n<p>9. No more McDonald''s endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl. </p>\n<p>10. Mattel stock options. It''s been 37 years - I think I deserve it. </p>\n<p>Ok, Santa, that''s it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I don''t think these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can find yourself a new bimbo doll for next Christmas. It''s that simple. </p>\n<p>Yours truly -- Barbie]

[A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first of the twosome teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole.As luck would have it, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in evident agony.The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize. ''Please allow me to help. I''m a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you''d allow.''''Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I''ll be all right...I''ll be fine in a few minutes,'' he replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal position still clasping his hands together at his crotch.But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help him. She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, she loosened his pants, and she put her hands inside. She began to massage his private parts. She then asked him, ''How does that feel?''''It feels great,'' he replied, ''but my thumb still hurts like hell.'']

[To the citizens of the United States of America: </p>\n<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. </p>\n<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. </p>\n<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: </p>\n<p>1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary. </p>\n<p>Then look up "aluminium" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. </p>\n<p>Look up "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed". </p>\n<p>2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. </p>\n<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn''t that hard. </p>\n<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. </p>\n<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through. </p>\n<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. </p>\n<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. </p>\n<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for "shit" </p>\n<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day. </p>\n<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. </p>\n<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It''s been driving us crazy. </p>\n<p>Thank you for your cooperation.]
[Let''s say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named<br /> Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a<br /> pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner,<br /> and again they enjoy themselves.</p>\n<p>They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while<br /> neither one of them is seeing anybody else.</p>\n<p>And then, one evening when they''re driving home, a thought<br /> occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it<br /> aloud: "Do you realize that, as of tonight, we''ve been seeing<br /> each other for exactly six months?"</p>\n<p>And then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a<br /> very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it<br /> bothers him that I said that. Maybe he''s been feeling confined<br /> by our relationship; maybe he thinks I''m trying to push him into<br /> some kind of obligation that he doesn''t want, or isn''t sure of.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I''m not so sure I want this<br /> kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little<br /> more space, so I''d have time to think about whether I really<br /> want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward . .<br /> . I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing<br /> each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward<br /> marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I<br /> ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this<br /> person?</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: . . . so that means it was . . . let''s<br /> see ...February when we started going out, which was right after<br /> I had the car at the dealer''s, which means . . . lemme check the<br /> odometer . . . Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s upset. I can see it on his face.<br /> Maybe I''m reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more<br /> from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he<br /> has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some<br /> reservations. Yes, I bet that''s it. That''s why he''s so reluctant<br /> to say anything about his own feelings. He''s afraid of being<br /> rejected.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: And I''m gonna have them look at the<br /> transmission again. I don''t care what those morons say, it''s<br /> still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on<br /> the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It''s 87 degrees<br /> out, and this thing is shifting like a goddamn garbage truck,<br /> and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s angry. And I don''t blame him. I''d<br /> be angry, too. God, I feel so guilty, putting him through this,<br /> but I can''t help the way I feel. I''m just not sure.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: They''ll probably say it''s only a 90- day<br /> warranty. That''s exactly what they''re gonna say, the scumballs.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: maybe I''m just too idealistic, waiting<br /> for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I''m<br /> sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy<br /> being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems<br /> to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my<br /> self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I''ll give<br /> them a goddamn warranty. I''ll take their warranty and stick it<br /> right up their....</p>\n<p>"Roger," Elaine says aloud.</p>\n<p>"What?" says Roger, startled.</p>\n<p>"Please don''t torture yourself like this," she says, her eyes<br /> beginning to brim with tears. "Maybe I should never have . .Oh<br /> God, I feel so....."</p>\n<p>(She breaks down, sobbing.)</p>\n<p>"What?" says Roger.</p>\n<p>"I''m such a fool," Elaine sobs. "I mean, I know there''s no<br /> knight. I really know that. It''s silly. There''s no knight, and<br /> there''s no horse."</p>\n<p>"There''s no horse?" says Roger.</p>\n<p>"You think I''m a fool, don''t you?" Elaine says.</p>\n<p>"No!" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer.</p>\n<p>"It''s just that . . . It''s that I . . . I need some time,"<br /> Elaine says.</p>\n<p>(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he<br /> can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up<br /> with one that he thinks might work.)</p>\n<p>"Yes," he says.</p>\n<p>(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.)</p>\n<p>"Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?" she says.</p>\n<p>"What way?" says Roger.</p>\n<p>"That way about time," says Elaine.</p>\n<p>"Oh," says Roger. "Yes."</p>\n<p>(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes,<br /> causing him to become very nervous about what she might say<br /> next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)</p>\n<p>"Thank you, Roger," she says.</p>\n<p>"Thank you," says Roger.</p>\n<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted,<br /> tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets<br /> back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV,<br /> and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis<br /> match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny<br /> voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something<br /> major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure<br /> there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he<br /> figures. it''s better if he doesn''t think about it. (This is also<br /> Roger''s policy regarding world hunger.)</p>\n<p>The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two<br /> of them, and they will talk about this situation for six<br /> straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze<br /> everything she said and everything he said, going over it time<br /> and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture<br /> for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification.<br /> They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for<br /> weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions,<br /> but never getting bored with it, either.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a<br /> mutual friend of his and Elaine''s, will pause just before<br /> serving, frown, and say: "Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?'']
[Women are under the illusion they don''t have to ask men for anything - that if the man really loved her, he would automatically and instinctively know what she needed. Right! As if the dysfunctional drone even knew you were in the room, let alone knew what you were feeling. A woman has a better chance of finding a bathing suit off the rack that fits than finding a man who knows what she is going through. Ironically, however, men like to feel needed - like they''re her knight in shining armor. Unfortunately, most turn out to be needy, like her nightmare from The Shining. Therefore, it is important that a woman ask a man directly for what she wants, not indirectly. He is not a mind reader. He doesn''t even read a map, how''s he going to read a mind?How To Ask A Man To Do Something*--------------------------------------*Always remember these five important rules when asking a man to do something:1. Make sure the man is conscious.2. Crash the hard drive on his computer and line the bird cage with the sports section.3. Be brief! Limit your nagging harangue to two, three hours, max.4. Reward him for cooperative behavior. Offer to cook him something that doesn''t have a peel-back cover.5. Punish him when he refuses to cooperate. Microwave his remote on high power for 55 minutes. Rotate 1/4 turn, and microwave again for another 35 minutes.6. Use "would you" or "will you" instead of "you''d better" or "do as I say and no one will get hurt". OK, Here are the six rules.************************The Right And Wrong Way to Ask A Man*--------------------------------------*How you ask a man to do something makes all the difference. Women think that a subtle nuance or slight turn of phrase will have no effect whatsoever on the resolve of their mucho-macho muscular moron. It does! Which is why you should always use "would you" and "will you" instead of "could you" and "can you". For example:Do say: would you please take out the garbage?Do not say: could you get off your big butt and do something around here? What am I, the maid?Do say: would you like to go out to a nice dinner Saturday night?Do not say: could you please take me to any restaurant that doesn''t have the words "burger", "king", or "happy meal" in their advertising??Do say: would you mind watching the kids while I take a night off with my girlfriends?Do not say: could you, just for one night, watch the kids you helped spawn-that I never get a break from-ever! I haven''t seen my friends in so long we wear name tags to identify ourselves.Do say: would you take me to a movie this week?Do not say: could you prove to me you''re not Velcroed to the couch and actually have the motor skills to take me to a motion picture? Something without Pamela Anderson in it.Do say: would you like me to listen to you talk about your day some more?Do not say: could you step up the filibuster, Sparky? Jeopardy is on in ten minutes.Do say: would you consider getting a vasectomy?Do not say: could you even imagine what it feels like taking birth control pills that make you feel like Attila the Hun one minute and Attila the Hun''s evil twin the next minute? Do it or I''ll do it FOR you!!Do say: would you like to take a vacation?Do not say: could you move out?Do say: would you get out of my life?Do not say: could you get out of my life?Notice how different these two statements are. A man is much more likely to get out of your life if you say "would".]

[Osama bin Laden has a heart attack and dies. </p>\n<p>He immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him. </p>\n<p>"I don''t know what to do here," the devil says. "You''re on my list, but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to stay here, so I''ll tell you what I''m going to do...</p>\n<p>I''ve got a couple of people here who weren''t quite as bad as you.

He kept diving in and surfacing empty-handed. Over and over and over. Such was his fate in hell.</p>\n<p>"No," bin Laden said, "I don''t think so. I''m not a good swimmer and I don''t think I could do that all day long."</p>\n<p>So the devil led him to the next room. In it was the Ayatollah Khomeini with a sledgehammer and a huge pile of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.</p>\n<p>"No, I''ve got this problem with my shoulder. I''d be in constant agony if all I did was break rocks all day," bin Laden commented.</p>\n<p>So the devil opened a third door. In it, bin Laden saw Bill Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was his girl Monica, doing what she does best. Osama bin Laden stared in disbelief and finally said, "Yeah, I can handle this."</p>\n<p>The devil smiled and said, "OK, Monica, you''re free to go."]
[In the 16th and 17th centuries, before synthetic fertilizer, large shipments of manure were commonly shipped by sea. It was dried and then shipped in order to reduce cargo weight, but once seawater soaked in, it not only became heavier, it began to decompose, producing methane gas. </p>\n<p>Because it was stored below decks in bundles you can see what could (and did) happen. Methane began to build up below decks and the first time someone unsuspectingly came below with a lantern was the last time in many cases.</p>\n<p>Several ships were destroyed in this manner before they realized what was happening. After that, the bundles of manure were always stamped with  the term "Ship High In Transit" on them.  Meaning that the sailors were to stow it high enough off the lower decks, so that any water that flowed into the  hold would not drench the manure.</p>\n<p>Thus, evolved the term "S.H.I.T " (Ship High In Transport), which we all know very well, explains why many things happen today.  Many mistakingly thought it originated on a golf course in Scotland. </p>\n<p>~~<br /> Editor''s Note: According to Urban Legends at about.com, shit is derived from the Indo-European root skei-, meaning "to cut" or "to split."  For most of its history "shit" was spelled "shite" (and sometimes still is, euphemistically).</p>\n<p>Doesn''t mean the ships weren''t blown to shit, though...]

[A must-read for all men.<br /> Keywords and their meanings: </p>\n<p>FINE:<br /> This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel<br /> we are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to<br /> describe how a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of<br /> those arguments. </p>\n<p>FIVE MINUTES:<br /> This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that<br /> your football game is going to last before you take out the<br /> trash, so it''s an even trade. </p>\n<p>NOTHING:<br /> This means something and you should be on your toes. "Nothing"<br /> is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting<br /> to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. "Nothing"<br /> usually signifies an argument that will last "Five Minutes" and<br /> end with a huffy "Fine." </p>\n<p>GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows):<br /> This is a dare, one that will result in my getting upset over<br /> "Nothing" and will end with the word "Fine." </p>\n<p>GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows):<br /> This means "I give up" or "do what you want because I don''t<br /> care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a few<br /> minutes, followed by "Nothing" and "Fine" and she will talk to<br /> you in about "Five Minutes" when she cools off. </p>\n<p>(LOUD SIGH):<br /> This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal<br /> statement very misunderstood by men.<br /> A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment<br /> and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and<br /> arguing with you over "Nothing." </p>\n<p>(SOFT SIGH):<br /> Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one<br /> of the few things that some men actually understand. She is<br /> content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will<br /> stay content. </p>\n<p>OH!:<br /> This exclamation, followed by any statement, is trouble.<br /> Example:<br /> "Oh, let me get that." Or, "Oh, I talked to him about what you<br /> were doing last night."<br /> If she says "Oh" before a statement, RUN, do not walk, to the<br /> nearest exit. She will tell you that she is "Fine" when she is<br /> done tossing your clothes out the window, but do not expect her<br /> to talk to you for at least 2 days. "Oh" as the lead to a<br /> sentence usually signifies that you are<br /> caught in a lie. Do not try to lie more to get out of it, or you<br /> will get raised eyebrows and "Go ahead" followed by acts so<br /> unspeakable that we can''t bring ourselves to write about them. </p>\n<p>THAT''S OK:<br /> This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can<br /> say to a man. "That''s OK" means that she wants to think long and<br /> hard before paying you retributions for what ever it is that you<br /> have done.<br /> "That''s OK" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in<br /> conjunction with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in<br /> the near future when she has plotted and planned, you are going<br /> to be in some mighty big trouble. </p>\n<p>PLEASE DO:<br /> This is not a statement; it is an offer. A woman is giving you<br /> the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have<br /> for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair<br /> chance to tell the truth, so be careful and you shouldn''t get a<br /> "That''s OK." </p>\n<p>THANKS:<br /> A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say, "You''re<br /> welcome." </p>\n<p>THANKS A LOT:<br /> This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say, "Thanks<br /> A LOT," when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that<br /> you have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by<br /> the "Loud Sigh." Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the<br /> "Loud Sigh," as she will only<br /> say "Nothing." </p>\n<p>I hope this clears up any misunderstandings...]

[A minister, a priest and a rabbi went for a hike one very hot day. They were sweating profusely by the time they came upon a small lake with a sandy beach. Since it was a secluded spot, they left all their clothes on a big log, ran down the beach to the lake and jumped in the water for a long, refreshing swim. Refreshed, they were halfway back up the beach to the spot they''d left their clothes, when a group of ladies from town came along.

[The 5 toughest questions that women ask men, and the answers...</p>\n<p>The questions are:<br /> 1.     What are you thinking about?<br /> 2.     Do you love me?<br /> 3.     Do I look fat?<br /> 4.     Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5.     What would you do if I died?</p>\n<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e., tells the truth).  Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible responses.</p>\n<p>Question # 1: What are you thinking about?<br /> The proper answer to this, of course, is: "I''m sorry if I''ve been<br /> pensive, dear.  I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful,<br /> thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to<br /> have met you." This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which most likely is one of the following:<br /> a.     Baseball.<br /> b.     Football.<br /> c.     How fat you are.<br /> d.     How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e.     How I would spend the insurance money if you died.<br /> (Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, "If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!")</p>\n<p>Question # 2: Do you love me?<br /> The proper response is: "YES!" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in order, "Yes, dear." Inappropriate responses include:<br /> A.     I suppose so.<br /> B.     Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> C.     That depends on what you mean by love.<br /> D.     Does it matter?<br /> E.     Who, me?</p>\n<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat?<br /> The correct answer is an emphatic: "Of course not!" Among the incorrect answers are:<br /> A.     Compared to what?<br /> B.     I wouldn''t call you fat, but you''re not exactly thin.<br /> C.     A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> D.     I''ve seen fatter.<br /> E.     Could you repeat the question?  I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question # 4: Do you think she''s prettier than me?<br /> Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: "Of course not!"<br /> Incorrect responses include:<br /> A.  Yes, but you have a better personality<br /> b.  Not prettier, but definitely thinner<br /> c.  Not as pretty as you when you were her age<br /> d.  Define pretty<br /> e.  Could you repeat the question?  I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question# 5: What would you do if I died?<br /> A definite no-win question. (The real answer, or course, is "Buy a<br /> Corvette.") No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an<br /> hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:</p>\n<p>Woman:  Would you get married again?<br /> Man:    Definitely not!<br /> W:      Why not, don''t you like being married?<br /> M:      Of course I do.<br /> W:      Then why wouldn''t you remarry?<br /> M:      Okay, I''d get married again.<br /> W:      You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)<br /> M:      Yes, I would.<br /> W:      Would you sleep with her in our bed?<br /> M:      Where else would we sleep?<br /> W:      Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?<br /> M:      That would seem like the proper thing to do.<br /> W:      And would you let her use my golf clubs?<br /> M:      Of course not, Dear. She''s left-handed.]
[A small village was troubled by a man-eating lion. So its leaders sent a message to the great hunter, Jonesie, to come and kill the beast.For several nights the hunter lay in wait for the lion, but it never appeared. Finally, he told the village chief to kill a cow and give him its hide. Draping the skin over his shoulders, he went to the pasture to wait for the lion.In the middle of the night, the villagers woke to the sound of blood-curdling shrieks coming from the pasture. As they carefully approached, they saw the hunter on the ground, groaning in pain. There was no sign of the lion."What happened, Jonesie? Where is the lion?" asked the chief."Forget the damn lion!" he howled. "Which one of you idiots let the bull loose?"]

[Our [softball] team usually puts the other woman at second base, where the<br /> maximum possible number of males can get there on short notice to help out in<br /> case of emergency.  As far as I can tell, our second basewoman is a pretty<br /> good baseball player, better than I am, anyway, but there''s no way to know for<br /> sure<br /> because if the ball gets anywhere near her, a male comes barging over<br /> from, say, right field, to deal with it.  She''s been on the team for three<br /> seasons now, but the males still don''t trust her.

They had been visiting units most of the day and the General came back to the chopper only to see the engine torn apart and the warrant deep in the inner workings of the chopper. The general asked the warrant what was wrong and the warrant, as warrants do, launched into an extremely complex and detailed technical explanation of exactly what was wrong with the engine. The general listened to him for a couple of minutes and then said "Stop! Now Chief, you''re paid for your technical expertise and skill, and its obvious you have that, but the other thing you need to do is to be able to communicate to others what''s wrong in terms they can understand. Now what I want you to do is to tell me what''s wrong with that chopper in words I can understand". The warrant thought for a moment and then got a big grin on his face."OK General", he said, "I think I can do that."

[Dear Mr. Johnson:Ann Landers wouldn''t print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain.It''s about my son, Billy. He''s always been a good, normal 10 year old boy. Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy.We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire -- you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying.I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It''s where he went last year. Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago.I DON''T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED. He''s changed. I can''t explain it. See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy''s letters:----------------------------------- Letter # 1---------- The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only good part. We''re learning how to program. Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up. Love, Billy. Letter # 2------------- Dear Mom, Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We all get to choose what we want to drink. By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I''m getting used to it now. Gotta go, it''s time for the flowchart class. Love, Billy.P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It''s spell checked too. Letter # 3------------- Dear Mom, Don''t worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I don''t have much of a tan cause we don''t go outside very often. You can''t see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I''m okay, really.Love, Billy. Letter # 4------------- Dear Mom, I''m fine. I''m sleeping enough. I''m eating enough. This is the best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Can you send more money? I''ve got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad.Love, Billy. Letter # 5------------- Dear Mother, Forget the money for the telephone. We''ve got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven''t written. I''ve been learning a lot. I''m real good at getting onto any computer in the country. It''s really easy! I got into the university''s in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five, he''s going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He''s really smart. He says that I shouldn''t call myself Billy anymore. So, I''m not.Signed, William. Letter # 6------------- Dear Mother, How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why''d you get so upset? I haven''t gained that much weight. The glasses aren''t real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you''d be proud of my program. After all, I''ve made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I''ve paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won''t be home until late August.Regards, William. Letter # 7------------- Mother, Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.? I won''t write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me.Sincerely, William.-------------What can I do, Mr. Johnson?See what I mean? It''s been two weeks since I''ve heard from my little boy. I know that it''s probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so. Thank you very much.Sally Gates, Concerned Parent]

[How to buy a stero1.  Carefully calculate power requirements, based on room dimensions, etc. Multiply by a factor of 100.2. The ideal system should have as many lights as possible, preferably blinking and flashing in time with the music.3. The components should all have black metal finish, and generally look very cool.4.  The system should be broken up into as many components as possible. (e.g. pre-amp, pre-pre-amp, pre-menstrual-amp, post-amp, post-menopause-amp, etc.)5.  The most important part of a stereo system is the speakers, they should look very cool.  Size and number of sub-speakers and varieties of components pointed at the listener is important. (e.g. tweeters, hooters, sub-woofers, super-sub-woofers, seismic noise generators, etc.)6.  The system should resemble the cockpit of an F16 or 757 aircraft; the more knobs and dials you can turn, the better.7.  The system should have full remote control capability, including over the mobile auto cellular phone so that the stereo can be playing as you get home.8.  Should have the capability of playing different music in every room of the house.9.  Components should have a cool names; this means no department store brands.10. The complete set-up should put a major recording studio or large radio station to shame.  After all, you may be trying to duplicate the exciting feeling of being at a heavy metal concert in a football stadium with 70,000 screaming fans.11. Having state-of-the-art equipment is not enough.  You should be a year or two ahead of everyone else.  Equipment over the warranty period is obsolete and should be disposed of promptly.12. The most important factor--out of everyone you know who owns stereo equipment, yours should be better.]

I walked over and lifted up<br /> the tail, and sure enough, there was my wife''s golf ball........stuck<br /> right in the middle of the cow''s butt. That''s when I made my mistake. </p>\n<p>"What did you do?" asks the doctor. </p>\n<p>Well, I lifted the tail and yelled to my wife, "Hey, this looks like<br /> yours!"]

[A married couple was in a terrible accident where the woman''s face was severely burned. The doctor told the husband that they couldn''t graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny. So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin. However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks. The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter.After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman''s new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty.One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, "Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you.""My darling," he replied, "think nothing of it. I get all the thanks I need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek.]

I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain. It''s about my son, Billy. He''s always been a good, normal ten year old boy. Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy. We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying. I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It''s where he went last year. (He made an adorable picture out of painted pinto beans and macaroni). Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP. We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago. I don''t know what''s happened. He''s changed. I can''t explain it. See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy''s letters.</em></p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only good part. We''re learning how to program. Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We all get to choose what we want to drink. I drink Classic Coke. By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I''m getting used to it now. Gotta go, it''s time for the flowchart class. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It''s spell checked too. </p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>Don''t worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I don''t have much of a tan ''cause we don''t go outside very often. You can''t see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I''m okay, really. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>I''m fine. I''m sleeping enough. I''m eating enough. This is the best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Frederick says it''s okay. Can you send more money? I spent mine on a pocket protector and a box of blank diskettes. I''ve got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>Dear Mother, </p>\n<p>Forget the money for the telephone. We''ve got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven''t written. I''ve been learning a lot. I''m real good at getting onto any computer in the country. It''s really easy! I got into the university''s in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five, he''s going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He''s really smart. He says that I shouldn''t call myself Billy anymore. So, I''m not.</p>\n<p>Signed, </p>\n<p>William. </p>\n<p>Dear Mother, </p>\n<p>How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why''d you get so upset? I haven''t gained that much weight. The glasses aren''t real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you''d be proud of my program. After all, I''ve made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I''ve paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won''t be home until late August. </p>\n<p>Regards, </p>\n<p>William. </p>\n<p>Mother, </p>\n<p>Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.? I won''t write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me. </p>\n<p>Sincerely, </p>\n<p>William. </p>\n<p>See what I mean? It''s been two weeks since I''ve heard from my little boy. What can I do, Mr. Dvorak? I know that it''s probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE ...CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so. </p>\n<p>Thank you very much. </p>\n<p>Sally Gates, </p>\n<p>Concerned Parent]

[THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMASOn the first day of Christmas, my kitten ruined for me........    A batch of my special hand-print cookies. I had turned my back to grab the cookie sheet sitting on the stove. In that micro-second, Sara climbed onto the table, poked her paw into the delightfully kneady mixture and, suddenly off-balance, fell into the cookie dough. Net loss? Six cups of flour, four cups of sugar, three sticks of butter.... Of course, it would have been cheaper to remove the feline ingredient, pick out the hairs, and just rename the recipe Paw Print Cookies. On the second day of Christmas, my kitten accompanied me........    On a trip to the vet clinic. Who knew that skinny curling ribbon has feline taste appeal? I didn''t. Damages: $28 for the office visit, $36 for anesthesia so the veterinarian could take $55 X-rays in case Sara had taste-tested any other Christmas decorations, and a heck of a lot of embarrassment when the vet removed the 3'' curly tail in slightly less than two seconds by tugging at it with a pair of tweezers. On the third day of Christmas, my kitten wrecked for me........    13 ornaments on my Christmas tree. My mistake was forgetting to chain the decorations to the branches. My other error was leaving the room to go to the bathroom while Sara feigned sleeping under the tree. How was I to know the was actually measuring its climbing potential? Value of broken bulbs? 7.50 plus tax.    On the fourth day of Christmas, my kitten broke for me........    A statue in my Lenox Nativity. Would you believe two Wise men plus a head? Lenox nativity figurines: $55.99    On the fifth day of Christmas, my kitten scratched for me........    The kid across the street who collects for charity. It was an accident. She merely wanted to reach out and touch someone. Unfortunately, she used a unsheathed claw to do so. I settled out-of-court for the cost of a jacket to replace the boy''s blood stained one and a hefty donation to the charity of their choice. Although the amount must remain secret according to our settlement, let me put it this way. You haven''t seen many soldiers for the Salvation Army this year, have you? Think: Major Windfall!    On the sixth day of Christmas, my kitten opened for me........    The presents beneath my Christmas tree. It was only two, really. While doing some early shopping at a discount store, I purchased a catnip mouse for Sara''s stocking. Apparently, anything in the same bag as catnip takes on its potent aroma for a very long time. Replacement costs: $3.99 for another roll of Christmas wrapping paper, $4.50 for two empty boxes, $1 each for the kind of bows Sara can''t unravel.    On the seventh day of Christmas, my kitten lost for me........    The earrings I bought for my sister Mary. Actually, it was one earring but since Mary doesn''t have a hole in her nose or navel, a pair of matching earrings does make a more appealing gift. Sale price: $29.95 plus tax.    On the eighth day of Christmas, my kitten helped me........    Replace my E and G guitar strings. Would you believe a kitten could fit into the itty-bitty hole in the middle of my Yamaha guitar? Neither could I, but Sara thought so. And she succeeded once she got those rascally strings out of the way. Unfortunately, her little rear end couldn''t get out the way I came in. After paying through the whiskers for her previous escapades, I would have been willing to leave her in the guitar for the duration of the holiday season, except that she chose to get stuck two hours before I was due at the nursing home for our annual Christmas carol sing-a-long. Set of steel guitar strings: $12.95; jar of petroleum jelly: 79 cents.    On the ninth day of Christmas, my kitten destroyed for me........    My Christmas card list when she walked across my computer''s delete key. Cost for call to Computer Country''s 900/help line: $17.50. And I still don''t know what happened to the listings of B through H.    On the tenth day of Christmas, my kitten hid from me........    The remote control from my 13-inch TV. This wouldn''t be such a disaster if she hadn''t previously stolen the power knob. I missed a week''s worth of Christmas specials, including my all-time favorite, ''It''s a Wonderful Life.'' Rental of ''It''s a Wonderful Life'': $2; purchase of book, ''Good owners, great cats'': $24.95. Unfortunately, it never mentions the psychological profile of kittens with kleptomania.    On the eleventh day of Christmas, my kitten ate for me........    The drumsticks off my 19-pound turkey. OK,OK, So this one time it was my fault. I knew I never should have uttered those now infamous words: ''Your first turkey, Sara. Want to try just a little piece?'' Cost: Christmas Dinner.       On the 12th day of Christmas........    Sara rested. And so, thank goodness, did my VISA card.]

[Little Harley kept disrupting his third grade class by regularly letting loud farts. His teacher kept him after school. When she insisted on knowing why he exhibited such offensive behaviour, Little Harley said, "I do it because I can do it better than anybody, and I''m very proud of that fact."The teacher says, "If I show you I can do it better than you, will you stop?"Little Harley agreed and the teacher placed two pieces of paper on the floor with identical piles of chalk dust on each one. Harley dropped his pants, squatted down, farted and blew all but a tiny little speck of dust off the paper. The teacher dropped her panties, lifted her skirt, squatted down and farted but when she was done, and there was not a trace of chalk dust left on the paper.Harley was astonished and asked if he could see her do it again. She was willing and as she repeated the process, Harley peeked up underneath her skirt."No wonder you won!" he exclaimed indignantly, "you''ve got a Double-Barrel!"]

[After a very successful career, a former Human Relations guru found herself at<br /> the pearly gates. </p>\n<p>"Welcome to Heaven," said St.Peter. "Before you get settled in though, it<br /> seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we''ve never once had a Human<br /> Resources Director make it this far, and we''re not really sure what to do with<br /> you, so what we''re going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven<br /> and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in." </p>\n<p>With that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and went down to hell.<br /> The doors opened, and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a<br /> beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and standing in front<br /> of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with - and<br /> they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up, kissed<br /> her and talked about old times. </p>\n<p>They played an excellent round of golf, and at night went to the country club,<br /> where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil, who<br /> was </p>\n<p>actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes<br /> and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was<br /> time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and </p>\n<p>waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. </p>\n<p>The elevator went up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates, and she found St.<br /> Peter waiting for her. "Now it''s time to spend a day in heaven," he said. So she<br /> spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and<br /> singing. She had a great time, and before she knew it, her 24 hours were up and<br /> St. Peter came and got her and asked her to choose. </p>\n<p>The woman paused for a second and then replied, "Well, I never thought I''d say<br /> this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better<br /> time in Hell." So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went<br /> down-down-down back to Hell. </p>\n<p>When the doors of the elevator opened, she found herself standing in a<br /> desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends were<br /> dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The<br /> Devil came up to her and put his arm around her. </p>\n<p>"I don''t understand," stammered the woman, "yesterday I was here and there was<br /> a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a<br /> great time. Now, all there is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look<br /> miserable." </p>\n<p>The Devil looked at her and smiled. "Yesterday, we were recruiting you, today<br /> you''re staff."]

[Dear Technical Support:</p>\n<p>I''m currently running the latest version of GirlFriend and I''ve<br /> been having some problems lately. I''ve been running the same<br /> version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 forever as my primary<br /> application, and all the GirlFriend releases I''ve tried have<br /> always conflicted with it. I hear that DrinkingBuddies won''t<br /> crash if GirlFriend is run in background mode and the sound is<br /> turned off. But I''m embarrassed to say I can''t find the switch<br /> to turn the sound off. I just run them separately, and it works<br /> okay.</p>\n<p>Girlfriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf<br /> program, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing<br /> incompatibility.</p>\n<p>I probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought<br /> I might see better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months<br /> of conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has<br /> had experience with GirlFriend 2.0. He said I probably didn''t<br /> have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0, and eventually it would<br /> require a Token Ring to run properly. He was right - as soon as<br /> I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself.</p>\n<p>Shortly after that, I installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the<br /> bugs were supposed to be gone, but the first time I used it, it<br /> gave me a virus anyway. I had to clean out my whole system and<br /> shut down for a while. I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend<br /> 4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a<br /> virus protection program. It worked okay for a while until I<br /> discovered that GirlFriend 1.0 was still in my system. I tried<br /> running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still<br /> installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I didn''t know about<br /> that automatically senses the presence of any other version of<br /> GirlFriend and communicates with it in some way, which results<br /> in the immediate removal of both versions.</p>\n<p>The version I have now works pretty well, but there are still<br /> some problems. Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in<br /> some obscure language I can''t understand, much less reprogram.<br /> Frankly I think there is too much attention paid to the look and<br /> feel rather than the desired functionality. Also, to get the<br /> best connections with your hardware, you usually have to use<br /> gold-plated contacts. And I''ve never liked how GirlFriend is<br /> totally "object-oriented." A year ago, a friend of mine upgraded<br /> his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a<br /> Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. He discovered<br /> that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don''t<br /> upgrade to Fiancee 1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had<br /> to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a huge resource<br /> hog. It has taken up all his space, so he can''t load anything<br /> else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go with Wife 1.0<br /> was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out<br /> the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits<br /> access to FreeSexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted<br /> to try. On top of that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well<br /> warmed-up system before he can do anything. Although he did not<br /> ask for it, Wife 1.0 came with MotherInLaw which has an<br /> automatic pop-up feature he can''t turn off.</p>\n<p>I told him to try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he heard<br /> if you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife<br /> 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself.<br /> Then Mistress 1.0 won''t install anyway because of insufficient<br /> resources. Any Ideas???]

[Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event. It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler''s trainer came to him and said, "Now don''t forget all the research we''ve done on this Russian. He''s never lost a match because of this "pretzel" hold he has. Whatever you do, don''t let him get you in this hold! If he does, you''re finished!" </p>\n<p>The wrestler nodded in agreement. </p>\n<p>Now, to the match: The American and the Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn''t watch the ending. Suddenly there was a scream, a cheep from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian''s back hit the mat with a thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him, getting the pin and winning the match. The trainer was astounded! </p>\n<p>When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asks, "How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!" </p>\n<p>The wrestler answered, "Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could. "You''d be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls!"]

[A rugby player was hurt very badly during a scrum and he had both of his ears<br /> ripped off. Since he was permanently disfigured, he decided to give up playing<br /> Rugby for good. His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money<br /> went his way.</p>\n<p>One day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear<br /> business. He bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line,<br /> realised that he knew nothing about business. He decided to employ someone to<br /> run the shop.</p>\n<p>The next day he set up three interviews. The first guy was great. He knew<br /> everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic. At the end of the interview,<br /> the former rugby player asked him, "Do you notice anything different about me?"</p>\n<p>And the man replied, "Why, yes, I couldn''t help noticing you have no ears."<br /> The rugby player got angry and threw him out.</p>\n<p>The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first<br /> guy. He asked her the same question, "Do you notice anythingdifferent about<br /> me?"</p>\n<p>She replied: "Well, you have no ears." He got upset again and showed her<br /> the door.</p>\n<p>The third and last interview was with the best of the three. He was a very<br /> young man fresh out of college. He was smart and handsome and seemed to know all<br /> about the sportswear business.</p>\n<p>The Rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question:<br /> "Do you notice anything different about me?"</p>\n<p>To his surprise the young man answered: "Yes, you wear contact lenses."</p>\n<p>The former rugby player was shocked, and said, "What an incredibly observant<br /> young man you are. </p>\n<p>How in the world did you know that?"</p>\n<p>The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, "Well,<br /> it''s pretty hard to wear glasses with no flipping ears."]

[Sent by  a  friend:  I''m  currently  running  the  latest  version  of<br /> GirlFriend and I''ve been having some problems lately.I''ve been running the  same<br />  version  of   DrinkingBuddies1.0   forever  as  my  primary application, and<br /> all the  GirlFriend  releases  I''ve tried have always conflicted with  it.  I<br /> hear  that  DrinkingBuddies  won''t  crash  if GirlFriend is run in  background<br /> mode  and  its  sound is turned off. However, for the life of  me  I  can''tfind<br /> the  switch that turns the sound off. So, I just run them separately, and they<br /> work just fine.<br /> GirlFriend also seems  to  have  a  problem  co-existing  with my Golf<br /> program,  often  trying  to  abort  Golf  with  some  sort  of  timing<br /> incompatibility. I probably should  have  stayed  with GirlFriend 1.0, but I<br /> thought I  might  see  better  performance  from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of<br /> conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with<br /> GirlFriend 2.0. He said I probably didn''t have enough cache to run GirlFriend<br /> 2.0,  and eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly.  He  was<br /> right.  As  soon  as I purged my cache,  it  uninstalled  itself.  Shortly<br /> after  that,  I  installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta.All the bugs  were  supposed  to<br /> be gone, but the first time I used it, it gave me a virus anyway.<br /> I had to clean out my  whole  system  and  shut down for while. I very<br /> cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend 4.0. This  time  I used a SCSI probe first and<br /> also installed a  virus  protection  program. It worked okay for a while until I<br />  discovered  that  GirlFriend  1.0 was still in my system. I tried running<br /> GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has<br /> a  feature  I didn''t know about that automatically senses the presence of  any<br /> other version of GirlFriend and communicates with it in some  way,  which<br /> results in the immediate removal of both versions.<br /> The version I have now  works  pretty  well,  but there are still some<br /> problems. Like all  versions  of  GirlFriend,  it  is  written in some obscure<br /> language I can''t  understand,  much  less reprogram. Frankly I think there is<br /> too much  attention  paid  to  the look and feel rather than the  desired<br /> functionality.  Also,  I''ve  never  liked  how  the GirlFriend Series is totally<br /> object-oriented. A  year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of<br /> GirlFriend  to GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident<br /> version of GirlFriend. He discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a<br /> year if you don''t upgrade to Fiancee 1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had<br /> to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a  huge  resource  hog. It has<br /> taken up all his space, so he can''t load anything  else. One of the primary<br /> reasons he decided to go  with  Wife  1.0  was  because  it  came bundled with<br /> FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 often<br /> prohibits access to FreeSexPlus,  even with new Plug-Ins. On top of that, Wife<br /> 1.0 came  with  MotherInLaw 1.0, although he did not<br /> ask for it. This has an automatic pop-up feature he can''t control, and it''s<br /> impossible to modulate its  sound.  I  suggested that he consider installing<br /> Mistress 1.0, but he said  he  heard  if  you try to run it without first<br /> uninstalling any of  the  Wife  series, Wife will delete all MSMoney files and<br /> crash  the  system  before uninstalling itself. With a purged cache, Mistress<br /> 1.0  will  never  install. The moral of this story is:  Know  your  system''s<br /> hardware  requirements, software peculiarities and limited range of<br /> compatibilities  and do be careful with those alluring upgrades.]

[THE FEMALE STRESS DIET<br /> This is a specially formulated diet designed to help you cope with the stress that builds up during the day:</p>\n<p>Breakfast - I grapefruit, I slice whole-wheat toast, I cup of skim milk.</p>\n<p>Lunch - Small portion of lean, steamed chicken with a cup of spinach, 1 cup of herbal tea, I Tim Tam.</p>\n<p>Afternoon Tea - The rest of the packet of Tim Tams, I tub of Tip Top ice cream with chocolate topping, I jar of Nutella.</p>\n<p>Dinner - 4 bottles of red wine, 2 loaves of garlic bread, I family size supreme pizza, 3 Snickers bars.</p>\n<p>Late Night Snack - Whole frozen Sarah Lee cheesecake eaten directly from the freezer.</p>\n<p>Diet Rules<br /> 1. If no one sees you eat something, it has no calories.</p>\n<p>2. When drinking a diet Coke with a chocolate bar, the fat in the  chocolate is cancelled out by the diet Coke.</p>\n<p>3. When you eat with someone else, calories don''t count if you  do not eat more than they do.</p>\n<p>4. Food used for medicinal purposes does NOT count. (For  example: hot chocolate, toast, cheesecake, vodka...)</p>\n<p>5. If you fatten up the people around you, you will look thinner.</p>\n<p>6. Cinema-related foods have a zero calorie count as they are part of the entertainment package and not counted as food intake. This includes popcorn, Minties, Maltesers, Jaffas and frozen Cokes.</p>\n<p>7. Biscuit pieces have no calories because breaking the biscuits up causes calorie leakage.</p>\n<p>8. Food licked from knives and spoons has no fat if you are in the process of cooking something.</p>\n<p>9. Foods that are the same color have the same amount of fat. Examples are: spinach and peppermint ice cream, apples and red jelly snakes.</p>\n<p>10. Chocolate is like a food-color wildcard and may be  substituted for any other color.</p>\n<p>11. Anything eaten while standing has no calories due to gravity and the density of the calorie mass.</p>\n<p>12. Food consumed from someone else''s plate has no fat as it rightfully belongs to the other person and will cling to his/her plate. (Oh, how fat likes to cling!)</p>\n<p>And remember: ''STRESSED'' SPELT BACKWARDS IS ''DESSERTS''!]

Finally, in the corner of the room, his<br /> flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot.&nbsp; "Did you say that?" He<br /> hissed at the parrot.</p>\n<p>"Yep," the parrot confessed, then squawked, "I''m just trying to warn<br /> you."</p>\n<p>The burglar relaxed. "Warn me, huh?

[Following a distinguished legal career, a man arrived at the Gates of Heaven, accompanied by the Pope, who had the misfortune to expire on the same day. The Pope was greeted first by St. Peter, who escorted him to his quarters. The room was somewhat shabby and small, similar to that found in a low grade Motel 6 type establishment. The lawyer was then taken to his room, which was a palatial suite including a private swimming pool, a garden, and a terrace overlooking the Gates. The attorney was somewhat taken aback, and told St. Peter, "I''m really quite surprised at these rooms, seeing as how the Pope was given such small accommodations." St. Peter replied, "We have over a hundred Popes here, and we''re really very bored with them. We''ve never had a lawyer."]
[Bill Gates suddenly dies and finds himself face to face with God. God stood over Bill Gates and said, "Well Bill, I''m really confused on this one. It''s a tough decision; I''m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows ''95 among other indiscretions. I believe I''ll do something I''ve never done before; I''ll let you decide where you want to go."Bill pushed up his glasses, looked up at God and replied, "Could you briefly explain the difference between the two?" Looking slightly puzzled, God said, "Better yet, why don''t I let you visit both places briefly, then you can make your decision. Which do you choose to see first, Heaven or Hell?"Bill played with his pocket protector for a moment, then looked back at God and said, "I think I''ll try Hell first." So, with a flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke, Bill Gates went to Hell.When he materialized in Hell, Bill looked around. It was a beautiful and clean place, a bit warm, with sandy beaches and tall mountains, clear skies, pristine water, and beautiful women frolicking about. A smile came across Bill''s face as he took in a deep breath of the clean air. "This is great," he thought, "if this is Hell, I can''t wait to see heaven."Within seconds of his thought, another flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke appeared, and Bill was off to Heaven. Heaven was a place high above the clouds, where angels were drifting about playing their harps and singing in a beautiful chorus. It was a very nice place, Bill thought, but not as enticing as Hell.Bill looked up, cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled for God and Bill Gates was sent to Hell for eternity.Time passed, and God decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was progressing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill Gates shackled to a wall in a dark cave amid bone thin men and tongues of fire, being burned and tortured by demons."So, how is everything going?" God asked.Bill responded with a crackling voice filled with anguish and disappointment, "This is awful! It''s nothing like the Hell I visited the first time!! I can''t believe this is happening! What happened to the other place....with the beaches and the mountains and the beautiful women?"That was the demo," replied God.]

After she''s completed the drink, she turns again to the throng and points around at all of them, again revealing the hairy armpit, saying,''What man out there will buy a lady a drink?''Once again, the little drunk slaps his hand down on the bar and slurs to the barman, ''Sir, I would like to buy the ballerina another drink.''After serving the lady her second drink, the barman approaches the little drunkard and says, ''It''s your business if you want to buy the lady a drink, but why do you keep calling her a ballerina?''To which, the drunk replies, ''Sir, in my eyes, any woman who can lift her leg up that high has got to be a ballerina.'']

[Trouser was normally a happy-go-lucky dog. He would chase tennis balls, play with other doggies, and eat his dinner without a fuss. He was a dog without a care. But on that fateful autumn afternoon, it was to be different. Trouser''s owners were walking him along a trail at the park, when suddenly from out of the bushes jumped a man all dressed in black. He had white paint on his face, and was gesturing annoyingly at Trouser''s masters. This strange person spoke not a word, but proceeded to pretend that he was trapped in a box and that he was pulling on a long rope. Seeing the sheer horror on his masters'' faces, Trouser took it upon himself to rectify the situation. With a low growl he jumped and sank his teeth into this annoying pseudo clown''s leg. Trouser immediately got a sickened look in his eyes and began to vomit wildly. He then dragged his tongue all over the ground in an effort to remove the man''s foul essence from his mouth. For Trouser had learned that .... a mime is a terrible thing to taste.]

[The 5 questions most feared by men are:<br /> 1. What are you thinking about?<br /> 2. Do you love me?<br /> 3. Do I look fat in this?<br /> 4. Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5. What would you do if I died?</p>\n<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e., tells the truth). Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible responses.</p>\n<p>Question # 1: What are you thinking about? The proper answer to this, of course, is: " I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you." This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which most likely is one of the following:<br /> a. Football.<br /> b. Golf.<br /> c. How fat you are.<br /> d. How much prettier she is than you<br /> e. How I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, "If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!"</p>\n<p>Question # 2: Do you love me? The proper response is: "YES!" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in order, "Yes, dear."</p>\n<p>Inappropriate responses include:<br /> a. Oh Yeah, sh@*-loads.<br /> b. Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> c. That depends on what you mean by love.<br /> d. Does it matter?<br /> e. Who, me?</p>\n<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat?<br /> The correct answer is an emphatic: "Of course not!" Among the incorrect answers are:<br /> a. Compared to what?<br /> b. I wouldn''t call you fat, but you''re not exactly thin.<br /> c. A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d. I''ve seen fatter.<br /> e. Sorry what did you say? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question # 4: Do you think she''s prettier than me?<br /> Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: "Of course not!" Incorrect responses include:<br /> a. Yes, but you have a better personality<br /> b. Not prettier, but definitely thinner<br /> c. Not as pretty as you when you were her age<br /> d. Define pretty<br /> e. Sorry what did you say ? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question # 5: What would you do if I died? A definite no-win question.(The real answer, of course, is "Buy a Lotus and a Boat").</p>\n<p>No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:</p>\n<p>WOMAN: Would you get married again?<br /> MAN: Definitely not!<br /> WOMAN: Why not - don''t you like being married?<br /> MAN: Of course I do.<br /> WOMAN: Then why wouldn''t you remarry?<br /> MAN: Okay, I''d get married again.<br /> WOMAN: You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)<br /> MAN: (makes audible groan)<br /> WOMAN: Would you sleep with her in our bed?<br /> MAN: Where else would we sleep?<br /> WOMAN: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?<br /> MAN: That would seem like the proper thing to do.<br /> WOMAN: And would you let her use my golf clubs?<br /> MAN: She can''t use them; she''s left-handed.<br /> WOMAN: - - - silence - - -<br /> MAN: Sh&amp;%.]

[There was a man that owned a giant gorilla and for all of its life, he''d never left it on its own. But eventually he had to go on a business trip and had to leave his gorilla in the care of his next-door neighbor. So he explained to his neighbor that all he had to do was feed his gorilla three bananas a day at three, six and nine o''clock. But he was never ever, ever to touch its fur. </p>\n<p>So the next day the man came and gave the gorilla a banana and looked at it for a while thinking, "Why can''t I touch its fur?" as there didn''t seem to be anything wrong with it. Every day he came in and looked for a little while longer as he still couldn�酶惟t understand until, about a week later, he�酶惟d worked himself into a frenzy and decided that he was going to touch the gorilla. </p>\n<p>He passed it the banana and very gently brushed the back of his hand against its fur. Suddenly the gorilla went ape wild and started to jump around, then it turned and began running towards the man who, in turn, ran through the front door, over the lawn, across the street, into some one else�酶惟s sports car and drove off. In the rear-view mirror, he could see the gorilla in its own sports car, driving right behind him. He drove for two hours until the engine began to splutter and the car just stopped. He jumped out and began to run down the street, over a brick wall, into someone''s front garden and up the apple tree. </p>\n<p>He turned around to find the gorilla right behind him beating its chest. The man jumped down and ran back in to the street screaming, until it became dark and he thought he''d lost the gorilla. The man ran into an alley-way, then, suddenly, he saw a giant shadow coming down the street ahead. The gorilla! It came to the end of the alley, stood and looked straight into the bloodshot eyes of the man and came towards him slowly. This time there was no escape. </p>\n<p>As the gorilla neared him, the man began to feel faint. The giant beast came face to face with him, raised its mighty hand and said, "Tag! You�酶惟re it!"]

[EUREKA! The Discovery that political conservatism is determined by the genes opens a window on a brighter tomorrow. (After all, who would actually choose to be Republican?)                     By Daniel MendelsohnThe startling discovery that affiliation with the Republican Party is genetically determined, announced by scientists in the current issue of the journal Nurture, threatens to overshadow the announcement by scientists that there might be a gene for homosexuality in men. Reports of the gene that codes for political conservatism, discovered after a long study of quintuplets in Orange County, Calif., has sent shock waves through the medical, political and golfing communities. Psychologists and psychoanalysts have long believed that Republicans'' unnatural and frequently unconstitutional tendencies result from unhealthy family life -- a remarkable high percentage of Republicans had authoritarian, domineering fathers and emotionally distant mothers who didn''t teach them how to be kind and gentle. But biologists have long suspected that conservatism in inherited. "After all," said on author of the Nurture article, "it''s quite common for a Republican to have a brother or sister who is a Republican." The finding has been greeted with relief by parents and friends of Republicans, who have tended to blame themselves for the political views of otherwise lovable people -- their children, friends and unindicted co-conspirators. One mother, a long time Democrat, clasped her hands in ecstasy on hearing of the findings: "I just knew it was genetic," she said, seated beside her two sons, both avowed Republicans. "I just knew nobody would actually choose that lifestyle!" When asked what the Republican lifestyle was, she said, "Well, you can just tell from watching TV, like at the convention in Houston: the loud outfits, the flaming xenophobia, the flamboyant demagogy -- you know." Both sons said they had suspected their Republicanism from an early age but did not confirm it until they were in college, when they became convinced it wasn''t just a phase they were going through. Despite the near certainty of the medical community about Republicanism''s genetic origins, troubling issues remain. The Nurture article offered no response to the suggestion that the startling high incidence of Republicanism among siblings could result from the fact that they hare not only genes but also psychological and emotional attitudes, being the products of the same parents and family dynamics. And it remains to be explained why so many avowed Democrats are known to vote Republican occasionally -- or at least to fantasize about doing so. Polls show that three out of five adult Democrats admit to having had a Republican experience. In well-adjusted people, however, this experimentation rarely outlasts adolescence. Surprisingly, some Republican activists hail the findings as a step forward rather that as an invitation to more conservophobia. They agree than since Republicans didn''t "choose" their unwholesome lifestyle any more that someone "chooses" to have a ski-jump nose, they shouldn''t be denied civil rights to which normal people are entitled. Other Republicans, recalling 19th century studies that "proved" the mental inferiority of blacks, find the frenzied search for the biological cause of Republicanism pointless, if not downright sinister. But for most real Americans, the discovery opens a window on a brighter tomorrow. In a few years, gene therapy could eradicate Republicanism altogether. If conservatism is not the result of sheer orneriness (as many suspect) but is something Republicans can''t help and probably even don''t like, there''s no reason why we shouldn''t tolerate Republicans in the military or even high elected office -- provided they don''t flaunt their political beliefs.]

I looked  around the room, and all the waiters, waitresses, busboys, etc. had spoons in  their pockets.</p>\n<p>When our waiter returned to take our order, I just had to ask, "Why the spoons?"</p>\n<p>"Well," he explained, "our parent company recently hired some Andersen<br /> Consulting efficiency experts to review all our procedures, and after<br /> months  of statistical analyses, they concluded that our patrons drop<br /> spoons on the floor 73% more often than any other utensil; at a frequency of 3 spoons per hour per workstation. By preparing all our workers for this contingency in advance, we can cut our trips to the kitchen down and save time...nearly 1.5 extra man-hours per shift.<br /> Just as he concluded, a "ch-ching" came from the table  behind him,  and he quickly replaced a fallen spoon with the one from his pocket.<br /> "I''ll grab another spoon the next time I''m in the kitchen instead of<br /> making a special trip," he proudly  explained.<br /> I was impressed.  "Thanks. I  had to ask."<br /> "No problem," he answered, then he continued to take our orders.</p>\n<p>As the members of my dinner party took their turns, my eyes darted<br /> back &amp; forth from each person ordering and my menu. That''s when, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a thin, black thread protruding from our waiter''s fly. Again, I  dismissed it; yet I had to scan the room and,  sure enough, there were other waiters &amp; busboys with strings hanging out of their trousers.<br /> My curiosity overrode discretion at this point, so before he could leave I had to ask. "Excuse me, but...uh...why, or what...about that string?"<br /> "Oh, yeah" he began in a quieter tone. "Not many people are that observant. That same efficiency group found we could save time in the Men''s room, too." "How''s that, I asked?"<br /> "You see, by tying a string to the end of our, eh. . ., selves, we can<br /> pull it out at the urinals literally hands-free and thereby eliminate<br /> the need to wash our hands, cutting time spent in the restroom by over<br /> 93%!" "Oh, that makes sense," I said, but then thinking through the<br /> process, I asked, "Hey, wait a minute.  If the string helps you pull it out, how do you get it back in?"</p>\n<p>"Well," he whispered, "I don''t know about the other guys; but I use<br /> the spoon in my pocket"!]
[Several men are in the locker room of a golf club. When a cell phone on a bench rings, a man engages the handsfree speaker-function and begins to talk.</p>\n<p>MAN: "Hello."</p>\n<p>WOMAN: "Honey, it''s me. Are you at the club?"</p>\n<p>MAN: "Yes."</p>\n<p>WOMAN: "I am at the mall and found a beautiful leather coat. Its only $1,000. Can I buy it?"</p>\n<p>MAN: "OK, go ahead if you like it that much."</p>\n<p>WOMAN: "I also stopped by the Mercedes dealership and saw the new models. I saw one I really liked."</p>\n<p>MAN: "How much?"</p>\n<p>WOMAN: "$60,000"</p>\n<p>MAN: "For that price I want it with all the options."</p>\n<p>WOMAN: "Great! One more thing....the house we wanted last year is back on the market. They''re only asking $750,000."</p>\n<p>MAN: "Well, then go ahead and buy it, but just offer $740,000."</p>\n<p>WOMAN: "OK. I''ll see you later! I love you!"</p>\n<p>MAN: "Bye, I love you, too."</p>\n<p>The man hangs up. The other men are looking at him in astonishment.

[A Delta Airlines pilot was badly embarrassed about the a particularly rough landing. He was reluctantly fulfilling company policy that required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited.  Nevertheless he stood there and gave each person a smile, and said:  ''Thanks for flying Delta.''He had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, awaiting that inevitable harsh comment on the landing, which by extension would impugn his professional skills and probably his manhood as well. There were fewer smiles than normal, but no comments.  Finally, everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane.  She said, ''Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?'' ''Why no M''am,'' said the pilot, ''what is it?'' The little old lady said, ''Did we just land or were we shot down?'']

[It was a boring Sunday afternoon in the jungle so the Elephants decided to challenge the Ants to a game of soccer. The game was going well with the Elephants beating the Ants ten goals to nil, when the Ants gained posession. The Ants'' star player was dribbling the ball towards the Elephants'' goal when the Elephants'' left back came lumbering towards him. The elephant trod on the little ant, killing him instantly. The referee stopped the game."What the hell do you think you''re doing? Do you call that sportsmanship, killing another player?"  The elephant replied, "Well, I didn''t mean to kill him -- I was just trying to trip him up."]
[In The Beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void, And darkness was upon the face of the deep.</p>\n<p>And the Devil said, "It doesn''t get any better than this."</p>\n<p>And so God created Man in His own image; Male and female He created them.</p>\n<p>And God looked upon Man and Woman And saw that they were lean and fit. And God populated the earth With broccoli and cauliflower and spinach and green and yellow vegetables of all kinds, So Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.</p>\n<p>And so the Devil created McDonald''s. And McDonald''s brought forth the 79-cent double cheeseburger. And the Devil said to Man, "You want fries with that?"</p>\n<p>And Man said, "Super size them." And Man gained five pounds.</p>\n<p>And so God created the healthful yogurt, That Woman might keep her figure. But the Devil brought forth chocolate. And Woman gained five pounds.</p>\n<p>And God said, "Try my crispy fresh salad." And the Devil brought forth Ben and Jerry''s. And Woman gained 10 pounds.</p>\n<p>And God said, "Why doth thou eatest thus? I have sent thee heart-healthy vegetables And olive oil with which to cook them."</p>\n<p>But the Devil brought forth chicken fried steak So big it needed its own platter. And Man gained 10 pounds And his bad cholesterol went through the roof.</p>\n<p>And so God brought forth running shoes. And Man resolved to lose those extra pounds.</p>\n<p>And the Devil brought forth cable TV with remote control So Man would not have to toil to change channels between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man gained another 20 pounds.</p>\n<p>And so God brought forth the potato, A vegetable naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition.</p>\n<p>And the Devil peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fat fried them. And the Devil created sour cream dip.</p>\n<p>And Man clutched his remote control And ate the potato chips swaddled in cholesterol.</p>\n<p>And the Devil saw this and said, "It is good."</p>\n<p>And Man went into cardiac arrest. And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.</p>\n<p>And the Devil cancelled Man''s health insurance.</p>\n<p>So God showed Woman how to peel the skin off chicken. And cook the nourishing whole grain brown rice. And the Devil created light beer So Man could poison his body, While feeling righteous because he had to drink twice as much of the now-insipid brew to get the same buzz. And Man gained another 10 pounds.</p>\n<p>And Woman ventured forth Into the land of Godiva chocolate, And upon returning asked Man, "Do I look fat?"</p>\n<p>And the Devil said, "Always tell the truth."</p>\n<p>And Man did.</p>\n<p>And Woman went out from the presence of Man And dwelt in the land of the divorce lawyer, East of the marriage counselor.</p>\n<p>And the Devil said, "It doesn''t get any better than this!"]
[The animals were bored. Finally, the lion had an idea. "I know a really<br /> exciting game that the humans play called football. I''ve seen it on T.V."</p>\n<p>He proceeded to describe it to the rest of the animals and they all got<br /> excited about it so they decided to play. They went out to the field and chose<br /> up teams and were ready to begin.</p>\n<p>The lion''s team received. They were able to get two first downs and then had<br /> to punt. The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick. He caught the<br /> ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two<br /> rabbits. He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to<br /> daylight, scoring six.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0.</p>\n<p>Late in the first half the lion''s team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked<br /> the extra point. The lion''s team led at halftime 7 - 6. In the locker room, the<br /> lion gave a peptalk.</p>\n<p>"Look you guys. We can win this game. We''ve got the lead and they only have<br /> one real threat. We''ve got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he''s a killer.<br /> Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino."</p>\n<p>The second half began. Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino''s<br /> team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino. Once again, the<br /> rhino lowered his head and was off running. First, he stomped two gazelles. He<br /> skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way. It looked like he<br /> was home free. Suddenly at the twenty-yard line, he dropped over dead. There<br /> were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what<br /> had happened. Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede.</p>\n<p>"Did you do this?" he asked the centipede.</p>\n<p>"Yeah, I did." the centipede replied.</p>\n<p>The lion retorted, "Where were you during the first half?"</p>\n<p>"I was putting on my shoes."]

[Once there was a man who was peacefully driving down a windy road.<br /> Suddenly, a bunny skipped across the road and the man couldn''t stop. He hit<br /> the bunny head on. Once the man knew what had happened, he quickly jumped out of<br /> his car to check the scene. There, laying lifeless in the middle of the road,<br /> was the Easter bunny. </p>\n<p>The man cried out, "Oh no! I have committed a terrible crime! I have run over<br /> the Easter bunny!" </p>\n<p>The man started sobbing quite hard and then he heard another car approaching.<br /> It was a woman in a red convertable.

Now there will be no one to deliver eggs on Easter Day, and it''s<br /> all my fault." </p>\n<p>The woman ran back to her car. A moment later, she came back carrying a spray<br /> bottle. She ran over to the motionless bunny and sprayed it. The bunny<br /> immediately sprang up, ran into the woods, stopped, and waved back at the man<br /> and woman. Then it ran another 10 feet, stopped, and waved. It then ran another<br /> 10 feet, stopped, and waved again. It did this over and over and over again<br /> until the man and the woman could no longer see the bunny. </p>\n<p>Once out of sight, the man exclaimed, "What is that stuff in that bottle?" </p>\n<p>The woman replied, "It''s harespray.

[Did you here what happened 3 1/2 years ago at the University of Tennessee<br /> just before Spring Break? Well 3 days before UT got out for spring break,<br /> some of the other SEC schools let their students out for spring break and<br /> with the Interstate running through Knoxville like it does, 5 Auburn<br /> Football Players drove thru Knoxville on their way to the Smoky Mountains<br /> on I-40 in a Dodge Caravan. One of the players knew the interstate exits<br /> in Knoxville and said turn here at 17th street and had the driver drive<br /> straight up to the hill on Tennessee''s campus. After parking the 5 players<br /> got out and started walking around UT''s campus looking at the football<br /> facilities and 3 of them were wearing T-shirts with AUBURN in bold type<br /> across the front. UT''s players were still there studying for finals and<br /> looked out, saw them, and recognized them and got mad. 15 UT players went<br /> out and circled them and said, "We looked up that word Auburn on your<br /> shirts, in the dictionary, and it talks about the colors of Fall, but it<br /> does not say anything about a school in Alabama. What does it mean?" The<br /> auburn players were scared being outnumbered 15 to 5 so they responded,<br /> "In football it means Alabama Usually Beats Us Round November". Of course<br /> Tennessee beat Auburn last year in the SEC Championship 12/6/97, which<br /> being not a full week into December is still around November, so when it<br /> comes to beating Auburn round November, UT means US TOO! We can beat<br /> Auburn around November!!!!]

[An optimist sees the best in the world, while a pessimist sees only the worst. An optimist finds the positive in the negative, and a pessimist can only find the negative in the positive. </p>\n<p>For example, an avid duck hunter was in the market for a new bird dog. His search ended when he found a dog that could actually walk on water to retrieve a duck. Shocked by his find, he was sure none of his friends would ever believe him. </p>\n<p>He decided to try to break the news to a friend of his, a pessimist by nature, and invited him to hunt with him and his new dog. </p>\n<p>As they waited by the shore, a flock of ducks flew by. they fired, and a duck fell. The dog responded and jumped into the water. The dog, however, did not sink but instead walked across the water to retrieve the bird, never getting more than his paws wet. This continued all day long; each time a duck fell, the dog walked across the surface of the water to retrieve it. </p>\n<p>The pessimist watched carefully, saw everything, but did not say a single word. </p>\n<p>On the drive home the hunter asked his friend, "Did you notice anything unusual about my new dog?" </p>\n<p>"I sure did," responded the pessimist. "Your dog can''t swim!"]

He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools, but he couldn''t find a ringer quarterback who could ensure a Super Bowl win.</p>\n<p>Then one night, while watching CNN, he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia. In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand grenade straight into a 15th-story window 200 yards away -- ka-boom!

Just out of curiosity, what''s your cut if you collect? The first thing you need to realize is that I have no credit record to "protect". My credit rating is piss-poor, and I have skipped out on bills all over the United States. </p>\n<p>However, I need a personal phone, so I have no intention of skipping out on this phone bill. More significantly, though, I would never, but NEVER, pay a past-due bill to you scum-sucking leeches. Which leads me to my next point: It should be clear by now that I do not have a high regard for your `arasitic profession. In fact, in my eyes, you would be doing yourselves, and society at large, a favor by closing down immediately and entering a more respectable field--like pimping or kiddie porn. You certainly have the professional ethics for it . . . </p>\n<p>In sum, I have every intention of paying my phone bill and restoring my service, hopefully within sixty days. But you heaps of rancid guano will have had NOTHING to do with it. Please continue to bombard me with notices--I just bought some extra-large trash bags to handle the load. Oh, and please feel free to send a representative to my home. </p>\n<p>Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to knock him down the flight of 25 steps leading to my front door. That is, if filth-balls of your ilk ever appear in daylight . . . Worst of luck and my sincerest wishes for the immediate failure of your "business". </p>\n<p>GET A JOB!!! </p>\n<p>Sincerely,]

[Little Johnny was 7 years old, and like other boys his age, rather curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about courting from other boys and he wondered what it was and how it was done.</p>\n<p>One day he took his questions to his mother, and she became flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did, and the following morning Johnny described everything to his mother:</p>\n<p>"Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her, I figured sis must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart,just like the doctor would. Except he''s not as good as the doctor, because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart.</p>\n<p>He was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been getting cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got toward the end of the couch.</p>\n<p>This was when the fever started. I know it was a fever because sis told him she was really HOT.</p>\n<p>Finally, I found out what was making them so sick.... a big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there about 9 inches long. HONEST!</p>\n<p>Anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away.</p>\n<p>When sis saw it she got really scared. Her eyes got big and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. I should tell her about the ones I saw at the lake!</p>\n<p>Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by bitting its head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go... I guess it bit her back.</p>\n<p>Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eels head to keep it from biting again.</p>\n<p>Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on it. And he helped by laying on the top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squishing it between them.</p>\n<p>After a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend sat up and sure enough they had killed the eel...</p>\n<p>I knew it was dead because it just hung there limp and some of its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went on courting anyway.</p>\n<p>He started hugging and kissing her again. And by golly, the eel wasn''t dead after all. It jumped straight up and started to fight again.</p>\n<p>I guess eels are like cats.... they have nine lives or something.</p>\n<p>This time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After about 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the eel. I know it was dead this time because I saw sis''s boyfriend peel off the skin and flush it down the toilet."</p>\n<p>Mother fainted.]

[Three turtles, Joe, Steve, and Poncho, decide to go on a picnic. So, Joe packs the picnic basket with cookies, bottled sodas, and sandwiches. The trouble is, the picnic site is, 10 miles away, so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there. By the time they do arrive, everyone''s whipped .Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and says,''Alright, Steve, gimme the bottle opener.</p>\n<p>"I didn''t bring the bottle opener,'' Steve says. ''I thought you packed it.'' Joe gets worried. </p>\n<p>He turns to Poncho. ''Poncho, do you have the bottle opener?'' </p>\n<p>Naturally, Poncho doesn''t have it, so the turtles are stuck ten miles away from home without soda. Joe &amp; Steve beg Poncho to turn back home and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses, knowing that they''ll eat everything by the time he gets back. Somehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go ,swearing on their great-grand turtles'' graves that they won''t touch the food. </p>\n<p>So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and steadily. Twenty days pass, but no Poncho. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise. Another day passes, and still no Poncho, but a promise is a promise. After three more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve starts getting restless. </p>\n<p>''I NEED FOOD!'' he says with a hint of dementia in his voice. ''NO!'' Joe retorts. ''We promised.'' Five more days pass. Joe realizes that Poncho probably skipped out to the Burger King down the road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid ,get a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat. </p>\n<p>But then, right at that instant, Poncho pops out behind a rock, and says, "Just for that, I''m not going."]
[On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of<br /> quarters at a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for<br /> dinner with her husband in the hotel dining room. But first she<br /> wanted to stash the quarters in her room. "I''ll be right back<br /> and we''ll go to eat," she told her husband and she carried the<br /> coin-laden bucket to the elevator. </p>\n<p>As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men<br /> already aboard. Both were black. One of them was big...very<br /> big...an intimidating figure. The woman froze. Her first thought<br /> was: These two are going to rob me. Her next thought was: Don''t<br /> be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice gentlemen. But racial<br /> stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her. </p>\n<p>She stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious,<br /> flustered, ashamed. She hoped they didn''t read her mind, but<br /> knew they surely did; her hesitation about joining them on the<br /> elevator was all too obvious. Her face was flushed. She couldn''t<br /> just stand there, so with a mighty effort of will she picked up<br /> one foot and stepped forward and followed with the other foot<br /> and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye contact, she turned around<br /> stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed. A second<br /> passed, and then another second, and then another. Her fear<br /> increased! The elevator didn''t move. Panic consumed her. "My<br /> God", she thought, "I''m trapped and about to be robbed!" Her<br /> heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore. </p>\n<p>Then...one of the men said, "Hit the floor." Instinct told her:<br /> Do what they tell you. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as<br /> she threw out her arms and collapsed on the elevator carpet. A<br /> shower of coins rained down on her. "Take my money and spare<br /> me", she prayed. </p>\n<p>More seconds passed. She heard one of the men say politely,<br /> "Ma''am, if you''ll just tell us what floor you''re going to, we''ll<br /> push the button." The one who said it had a little trouble<br /> getting the words out. He was trying mightily to hold in a belly<br /> laugh. She lifted her head and looked up at the two men. They<br /> reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her<br /> feet. </p>\n<p>"When I told my man here to hit the floor," said the average<br /> sized one, "I meant that he should hit the elevator button for<br /> our floor. I didn''t mean for you to hit the floor, ma''am." He<br /> spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious he was having a<br /> hard time not laughing. </p>\n<p>She thought: "My God, what a spectacle I''ve made of myself." She<br /> was too humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology,<br /> but words failed her. How do you apologize to two perfectly<br /> respectable gentlemen for behaving as though they were going to<br /> rob you? She didn''t know what to say. </p>\n<p>The 3 of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her<br /> bucket. When the elevator arrived at her floor they insisted on<br /> walking her to her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her<br /> feet, and they were afraid she might not make it down the<br /> corridor. At her door they bid her a good evening. </p>\n<p>As she slipped into her room she could hear them roaring with<br /> laughter while they walked back to the elevator. The woman<br /> brushed herself off. She pulled herself together and went<br /> downstairs for dinner with her husband. </p>\n<p>The next morning flowers were delivered to her room--a dozen<br /> roses. Attached to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar<br /> bill. The card said: "Thanks for the best laugh we''ve had in<br /> years." It was signed, Eddie Murphy &amp; Michael Jordan]

[I was on my way to the post office to pick up my case of free M&amp;M''s (sent to me because I forwarded an e-mail to five other people, celebrating the fact that the year 2000 is "MM" in Roman numerals), when I ran into a friend whose neighbor, a young man, was home recovering from having been served a rat in his bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken (which is predictable, since as everyone knows, there''s no actual chicken in Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is why the government made them change their name to KFC).</p>\n<p>Anyway, one day this guy went to sleep and when he awoke he was in his bathtub and it was full of ice and he was sore all over and when he got out of the tub he realized that HIS KIDNEY HAD BEEN STOLEN. He saw a note on his mirror that said "Call 911!" but he was afraid to use his phone because it was connected to his computer, and there was a virus on his computer that would destroy his hard drive if he opened an email entitled "Join the crew!" He knew it wasn''t a hoax because he himself was a computer programmer who was working on software to prevent a global disaster in which all the computers get together and distribute the $250.00 Neiman-Marcus cookie recipe under the leadership of Bill Gates. (It''s true - I read it all last week in a mass e-mail from BILL GATES HIMSELF, who was also promising me a free Disney World vacation and $5,000 if I would forward the e-mail to everyone I know.)</p>\n<p>The poor man then tried to call 911 from a pay phone to report his missing kidneys, but a voice on the line first asked him to press #90, which unwittingly gave the bandit full access to the phone line at the guy''s expense.</p>\n<p>Then reaching into the coin-return slot he got jabbed with an HIV-infected needle around which was wrapped a note that said, "Welcome to the world of AIDS." Luckily he was only a few blocks from the hospital - the one where that little boy who is dying of cancer is, the one whose last wish is for everyone in the world to send him an e-mail and the American Cancer Society has agreed to pay him a nickel for every e-mail he receives.</p>\n<p>I sent him two e-mails and one of them was a bunch of x''s and o''s in the shape of an angel (if you get it and forward it to more than 10 people, you will have good luck but for 10 people only you will only have OK luck and if you send it to fewer than10 people you will have BAD LUCK FOR SEVEN YEARS).</p>\n<p>So anyway the poor guy tried to drive himself to the hospital, but on the way he noticed another car driving without its lights on. To be helpful, he flashed his lights at him and was promptly shot as part of a gang initiation.</p>\n<p>Send THIS to all the friends who send you their junk mail and you will receive 4 green M&amp;Ms -- if you don''t, the owner of Proctor and Gamble will report you to his Satanist friends and you will have more bad luck: you will get sick from the Sodium Laureth Sulfate in your shampoo, your spouse/mate will develop a skin rash from using the antiperspirant which clogs the pores under your arms, and the U.S. government will put a tax on your e-mails forever.</p>\n<p>I know this is all true because I read it on the Internet! </p>\n<p>Submitted by Curtis<br /> Edited by Calamjo]

[The cost for all the presents in ''''The Twelve Days of Christmas'''' has taken an unprecedented swan dive this year. A 50 percent fall in the price tag for seven swans a swimming'''' helped cut this year''s bill for the items in the famous Christmas carol by $3,462.55 from 1996, PNC Bank calculated in an index released Monday. </p>\n<p>The total cost for giving one''s true love everything from 12 drummers drumming to a partridge in a pear tree this year is $12,481.65, down 21.7 percent from $15,964.20 in 1996 and the lowest level since 1986. This is the first time since researchers at PNC Bank began compiling the annual index in 1984 that the price of Christmas has fallen significantly, although it took a 0.6 percent dip in 1988. The decline reflects inflation trends in the economy at large, as well as progress in reviving the trumpeter swan population. The price for the swans dropped due to a fluctuation of supply and demand,'''' PNC said. </p>\n<p>The general flatness in the cost of most of the items in the song reflect the low inflation rate.'''' The price for seven swimming trumpeter swans, as quoted by the Philadelphia Zoo, dropped from $7,000 last year to $3,500. The North American population of the swans has risen from 73 in 1935 to more than 14,000 now, driving down the price and bringing the government close to removing the birds from the endangered species list, PNC said. </p>\n<p>In general, prices for consumer goods such as five gold rings were steady or lower. But services such as leaping lords were steady or higher. The price of five gold rings fell to $325 from $450 last year, while the price of a pear tree fell to $12.50 from $19.99, because the nursery PNC uses was having a sale. </p>\n<p>The cost of eight minimum-wage milkmaids was unchanged at $34 for one hour''s service, while unionized pipers piping and drummers drumming commanded the same fees as the year before, for the first time. Those fees were $1,109.16 for the 11 pipers and $1,201.59 for the 12 drummers. But the bill for 10 lords a leaping climbed 5.6 percent, to $3,182.57, the only increase on the list.]

Do you have any idea what it feels like to have nylon and velcro crawling up your butt?</p>\n<p>2. Real underwear that can be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What bonehead at Mattel decided to cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my skin?!? It looks like cellulite!</p>\n<p>3. A REAL man...maybe GI Joe. Hell, I''d take Tickle-Me Elmo over that wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend, Ken. And what''s with that earring anyway? If I''m gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him (and me) anatomically correct.</p>\n<p>4. Arms that actually bend so I can push the aforementioned Ken-wimp away once he is anatomically correct.</p>\n<p>5. Breast reduction surgery. I don''t care whose arm you have to twist, just get it done.</p>\n<p>6. A sports bra. To wear until I get the surgery.</p>\n<p>7. A new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don''t cut it. How about a systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account exec!</p>\n<p>8. A new, more 90s persona. Maybe "PMS Barbie", complete with a miniature container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips; "Animal Rights Barbie", with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake fur coat and handcuffs; or "Stop Smoking Barbie", sporting a removable Nicotrol patch and equipped with several packs of gum.</p>\n<p>9.

Suddenly some armed robbers leaped out of the bushes and stopped the car.''Give us the money'' they shouted at the Queen.''But I''m the Queen of England, I have no need for money, thus I never carry any.''''Oh, blimey'', said the leader of the armed band, and turned to Lady Di.''Give us yer jewels.''''But I don''t wear my jewels all the time, only on state occasions.''The armed robbers looked fed up when suddenly they heard the sound of wailing sirens approaching.  ''Quick, out of the car.  We''ll have the Range Rover at least'', and with that the robbers drove off.As the Queen and Di are waiting for the police to get there, Di turns to the Queen, and asks: ''So, what did you do to all the cash you had?  You''re always loaded.''''Ah,'' said the Queen, ''I saw the robbers and in the few seconds before they got to the car I rolled up my notes and tucked them into that little place that women have.  Reaching under her skirt, she produced several thousand pounds in notes.''And what did you do with your jewels?  You always wear lots of jewelery, my dear'' the Queen says to Di.''Well, like you, in those few seconds before the robbers got to the car, I slipped off my rings, necklaces and tiara, and like you, slipped them into that little place that only women have.'' Reaching down, she plucks out her jewelery.They both smile, knowingly at each other.  After sitting quietly for a few moments, the Queen turned to Di, and with all the grace and dignity one should expect of the Queen of the British Empire, said: says ''You know, if Fergie had been with us, we would still have that Range Rover.'']
[Dear Tech Support, </p>\n<p>Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a slow down in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 un-installed many other valuable programs such as Romance 9.9, but installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 crashes the system. I''ve tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? </p>\n<p>Desperate </p>\n<p>--- </p>\n<p>Dear Desperate, </p>\n<p>First, keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try to enter the command C:/I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and install Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create SnoringLoudly.WAV files. DO NOT install Mother-In-Law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. </p>\n<p>In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9. </p>\n<p>Good luck, </p>\n<p>Tech Support]

[After a very successful career, a former Human Relations guru found herself at the pearly gates. </p>\n<p>"Welcome to Heaven," said St.Peter. "Before you get settled in though, it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we''ve never once had a Human Resources Director make it this far, and we''re not really sure what to do with you, so what we''re going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in." </p>\n<p>With that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and went down to hell. The doors opened, and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with - and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up, kissed her and talked about old times. </p>\n<p>They played an excellent round of golf, and at night went to the country club, where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil, who was </p>\n<p>actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and </p>\n<p>waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. </p>\n<p>The elevator went up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates, and she found St. Peter waiting for her. "Now it''s time to spend a day in heaven," he said. So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a </p>\n<p>great time, and before she knew it, her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her and asked her to choose. </p>\n<p>The woman paused for a second and then replied, "Well, I never thought I''d say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell." So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went down-down-down back to Hell. </p>\n<p>When the doors of the elevator opened, she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She </p>\n<p>saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her. </p>\n<p>"I don''t understand," stammered the woman, "yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate </p>\n<p>lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now, all there is is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable." </p>\n<p>The Devil looked at her and smiled. "Yesterday, we were recruiting you, today you''re staff."]

''''I drive a truck, and the smell is just from the computers I''m hauling.''''  ''''Okay, truck drivers are not nerds,'''' he says and serves him a beer. As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in with tape around his glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver is totally shocked. ''''Why did you do that?''''  ''''Not to worry, the nerds are overpopulating Silicon Valley and are in season now. You don''t even need a license.''''

He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, grabbing up the computers.They are all engineers, accountants, and programmers wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen. He can''t let them steal his whole load. So, remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, felling several of them instantly.

[One day, a man had an accident at work, which resulted in him getting his eye gouged out. He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency operation, was told by the doctor that he''d been given a glass eye. The man looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his original eye colour was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged. ''''I can''t walk around like this!!""Sir," the doctor said, "there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.''''  A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the road before finally hitting a tree.  The man screeched to a halt, and ran down the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye!  As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, noone was about. So the man proceeded to get a screwdriver  and removed one of the deceased man''s blue eyes, replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to have the replacement blue eye fitted.  A few days later, the man was driving along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads.  ''''Excuse me, sir," said the policeman."Do you know anything about this at all?''''''''No, constable'''', said the man.''''Well, we can''t figure this out.

By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I''m getting used to it now. Gotta go, it''s time for the flowchart class. Love, Billy. </p>\n<p>P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It''s spell checked too. </p>\n<p>Letter # 3 ------------- Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>Don''t worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I don''t have much of a tan cause we don''t go outside very often. You can''t see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I''m okay, really. </p>\n<p>Love, Billy. </p>\n<p>Letter # 4 ------------- Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>I''m fine. I''m sleeping enough. I''m eating enough. This is the best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Can you send more money? I''ve got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad. </p>\n<p>Love, Billy. </p>\n<p>Letter # 5 ------------- Dear Mother, </p>\n<p>Forget the money for the telephone. We''ve got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven''t written. I''ve been learning a lot. I''m real good at getting onto any computer in the country. It''s really easy! I got into the university''s in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five, he''s going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He''s really smart. He says that I shouldn''t call myself Billy anymore. So, I''m not. </p>\n<p>Signed, William. </p>\n<p>Letter # 6 ------------- Dear Mother, </p>\n<p>How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why''d you get so upset? I haven''t gained that much weight. The glasses aren''t real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you''d be proud of my program. After all, I''ve made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I''ve paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won''t be home until late August. </p>\n<p>Regards, William. </p>\n<p>Letter # 7 ------------- Mother, </p>\n<p>Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.? I won''t write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me. </p>\n<p>Sincerely, William. </p>\n<p>What can I do, Mr. Johnson? See what I mean? It''s been two weeks since I''ve heard from my little boy. I know that it''s probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so. Thank you very much. </p>\n<p>Sally Gates, Concerned Parent]

[The setting is Disneyland, "The Happiest Place on Earth," where I had joined a couple of friends for a day of fun and adventure. After paying something approaching $30 each to get in, we wanted to conserve what little was left of our cash for important things like rubber lizards and the air hockey tables, so when it came time to eat we opted for a quick-n-cheap lunch rather than fine dining in one of their numerous restaurants. </p>\n<p>Lunch consisted of one of those burritos in a plastic bag, and a can of cola. I could go into great detail here, but why bother. You know precisely what I''m getting at here: INTESTINAL GAS! </p>\n<p>Funny thing is, lunch didn''t seem to give me any problem. I don''t think I flatulated once the whole afternoon. More junk food was consumed. Many violent games of air hockey were played. Little did I know what my bowels had in store. </p>\n<p>So late in the afternoon we step in line for the Jungle Cruise ride (you''ll also find rubber lizards for sale in this area). The lines at Disneyland are densely packed in a serpentine configuration such that it''s pretty much impossible to bail out from the middle. As I shuffle around a bend deep into the line, I notice there''s a little girl right behind me who it would seem has been genetically engineered to be just the height that would place her nose precisely in line for problems. </p>\n<p>"Wouldn''t it be funny," I think to myself, "if I had to flatulate right now?" </p>\n<p>We continue shuffling through the densely-packed line, and just as we come to the exact center of the line, with the small, innocent child mere inches away and at least 20 feet of human bodies in all directions and nowhere to run, I did just that. I passed gas. </p>\n<p>However, this was no ordinary flatus. Nothing like this has crept from my bowels before or since. This was ... The Doomsday Fart! You know the expression, "silent but deadly"? You couldn''t have heard this one with a stethoscope, but Landsat 4 probably picked it up in the thermal band. It was simply unholy. A fart that could melt diamond. The oil fires of Kuwait couldn''t hold a candle to this thing. Chernobyl? Child''s play! Weather patters were disrupted. LAX was "fogged in." The world knew a new evil on this day. A voluminous, hot, humid, painfully burning fart that makes the greenhose effect look like a pleasant alternative. It probably knocked down a couple local trailer parks just for good measure. </p>\n<p>I farted only once on this day, but it was more than most people will manage in a lifetime. The line started moving. I did not look back, for fear that I might see a live action replay of the scene in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" where people were melting and shriveling up (or would it be more like the ash bodies in Terminator 2?). We go around one of the bends in the line, headed back toward The Mushroom Cloud. </p>\n<p>My friends both choke, look back at me, and give the best glabe they can manage with their eyes watering like that. I''ve just got this big grin on my face. They do not need to ask where "It" came from (brave souls, these folks - they still joined me on the submarine ride later). Rounding the corner myself, I get a glimpse of what''s left of the small child behind me. </p>\n<p>Her face is scrunched in pain, her hands violently waving the air in front of her. I don''t think she needs to ask either. Except for the complete depilatation, it''s nothing a good plastic surgeon can''t fix. </p>\n<p>That evening, we ate dinner in a restaurant.]
[One day, a man had an accident at work, which resulted in him getting his eye gouged out. He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency operation, was told by the doctor that he''d been given a glass eye. The man looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his original eye colour was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged. ''''I can''t walk around like this!!""Sir," the doctor said, "there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.'''' A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the road before finally hitting a tree. The man screeched to a halt, and ran down the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye! As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, no one was about. So the man proceeded to get a screwdriver and removed one of the deceased man''s blue eyes, replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to have the replacement blue eye fitted. A few days later, the man was driving along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads. ''''Excuse me, sir," said the policeman."Do you know anything about this at all?''''''''No, constable'''', said the man.''''Well, we can''t figure this out. Somehow, this bloke managed to drive 40 miles with two glass eyes!'''']

[The Reverend John Fuzz was pastor of a small congregation in a little Pennsylvania town. One day, he was walking down Main Street and he happened to notice a female member of his congregation sitting in the town bar, drinking beer. The reverend thought this was sinful and not something a member of his congregation should do. He walked through the open door of the bar and sat down next to the woman.    "Mrs. Fitzgerald," the reverend said sternly."This is no place for a member of my congregation. Why don''t you let me take you home?"    "Sure," she said with a slur, obviously very drunk. When Mrs. Fitzgerald stood up from the bar, she began to weave back and forth. The reverend realized that she had had too much to drink and he grabbed hold of her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance and tumbled to the floor. After rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lying on top of Mrs. Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist.    The bartender looked over the bar and said, "Here, here, buddy, we won''t have any of that carrying on in this bar."    The reverend looked up at the bartender and said, "But you don''t understand, I''m Pastor Fuzz."    The bartender nodded, "Well if you''re that far into the game, you may as well finish!"]

[Teenager (noun)<br /> 1) A mammal found extensively throughout the planet, often clustered in groups<br /> in front of television sets. Thought to be a member of Homo sapiens due to<br /> physical similarities, though social and emotional behavior leads many<br /> researchers to consider Teenagers to be a completely different species<br /> altogether. Very territorial.<br /> Teenagers are extraordinarily social animals, seeking contact with their peer<br /> groups to such a great extent they will forgo family, chores, food, and<br /> responsibility. The males of the species forage for food constantly and can<br /> consume three times their weight every day. When in full plumage, the males are<br /> usually drab, marked by loose fitting garments which slide off their backsides<br /> and look ridiculous.<br /> The females, on the other hand, sport striking colors under their eyes,<br /> throughout their hair, and on the tips of their fingers. Females often attract<br /> males by wearing garments to accentuate chest development. Males indicate their<br /> approval by staring at the display. The call of the female is complex and<br /> shrill: "Like, O m''Gosh! O m'' Gosh!" Males are less vocal, signaling to other<br /> males with a salutatory "Yo. Yo. Yo. S''up? S''up? S''up?"<br /> Teenagers line their nests with discarded undergarments. The females hold<br /> telephone receivers to their ears an average of six hours a day. When challenged<br /> for possession, they snarl and warn intruders, "I''m doing my HOMEWORK. My<br /> HOMEWORK. My HOMEWORK." The males lie immobile for hours at a time, conserving<br /> energy and listening to violent electronic signals from radios. Male Teenagers<br /> concentrate on important information by rolling their eyes, shrugging, kicking<br /> dirt and sighing. Females burst into tears and slam doors. Many Homo sapiens<br /> families have a host-to-parasite relationship with one or more than one<br /> Teenager. These host families often develop a resistance to the parasite,<br /> rejecting them some time in the eighteenth year of life. Often, though, this<br /> rejection is merely theoretical, with the Teenager continuing to live off of the<br /> host Homo sapiens family for many years afterward, often at great sacrifice.</p>\n<p>2) Of, relating to, and especially EXPLAINING irrational, intolerable, or<br /> inexplicable behavior. ("She''s a Teenager.")<br /> 3) A request for sympathy, offered by adult parents to each other in support.<br /> ("I have a Teenager at home.") Often accompanied by sighs, head shaking, tongue<br /> clucking, and shoulder shrugging.]

[A man had recently gone through a messy divorce to his wife of 10 years.  Part of the settlement was that for every dollar he made, she would get 2/3 of it.  If he made $300, she would get $200 and he would get $100.  So, she would always get twice as much as he did.One day on a jog, he found a corked bottle lying on the ground, and of course, when he rubbed on it to try to clean it off, a genie came out.''You know the drill,'' said the genie.

[Election update from http://www.aaronsjokes.com/</p>\n<p>NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE</p>\n<p>To the citizens of the United States of America,</p>\n<p>In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your<br /> independence, effective today.</p>\n<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other  territories.  Except Utah, which she does not fancy. </p>\n<p>Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85%<br /> of you who have until now been unaware that there is a  world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections.</p>\n<p>Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be<br /> circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.</p>\n<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:</p>\n<p>1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up "aluminum". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look "vocabulary".  Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed".</p>\n<p>2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.</p>\n<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.<br /> It really isn''t that hard.</p>\n<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.</p>\n<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.</p>\n<p>6. You should stop playing American "football". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays "American" football.

So he goes to his doctor and asks him what is wrong with him.  The doctor told him that he has a rare disease that will require him to take this medication for several months to clear up the disease, however the medication will make his hair fall out permanently.

[1. What are you thinking about?<br /> 2. Do you love me?<br /> 3. Do I look fat in this?<br /> 4. Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5. What would you do if I died? </p>\n<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one<br /> is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man<br /> answers incorrectly (i.e., tells the truth). Therefore, as<br /> a public service, each question is analyzed below, along<br /> with possible responses. </p>\n<p>Question # 1: What are you thinking about? The proper<br /> answer to this, of course, is: " I''m sorry if I''ve been<br /> pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm,<br /> wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are,<br /> and how lucky I am to have met you." This response<br /> obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which<br /> most likely is one of the following: a. Football. b. Golf.<br /> c. How fat you are. d. How much prettier she is than you e.<br /> How I would spend the insurance money if you died.<br /> Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by<br /> Al Bundy, who once told Peg, "If I wanted you to know what<br /> I was thinking, I would be talking to you!" </p>\n<p>Question # 2: Do you love me? The proper response<br /> is: "YES!" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in<br /> order, "Yes, dear."<br /> Inappropriate responses include: a. Oh Yeah, sh@*-loads. b.<br /> Would it make you feel better if I said yes? c. That<br /> depends on what you mean by love. d. Does it matter? e.<br /> Who, me? </p>\n<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat? The correct answer is an<br /> emphatic: "Of course not!"<br /> Incorrect answers are: a. Compared to what? b. I wouldn''t<br /> call you fat, but you''re not exactly thin. c. A little<br /> extra weight looks good on you. d. I''ve seen fatter. e.<br /> Sorry what did you say? I was just thinking about how I<br /> would spend the insurance money if you died. </p>\n<p>Question # 4: Do you think she''s prettier than me? Once<br /> again, the proper response is an emphatic: "Of course not!"<br /> Incorrect responses include: a. Yes, but you have a better<br /> personality b. Not prettier, but definitely thinner c. Not<br /> as pretty as you when you were her age d. Define pretty e.<br /> Sorry what did you say ? I was just thinking about how I<br /> would spend the insurance money if you died. </p>\n<p>Question # 5: What would you do if I died? A definite no-<br /> win question.(The real answer, of course, is "Buy a Lotus<br /> and a Boat").<br /> No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an<br /> hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:<br /> WOMAN: Would you get married again? MAN: Definitely not!<br /> WOMAN: Why not - don''t you like being married? MAN: Of<br /> course I do. WOMAN: Then why wouldn''t you remarry? MAN:<br /> Okay, I''d get married again. WOMAN: You would? (with a<br /> hurtful look on her face) MAN: (makes audible groan) WOMAN:<br /> Would you sleep with her in our bed? MAN: Where else would<br /> we sleep? WOMAN: Would you put away my pictures, and<br /> replace them with pictures of her? MAN: That would seem<br /> like the proper thing to do. WOMAN: And would you let her<br /> use my golf clubs? MAN: She can''t use them; she''s left-<br /> handed. WOMAN: - - - silence - - .]

They used to<br /> live here in a big brick home, but Grandpa got retarded and they moved to<br /> Florida. Now they live in a place with a lot of other retarded people. They all<br /> live in little tin boxes. They ride on big three-wheeled tricycles and they all<br /> wear nametags because they don''t know whom they are.

They agreed that it was.</p>\n<p>So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar.  He shook the jar lightly.  The pebbles rolled into the open areas between golf balls.</p>\n<p>He then asked the students again if the jar was full.  They agreed it was.</p>\n<p>The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else.</p>\n<p>He asked once more if the jar was full.  The students responded with a unanimous "yes."</p>\n<p>The professor then produced two cans of beer from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand.  The students laughed.</p>\n<p>"Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.  The golf balls are the important things--your family, your children, your health, your friends, your favorite passions--things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.</p>\n<p>"The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car.</p>\n<p>The sand is everything else--the small stuff.</p>\n<p>"If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.  The same goes for life.  If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.  Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.  Play with your children.  Take time to get medical checkups.  Take your partner out to dinner.  Play another 18.  There will always be time to clean the house, and fix the disposal.</p>\n<p>"Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your  priorities.  The rest is just sand."</p>\n<p>One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the beer represented.</p>\n<p>The professor smiled.  "I''m glad you asked.  It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there''s always room for a couple of beers."]

[The following appeared in a computer magazine in Mr. Dvorak''s<br /> column: </p>\n<p>Dear Mr. Dvorak: </p>\n<p>Ann Landers wouldn''t print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I<br /> have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling<br /> on. Let me try and explain. It''s about my son, Billy. He''s<br /> always been a good, normal ten year old boy. Well, last spring<br /> we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy. We<br /> sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps<br /> with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire--you<br /> know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight<br /> reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in<br /> Tibetan knot tying. </p>\n<p>I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It''s where he went<br /> last year. (He made an adorable picture out of painted pinto<br /> beans and macaroni). Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a<br /> brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We<br /> should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known.<br /> He left three weeks ago. I don''t know what''s happened. He''s<br /> changed. I can''t explain it. See for yourself. These are some of<br /> my little Billy''s letters. </p>\n<p>**********<br /> Dear Mom,<br /> The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the<br /> only good part. We''re learning how to program. Late at night is<br /> the best time to program, so they let us stay up.<br /> Love, Billy.</p>\n<p>**********<br /> Dear Mom,<br /> Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night.<br /> We all get to choose what we want to drink. I drink Classic<br /> Coke. By the way, can you make Szechuan food? I''m getting used<br /> to it now. Gotta go, it''s time for the flowchart class.<br /> Love, Billy.<br /> P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh?<br /> It''s spell checked too.</p>\n<p>**********<br /> Dear Mom,<br /> Don''t worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by<br /> the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I<br /> don''t have much of a tan ''cause we don''t go outside very often.<br /> You can''t see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That<br /> wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off,<br /> Mom. I''m okay, really.<br /> Love, Billy.</p>\n<p>**********<br /> Dear Mom,<br /> I''m fine. I''m sleeping enough. I''m eating enough. This is the<br /> best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm<br /> code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Frederick says<br /> it''s okay. Can you send more money? I spent mine on a pocket<br /> protector and a box of blank diskettes. I''ve got to chip in on<br /> the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a<br /> computer? Give my regards to Dad.<br /> Love, Billy.</p>\n<p>**********<br /> Dear Mother,<br /> Forget the money for the telephone. We''ve got a way to not pay.<br /> Sorry I haven''t written. I''ve been learning a lot. I''m real good<br /> at getting onto any computer in the country. It''s really easy! I<br /> got into the university''s in less than fifteen minutes.<br /> Frederick did it in five, he''s going to show me how. Frederick<br /> is my bunk partner. He''s really smart. He says that I shouldn''t<br /> call myself Billy anymore. So, I''m not.<br /> Signed, William.</p>\n<p>**********<br /> Dear Mother,<br /> How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why''d you get so<br /> upset? I haven''t gained that much weight. The glasses aren''t<br /> real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me,<br /> the tape on them is cool. I thought that you''d be proud of my<br /> program. After all, I''ve made some money on it. A publisher is<br /> sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I''ve paid for the next six<br /> weeks of camp. I won''t be home until late August.<br /> Regards, William.</p>\n<p>**********<br /> Mother,<br /> Stop treating me like a child. True--physically I am only ten<br /> years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try<br /> again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the<br /> bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not<br /> kidding. O.K.? I won''t write again and this is your only<br /> warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain<br /> me.<br /> Sincerely, William.</p>\n<p>**********</p>\n<p>See what I mean? It''s been two weeks since I''ve heard from my<br /> little boy. What can I do, Mr. Dvorak? I know that it''s probably<br /> too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these<br /> letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming,<br /> please, I beg of you to do so. Thank you very much. </p>\n<p>Sally Gates,</p>\n<p>Concerned Parent]

[The newly born sperm was receiving instructions in conception from the instructor:"As soon as you hear the siren, run for the tunnel and swim in a straight line until you get to the entrance of a damp cavern. At the end of the cavern you will find a red, sticky ball which is the egg. Address it and say, "I''m a Sperm." She will answer, "I''m the Egg." From that moment on you will work together to create the embryo. Do you understand?"The sperm nodded affirmatively and the instructor said, "Then, good luck!"Two days later, the sperm is taking a nap when he hears the siren. He wakes up immediately and runs to the tunnel. A multitude of sperm swim behind him. He knows he has to arrive first. When he nears the entrance to the cavern, he looks back and sees that he is far ahead of the other sperm. He is able to swim at a slower pace but does approach the red, sticky ball.When, at last, he reaches the red, sticky ball, he smiles and says, "Hi, I''m a sperm."The red sticky ball smiles and says, "Hi.

[The other day I went to the local religious book store where I saw a "HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on my back bumper and I''m glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed. That bumper sticker really worked!!I found lots of people who loved Jesus. I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love Jesus because pretty soon he leaned out of his window and yelled "JESUS CHRIST!" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, "GO!...JESUS CHRIST!...GO!" Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out the window and smiled and waved to all those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I heard him yell something about a sunny beach and saw him waving with only his middle finger. I asked my kids what he meant by that and they laughed and said it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So I leaned out of the window and gave him the good luck sign back. A couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started running towards me! I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed so I stepped on the gas. It''s a good thing that I did because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back and everyone was still standing there so I leaned way out the window and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful people!]

When she insisted on knowing why he exhibited such offensive behaviour, Little Harley said, "I do it because I can do it better than anybody, and I''m very proud of that fact." The teacher says, "If I show you I can do it better than you, will you stop?"

[1. Atlanta is comprised entirely of one way streets. The only way to get out of downtown Atlanta is to turn around and start over when you reach Greenville, South Carolina. </p>\n<p>2. All directions start with, "Go down Peachtree..." </p>\n<p>3. Peachtree Street has no beginning and no end. </p>\n<p>4. Atlanta is home of Coca Cola. That''s all we drink here, so don''t ask for any other soft drink. </p>\n<p>5. Atlantans only know their way home and their way to work. </p>\n<p>6. Gate One at the Airport is 32 miles away from the Main Concourse. </p>\n<p>7. It''s impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street you started on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a "scenic drive". </p>\n<p>8. The 8 a.m. rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30 a.m. The 5:00 p.m. rush hour is from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. Friday''s rush hour starts Thursday morning. </p>\n<p>9. Reversible Lanes are not understood by anybody. </p>\n<p>10. "Sir" and "Ma''am" are used by the person speaking to you if there''s a remote possibility that you''re at least 30 minutes older than they are. </p>\n<p>11. "Sugar" is a more common form of address than "Miss". So is "Honey". </p>\n<p>12. Ponce de Leon Avenue can only be pronounced by a native, so do not attempt the Spanish pronunciation. People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you. </p>\n<p>13. The falling of one rain drop causes all traffic to immediately cease; so will daylight savings time and a girl applying eye shadow across the street, or a flat tire three lanes over. </p>\n<p>14. If you''re standing on a corner and a MARTA Bus stops, you''re expected to get on and go somewhere. </p>\n<p>15. Atlanta is pronounced "Lan-uh". </p>\n<p>16. Construction on Peachtree Street is a way of life, and a permanent form of entertainment. </p>\n<p>17. Construction crews aren''t doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour. (Ed. note: This appears to be a common theme in almost any major American city). </p>\n<p>18. Atlanta''s traffic is the friendliest around. The commuters spend hours mingling with each other twice a day. In fact, Atlanta''s traffic is rated number 1 in the country. You will often see people parked beside the road and engaged in lively discussions. </p>\n<p>19. Atlantans are very proud of their race track, known as Road Atlanta. It winds throughout the city on the Interstates, hence its name. </p>\n<p>20. Georgia 400 is the southern equivalent of the AutoBahn. You will rarely see a semi-truck on GA400, because the truck drivers are intimidated by the oversized-SUV-wielding housewives racing home after a grueling day at the salon or the tennis match to meet their children at the school bus.]

[One day this fellow noticed that a new couple had moved into the house next door. He was also quick to notice that the woman liked to sunbathe in the backyard, usually in a skimpy bikini that showed off a magnificent pair of breasts. He made it a point to water and trim his lawn as much as possible, hoping for yet another look. </p>\n<p>Finally, he could stand it no more. Walking to the front door of the new neighbour''s house, he knocked and waited. The husband, a large, burly man, opened the door. "Excuse me," the man stammered, "But I couldn''t help noticing how beautiful your wife is." </p>\n<p>"Yeah? So?" his hulking neighbour replied. </p>\n<p>"Well, in particular, I am really struck by how beautiful her breasts are. I would gladly pay you ten thousand dollars if I could kiss those breasts." </p>\n<p>The burly gorilla is about to deck our poor guy when his wife appears and stops him.

Our man takes one in each hand, and proceeds to rub his face against them in total ecstasy. This goes on for several minutes, until the husband gets annoyed. </p>\n<p>"Well, come on already, kiss ''em!" he growls. </p>\n<p>"I can''t," replies our awe-struck man, still nuzzling away. </p>\n<p>"Why not?" demands the husband, getting really angry now. </p>\n<p>"I don''t have ten thousand dollars."]

A cigarette<br />   lighter and a small tolerance for pain can accomplish the same<br />   goal and save hours. Note: It''s a good idea to keep a bucket of<br />   water handy when using this method.</p>\n<p>"East Texas Dating (outside the family)"</p>\n<p>- Always offer to bait your date''s hook, especially on the first<br />   date.<br /> - Be aggressive.

A leisure suit with a<br />   cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a natty<br />   appearance. Though uncomfortable, say yes to socks and shoes<br />   for this special occasion.</p>\n<p>"East Texas Etiquette for All Occasions"</p>\n<p>- Never take a beer to a job interview or ask if they press<br />   charges.<br /> - Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.<br /> - Always say "Excuse me" after getting sick in someone''s else''s<br />   car.<br /> - It''s considered tacky to take a cooler to church,<br /> - Even if you''re certain that you are included in the will, you<br />   should refrain from driving a U-Haul to the funeral home.<br /> - The socially refined never fish coins out of public toilets,<br />   especially if other people are around.<br /> - Always provide an alibi to the police for family members.]

The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts<br /> the offer. </p>\n<p>St. Peter shows him all the sights - the golf course, the reading room and<br /> library, the observation room, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a HUGE<br /> room full of clocks. The guy asks, "What''s up with these clocks?" </p>\n<p>St. Peter explains, "Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he<br /> has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to<br /> the Gates to be judged." The guy thinks this makes sense but notices that some<br /> of the clocks are going faster than others. He asks why is that? </p>\n<p>St. Peter explains, "Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds his<br /> clock." </p>\n<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before<br /> leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both<br /> hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, "What''s the story with<br /> that clock?" </p>\n<p>"Oh, that," St. Peter replies, "That''s President Clinton''s clock. We decided<br /> to use it as a fan."]
[A burglar broke into a house one night. He shone his torch around looking for valuables. When he picked up a CD player to place in his sack, a strange disembodied voice echoed from the dark, saying, ''Jesus is watching you.'' He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight off and froze.When he heard nothing more after a little while, he shook his head, promised himself a holiday after the next score, and then clicked his light back on and began searching for more valuables.Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell, he heard, ''Jesus is watching you.''Freaked out, he shone his light around frantically looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his torch came to rest on a parrot.''Did you say that?'' he hissed at the parrot.''Yep,'' the parrot confessed, and then squawked, ''I''m trying to warn you.''The burglar relaxed. ''Warn me, eh? Who are you?''''Moses,'' replied the parrot.`Moses?'' The burglar laughed. ''What kind of stupid people would name a parrot Moses?''The parrot replied, ''Probably the same kind of people that would name a Rottweiler Jesus.'']

[Let''s say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time.</p>\n<p>A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while, neither one of them is seeing anybody else.</p>\n<p>Then, one evening when they''re driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: "Do you realize that, as of tonight, we''ve been seeing each other for exactly six months?"</p>\n<p>And then there is silence in the car. . . To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: </p>\n<p>Jeez, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he''s been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I''m trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he want, or isn''t sure of.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>\n<p>Gosh. Six months.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: </p>\n<p>But, hey, I''m not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I''d have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward. I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even knog this person?</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>\n<p>So that means it was ...let''s see ...February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer''s, which means...lemme check the odometer. Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: </p>\n<p>He''s upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I''m reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed-even before I sensed it-that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that''s it. That''s why he''s so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He''s afraid of being rejected.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>\n<p>And I''m gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don''t care what those morons say, it''s still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It''s 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: </p>\n<p>He''s angry. And I don''t blame him. I''d be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can''t help the way I feel. I''m just not sure.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>\n<p>They''ll probably say it''s only a 90-day warranty. Scumbags!</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: </p>\n<p>Maybe I''m just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I''m sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, school girl romantic fantasy.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>\n<p>Warranty? They want a warranty? I''ll give them a warranty. I''ll take their warranty and stick it right up their...</p>\n<p>"Roger," Elaine says aloud.</p>\n<p>"What?" says Roger, startled.</p>\n<p>"Please don''t torture yourself like this," she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. "Maybe I should never have... Oh God, I feel so..." (She breaks down, sobbing.)</p>\n<p>"What?" says Roger.</p>\n<p>"I''m such a fool," Elaine sobs. "I mean, I know there''s no knight. I really know that. It''s silly. There''s no knight, and there''s no horse."</p>\n<p>"There''s no horse?" says Roger.</p>\n<p>"You think I''m a fool, don''t you?" Elaine says.</p>\n<p>"No!" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer.</p>\n<p>"It''s just that... it''s that I... I need some time," Elaine says.</p>\n<p>(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.) "Yes," he says.</p>\n<p>(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.) "Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?" she says.</p>\n<p>"What way?" says Roger.</p>\n<p>"That way about time," says Elaine.</p>\n<p>"Oh," says Roger. "Yes."</p>\n<p>(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)</p>\n<p>"Thank you, Roger," she says.</p>\n<p>"Thank you," says Roger.</p>\n<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn.</p>\n<p>Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it''s better if he doesn''t think about it.</p>\n<p>The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine''s, will pause just before serving, frown, and say, "Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?"</p>\n<p>And that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the difference between men and women!]

[Dear Dad &amp; Mom,Our scoutmaster told us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 Sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we we''re all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened.Oh yea! Please call Chad''s mother and tell her he is OK. He can''t write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search &amp; rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn''t been for the lightning. Scoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn''t hear him.Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn''t burn, but one of our tents did, also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back.We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn''t his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that''s probably why he can''t get insurance on it. We think it''s a neat car.He doesn''t care if we get it dirty, and if it''s hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us.Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don''t worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn''t any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks.This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Webb wouldn''t let me because I can''t swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood.Scoutmaster Webb isn''t crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn''t even get mad about us not wearing the life jackets.He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble.Guess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken, he said they got sick that way with the food they ate in prison. I''m so glad he got out and become our scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time.I have to go now.

[A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first of the twosome teed-off and watched in horror as the ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole. Indeed, the ball hit one of the men and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in agony.</p>\n<p>The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize.</p>\n<p>"Please allow me to help, I''m a physiotherapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you''d just allow me!", she told him earnestly.</p>\n<p>"Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I''ll be alright. I''ll be fine in a few minutes", he replied as he remained in the fetal position still clasping his hands together at his crotch.</p>\n<p>The woman takes it upon herself to begin to "ease his pain". She began<br /> to massage his groin.</p>\n<p>After a few moments she asked, "Does that feel better?"</p>\n<p>The man looked up at her and replied, "Yes, that feels pretty good... but my thumb still hurts like hell!"]
[Dear Mom and Dad:</p>\n<p>It has now been three months since I left for college.I have been remiss in<br /> writing this and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written<br /> before. I will bring you up to date now, but, before you read on,please sit<br /> down.<br /> YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN OKAY!<br /> Well then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the<br /> concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught<br /> fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I only get those sick<br /> headaches once a day.<br /> Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump were witnessed by an<br /> attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the<br /> fire department and the ambulance.<br /> He also visited me at the hospital and, since I had nowhere to live because of<br /> the burned out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment<br /> with him. It''s really a basement room, but it''s kind of cute. He is a very fine<br /> boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to be married.<br /> We haven''t set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy<br /> begins to show.<br /> Yes, Mom and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward to<br /> being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the love,<br /> devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.<br /> The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor<br /> infection which prevents us from passing our pre-marital blood tests, and I<br /> carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin<br /> injections I am having daily. I know you will welcome him into our family with<br /> open arms. He is kind and, although not well educated, he is ambitious.<br /> Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know your<br /> often expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that<br /> his skin colour is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I<br /> do. His family background is good too, for I am told that his father is an<br /> important gun-bearer in the village in Africa from which he came.</p>\n<p>Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no<br /> dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture. I was not in<br /> the hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged. I do not have syphilis and<br /> there is no man (of any colour) in my life. However, I am getting a ''D'' in<br /> History and an ''F'' in Science and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper<br /> perspective.</p>\n<p>Yours,<br /> Your Loving Daughter.]

[There was a man that owned a giant gorilla and, all its life, he''d never left it on its own. But eventually he had to go on a business trip and had to leave his gorilla in the care of his next-door neighbor. So he explained to his neighbor that all he had to do was feed his gorilla three bananas a day at three, six and nine o''clock.  But he was never ever, ever to touch its fur.  So the next day the man came and gave the gorilla a banana and looked at it for a while thinking, �酶惟Why can''t I touch its fur?�酶惟 as their didnt seem to be anything wrong with it.  Every day he came in and looked for a little while longer as he still couldnt understand until, about a week later, he''d worked himself into a frenzy and decided that he was going to touch the gorilla. He passed it the banana and very gently brushed the back of his hand against its fur.  Suddenly the gorilla went ape shit and started to jump around, then it turned and began to running towards the man who, in turn, ran through the front door, over the lawn, across the street, into some one else''s sports car and drove off. In the rear-veiw mirror, he could see the gorilla in its own sports car, driving right behing him. He drove for two hours until the engine began to splutter and the car just stopped. He jumped out and began to run down the street, over a brick wall, into someone''s front garden and up the apple tree.He turned around to find the gorilla right behind him beating its chest. The man jumped down and ran back in to the street screaming, until it became dark and he thought he''d lost the gorilla. The man ran into an alleyway then, suddenly, he saw a giant shaddow coming down the street ahead. The gorilla! It came to the end of the alley, stood and looked striaght into the bloodshoot eyes of the man and came towards him slowly. This time there was no escape. As the gorilla neared him, the man began to feel faint. The giant beast came face to face with him,  raised its mighty hand and said, �酶惟Tag! You''re it!�酶惟]

Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and<br /> HouseCleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system.<br /> I''ve tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no<br /> avail.<br /> --Desperate<br /> ***<br /> Dear Desperate,<br /> Keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while<br /> Husband 1.0is an operating system.<br /> Try to enter the command: C:/ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and install<br /> Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the<br /> applications: Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse<br /> can cause Husband 1.0 to default to GrumpySilence 2.5, Happyhour<br /> 7.0 or Beer 6.1.<br /> Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create "Snoring Loudly"<br /> wave files.

[DINING OUT</p>\n<p>1. When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup, and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine. </p>\n<p>2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your fingers covering the label. </p>\n<p>ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME </p>\n<p>1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist. </p>\n<p>2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table...no matter how good his manners are.</p>\n<p>PERSONAL HYGIENE</p>\n<p>1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one''s OWN truck keys. </p>\n<p>2. Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days. However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of good money. </p>\n<p>3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman''s jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods. </p>\n<p>DATING (Outside the Family) </p>\n<p>1. Always offer to bait your date''s hook, especially on the first date. </p>\n<p>2. Be aggressive. Let her know you''re interested: "I''ve been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago." </p>\n<p>3. Establish with her parents what time she is expected back. Some will say 10:00 PM; Others might say "Monday."

Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino''s team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino. Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running. First, he stomped two gazelles. He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way. It looked like he was home free. Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead. There were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened.

After years of this, the wife wants him to quit; she gets two shot glasses, filling one with water and the other with whiskey.After getting him to the table that had the glasses, she brings his bait box. She says "I want you to see this." She puts a worm in the water it, and it swims around.She puts a worm in the whiskey, and the worm dies immediately.

[THE FEMALE STRESS DIETThis is a specially formulated diet designed to help you cope with the stress that builds up during the day:Breakfast - I grapefruit, I slice whole-wheat toast, I cup of skim milk.Lunch - Small portion of lean, steamed chicken with a cup of spinach, 1 cup of herbal tea, I Tim Tam.Afternoon Tea - The rest of the packet of Tim Tams, I tub of Tip Top ice cream with chocolate topping, I jar of Nutella.Dinner - 4 bottles of red wine, 2 loaves of garlic bread, I family size supreme pizza, 3 Snickers bars.Late Night Snack - Whole frozen Sarah Lee cheesecake eaten directly from the freezer.Diet Rules1. If no one sees you eat something, it has no calories.2. When drinking a diet Coke with a chocolate bar, the fat in the chocolate is cancelled out by the diet Coke.3. When you eat with someone else, calories don''t count if you do not eat more than they do.4. Food used for medicinal purposes does NOT count. (For example: hot chocolate, toast, cheesecake, vodka...)5. If you fatten up the people around you, you will look thinner.6. Cinema-related foods have a zero calorie count as they are part of the entertainment package and not counted as food intake. This includes popcorn, Minties, Maltesers, Jaffas and frozen Cokes.7. Biscuit pieces have no calories because breaking the biscuits up causes calorie leakage.8. Food licked from knives and spoons has no fat if you are in the process of cooking something.9. Foods that are the same color have the same amount of fat. Examples are: spinach and peppermint ice cream, apples and red jelly snakes.10. Chocolate is like a food-color wildcard and may be substituted for any other color.11. Anything eaten while standing has no calories due to gravity and the density of the calorie mass.12. Food consumed from someone else''s plate has no fat as it rightfully belongs to the other person and will cling to his/her plate. (Oh, how fat likes to cling!)And remember: ''STRESSED'' SPELT BACKWARDS IS ''DESSERTS''!]

[STATE OF MICHIGANJOHN ENGLER, Governor Reply to:  GRAND RAPIDS DISTRICT OFFICE  STATE OFFICE BUILDING 6TH FLOOR 350 OTTAWA NW  GRAND RAPIDS MI 49503-2341DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITYRUSSELL J. HARDING, Director HOLLISTER BUILDING,  PO BOX 30473,  LANSING MI 48909-7973 http://www.deq.state.mi December 17, 1997   CERTIFIEDMr. Ryan DeVries 2088 Dagget Pierson, MI 49339Dear Mr. DeVries:SUBJECT: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023-1   T11N, R10W,  Sec.  20, Montcalm CountyIt has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of property.  You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor who did the following unauthorized activity: Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond.  A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  A review of the Department''s files show that no permits have been issued.Therefore, the Department has determined that this activity is in violation of Part 301,.  Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated.  The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially, failed during a recent rain event, causing debris dams and flooding at downstream locations.  We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted.  The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist all unauthorized activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the strewn channel. All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 1998. Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff.Failure to comply with this request, or any further unauthorized activity on the site, may result in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter.Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.Sincerely,David L. Price District Representative Land and Water Management Division        ----Reply Letter----Dear Mr. Price:Re: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023;  T11N, R10W, Sec 20; Montcalm CountyYour certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to.  You sent out a great deal of carbon copies to a lot of people, but you neglected to include their addresses.  You will, therefore, have to send them a copy of my response.First of all, Mr. Ryan DeVries is not the legal landowner and/or contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson, Michigan - I am the legal owner and a couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of constructing and maintaining two wood ''debris'' dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond.  While I did not pay for, nor authorize their dam project, I think they would be highly offended you call their skillful use of natural building materials ''debris.''  I would like to challenge you to attempt to emulate their dam project any dam time and/or any dam place you choose.  I believe I can safely state there is no dam way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.As to your dam request the beavers first must fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity, my first dam question to you is: are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers or do you require all dam beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam request?  If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, please send me completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam permits.  Perhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated.My first concern is - aren''t the dam beavers entitled to dam legal representation?The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said dam representation - so the State will have to provide them with a dam lawyer.  The Department''s dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing dam flooding is proof we should leave the dam Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling their dam names.  If you want the dam stream ''restored'' to a dam free-flow condition - contact the dam beavers - but if you are going to arrest them (they obviously did not pay any dam attention to your dam letter-being unable to read English) - be sure you read them their dam Miranda rights first.  As for me, I am not going to cause more dam flooding or dam debris jams by interfering with these dam builders.  If you want to hurt these dam beavers - be aware I am sending a copy of your dam letter and this response to PETA. If your dam Department seriously finds all dams of this nature inherently hazardous and truly will not permit their existence in this dam State - I seriously hope you are not selectively enforcing this dam policy - or once again both I and the Spring Pond Beavers will scream prejudice!In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their dam unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water flows downstream.  They have more dam right than I to live and enjoy Spring Pond.  So, as far as I and the beavers are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more dam elevated enforcement action now.  Why wait until 1/31/98?  The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then, and there will be no dam way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then.In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention a real environmental quality (health) problem; bears are actually defecating in our woods.  I definitely believe you should be persecuting the defecating bears and leave the dam beavers alone.  If you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step!  (The bears are not careful where they dump!)Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office. Sincerely,Stephen L. Tvedtenxc: PETA--]

[A married couple was in a terrible accident where the woman''s face was severely burned. The doctor told the husband that they couldn''t graft the skin from her body, so the husband offered to donate some of his own skin. However, the only skin on his body that the doctor found suitable would have to come from his rear end. The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter. After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman''s new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before! All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty! One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, "Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you." "My darling," he replied," think nothing of it.

St. Peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a HUGE room full of clocks. </p>\n<p>The guy asks, "What''s up with these clocks?" </p>\n<p>St. Peter explains, "Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged." </p>\n<p>The guy thinks this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks are going faster than others. He asks why is that? </p>\n<p>St. Peter explains, "Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds his clock." </p>\n<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling.

[The Reverend John Fuzz was pastor of a small congregation in a little<br /> Pennsylvania town. One day he was walking down Main Street and he happened to<br /> notice a female member of his congregation sitting in the town bar, drinking<br /> beer. The reverend thought this was sinful and not something a member of his<br /> congregation should do, so he walked through the open door of the bar and sat<br /> down next to the woman. "Mrs. Fitzgerald," the reverend said sternly. "This is<br /> no place for a member of my congregation. Why don''t you let me take you home?"<br /> "Sure," she said with a slur, obviously very drunk. When Mrs. Fitzgerald stood<br /> up from the bar, she began to weave back and forth. The reverend realized that<br /> she had had too much to drink and he grabbed hold of her arms to steady her.<br /> When he did, they both lost their balance and tumbled to the floor. After<br /> rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lying on top of Mrs.<br /> Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist. The bartender looked over the bar<br /> and said, "Here, here, buddy, we won''t have any of that carrying on in this<br /> bar."<br /> The reverend looked up at the bartender and said, "But you don''t<br /> understand, I''m Pastor Fuzz�酶惟.<br /> The bartender nodded.<br /> "Well if you''re that far you may as well finish."]

[1. Men like to barbecue. Men will cook if danger is involved. </p>\n<p>2. Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage. They''ve experienced pain and bought jewelry. </p>\n<p>3. Marrying a divorced man is ecologically responsible. In a world where there are more women than men, it pays to recycle. </p>\n<p>4. Men are very confident people. My husband is so confident that when he watches sports on television, he thinks that if he concentrates he can help his team. If the team is in trouble, he coaches the players from our living room, and if they''re really in trouble, I have to get off the phone in case they call him. </p>\n<p>5. Men like phones with lots of buttons. It makes them feel important. </p>\n<p>6. Men love to be the first to read the newspaper in the morning. Not being the first is upsetting to their psyches. </p>\n<p>7. All men are afraid of eyelash curlers. I sleep with one under my pillow, instead of a gun. </p>\n<p>8. A good place to meet a man is at the dry cleaner. These men usually have jobs and bathe. </p>\n<p>9. All men hate to hear, "We need to talk about our relationship." These seven words strike fear in the heart of even General Schwarzkopf. </p>\n<p>10. Men are sensitive in strange ways. If a man has built a fire and the last log does not burn, he will take it personally. </p>\n<p>11. Men have an easier time buying bathing suits. Women have two types: depressing and more depressing. Men have two types: nerdy and not nerdy. </p>\n<p>12. Men have higher body temperatures than women. If your heating goes out in winter, I recommend sleeping next to a man. Men are like portable heaters that snore. </p>\n<p>13. Women take clothing much more seriously than men. I''ve never seen a man walk into a party and say "Oh, my God, I''m so embarrassed; get me out of here. There''s another man wearing a black tuxedo." </p>\n<p>14. Most men hate to shop. That''s why the men''s department is usually on the first floor of a department store, two inches from the door. </p>\n<p>15. If a man prepares dinner for you and the salad contains three or more types of lettuce, you should be worried about him. </p>\n<p>16. No man is charming all of the time. Even Cary Grant is on record saying he wished he could be Cary Grant. </p>\n<p>17. When four or more men get together, they talk about sports. </p>\n<p>18. When four or more women get together, they talk about men. </p>\n<p>19. Men are less sentimental than women. No man has ever seen the movie "The Way We Were" twice, voluntarily. </p>\n<p>20. Most women are introspective: "Am I in love? Am I emotionally and creatively fulfilled?" Most men are outrospective: "Did my team win? How''s my car?" </p>\n<p>21. If a man says, "I''ll call you," and he doesn''t, he didn''t forget. He didn''t lose your number. He didn''t die. He just didn''t want to call you. </p>\n<p>22. Getting rid of a man without hurting his masculinity is a problem. "Get out" and "I never want to see you again" might sound like a challenge. If you want to get rid of a man, I suggest saying, "I love you; I want to marry you; I want to have your children." Sometimes they leave so fast, they leave skid marks. </p>\n<p>23. Men are self confident because they grow up identifying with super heroes. Women have bad self images because they grow up identifying with Barbie. </p>\n<p>24. Male menopause is a lot more fun than female menopause. With female menopause you gain weight and get hot flashes. With male menopause, you get to date young girls and drive motorcycles. </p>\n<p>25.

[Billy''s Mom''s LettersThe following appeared in a computer magazine in Mr. Dvorak''s column:Dear Mr. Dvorak:Ann Landers wouldn''t print this.  I have nowhere else to turn.  I have to get the word out. Warn other parents.  I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain.  It''s about my son, Billy.  He''s always been a good, normal ten year old boy.  Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy.  We sorted through the camp brochures.  There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire -- you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying.  I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo.  It''s where he went last year. (He made an adorable picture out of painted pinto beans and macaroni).  Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket.  It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known.  He left three weeks ago.  I don''t know what''s happened.  He''s changed.  I can''t explain it. See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy''s letters.Dear Mom,    The kids are dorky nerds.  The food stinks.  The computers are the only good part.  We''re learning how to program.  Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up.                  Love, Billy.Dear Mom,    Camp is O.K.  Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night.    We all get to choose what we want to drink.  I drink Classic Coke. By the way, can you make Szechuan food?  I''m getting used to it now. Gotta go, it''s time for the flowchart class.                  Love, Billy.P.S. This is written on a wordprocessor. Pretty swell, huh? It''s spellchecked too.Dear Mom,    Don''t worry.  We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens.  It was real neat.  I don''t have much of a tan ''cause we don''t go outside very often.  You can''t see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway.  That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I''m okay, really.                   Love, Billy.Dear Mom,    I''m fine. I''m sleeping enough. I''m eating enough.  This is the best camp ever.  We scared the counselor with some phony worm code.  It was real funny.  He got mad and yelled.  Frederick says it''s okay. Can you send more money? I spent mine on a pocket protector and a box of blankdiskettes. I''ve got to chip in on the phone bill.  Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer?  Give my regards to Dad.                   Love, Billy.Dear Mother,    Forget the money for the telephone.  We''ve got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven''t written. I''ve been learning a lot. I''m real good at getting onto any computer in the country.  It''s really easy! I got into the university''s in less than fifteen minutes.  Frederick did it in five, he''s going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner.  He''s really smart.  He says that I shouldn''t call myself Billy anymore.  So, I''m not.                   Signed, William.Dear Mother,    How nice of you to come up on Parents Day.  Why''d you get so upset?    I haven''t gained that much weight.  The glasses aren''t real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in.  Believe me, the tape on them is cool.  I thought that you''d be proud of my program. After all, I''ve made some money on it.  A publisher is sending a check for $30,000.Anyway, I''ve paid for the next six weeks of camp.  I won''t be home until late August.                   Regards, William.Mother,    Stop treating me like a child.  True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me.  Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding.  O.K.?  I won''t write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me.                   Sincerely, William.    See what I mean? It''s been two weeks since I''ve heard from my little boy. What can I do, Mr.Dvorak?  I know that it''s probably too late to save my little Billy.  But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming, please,  I beg of you to doso. Thank you very much. Sally Gates, Concerned Parent]

[In order to brighten up the living room we bought a pet fish and an aquarium to put it in. The fish was brightly coloured and I often liked to watch it as it swam contentedly round and round its little rectangular tank of water. It was so friendly and tame that it was happy to take food directly out of my hand. Having an interest in the theories of Charles Darwin, as an experiment one day I decided to see how the fish would adapt to change. So each day I would remove a tablespoonful of the water and replace it with a tablespoonful of seawater. This went on for several months until eventually the fish was happily swimming around in pure seawater.I decided to reverse the process, and each day, I would remove a tablespoonful of seawater from the tank and replaced it with a tablespoonful of fresh water until the water in the tank was completely returned to fresh water. The fish was none the worse for his experience.Encouraged by this success I decided to try a further experiment. Each day I would remove a tablespoonful of the water from the tank to see if the fish could adapt to the changed circumstances of reduced water levels. Although the fish had difficulty adapting at first it was eventually able to lie on the bed of the tank and breath air. Later I decided to move the fish to a disused budgerigar cage and was surprised to see that the fish had adapted to its new circumstances and was cheerfully hopping from perch to perch, ringing the bell, and playing on the swing. The fish lived like this for several months until sadly one day it fell from its perch straight into the bowl of drinking water and drowned.]

The golfer walked onto the water, found his the ball, placed it next to the water hazard and hit it onto the green.As you may have guessed, the first golfer was Moses, and the second golfer was Jesus.The third teed off. The ball soared through the air and it too was headed for the water. However, just before the ball went in the water, a fish jumped up and grabbed the ball in its mouth. As the fish was about to go back into the water, a eagle grabbed the fish and started to fly away. Then, as the eagle flew over the green a big flash of lightning hit the eagle. Well, the eagle dropped the fish and as the fish fell on the green, the ball rolled out of his mouth and into the hole.Then Jesus shouted, "Dad! If you do that again,I''m going to stop inviting you to play golf with us!"]

[- Redneck Driving Etiquette -<br /> Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun is loaded and the deer is in sight.<br /> When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires always has the right of way.<br /> Never tow another car using pantyhose and duct tape.<br /> When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer.<br /> Never relieve yourself from a moving vehicle, especially when driving.<br /> Do not remove the seats from the car so that all your kids can fit in.<br /> Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.</p>\n<p>- Redneck Personal Hygiene -<br /> Unlike clothes and shoes, a toothbrush should never be a hand-me-down item.<br /> If you have to vacuum the bed, it''s time to change the sheets.<br /> While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one''s OWN truck keys.<br /> Plucking unwanted nose hair is time-consuming work.<br /> A cigarette lighter and a small tolerance for pain can accomplish the same goal and save hours.<br /> Note: Its a good idea to keep a bucket of water handy when using this method. </p>\n<p>- Redneck Dining Out -<br /> Remember to leave a generous tip for good service. After all, their mobile home costs just as much as yours. </p>\n<p>- Redneck Entertaining in Your Home -<br /> A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist.<br /> Do not allow the dog to eat at the table . . . no matter how good his manners are.<br /> If your dog falls in love with a guest''s leg, have the decency to leave them alone for a few minutes. </p>\n<p>- Redneck Dating (Outside the Family) -<br /> Always offer to bait your date''s hook, especially on the first date.<br /> Be aggressive.

[Why is there never a working ballpoint pen attached to those chains you see hanging around banks?Once imprisoned, the ballpoint pen soon loses the will to write. Even if released, it develops a deep-seated pattern of skipping and blotching that will soon send it back to the chain gang. Repeat offender ballpoint pens are sent to the post office, where they become federal pens. If not watched carefully, these pens will hang themselves from the writing desks. To prevent this, postal workers are particularly attentive, which is why they so often seem to be standing around staring at the pens. To avoid contributing to this destructive and unwholesome situation, I use a high-resolution dot-matrix printer when I write, and I recommend you do the same.]
[The five toughest questions women ask - and their answers:1. `What are you thinking?'' 2. `Do you love me?'' 3. `Do I look fat?'' 4. `Do you think she''s prettier than me?'' 5. `What would you do if I died?''What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example:1. `What are you thinking?''The proper answer to this question, of course, is: ''I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you.'' Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things: a - football. b - baseball. c - How fat you are. d - How much prettier she is than you. e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died.The best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married with Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. His answer: ''If I wanted you to know I''d be talking instead of thinking''The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers:2. ''Do you love me?'' The correct answer to this question is, ''Yes.'' For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer. ''Yes dear.'' Wrong answers include: a - I suppose so. b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes? c - That depends on what you mean by ''love''. d - Does it matter? e - Who, me?3. ''Do I look fat?'' The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, ''No, of course not'' and then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include: a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either. b - Compared to what? c - A little extra weight looks good on you. d - I''ve seen fatter. e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.4. ''Do you think she''s prettier than me?'' The ''she'' in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passerby you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is: ''No, you are much prettier.'' Wrong answers include: a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things. c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality. d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner. e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.5. ''What would you do if I died?'' Correct answer: ''Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first truck that came my way.''This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke:''Dear,'' said the wife, `what would you do if I died?'' ''why, dear, I would be extremely upset,'' said the husband. ''Why do you ask such a question?'' ''Would you remarry?'' persevered the wife. ''No, of course not, dear,'' said the husband. ''Don''t you like being married?'' said the wife. ''Of course I do, dear,'' he said. ''Then why wouldn''t you remarry?'' ''All right,'' said the husband, ''I''d remarry.'' ''You would?'' said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. ''Yes,'' said the husband. `Would you sleep with her in our bed?'' said the wife after a long pause.

[A married woman is having an affair. Whenever her lover comes over, she<br /> puts her nine year old son in the closet. One day the woman hears a car in<br /> the driveway and puts her lover in the closet as well.</p>\n<p>Inside the closet, the little boy says, "It''s dark in here, isn''t it?"<br /> "Yes, it is," the man replies.<br /> "You wanna buy a baseball?" the little boy asks.<br /> "No thanks," the man replies.<br /> "I think you do want to buy a baseball," the little extortionist continues.<br /> "OK. How much?" the man replies after considering the position he''s in.<br /> "Twenty-five dollars," the little boy replies.<br /> "TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS?" the man repeats incredulously, but complies to<br /> protect his hidden position.</p>\n<p>The following week, the lover is visiting the woman again when she hears a<br /> car in the driveway and, again, places her lover in the closet with her<br /> little boy.<br /> "It''s dark in here, isn''t it?" the boy starts off.<br /> "Yes, it is," replies the man.<br /> "Wanna buy a baseball glove?" the little boy asks. "OK. How much?" the<br /> hiding lover responds, acknowledging his disadvantage.<br /> "Fifty dollars," the boy replies and the transaction is completed.</p>\n<p>The next weekend, the little boy''s father says "Hey, son. Go get your ball<br /> and glove and we''ll play some catch."<br /> "I can''t. I sold them," replies the little boy.<br /> "How much did you get for them?" asks the father, expecting to hear the<br /> profit in terms of lizards and candy.<br /> "Seventy-five dollars," the little boy says.<br /> "SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS? That''s thievery! I''m taking you to the church right<br /> now. You must confess your sin and ask for forgiveness," the father<br /> explains as he hauls the child away. At the church, the little boy goes<br /> into the confessional, draws the curtain, sits down, and says "It''s dark<br /> in here, isn''t it?" To which the priest exclaims, "Don''t you start that<br /> shit in here."]

[There was a guy so addicted to golf that all he did is go out on the links every single day. He had ambitions of making it to the Pros, so he took his game very seriously. One windy day while playing in the finals of a a tournament, the guy was in contention, so he played every shot with utmost care and concentration. After all the scores were submitted, he was declared the winner of the tournament. He went home to his wife with the trophy and some small cash prize. He kept repeating his round over dinner.

But remember, overuse<br /> can cause Husband 1.0 to default to GrumpySilence 2.5, HappyHour<br /> 7.0 or Beer 6.1. </p>\n<p>Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create "Snoring Loudly"<br /> WAV sound files. DO NOT install MotherInLaw 1.0 or reinstall<br /> another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications<br /> and will crash Husband 1.0. </p>\n<p>In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have<br /> limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly.<br /> Consider buying additional software to improve performance. </p>\n<p>I personally recommend HotFood 3.0 and Lingerie 5.3 </p>\n<p>--Help Desk]

[An eighty-five-year-old couple, married for almost sixty years,<br /> died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten<br /> years, mainly as a result of her interest in health food and<br /> exercise.</p>\n<p>When they reached the Pearly Gates, St. Peter took them to their<br /> mansion, which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and a<br /> master bath suite with a sauna and Jacuzzi. As they "oohed and<br /> aahed" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to<br /> cost. "It''s free," Peter replied. "This is heaven."</p>\n<p>Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course<br /> that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges<br /> every day, and each week the course would change to new one that<br /> represented one of the great golf courses on Earth. The old man<br /> asked, "What are the green fees?" Peter''s reply: "This is<br /> heaven; you play for free."</p>\n<p>Next they went to the clubhouse and saw the lavish buffet lunch<br /> with the cuisines of the world laid out. "How much to eat?"<br /> asked the old man. "Don''t you understand yet? This is heaven; it<br /> is free!" Peter replied with some exasperation. "Well, where are<br /> the low-fat and low-cholesterol tables?" the old man asked<br /> timidly. Peter lectured, "That''s the best part: You can eat as<br /> much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and<br /> you never get sick. This is heaven."</p>\n<p>With that, the old man threw down his hat, stomped on it, and<br /> shrieked wildly. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down,<br /> asking him what was wrong. The old man looked at his wife and<br /> said, "This is all your fault. If it weren''t for your blasted<br /> bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!"]

[15 Easy Steps To Crap Like A Woman</p>\n<p>1. Under no circumstances use any other toilet than your own,<br /> regardless of any stomach pain that may be caused while waiting<br /> to get home. </p>\n<p>2. With the toilet-brush, clean any residue left on the bowl by<br /> your boyfriend/husband. Also wipe his pubic hair off the seat<br /> with some toilet paper. </p>\n<p>3. Flush the toilet before starting. Then wash your hands. </p>\n<p>4. Line the toilet seat with toilet paper (as other people may<br /> have sat on the toilet since it was last bleached). </p>\n<p>5. Stuff toilet paper inside the bowl to prevent splash back. </p>\n<p>6. Pull panties down and sit. Some women may still prefer to<br /> squat over the seat as opposed to taking the risk of touching it<br /> with bare flesh. </p>\n<p>7. Release solids, but strain to avoid making any sounds. </p>\n<p>8. Rise and quickly flush before direct eye contact is made with<br /> any feces. </p>\n<p>9. Take a length of toilet paper and fold it several times to<br /> positively guarantee that no residue will touch bare skin (about<br /> five or six applications per roll). </p>\n<p>10. Wipe once and throw paper into the bowl. Do not look at the<br /> paper. </p>\n<p>11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 at least thirty times. It may be<br /> necessary to yell for your boyfriend/husband to find some more<br /> rolls to pass through the door while promising not to open his<br /> eyes or pass any comments. It is traditional to do this while he<br /> is trying to watch sports. </p>\n<p>12. Flush the toilet and replace the lid. </p>\n<p>13. Wash hands at least three times with disinfectant soap. </p>\n<p>14. Open all windows and spray approximately half-a-can of air<br /> freshener. </p>\n<p>15. Pick up all reading material left behind by your<br /> boyfriend/husband and leave bathroom, closing the door firmly<br /> behind you.]

[1) Coming home, I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don''t have.</p>\n<p>2) The other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intentions.</p>\n<p>3) I thought my window was down, but I found out it was up when I put my hand through it.</p>\n<p>4) I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way.</p>\n<p>5) A truck backed through my windshield into my wife''s face.</p>\n<p>6) A pedestrian hit me and went under my car.</p>\n<p>7) I had been learning to drive with power steering. I turned the wheel to what I thought was enough and found myself in a different direction going the other way.</p>\n<p>8) I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law and headed over the embankment.</p>\n<p>9) In my attempt to kill a fly, I drove into a telephone pole.</p>\n<p>10) I had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home. As I reached an intersection, a hedge sprang up, obscuring my vision.</p>\n<p>11) I had been driving for 40 years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident.</p>\n<p>12) I was on my way to the doctors with rear end trouble, when my universal joints gave way, causing me to have an accident.</p>\n<p>13) Upon collision and in a flash of blue, I hit my head, twisted my neck, and tossed the lower part of my body out the side window.</p>\n<p>14) To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.</p>\n<p>15) My car was legally parked as it backed into the other vehicle.</p>\n<p>16) An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car and vanished.</p>\n<p>17) I told the police that I was not injured, but on removing my hat, I found that I had a skull fracture.</p>\n<p>18) I was sure the old fellow would not make it to the other side of the street when I struck him.</p>\n<p>19) The pedestrian had no idea which way to go, so I ran over him.</p>\n<p>20) I saw the slow moving, sad faced gentleman as he bounced off the hood of my car.</p>\n<p>21) I was thrown from my car as it left the road, I was later found in a ditch by some stray cows.</p>\n<p>22) The telephone pole was approaching fast. I attempted to swerve out of its way, when it struck the front of my car.</p>\n<p>23) The accident occurred with me waving to the man I hit last week.</p>\n<p>24) I hit a bus stop sign that was obscured by human beings.</p>\n<p>25) The pedestrian was all over the road, I had to swerve a few times before I hit him.</p>\n<p>26) A bull was standing near and a fly must have tickled him as he gored my car.</p>\n<p>27) A stop sign suddenly appeared in a place where no stop sign had ever appeared before. I was unable to stop in time to avoid the accident.</p>\n<p>28) I immediately applied my brakes as the vehicle struck the cement wall, thus bringing my car to a complete halt.</p>\n<p>29) I left my car unattended for a minute when by accident it ran away.</p>\n<p>31) I saw her look at me twice. She appeared to be making slow progress, then we met on impact.</p>\n<p>32) I struck the young man with my husband''s car. He wanted to call the police but after having a look at my particulars he decided we should go to his apartment and settle things in private.</p>\n<p>33) I thought I could squeeze between two trucks when my car became squashed.</p>\n<p>34) I thought my car was in reverse but I found otherwise when it lurched forward, doing injury to a parking meter. When the police arrived the meter had expired.</p>\n<p>35) I was contemplating continuous travel of a relaxing nature when, without due justification or color of right, my vehicle was struck in the rear by a vehicle driven by a person of obvious sub-normal intelligence.</p>\n<p>36) I was on my way through a green light, with 3 witnesses, on the way to the accident that was about to happen.</p>\n<p>37) I was thrown from my car as I left the road. I was later found in a ditch by some stray cows.</p>\n<p>38) I was unable to control my car when it went berserk and struck another vehicle.</p>\n<p>39) I was unable to stop in time, and my car crashed into the other vehicle. The driver and passengers left immediately for a vacation with injuries.</p>\n<p>40) My car hit a pothole and came to rest approximately fifteen feet below the surface of the road.</p>\n<p>41) My girlfriend kissed me. I lost control and woke up in the hospital.</p>\n<p>42) My mind became confused by a sign that read "Free Puppy for Sale". The next thing I remember, I was in the ditch.</p>\n<p>43) No one was to blame for the accident but it never would have happened if the other driver had been alert.</p>\n<p>44) The accident happened when a right front door of a car came around the corner without giving a signal.</p>\n<p>45) The accident occurred when I was attempting to bring my car out of a skid by steering it into the other vehicle.</p>\n<p>46) The gentleman behind me struck me on the backside. He then went to rest in the bush with just his rear end showing.</p>\n<p>47) The indirect cause of the accident was a little guy in a small car with a big mouth.</p>\n<p>48) The other car attempted to cut in front of me, so I, with my right front fender, removed his left rear tail light.</p>\n<p>49) The other driver looked like the usual lane-hopping type with thick horn rimmed glasses, pimply faced, brown suit and thick soled shoes.</p>\n<p>50) The other driver struck my car with an Expired Drivers License then left the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p>51) There was a heavy fog and I was unable to find the traffic lights. A witness told the police that the other driver had the lights with him when he entered the intersection.</p>\n<p>52) When I pressed the windshield spray button my car left the road and struck a fire hydrant. I was unable to see the road because of the spray.  My windows are clean.</p>\n<p>53) When I saw I could not avoid a collision I stepped on the gas and crashed into the other car.]

So that you may find better success in your future romantic endeavors, please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were disqualified from the competition. Check those that apply... </p>\n<p>___Your last name is objectionable. I can''t imagine taking it, hyphenating it, or subjecting my children to it. </p>\n<p>___Your first name is objectionable. It''s just not something I can picture myself yelling out in a fit of passion. </p>\n<p>___The fact that our dining experiences to date has left MY wallet a little lighter, and YOUR pants a little tighter! </p>\n<p>___Your inadvertent admission that you "buy condoms by the truckload" indicates that you m! ay be interested in me for something other than my personality. </p>\n<p>___You failed the 20 Question Rule, i.e., I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself. </p>\n<p>___Your constant e-mailing shows me you have TOO much time on your hands! </p>\n<p>___Your legs are skinnier than mine. </p>\n<p>___You''re too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up repeatedly at recess. </p>\n<p>___You''re too tall. I''m developing a chronic neck condition from trying to kiss you. </p>\n<p>___I find your inability to fix my car extraordinarily unappealing. </p>\n<p>___The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable. </p>\n<p>___The phrase "My Mother" has popped up far too often in conversation. </p>\n<p>___You still live with your parents. </p>\n<p>___Although I do enjoy the X-Files, I find your wardrobe of Star Trek uniforms a little disconcerting. </p>\n<p>___Your frequent references to your ex -girlfriend lead me to suspect that you are some sort of psychotic stalker. </p>\n<p>___Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I am seeking in a long-term partner. </p>\n<p>___Your height is out of proportion to your weight. If you should however, happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches, please resubmit your application. </p>\n<p>___Somehow I doubt those condoms I found in your overnight bag were really necessary for a successful business trip. </p>\n<p>___I am out of your league, set your sights lower next time. </p>\n<p>Sincerely, ______________________]

[Here are a few things that Americans were saying in 1959. Some<br /> of you will remember, some will only laugh...</p>\n<p>* I''ll tell you one thing, if things keep going the way they<br /> are, it''s going to be impossible to buy a week''s groceries for<br /> $20.</p>\n<p>* Have you seen the new cars coming out next year? It won''t be<br /> long before $2,000 will only by a used one.</p>\n<p>* If cigarettes keep going up in price, I''m going to quit. A<br /> quarter a pack is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>* Did you hear the post office is thinking about charging a dime<br /> just to mail a letter?</p>\n<p>* If they raise the minimum wage to $1.00, nobody will be able<br /> to hire outside help at the store.</p>\n<p>* When I first started driving, who would have thought gas would<br /> someday cost 30 cents a gallon? Guess we''d be better off leaving<br /> the car in the garage.</p>\n<p>* Kids today are impossible. Those duck tail haircuts make it<br /> impossible to stay groomed. Next thing you know, boys will be<br /> wearing their hair as long as the girls.</p>\n<p>* Pretty soon, you won''t be able to buy a good 10-cent cigar.</p>\n<p>* I read the other day where some scientist thinks it''s possible<br /> to put a man on the moon by the end of the century.</p>\n<p>* Did you see where some baseball player just signed a contract<br /> for $75,000 a year just to play ball? It wouldn''t surprise me if<br /> someday they''ll be making more than the President.</p>\n<p>* I never thought I''d see the day all our kitchen appliances<br /> would be electric. They are even making electric typewriters now.</p>\n<p>* It''s too bad things are so tough nowadays. I see where a few<br /> married women have to work to make ends meet.</p>\n<p>* It would be long before young couples are going to have to<br /> hire someone to watch their kids so they can both work.</p>\n<p>* I''m just afraid the Volkswagen car is going to open the door<br /> to a whole lot of foreign business.</p>\n<p>* Thank goodness I won''t live to see the day when the government<br /> takes half our income in taxes. I sometimes wonder if we are<br /> electing the best people to Congress.</p>\n<p>* The drive-in restaurant is convenient in nice weather, but I<br /> seriously doubt they will ever catch on.</p>\n<p>* There is no sense going to the city for a weekend. It costs<br /> nearly $15 a night to stay in a hotel.</p>\n<p>* No one can afford to be sick anymore. $35 a day in the<br /> hospital is too rich for my blood.</p>\n<p>* If a few idiots want to risk their necks flying across the<br /> country, that''s fine, but nothing will ever replace trains.</p>\n<p>* I don''t know about you, but if they raise the price of coffee<br /> to 15 cents, I''ll just have to drink mine at home.</p>\n<p>* If they think I''ll pay 50 cents for a haircut, forget it. I''ll<br /> have my wife learn to cut hair.</p>\n<p>* We won''t be going out much anymore. Our babysitter informed us<br /> she wants 50 cents an hour. Kids think money grows on trees.]

That haggis has made me verra hungry and I wad verra much like a drink!'''' She goes off into the woods again and returns with a bottle of 75-year-old single-malt Scotch whiskey.

[An 85-year-old couple, after being married for almost 60 years, died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years, mainly due to her interest in health food and exercising. When they reached the Pearly Gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion, which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen, master bath suite and a Jacuzzi. As they looked around, the old man asked St. Peter how much all this was going to cost. ''''It''s free,'''' St. Peter replied, ''''this is Heaven.'''' Next, they went out in the back yard to survey the championship-style golf course that the home was located. They would have golfing privileges every day and each week, the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, ''''What are the green fees?'''' St. Peter replied, ''''This is heaven, you play for free.'''' Next, they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisines of the World laid out. ''''How much to eat?'''' asked the old man. ''''Don''t you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!'''' St. Peter replied, with some exasperation. ''''Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?'''' the old man asked timidly. St. Peter lectured, ''''That''s the best part - you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven.'''' With that, the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and screaming wildly. St. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong. The old man looked at his wife and said, ''''This is all your fault! If it weren''t for your blasted bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!'''']

[The Reverend John Fuzz was pastor of a small congregation in a little Pennsylvania town. One day he was walking down Main Street and he happened to notice a female member of his congregation sitting in the town bar, drinking beer. The reverend thought this was sinful and not something a member of his congregation should do, so he walked through the open door of the bar and sat down next to the woman."Mrs. Fitzgerald," the reverend said sternly."This is no place for a member of my congregation. Why don''t you let me take you home?" "Shure," she said with a slur, obviously very drunk.When Mrs. Fitzgerald stood up from the bar, she began to weave back and forth. The reverend realised that she had had too much to drink and he grabbed hold of her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance and tumbled to the floor. After rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lying on top of Mrs. Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist. The bartender looked over the bar and said, "Here, here, buddy, we won''t have any of that carrying on in this bar."The reverend looked up at the bartender and said, "But you don''t understand, I''m Pastor Fuzz."The bartender nodded."Well if you''re that far you may as well finish."]
[The Seven Deadly Sins of Gilligan''s Island theory is quite simple.Each of the seven characters on the island represents each of the seven deadly sins. Now, this theory seems to fit upon initial inspection, there are technical difficulties when you get down to THE MAN himself, Gilligan. Run with me on this one...Most obvious is the Professor, who fits PRIDE to a T. Any man who can make a ham radio out of some wire and two coconuts has to be pretty cocky. (His character was later revised and given a series of his own, called MacGyver''.)For the sin of ENVY we need look no further than Maryann, who may have worn those skimpy little tops, but could never achieve Ginger''s glamour. (As an interesting and completely irrelevant side note, a nationwide survey of college students a few years ago revealed that the professor and Maryann were voted the most likely couple to have ''done it'' on the island.)And who could doubt for a moment that Ginger is LUST incarnate? Sure, the kids were supposed to think she was ACTING, but we all know what being deprived episode after episode was doing to her. You know and I know that glazed look wasn''t boredom, my friends.What kind of person takes a trunk full of money on a three-hour cruise? Mr Howell gets my vote for GREED.We are now left with three characters and three Deadly Sins. We have Gilligan, the Skipper and Mrs Howell to whom we must match GLUTTONY, SLOTH and ANGER. As you can see, there is a Gilligan problem here. Certainly we can further eliminate Mrs Howell from this equation by connecting her with SLOTH. She did jack shit during her many years on the island and everybody knows it.This leaves ANGER and GLUTTONY, either of which the Skipper had no shortage. He was, after all, a big guy with the tendency to hit Gilligan with his hat at least once an episode. After much consideration, I have decided that he can easily do double-duty, covering the two remaining Deadly Sins.So here we have the Seven Deadly Sins trapped in an endlessly recurring Hell of hope followed by denial and despair, forced to live with each other in our TVs until the last re-run ends.And who is their captor? What keeps them trapped there? Gilligan. Gilligan is SATAN. Think about it.]

[1. Most Blues begin, "Woke up this morning."</p>\n<p>2. " I got a good woman" is a bad way to begin the Blues, ''less you stick something nasty in the next line, like "I got a good woman, with the meanest face in town."</p>\n<p>3. The Blues is simple. After you get the first line right, repeat it. Then find something that rhymes ... sort of: "Got a good woman - with the meanest face in town. Got teeth like Margaret Thatcher - and she weigh 500 pound."</p>\n<p>4. The Blues are not about choice. You stuck in a ditch, you stuck in a ditch; ain''t no way out.</p>\n<p>5. Blues cars: Chevys and Cadillacs and broken-down trucks. Blues don''t travel in Volvos, BMWs, or Sport Utility Vehicles. Most Blues transportation is a Greyhound bus or a southbound train. Jet aircraft an'' state-sponsored motor pools ain''t even in the running. Walk-in''s plays a major part in the blues lifestyle. So does fixin'' to die.</p>\n<p>6. Teenagers can''t sing the Blues. They ain''t fixin'' to die yet. Adults sing the Blues. In Blues, "adulthood" means being old enough to get the electric chair if you shoot a man in Memphis.</p>\n<p>7. Blues can take place in New York City but not in Hawaii or any place in Canada. Hard times in St. Paul or Tucson is just depression. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City still the best places to have the Blues. You cannot have the blues in any place that don''t get rain.</p>\n<p>8. A man with male pattern baldness ain''t the blues. A woman with male pattern baldness is. Breaking your leg cuz you skiing is not the blues. Breaking your leg cuz an alligator be chomping on it, is.</p>\n<p>9. You can''t have no Blues in an office or a shopping mall. The lighting is wrong. Go outside to the parking lot or go sit by the dumpster.</p>\n<p>10. Good places for the Blues:</p>\n<p>a. highway</p>\n<p>b. jailhouse</p>\n<p>c. empty bed</p>\n<p>d. bottom of a whiskey glass</p>\n<p>Bad places:</p>\n<p>a. Ashrams</p>\n<p>b. Gallery openings</p>\n<p>c. Ivy League institutions</p>\n<p>d. Golf courses</p>\n<p>11. No one will believe it''s the Blues if you wear a suit, ''less you happen to be an old ethnic person, and you slept in it.</p>\n<p>12. Do you have the right to sing the Blues? Yes, if:</p>\n<p>a. you''re older than dirt</p>\n<p>b. you''re blind</p>\n<p>c. you shot a man in Memphis</p>\n<p>d. you can''t be satisfied</p>\n<p>No, if:</p>\n<p>a. you have all your teeth</p>\n<p>b. you were once blind but now can see</p>\n<p>c. the man in Memphis lived.</p>\n<p>d. you have a retirement plan or trust fund.</p>\n<p>13. Blues is not a matter of color. It''s a matter of bad luck. Tiger Woods cannot sing the blues. Gary Coleman could. Ugly white people also got a leg up on the blues.</p>\n<p>14. If you ask for water and Baby give you gasoline, it''s the Blues. Other acceptable Blues beverages are:</p>\n<p>a. wine</p>\n<p>b. whiskey or bourbon</p>\n<p>c. muddy water</p>\n<p>d. black coffee</p>\n<p>The following are NOT Blues beverages:</p>\n<p>a. mixed drinks</p>\n<p>b. kosher wine</p>\n<p>c. Snapple</p>\n<p>d. sparkling water</p>\n<p>15. If it occurs in a cheap motel or a shotgun shack, it''s a Blues death. Stabbed in the back by a jealous lover is another Blues way to die. So is the electric chair, substance abuse, and dying lonely on a broken down cot. You can''t have a Blues death if you die during a tennis match or getting liposuction.</p>\n<p>16. Some Blues names for women:</p>\n<p>a. Sadie</p>\n<p>b. Big Mama</p>\n<p>c. Bessie</p>\n<p>d. Fat River Dumpling</p>\n<p>17. Some Blues names for men:</p>\n<p>a. Joe</p>\n<p>b. Willie</p>\n<p>c. Little Willie</p>\n<p>d. Big Willie</p>\n<p>18. Persons with names like Sierra, Sequoia, Auburn, and Rainbow can''t sing the Blues no matter how many men they shoot in Memphis.</p>\n<p>19.

And Man gained 5 pounds.</p>\n<p>And God created the healthful yogurt, that woman might keep her figure that<br /> man found so fair.</p>\n<p>And Satan brought forth chocolate.

[=&gt; NAME: *Expecteria Trouserius* (Trouser Snake) =&gt; LOCATION: Throughout the world=&gt; DESCRIPTION: One-eyed, with mushroom-shaped head (other types come with extra layers of skin) Varying from pink to black. Fang-less with a highly venomous spit. (Spit can reach distances up to 2-3 feet) *Size varies from 3 to 12 inches, depending on its mood &amp; sub-species.=&gt; SYMPTOMS: This snake attacks mainly women in the lower front abdomen, resulting in an inconspicuous bump. Then a severe swelling followed by excruciating pain after nine months. The attack is not usually fatal. Beware: It has been known to attack men in the rear lower abdomen!=&gt; HABITAT: Usually found in bedrooms, but has been known to appear in the most unusual places.=&gt; ANTIDOTE: Various types of vaccine available for women. However, once the venom is injected into the body only drastic measures will ensure complete recovery. There is no known antidote for men.=&gt; WHAT TO DO WHEN ATTACKEDTOURNIQUET: Do not apply a tourniquet as the venom is too deep in the body to be affected.CUTTING THE WOUND: This would be completely unnecessary and ineffective as the bleeding will stop after a few weeks anyhow.SUCKING THE WOUND: This method is the most popular with the victim, but so far has not been reported to have led to any success.=&gt; CONCLUSION: This snake, although it is very aggressive and active, is not necessarily a vermin, and treated with the right respect, makes a wonderful pet.]

[The next time you complain about that tricky water hole on your favorite golf course, just be glad it isn''t filled with crocodiles. According to the April issue of Men''s Health magazine, here are the 10 most dangerous golf courses around the world: </p>\n<p>Lost City Golf Course, Sun City, South Africa: The 13th green is fronted by a stone pit filled with crocodiles, some stretching up to 15 feet long. </p>\n<p>Elephant Hills Country Club, Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe: The fairways are sometimes marked by craters caused by mortar shells fired across the Zambezi River. </p>\n<p>Compton Par-3 Golf Course, Compton, California: If you like high caliber excitement, this is your place. Home to Crips versus Bloods, Ryder Cup-style competition. </p>\n<p>Machrie Hotel Golf Course, Islay, Scotland: On this old-fashioned, lay of the land links, virtually every drive and approach is blind, played over huge sand dunes. Incoming! </p>\n<p>Scholl Canyon Golf Course, Glendale, California: Built on a landfill, it ran into difficulties when golfers snagged clubs on buried tires and methane gas rose up from the divots. They now pump the gas to the local power company. </p>\n<p>Pelham Bay and Split Rock golf courses, Bronx, New York: Pelham''s remote location makes it ideal for dumping unfortunate souls. In a recent 10-year period, 13 bodies were said to have been found.</p>\n<p>Singapore Island Country Club, Singapore: In the 1982 Singapore Open, pro Jim Stewart encountered a 10-foot cobra. He killed it, only to watch in horror as another emerged from its mouth. </p>\n<p>Beachwood Golf Course, Natal, South Africa: Mrs. Molly Whitaker successfully executed a bunker shot here a few years back, but was then attacked by a monkey who leaped from the bush and tried to strangle her. An alert caddie dispatched the ape. </p>\n<p>Plantation Golf and Country Club, Gretna, Louisiana: With 18 holes shoved into 61 acres (less than half the norm) players must huddle against protective fencing while awaiting their turn. </p>\n<p>Lundin Links, Fife, Scotland: Enjoyable links near St. Andrews, unless you''re Harold Wallace, who in 1950 was hit by a train while crossing the tracks beyond the fifth green.]

"The first is from an 18-year old<br /> kid, non-smoker, athletic, swimmer, with a great diet. He hit his head on the<br /> swimming pool and died. It''s $100,000. The second is from a marathon runner, 25<br /> years old, great condition, very strong. He got hit by a bus. It''s $150,000. The<br /> third is from a heavy drinker, cigar smoker, steak lover.

[One summer, on a Friday afternoon, a young man was being trained by his supervisor on his first day as a salesperson at a large department store. His supervisor was trying to show him the amount of things he could sell to customers by making them feel they needed the items. "Watch this," he said and approached a man who has just entered the store. "May I help you, sir?" The man replied, "I just moved into my first house and I need some fertiliser for my lawn."So the supervisor said, "Well, we have five- and ten-pound bags of fertiliser. I recommend you go with the ten pound bag.""Why is that?""The ten-pound bag will get you through most of the summer, but the five-pound bag won''t," the supervisor answered."Fine," the man agreed, "I''ll take the ten-pounder." "Very good sir. And would you like the stiff rake or the spring-rake with that?""Rake? What do I need that for?""Well sir," said the supervisor authoritatively, "if you don''t rake up the old dead grass before you spread the fertiliser, it won''t all reach the soil.""All right then. I''ll get the stiff rake.""Very good sir. And would you like the fixed sprinkler or the oscillating sprinkler with that?"The man started to get a bit steamed and asked harshly, "Sprinkler? Look, I just came in here for some fertiliser. What do I need a sprinkler for?" Calmly, the supervisor responded, "Well sir, if you water your lawn immediately after fertilising, the fertiliser will sink into the soil more quickly and in no time at all, you''ll have the greenest lawn in your neighbourhood."This sounded pretty good to the man so he picked up the fixed sprinkler. "OK, then. I''ll take all this.""Very good sir. And would you like the electric or gas mower with that," asked the supervisor.Now the customer had about had it and he all but blew up at the supervisor. "LAWNMOWER? Look, all I wanted when I came here was a bag of fertiliser. You''ve already managed to sell me a rake and a sprinkler besides. Give me one good reason why I should get a lawnmower, too!"Calm as ever, the supervisor said, "Well sir, if you get a lawnmower now, then you''ll be all ready to start trimming your beautiful green grass the minute it starts getting too long. Your lawn will look like a golf course and you''ll be the envy of all your neighbours! Besides, they are on sale this week only, and you''re going to need it either way."Well, the man figured that sounded OK and he really wanted to get out of there before he bought anything else so at last he relented. "Fine. I''ll get the electric mower, but that''s it!""Very good sir. I''ll ring that up for you."After the man had left the store with all his new purchases, the supervisor turned to the trainee and said, "So, do you think you could do that?" The trainee said that he thought he could and the supervisor directed him towards another customer.The trainee approached the puzzled-looking man and asked, "May I help you sir?"The man replied, "Yes. I need some tampons for my wife." Well, the trainee is totally thrown off by this request. He can''t imagine what he could offer the man to go along with that. However, he wanted to impress his boss so he thought hard. Suddenly, he had it! "Very good sir. And would you like the electric or gas mower with that?""Mower? What the hell is wrong with you? I came in here looking for tampons. Why the hell should I get a lawnmower, too?""Well sir," the trainee answered, "I figure your weekend is shot, so you might as well cut the grass."]

[A burglar broke into a house one night. He shined his flashlight around looking for valuables, and when he picked up a CD player to place in his sack a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying, "Jesus is watching you."He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight out and froze. When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, promised himself a long vacation after his next big score, then clicked the light back on and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard, "Jesus is watching you."Freaked out, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot.  "Did you say that?" he hissed at the parrot. "Yep," the parrot confessed, then squawked, "I''m just trying to warn you."The burglar relaxed. "Warn me, huh? Who the heck are you?""Moses," replied the bird."Moses?" the burglar laughed. "What kind of stupid people would name a parrot Moses?"The bird promptly answered, "Probably the same kind of people that  Would name a 140 pound Rottweiler Jesus."]

[A woman had 8 children, all of them boys. So, one day a magazine sent a journalist to her house for an interview. </p>\n<p>He asked her about the boys and what their names were; she sid ''Kevin''. ''Right'', he said, ''what about that blond one over there?'' ''Kevin'', she said. ''Oh, and the tall one with the freckles?'' ''Kevin'', she said. </p>\n<p>''Well, and the little chubby one with the baseball cap?'' ''Kevin'', she said. ''Are all your boys called Kevin?'' he asked, ''isn''t that terribly complicated?'' </p>\n<p>''Not at all'', she said, ''it makes everything very easy, actually. When I shout: Kevin, tea is ready!, they all come. When I say: Kevin, it''s time for bed!, they all go to bed.'' </p>\n<p>''I see. But what if you want only one of them?''<br /> ''No problem.'' she answers. ''Then I call them by their surnames.'']

[Little Johnny was about 10 years old and curious as only a boy<br /> should be. He had been hearing a lot about courting from other<br /> boys so he asked his mother how it was done. She told him to<br /> hide behind the curtains some night and watch his sister and her<br /> boyfriend. So Johnny did and this is what happened (or at least<br /> his version).</p>\n<p>"Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked awhile, then turned out<br /> all the lights except the blue one, then he started kissing her,<br /> and for some reason he put his hand inside her blouse. She<br /> started giggling and ooing, then he put his hand up her skirt,<br /> when he did this she began to moan and sigh.</p>\n<p>Then she slowly moved to the other end of the couch till she was<br /> lying down. I think she had a backache, then he rolled over and<br /> unzipped his pants and pulled out a Texas Eel. I don''t know what<br /> it was doing in there but it was 8" long and 2" wide. He held it<br /> in his hands so it wouldn''t get away. Sis tried to help him, so<br /> she got a tight grip on it, she spread her legs far apart and<br /> stuck this eel between her legs and got a good scissors hold on<br /> it. He helped by lying on top of Sis to keep the eel from moving.</p>\n<p>The eel put up a hell of a fight though. Sis squalled and her<br /> boyfriend nearly up set the couch. For a minute there I thought<br /> the damn thing was getting away but Sis grabbed it just as it<br /> was slipping out and stuck it back in.</p>\n<p>Soon they both gave a large sigh and stopped moving. First they<br /> let the eel move but it didn''t. It tried to get away but her<br /> boyfriend got up and the thing was dead. It just hung there<br /> limber as a hot water bottle and its end was dripping. Sis and<br /> her boyfriend were all tired out from the battle. They started<br /> kissing and loving again and by God if that damn thing didn''t<br /> come back to life again, so the battle started again.</p>\n<p>Well it sure was the best wrestling match I ever saw. This time<br /> they really killed the eel. I saw her boyfriend pull its skin<br /> off and flush it down the toilet."]

[A man complained to his friend "My elbow hurts I better go to the doctor." "Don''t do that," volunteered his friend "there''s a new computer at the drug store that can diagnose any problem quicker and cheaper than a doctor. All you have to do is put in a urine sample, deposit $10, then the computer will give you your diagnosis and plan of treatment."<br /> The man figured he had nothing to lose so he took a sample of urine down to the drug store. Finding the machine, he poured in the urine and deposited the $10. The machine began to buzz and various lights flashed on and off. After a short pause, a slip of paper popped out on which was printed: </p>\n<p>You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water twice a day. Avoid heavy labor. Your elbow will be better in two weeks </p>\n<p>That evening as the man contemplated this breakthrough in medical science, he began to suspect fraud. To test his theory he mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and teenage daughter. To top it all off, he masturbated into the jar. </p>\n<p>He took this concoction down to the drug store, poured it in the machine, and deposited $10. The machine went through the same buzzing and flashing routine as before then printed out the following message: </p>\n<p>Your tap water has lead.<br /> Get a filter.<br /> Your dog has worms.<br /> Give him vitamins.<br /> Your daughter is on drugs.<br /> Get her in rehab.<br /> Your wife is pregnant.<br /> It''s not your baby - get a lawyer.<br /> And if you don''t stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.]

After a series of scathing cross-examinations,<br /> he was looking forward to his examination of yet another witness.</p>\n<p>"Did you actually see the accident?" he asked.</p>\n<p>The witness responded with a polite, "Yes, sir."</p>\n<p>"How far away were you when the accident happened?"</p>\n<p>"I was Thirty-four feet, seven and three quarter�酶惟s inches away from the point<br /> of collision."</p>\n<p>"Thirty-four feet, seven and three quarter inches?" the lawyer asked,<br /> sarcastically, "Do you expect us to believe that your memory is so good, and<br /> your sense of distance is so precise, that months after the accident you can<br /> come into court and give that type of detail?"</p>\n<p>The witness was unphased. "Sir, I had a hunch that some obnoxious, know-it-all<br /> lawyer would ask me the distance, and would try to make it seem like I was lying<br /> if I could not give an exact answer. So I got a tape measure, and measured out<br /> the exact distance."]
[A guy dies and goes to heaven. It''s a slow day for St. Peter, so, upon passing the entrance test, St. Peter says, "I''m not very busy today, why don''t you let me show you around?"The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the offer. St. Peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a huge room full of clocks.The guy asks, "What''s up with these clocks?"St. Peter explains, "Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged."The guy thinks that this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks are going faster than others. He asks why that is?St. Peter explains, "Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds his clock."This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, "What''s the story with that clock?""Oh, that," St. Peter replies, "That''s OJ Simpson''s clock. We decided to use it as a fan."]
[A burglar broke into a house one night. He shined his flashlight around, looking for valuables, and when he picked up a CD player to place in his sack, a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying, "Jesus is watching you."</p>\n<p>He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight out, and froze. When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, promised himself a vacation after the next big score, then clicked the light back on and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard, "Jesus is watching you."</p>\n<p>Freaked out, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot. "Did you say that?" He hissed at the parrot.</p>\n<p>"Yep," the parrot confessed, then squawked, "I''m just trying to warn you."</p>\n<p>The burglar relaxed. "Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?"</p>\n<p>"Moses," replied the bird.</p>\n<p>"Moses?" the burglar laughed. "What kind of stupid people would name a parrot Moses?"</p>\n<p>The bird promptly answered, "Probably the same kind of people that would name a Rotweiller "Jesus"!</p>\n<p>Submitted by Calamjo<br /> Edited by Curtis]
[This American golf fanatic always dreamed of playing at st. Andrews, and<br /> finally got the chance. Going with his wife, they teed off and he proceeded to<br /> play the best game of his life. After 9 holes, he was 5 strokes under par, and<br /> was on cloud nine. On the back nine, he started playing even better, even<br /> getting an eagle on the 16th hole. </p>\n<p>He was so excited that he ended up slicing the shot on the 17th tee, and as he<br /> walked up to it, saw that his ball was behind a small shack for the<br /> groundskeepers. </p>\n<p>Now he started to worry that his score would go up, but his caddy came up to<br /> him and said "sir, this may sound like a tough shot, but if you put it through<br /> that window, the ball should go through the window on the other side, and if<br /> you''re lucky, the ball will roll onto the green. The way you''ve played today, I<br /> think you can make it." </p>\n<p>So the guy takes a look and sees that it''s a tough shot, but possible, so he<br /> tries it. But his shot just misses the window, hit the window frame, and struck<br /> his wife right in the head, killing her instantly. </p>\n<p>Years go by and the man can''t forget that horrible day.

Andrews, and<br /> miraculously, he is playing another stellar game. He starts to feel better about<br /> himself as the round goes on, but when he approaches the 17th hole, he gets so<br /> nervous that he slices his shot to the same damned spot. </p>\n<p>As at his ball lying there behind the shack, his caddy says "sir, the way<br /> you''ve been playing, why not try a trick shot. Some of the other caddies say if<br /> you can get it through that window, it will follow through the one opposite it<br /> and roll onto the green." </p>\n<p>The guy says "are you out of your f*****'' mind?

So off came his shorts, and into the water he went. What a fantastic feeling! He was so engrossed that he did not realise a group of young convent nuns approaching. When he finally did realise, he had run out of time, so he jumped out of the water and pretended to be a statue.

[One day, a large group of people were waiting for the bus at a local Greyhound station. At the front of the line was a very attractive woman dressed in a black business vest, white blouse, leather miniskirt, and high heels. As the bus pulled up and opened the door, she went to board it, but found that her skirt was too tight for her to raise her leg to the required height. Looking around and thinking quickly, she reaches behind her and unzips the zipper on the back of her skirt a little and then tries again. Again, she finds that she cannot maneuver the step, so once more she reaches behind her and unzips her skirt a little more. With a smile, she looks at the bus driver and tries to board again. With disappointment, she finds that she still can''t step that high and so with exasperation and a sigh she unzips her skirt the rest of the way down. To her amazement, her leg still will not reach the bottom step. Finally, a very large Texan behind her gently grabs her by the waist, lifts her up, and places her on the bus. The woman turns to the Texan furious and says, "Who do you think you are to touch my body in that way? I don''t even know you!" Nonplused, the Texan looks at her and replies, "Well, ma''am, after you unzipped my fly I thought we were pretty good friends."]
[The Darwin awards are given to people who have done their best to aid humanity in eliminating (their own) undesirable genes from the human gene pool. </p>\n<p>More Darwin Award Nominees: </p>\n<p>Doctors at Portland''s University Hospital said Wednesday an Oregon man shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive, and will be released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men''s rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous, in Grants Pass, Ore. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Roberts'' right eye. Doctors said had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the a major blood vessel would have cut and Roberts would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Dr. Johnny Delashaw at the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches of brain, with the tip protruding at the rear of his skill, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said had Robert tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself. Roberts admitted afterwards he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts "I feel so dumb about this." No charges have been filed but the Josephine Court District attorney''s office said the initiation stunt is under investigation. </p>\n<p>Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis market.

Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during a party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. "Another man had it in an aquarium, hooked to a battery, and was trying to explode it," Payne said. "It wouldn''t go off and this guy said, ''I''ll show you how to set it off. "He put it in his mouth and bit down. It blew all his teeth off, his tongue and his lips," Payne said. Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday, with extensive facial injuries, according to a spokesman at Charleston Area Medical Division. "I just can''t imagine anyone doing something like that," Payne said. </p>\n<p>O.K.... one more, but that''s it: </p>\n<p>Another true story of a guy in L.A. who was afraid of heights, and had to go up on his roof to adjust his TV antenna. So he tied a rope around himself, and tied the other end to the bumper of his car. Well, he should have told his wife . She went out and got in the car to go to the store. The man was pulled off the roof and dragged down the street before someone alerted the wife to the fact that she had some extra cargo. The man was rushed to the hospital where he spent a couple of weeks recovering, more or less. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the story does not end there. To make amends, the wife planned a little surprise party for her husband the day he returned home. She invited several couples over to enjoy the festivities, most of them smokers. Since the wife and husband smoked too, they had several lighters around the house, and the wife decided to fill them before the guests arrived. To be safe, she took them all into the bathroom and filled them over the toilet. </p>\n<p>Have you guessed yet? Yes, the husband used the bathroom immediately afterward, and threw his cigarette into the toilet while sitting.]

[Dear Tech Support:<br /> Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and<br /> noticed a slow down in the overall performance,<br /> particularly in the flower and jewellery applications that<br /> had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition,<br /> Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such<br /> as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, but installed<br /> undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. and now<br /> Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6<br /> simply crashes the system. I''ve tried running Nagging 5.3<br /> to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? </p>\n<p>Desperate </p>\n<p>******************************************** </p>\n<p>Dear Desperate:<br /> First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment<br /> package,while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try to<br /> enter the command: C:/I THOUGH! T YOU LOVED ME and download<br /> Tears 6.2 to install Guilt 3.0.If all works as designed,<br /> Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications<br /> Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember, overuse can<br /> cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy<br /> Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that<br /> will create Snoring Loudly. WAV files. Whatever you do, DO<br /> NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 or reinstall another<br /> Boyfriend program.<br /> These are not supported applications and will crash Husband<br /> 1.0.<br />      In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited<br /> memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying<br /> additional software to improve memory and performance. I personally recommend<br /> Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 7.7. </p>\n<p>Good Luck,<br /> Tech! Support]
[One day a young fella walked into the golf course club house looking for a<br /> game. The attendant said there was a young lady about to tee off on the first<br /> tee by herself The young fella went out and joined her for 18 holes. When on the<br /> 18th green, the young fella had a 25ft putt for a birdie and the young lady had<br /> a 20ft birdie putt. The young fella was about to putt his 25 footer , when he<br /> stopped and looked up at the young lady and said, "You know, I''ve enjoyed myself<br /> so much today that if I make this 25ft birdie putt, I''ll take you out for<br /> wineing and dining to the best places in town." With that he putts his 25 footer<br /> in for a birdie. The young lady steps up to her 20 ft birdie, stops and says,<br /> "If I make this 20ft birdie putt, that after our wineing and dining, I''ll take<br /> you back to my place for wild times all night." Just as she goes to putt, the<br /> young fella hollers out, "Hold it! Thats a gimme, pick it up!"]

Two boll weevils grew up in South Carolina.  One  went to Hollywood and became a famous actor.   The other stayed behind in the cotton fields and  never amounted to much.  The second one,  naturally, became known as the lesser of two  weevils.  A mushroom walks into a bar, sits down and orders a drink.  The bartender says, ''We don''t serve mushrooms here.''  The mushroom says, ''Why?!  I''m a fun guy!''  A three-legged dog walks into a saloon in the  Old West.  He sidles up to the bar and  announces: ''I''m lookin'' for the man who shot my paw.''  This guy goes into a restaurant for a Christmas  breakfast while in his home town for the  holidays.  After looking over the menu he says,  ''I''ll just have the eggs benedict.'' His order  comes a while later and it''s served on a huge  fancy chrome plate.  He asks the waiter, ''Whats  with the fancy plate?'' The waiter replies,  ''There''s no plate like chrome for the  hollandaise!''  Very early one morning two birds are sitting at  the side of a large puddle of oil. They see a  worm on the other side.  So... the one flies  over and the other one swims through -- which  one gets to the worm first?  The one who swam,  of course, because ''Da oily boid gets da woim.''

[There once was a man who had three girlfriends, and he couldn�酶惟t decide which one to marry. He decided to give five thousand dollars to each woman to see what she would do with it.The first woman bought new clothes for herself. She got an expensive new hairdo, a massage, a facial, a manicure, and a pedicure. She said, I spent the money so that I would look pretty for you because I love you so much.The second woman bought a VCR, a CD player, a set of golf clubs, and a tennis racket and gave them to the man. I used the money to buy you these gifts because I love you, she told him.The third woman invested the money in the stock market and within a short time had doubled her investment. She returned the initial five thousand dollars to the man and reinvested the profit. Im investing in our future because I love you so much, she said.The man carefully considered how each woman had spent the money, and married the woman with the biggest tits.]
[1) "Luke in Bactine Tank" A favorite scene from "Empire"<br /> recreated in miniature, complete with a removable diaper for<br /> Luke. Unfortunately, it was found that the glowing bactine wash<br /> posed a radioactive health hazard for tykes. </p>\n<p>2) "Missile Hand Luke" Luke doll with a special lever on his<br /> back which causes his artificial hand to shoot off at 25 mph.<br /> Manufacturers recalled it when hands started finding their way<br /> into eyeballs, windpipes, and other orifices. </p>\n<p>3) "Exploding Death Star" Potential radiation burn/shrapnel<br /> hazard, which did not keep kids from recreating the scene with<br /> their own "normal" Death Star and a few M-60''s. </p>\n<p>4) "Black Princess Leia" Promoted as competition for Mattel''s<br /> popular "Black Disco Barbie"; did not find expected level of<br /> popularity. </p>\n<p>5) "Incredible Shavable Han Solo" Sprouted real hair; failed<br /> miserably when tested on real kids. </p>\n<p>6) "Dissect An Ewok Kit" The deal was off when Play-doh pulled<br /> out at the last minute. </p>\n<p>7) "Nit-laden Chewbacca" Concept behind this was that kids would<br /> enjoy picking nits off of a large, furry Chewbacca. Didn''t do<br /> well, since it came with real nits which quickly spread to other<br /> parts of the house. </p>\n<p>8) The Ugnaught figures made from Genetically altered mice. PETA<br /> sank that one real quick. </p>\n<p>9) Emperor Palpatine Doll/Tesla Coil. Hey kids, real lightning!<br /> Kill your enemies! Nixed due to obvious danger of children<br /> accidentally running up huge power bills. </p>\n<p>10) Full scale working Death Star Kit. Kenner built one fully<br /> working model, but it was destroyed. They were halfway finished<br /> with their second when it too was destroyed. Plans were scrapped<br /> to build any more. </p>\n<p>11) Darth Vader Funeral Pyre. They couldn''t figure out how to<br /> make a character who had been 4 inches tall and thin into a<br /> character 2.5 inches tall and fat as a slug once you removed his<br /> helmet. Also a problem with the fact that it only worked once. </p>\n<p>12) Aunt Beru doll. Nixed as just plain stupid. A huge loss to<br /> those fans of Bok Choi and blue Kool-aid out there. </p>\n<p>13) "Real-Guts" Tauntaun. Also referred to as "The Visible<br /> Tauntaun." Once you pulled off the skin, you could see all the<br /> internal organs. Much like real tauntauns, it stank to high<br /> heaven. Other problem: Like similar toy "The Visible Man,"<br /> Visible Tauntaun''s organs never went back in right and you were<br /> always left with an extra organ or two. </p>\n<p>14) "Learn the Force At Home" Kit. Included self-hypnosis<br /> training tapes and rocks to lift. Recalled after thousands of<br /> children with no strong parental figure turned to the Dark Side,<br /> killing their parents and saying things like "You are part of<br /> the Rebel Alliance and you did not make me the type of sandwich<br /> that I like!" while strangling them from across the room. </p>\n<p>15) "Fun Fusion Grenade." Seen in the exciting throneroom scene<br /> in Return of the Jedi where a disguised Leia holds it up to<br /> bluff out Jabba the Hutt. Problem was, the kids didn''t<br /> understand the concept of a fusion grenade and would often<br /> actually detonate it while trying to bluff their parents into<br /> extending their bedtime. </p>\n<p>16) "Mr. Hutt-Head." A Mr. Potato Head ripoff which had a Jabba<br /> body and a series of switchable heads with the faces of famous<br /> fat people. See Rush The Hutt, Willard The Hutt, John Candy The<br /> Hutt, etc. Nixed when famous fat people got angry at being<br /> identified with Pizza Hutt. (they just didn''t get it). </p>\n<p>17) Pimp Lando Figure. Lando as a loc-ed out pimp daddy. Long<br /> brown leather coat, straight razor, huge afro, gold tooth, etc.<br /> Actually molded, packaged, and ready to be shipped when the<br /> makers of the Shaft figures sued for copyright infringement. </p>\n<p>18) Dead Admiral Doll. Well, Vader killed so many Admirals in<br /> the three movies that Kenner figured that there should be a<br /> doll. Problem was, he couldn''t be posed and would always fall<br /> over in a heap. Kids decided they could fake it with a normal<br /> Admiral doll and chose not to purchase this no-spined rubbery<br /> thing. </p>\n<p>19) Roller Disco Cloud City Worker. Roller Disco went out of<br /> fashion, so the skakes were cut off and the hair removed, and<br /> thus the figure was converted to Lando''s Pal Lobot with the<br /> weird headphones. </p>\n<p>20) Voices of the Dead Driving Headset. The voice of Ben Kenobi<br /> helps You drive around town. "Watch out for the brown van,<br /> Luke!" "The light is about to turn green, Luke!" Actually a<br /> great help for drivers, but failed on the market due to the fact<br /> that not very many people are named Luke, and no one likes a<br /> back seat driver. </p>\n<p>21) Talking Stormtroopers. Pull a string on their chest and they<br /> would say things like "There''s one, set for stun!" or "Look Sir,<br /> Droids!" During production the voiceboxes got switched with<br /> talking Barbie. The stormtroopers ended up saying things like:<br /> "Gosh, math is so hard!" and "Let''s Go Shopping!" while Barbie<br /> barked out "What do you mean, radiation leak?" </p>\n<p>22) Speaking of Radiation Leaks, the best toy of all: The Death<br /> Star Detention center. Eventually it was toned down to two lame<br /> rooms in the 4-story death star playset, but it was originally<br /> conceived of as a set all to itself, with rooms such as "b*s<br /> communications center" where you try to talk your way out of<br /> tight fixes with such lies as "oh, weapons misfire." The hallway<br /> of harmless light: fifty stormtroopers pump bolts of laser fire<br /> down the hall where you and your four friends have no harm done<br /> to you, even though you have no cover to speak of. The best part<br /> about the detention center was that it included some cool dolls:<br /> "torture/interrogation droid," "giggling Moff Tarkin doll," and<br /> "flayed flesh Leia," not to mention "stupid gullible guard"<br /> doll. Eventually stopped by Kenner brass who noticed that<br /> playtesting kids were getting a little too into the torture<br /> room. Fearful of breeding a generation of Salvadorean Death<br /> Squads, they pulled the plug on this toy.]

We all need companionship."</p>\n<p>"If I died and you remarried," the wife asks, "would she live in this house?" "We''ve spent a lot of money getting this house just the way we want it.

[Three guys found themselves in Hell: we will call them Carl, Bob, and Brett, they were a little confused at their present situation, and they were startled to see a door in the wall open, and behind the door was perhaps the ugliest woman they had ever seen. She was 3''4", dirty, and you could smell her even over the Brimstone. The voice of the Devil was heard, "Brett, you have sinned! You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this woman!" And Brett was whisked through the door by a group of lesser demons to his torment. This understandably shook up the other two, and so they both jumped when a second door opened, and they saw an even more disgusting example of womanhood gone wrong. She was over 7'' tall, monstrous, covered in thick black hair,and flies circled her. The voice of the Devil was heard, "Carl, you have sinned! You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this woman!" And Carl, like Brett, was whisked off. Bob, now alone, felt understandably anxious, and feared the worst when the third door opened. And as the door inched open, he strained to see the figure of ... Cindy Crawford. Delighted, Bob jumped up, taking in the sight of this beautiful woman, dressed in a skimpy bikini. Then he heard the voice of the Devil saying:"Cindy, you have sinned."]
[Democrats buy most of the books that have been banned somewhere. Republicans form censorship committees and read them as a group. Democrats give their worn out clothes to those less fortunate. Republicans wear theirs. Democrats name their children after currently popular sports figures, politicians, and entertainers. Republican children are named after their parents or grandparents, according to where the money is. Republicans tend to keep their shades drawn, although there is seldom any reason why they should. Democrats ought to, but don''t. Republican boys date Democratic girls. They plan to marry Republican girls, but feel that they''re entitled to a little fun first. Democrats make plans and then do something else. Republicans follow the plans their grandfathers made.

[One day, a man complained to his friend, "My elbow really hurts, guess I should see a doctor." </p>\n<p>His friend said, "Don''t do that. There''s a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. And it only costs $10.00." </p>\n<p>The guy figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise andvarious lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read:<br /> You have tennis elbow.<br /> Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor.<br /> It will be better in two weeks. </p>\n<p>That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this computer could be fooled. </p>\n<p>He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in thisample and deposited the $10.00. The machine again made the usual noises,flashedlights, and printed out the following analysis:<br /> Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.<br /> Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.<br /> Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> Your wife is pregnant....twin girls. They aren''t yours.

[Grandma writes:The other day I went to the local religious book store where I saw a "Honk if you really love Jesus" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car and I''m really glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed.I was stopped at the light of a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn''t notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must really love the Lord because pretty soon he leaned out his window and yelled, "Jesus Christ!" as loud as he could. Why, it was like a football game with him shouting, "Go, Jesus Christ, Go"! Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and I saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I had recently asked my two grandsons what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed, and I stepped on the gas. It''s a good thing I did, because I was the only car to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned out the window, gave them a big smile, and held up the Hawaiian Good Luck sign as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks!Love ya all,Grandma]

[Let''s say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else.<br /> And then, one evening when they''re driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: "Do you realize that, as of tonight, we''ve been seeing each other for exactly six months?" </p>\n<p>And then there is silence in the car. </p>\n<p>To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he''s been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I''m trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn''t want, or isn''t sure of. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I''m not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I''d have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward... I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person? </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: ...so that means it was... let''s see... February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer''s, which means... lemme check the odometer... Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I''m reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed-even before I sensed it-that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that''s it. That''s why he''s so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He''s afraid of being rejected. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: And I''m gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don''t care what those morons say, it''s still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It''s 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s angry. And I don''t blame him. I''d be angry too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can''t help the way I feel. I''m just not sure. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: They''ll probably say it''s only a 90-day warranty........scumbags. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: Maybe I''m just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I''m sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I''ll give them a warranty. I''ll take their warranty and stick it right up their... </p>\n<p>"Roger," Elaine says aloud. </p>\n<p>"What?" says Roger, startled. </p>\n<p>"Please don''t torture yourself like this," she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. "Maybe I should never have... Oh God, I feel so..." (She breaks down, sobbing.) </p>\n<p>"What?" says Roger. </p>\n<p>"I''m such a fool," Elaine sobs. "I mean, I know there''s no knight. I really know that. It''s silly. There''s no knight, and there''s no horse." </p>\n<p>"There''s no horse?" says Roger. </p>\n<p>"You think I''m a fool, don''t you?" Elaine says. </p>\n<p>"No!" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer. </p>\n<p>"It''s just that... it''s that I... I need some time," Elaine says. </p>\n<p>(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.) "Yes," he says. </p>\n<p>(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.) "Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?" she says. </p>\n<p>"What way?" says Roger. </p>\n<p>"That way about time," says Elaine. </p>\n<p>"Oh," says Roger. "Yes." </p>\n<p>(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.) </p>\n<p>"Thank you, Roger," she says. </p>\n<p>"Thank you," says Roger. </p>\n<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it''s better if he doesn''t think about it. </p>\n<p>The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine''s, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: "Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?" </p>\n<p>And that''s the difference between men and women.]

[I. DOORS: Do not allow closed doors in any room. To get door opened, stand on hind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is opened, it is not necessary to use it. After you have ordered an "outside" door opened, stand halfway in and out and think about several things. This is particularly important during very cold weather, rain, snow, or mosquito season. Swinging doors are to be avoided at all costs. </p>\n<p>II. CHAIRS AND RUGS: If you have to throw up, get to a chair quickly. If you cannot manage in time, get to an Oriental rug. If there is no Oriental rug, shag is good. When throwing up on the carpet, make sure you back up so that it is as long as the human''s bare foot. </p>\n<p>III. BATHROOMS: Always accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not necessary to do anything -- just sit and stare. </p>\n<p>IV. HAMPERING: If one of your humans is engaged in some close activity and the other is idle, stay with the busy one. This is called "helping", otherwise known as "hampering". Following are the rules for "hampering":<br /> a) When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook. You cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on and then picked up and comforted.<br /> b) For book readers, get in close under the chin, between eyes and book, unless you can lie across the book itself.<br /> c) For knitting projects or paperwork, lie on the work in the most appropriate manner so as to obscure as much of the work or at least the most important part. Pretend to doze, but every so often reach out and slap the pencil or knitting needles. The worker may try to distract you; ignore it. Remember, the aim is to hamper work. Embroidery and needlepoint projects make great hammocks in spite of what the humans may tell you.<br /> d) For people paying bills (monthly activity) or working on income taxes or Christmas cards (annual activity), keep in mind the aim -- to hamper! First, sit on the paper being worked on. When dislodged, watch sadly from the side of the table. When activity proceeds nicely, roll around on the papers, scattering them to the best of your ability. After being removed for the second time, push pens, pencils, and erasers off the table, one at a time.<br /> e) When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him/her, be sure to jump on the back of the paper. They love to jump. </p>\n<p>V. WALKING: As often as possible, dart quickly and as close as possible in front of the human, especially: on stairs, when they have something in their arms, in the dark, and when they first get up in the morning.

[While walking down the street one day, a Republican head of state is tragically hit by a truck and dies. His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. </p>\n<p>"Welcome to Heaven," says St. Peter. "Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we''re not sure what to do with you."</p>\n<p>"No problem, just let me in." says the Republican.</p>\n<p>"Well, I''d like to but I have orders from higher up.   What we''ll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity."</p>\n<p>"Really, I''ve made up my mind. I want to be in Heaven," says the Republican head of state.</p>\n<p>"I''m sorry but we have our rules." And with that, St. Peter escorts the Republican to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course.   In the distance is a club and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him, everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, hug him, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at expense of the people.   They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar. Also present is the Devil (a Republican, too), who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes.</p>\n<p>They are having such a good time that, before he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator<br /> rises. The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.</p>\n<p>"Now it''s time to visit Heaven." So 24 hours pass with the Republican head of state joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.</p>\n<p>"Well then, you''ve spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now choose your eternity."</p>\n<p>He reflects for a minute, then the head of state answers: "Well, I would never have thought it, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in Hell."</p>\n<p>So Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. The Devil comes over to the Republican and lays an arm on his neck.</p>\n<p>"I don''t understand," stammers the Republican head of state.

[Here''s Martha Stewart''s Etiquette Guide for Rednecks!</p>\n<p>1. Never take a beer to a job interview.<br /> 2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.<br /> 3. It''s considered tacky to take a cooler to church.<br /> 4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.<br /> 5. Even if you''re certain that you are included in the will, it is still considered tacky to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home.<br /> ***************************</p>\n<p>DINING OUT</p>\n<p>1. When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup,and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine.<br /> 2.

A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist.<br /> 2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table...no matter how good his manners are.<br /> ***********************</p>\n<p>PERSONAL HYGIENE</p>\n<p>1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one''s OWN truck keys.<br /> 2. Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days. However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of good money.<br /> 3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman''s jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.<br /> ****************</p>\n<p>DATING (Outside the Family)</p>\n<p>1.

[When you''re 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: "Just because you''ve reached middle age, that doesn''t mean you shouldn''t take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it."</p>\n<p>This is the voice of Satan.</p>\n<p>I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales.</p>\n<p>I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. "I''ll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets" is a typical breakfast order for me these days.</p>\n<p>This is because I went snowboarding.</p>\n<p>For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough.</p>\n<p>These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, "Cool."</p>\n<p>People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together.</p>\n<p>We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill).</p>\n<p>If anybody asks if you''re OK, you say, "I''m just catching my breath!" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you''re going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you''re planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw.</p>\n<p>At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance.</p>\n<p>So I thought I''d take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing.</p>\n<p>In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range.</p>\n<p>Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can''t stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you.</p>\n<p>Skiers hate snowboarders. It''s a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc.</p>\n<p>Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd.</p>\n<p>I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope.</p>\n<p>Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who''s going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete.</p>\n<p>You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.)</p>\n<p>We learned snowboarding via a two step method:</p>\n<p>STEP ONE: Watching Brad do something.</p>\n<p>STEP TWO: Trying to do it ourselves.</p>\n<p>I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics.</p>\n<p>I''d struggle to my feet, and I''d be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot.</p>\n<p>"Keep your knees bent!" Brad would yell, helpfully.</p>\n<p>Have you noticed that whatever sport you''re trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if THAT would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, "FORGET MY KNEES! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE GRAVITY CHUNKS!"</p>\n<p>Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me.</p>\n<p>If I hadn''t gotten out of there, they''d have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding.</p>\n<p>So I think, when my body heals, I''ll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you''ll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.]

[The Reverend John Fuzz was pastor of a small congregation in a little Pennsylvania town. One day he was walking down Main Street and he happened to notice a female member of his congregation sitting in the town bar, drinking beer. The reverend thought this was sinful and not something a member of his congregation should do, so he walked through the open door of the bar and sat down next to the woman."Mrs. Fitzgerald," the reverend said sternly. "This is no place for a member of my congregation. Why don''t you let me take you home?" "Shure," she said with a slur, obviously very drunk.When Mrs. Fitzgerald stood up from the bar, she began to weave back and forth. The reverend realised that she had had too much to drink and he grabbed hold of her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance and tumbled to the floor. After rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lying on top of Mrs. Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist.The bartender looked over the bar and said, "Here, here, buddy, we won''t have any of that carrying on in this bar."The reverend looked up at the bartender and said, "But you don''t understand, I''m Pastor Fuzz."The bartender nodded. "Well if you''re that far you may as well finish."]

[A blind man was describing his favorite sport - parachuting. When asked how this was accomplished, he said that things were all done for him. �酶惟I am placed in the door and told when to jump. My hand is placed on my release ring for me, and out I go.�酶惟 "But how do you know when you are going to land?" he was asked.

[After Quasimodo''s death, the bishop of the Cathedral of Notre Dame sent word through the streets of Paris that a new bellringer was needed. The bishop decided that he would conduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to begin the screening process. After observing several applicants demonstrate their skills, he had decided to call it a day - when an armless man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the bell ringer''s job.The bishop was incredulous.  "You have no arms!""No matter," said the man, "observe!"  He then began striking the bells with his face, producing a beautiful melody on the carillon.  The bishop listened in astonishment, convinced that he had finally found a suitable replacement for Quasimodo.Suddenly, rushing forward to strike a bell, the armless man tripped and plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death in the street below.The stunned bishop rushed to his side.  When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moments before.As they silently parted to let the bishop through, one of them asked, "Bishop, who was this man?""I don''t know his name," the bishop sadly replied, "but his face rings a bell."The following day, despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist, the bishop continued his interviews for the bell ringer of Notre Dame.The first man to approach him said, "Your Excellency, I am the brother of the poor armless wretch that fell to his death from this very belfry yesterday.  I pray that you honor his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty."The bishop agreed to give the man an audition, and, as the armless man''s brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell, he groaned, clutched at his chest and died on the spot.  Two monks, hearing the bishop''s cries of grief at this second tragedy, rushed up the stairs to his side. "What has happened?" the first asked, breathlessly. "Who is this man?""I don''t know his name," sighed the distraught bishop, "but he''s a dead ringer for his brother."]

[Forwarded from a guy at MIT who knows this guy at WPI. Story confirmed by a co-employee who graduated from MIT. Unfortunately we don''t have an e-dress for Mikey to  REALLY confirm this, but then, who would make THIS up?   ;-)                       -------------------------And so I get back to school, start my senior year, two research projects, grad school applications, GRE preparation, and the like. The year started off good, but that all changed about two months ago. Some of you (especially those at Berkeley) may have heard rumors of some bizarre accident that I was involved in. So here is the truth, unabridged, for those of you who actually want to know...Around the second week of school, the society of physics students held a roughly annual welcome back party, and, as tradition dictates, we made our own ice cream with liquid nitrogen (77 K) as a refrigerant and aerator.Things were going fine for a while. We spilled a little of the nitrogen onto a table, and watched tiny little drops of it dance around. Then someone asked, ''why does it do that?''That may have been the point of no return. I, as is traditionally my role, answered that the nitrogen evaporates at the surface of the table, which provides a cushion of air for the drop to sit on, and thermally insulates the drop to minimize further evaporation. So you see a drop dance around without boiling away, and without interacting with the table and getting slowed down or smeared out. Then, I continued...I mentioned that the same principle makes it possible to dip a wet hand into molten lead, or to drink liquid nitrogen without injury.I had done the latter several years earlier in a cryogenics lab, and remembered the physics behind how it worked. Naturally, people around me were skeptical. ''You can''t drink the stuff... it''ll freeze your whole body... remember terminator 2?'' but I was sure of myself. I had done it before, and I believed in the physics behind it. So, naturally, I poured myself a glass and took a shot. Simple: Swallow, blow smoke out nose and mouth and impress everyone at the party.Within about two seconds, I had collapsed to the floor, unable to breathe or feel anything other than intense pain.Ambulance arrives. Police arrive. Trip to hospital. Admission. Try to explain to ER staff exactly how something like this happens. Then I pass out.I wake up next morning connected to many machines, some beeping, others performing more important functions like digesting my food and breathing for me.Turns out that, in accordance with popular belief, you really should not drink the stuff. I eventually learned a few things about liquid nitrogen. Like... while you can safely put it in your mouth, and blow neat smoke patterns, you should never ever ever swallow. First off, the closing of the epiglottis prevents the nitrogen gas from escaping, so it is forced into your body instead. Second, your esophagus naturally constricts around anything inside it, so, even if there is a thin protective gas layer, the esophagus will find a way to make contact with the liquid nitrogen.Also turns out that my memory was flawed. When I had done it six years ago, I put it into my mouth and didn''t swallow. Over time, that fineline between parlor trick and near fatal accident must have blurred.So... the consequences... my entire upper GI tract, from epiglottis to the bottom of the stomach was badly burned, scarred, and perforated. The gas also expanded quite a bit while inside my body. It filled my chest cavity with several liters of nitrogen gas, which was under enough presuure to collapse a lung. So after what I''m told was a grueling all night surgery, they removed part of my stomach, and had my entire digestive system, top to bottom, running on machine power for a while. I also had a breather for the first day or so, until my lung was restored. There are a few details which are considerably uglier which I will spare you.So... the recovery... they were impressed with my recuperative skills. I could breathe on my own completely after a few days. I could sit up in bed after a week, and was walking in two. About that time, I began to eat again as well. After four weeks, I was up and about again. Now, something like eight weeks, I''m virtually healed, with the exception of a number of unsightly scars.But.... the good news is that I am the first documented medical case of a cryogenic ingestion. Read the new england journal of medicine. Three articles are in review now, and will be published soon, I''m told. These days, my little adventure leaves me with bad jokes at physics department meetings, and the occasional blurb in the school paper. ''Make Mikey drink it. Mikey likes it.'' I''ve also picked up the nickname''Nitro-Mike,'' which is somehow supposed to sound cool, because it conjures up images of nitro-glycerin, which implies I''m a bad mother. I don''t buy it.If any of you guys have heard a variation on this story, let me know. I''m always curious to hear how these things sound third and fourth hand. I was on a follow-up visit to the hospital, and I mentioned to one of the nurses that I go to WPI. And he said that he heard about some kid from WPI who broke into a lab in the middle of the night and stole some liquid nitrogen to try and get high. Then, as the story goes, by the time he gets to the hospital, he''s in pretty bad shape. His lower jaw has to be amputated, as well as his tongue. He can never eat solid foods again, and also has a ''bag,'' if you know what I mean. I didn''t have the heart to tell this guy the truth, because the story was so good at that point.So, that, in a nutshell, is what''s happened to me. Nowadays, I''m back to my normal self... school, thesis work, grad apps, playing music, talking on the radio, and suffering over women.So here I am.Michael]

[One day, a man came home from work very anxious to tell his wife something. He tells her that his boss has premoted him to a higher placement in his company, and that his boss invited him and his wife to play golf in a few weeks. The wife replied that she didn''t know how to play golf, so her husband signed her up for lessons. So the following week, she went to her first lesson. The insructor explained the way that she was supposed to stand and what position would be best for her. Then he tried to show her how to handle the club, it wasn''t working out very well, so he told her to pretend that the club was her husband''s manhood. At the end of the lesson the instructor said this, "Ma''am, you did very well for your first lesson, but next week let''s try to keep the club out of your mouth."]
[Dear Tech Support: </p>\n<p>I am desperate for some help. I recently upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that the new program began unexpected child processing and also took up a lot of space and valuable resources. This wasn''t mentioned in the product brochure. </p>\n<p>In addition Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialisation where it monitors all other system activity. </p>\n<p>Applications such as Boys Night Out 2.5, and Golf 5.3 no longer run and crash the system whenever selected. Attempting to operate Sunday Football 6.3 always fails but Saturday Shopping 7.1 runs instead. I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background whilst attempting to run any of my favourite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0 but de-install doesn''t work on this program. </p>\n<p>Can you please help!<br /> Joe. </p>\n<p>Dear Joe, </p>\n<p>This is a very common problem resulting from a basic misunderstanding. </p>\n<p>Many men upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 thinking that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT program. Whereas Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM designed by its creator to run everything. </p>\n<p>You are unlikely to be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0 as Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this and it is impossible to de-install, delete or purge the program files from the system once installed. </p>\n<p>Some people have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0, but have<br /> ended up with even more problems. (See in manual under Alimony/Child Support and Solicitors Fees). Having Wife 1.0 installed myself I recommend you keep it installed and deal with the difficulties as best you can. </p>\n<p>When any faults or problems occur, whatever you think has caused them, you must run the C: IAPOLOGISE program and avoid attempting to use the *Esc-key. It may be necessary to run C: I APOLOGISE a number of times, but hopefully eventually the operating system will return to normal. </p>\n<p>Wife 1.0 although a very high maintenance program can be very rewarding. To get the most out of it consider buying additional software such as Flowers 2.0 and Chocolates 5.0. </p>\n<p>Do not under any circumstances install Secretary (Short Skirt version) as this is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and the system will almost certainly crash. </p>\n<p>Best of luck!<br /> Tech Support]

[I took some clients out to dinner last week, and I noticed a spoon in the shirt pocket of our waiter as he handed us the menus. It seemed a little odd, but I dismissed it as a random thing. Until our busboy came with water and tableware; he too, sported a spoon in his breast pocket. I looked around the room, and all the waiters and busboys had spoons in their pockets. When our waiter returned to take our order, I just had to ask, "Why the spoons?""Well," he explained, "our parent company recently hired some Andersen Consulting efficiency experts to review all our procedures, and after months of statistical analyses, they concluded that our patrons drop spoons on the floor 73% more often than any other utensil, at a frequency of 3 spoons per hour per workstation. By preparing our workers for this contingency in advance, we can cut our trips to the kitchen down and save time... nearly 1.5 extra man-hours per shift." Just as he concluded, a "ch-ching" came from the table behind him, and he quickly replaced the fallen spoon with the one from his pocket."I''ll grab another spoon the next time I''m in the kitchen instead of making a special trip," he proudly explained.I was impressed. "Thanks, I had to ask.""No problem," he answered. Then he continued to take our orders. As the members of our dinner party took their turns, my eyes darted back and forth from each person ordering and my menu. That''s when, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a thin black thread protruding from our waiter''s fly. Again, I dismissed it; yet I had to scan the room and, sure enough, there were other waiters and busboys with strings hanging out of their trousers. My curiosity overrode discretion at this point, so before he could leave I had to ask. "Excuse me, but...uh...why, or what about that string?""Oh, yeah," he began, in a quieter tone, "not many people are that observant. That same efficiency group found we could save time in the Men''s Room, too.""How''s that?" I asked."You see, by tying a string to the end of our, uh, selves, we can pull it out at the urinals literally hands-free and thereby eliminate the need to wash our hands, cutting time spent in the washroom by over 93%!""Hey, wait a minute. If the string helps you pull it out, how do you get it back in?""Well," he whispered, "I don''t know about the other guys, but I use the spoon."]

[It''s your first time. As you lie back your muscles tighten.  You put him<br /> off for awhile searching for an excuse, but he refuses to be swayed as<br /> he<br /> approaches you.  He asks if you''re afraid and you shake your head<br /> bravely.<br /> He has more experience, but it is the first time his finger has found<br /> the<br /> right place.  He probes deeply and you shiver: your body tenses, but<br /> he''s<br /> gentle like he promised he''d be!  He looks deeply into your eyes and<br /> tells you to trust him ---- he''s done this many times before.  His cool<br /> smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him more room for any easy<br /> entrance.   You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, but he goes very<br /> slowly, wanting to cause you as little pain as possible.  As he presses<br /> closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue give way; pain surges through-<br /> out your body and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues.<br /> He looks concerned and asks you if it''s too painful.... Your eyes are<br /> filled with tears but you shake your head and nod for him to go on.  He<br /> begins moving in and out with skill but you are now to numb to feel him<br /> within you.  After a few frenzied moments, you feel something bursting<br /> within you and he pulls it out of you.  You lay panting, glad to have it<br /> over.  He looks at you and smiling warmly, tells you, with a chuckle,<br /> that<br /> and thank your dentist.  After all, it was your first time to have a<br /> tooth<br /> pulled!]

[1. Never take a beer to a job interview. </p>\n<p>2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them. </p>\n<p>3. It''s considered tacky to take a cooler to church. </p>\n<p>4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets. </p>\n<p>5. Even if you''re certain that you are included in the will, it is still considered tacky to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home. </p>\n<p>DINING OUT </p>\n<p>1. When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup, and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine. </p>\n<p>2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your fingers covering the label. </p>\n<p>ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME </p>\n<p>1.

[The 5 toughest questions women ask - and their answers</p>\n<p>The five questions are:<br /> 1 - "What are you thinking?"<br /> 2 - "Do you love me?"<br /> 3 - "Do I look fat?"<br /> 4 - "Do you think she is prettier than me?"<br /> 5 - "What would you do if I died?"</p>\n<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is<br /> guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if<br /> the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly.<br /> For example:</p>\n<p>1 - "What are you thinking?" The proper answer to this question,<br /> of course, is, "I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just<br /> reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful,<br /> intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am<br /> to have met you."<br /> Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what<br /> the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely<br /> one of five things:<br /> a - Baseball<br /> b - Football<br /> c - How fat you are.<br /> d - How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid<br /> question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was<br /> asked it by his wife, Peg. "If I wanted you to know," Al said,<br /> "I''d be talking instead of thinking."</p>\n<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many<br /> wrong answers:</p>\n<p>2 - "Do you love me?" The correct answer to this question is,<br /> "Yes." For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you<br /> may answer, "Yes, dear. Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I suppose so.<br /> b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes.<br /> c - That depends on what you mean by "love".<br /> d - Does it matter?<br /> e - Who, me?</p>\n<p>3 - "Do I look fat?" The correct male response to this question<br /> is to confidently and emphatically state, "No, of course not" and<br /> then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either.<br /> b - Compared to what?<br /> c - A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d - I''ve seen fatter.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your<br /> insurance policy.</p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she''s prettier than me?" The "she" in the<br /> question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were<br /> starring at so hard thay you almost cause a traffic accident or<br /> an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct<br /> response is, "No, you are much prettier." Wrong answers include:<br /> a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.<br /> b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things.<br /> c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.<br /> d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your<br /> insurance policy.</p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?" Correct answer: "Dearest love,<br /> in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have<br /> meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front<br /> tires of the first Domino''s Pizza truck that came my way." This<br /> might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by<br /> the following stupid joke:</p>\n<p>"Dear," said the wife. "What would you do if I died?"<br /> "Why, dear, I would be extremely upset," said the husband. "Why<br /> do you ask such a question?"<br /> "Would you remarry?" persevered the wife.<br /> "No, of couse not, dear" said the husband.<br /> "Don''t you like being married?" said the wife.<br /> "Of course I do, dear" he said.<br /> "Then why wouldn''t you remarry?"<br /> "Alright," said the husband, "I''d remarry."<br /> "You would?" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt.<br /> "Yes" said the husband.<br /> "Would you sleep with her in our bed?" said the wife after a long<br /> pause.<br /> "Well yes, I suppose I would." replied the husband.<br /> "I see," said the wife indignantly." And would you let her wear<br /> my old clothes?"<br /> "I suppose, if she wanted to" said the husband.<br /> "Really," said the wife icily. "And would you take down the<br /> pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?"<br /> "Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do."<br /> "Is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet. "And I suppose<br /> you''d let her play with my golf clubs, too."<br /> "Of course not, dear," said the husband. "She is left-handed."]

[Robert A. Chase, 45, was charged with threatening an 11-year-old boy with a<br /> knife in Madison, Wis. The boy was watching Chase play basketball with another<br /> adult when the opponent accused Chase of "traveling" (taking steps without<br /> dribbling the ball). To seek an impartial opinion, Chase asked the boy, but the<br /> boy agreed that Chase had traveled. Chase then allegedly grabbed the boy, held a<br /> knife to his throat, and asked, "Now. Did I travel?"]
[Why did the chicken cross the road?</p>\n<p>Deregulation of the chicken''s side of the road was threatening its<br /> dominant market position. The chicken was faced with significant<br /> challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly<br /> competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partnering relationship<br /> with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical<br /> distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry<br /> Integration Model (PIM) Andersen helped the chicken use its skills,<br /> methodologies, knowledge capital and experiences to align the chicken''s<br /> people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy<br /> within a Program Management framework. Andersen Consulting convened a<br /> diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens along with<br /> Andersen consultants with deep skills in the transportation industry to<br /> engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their<br /> personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them<br /> to synergize with each other in order to achievethe implicit goals of<br /> delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an<br /> enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry<br /> cross-median processes.  The meeting was held in a park like setting<br /> enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically<br /> based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear, and unified<br /> market message and aligned with the chicken''s mission, vision, and core<br /> values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total business<br /> integration solution. Andersen Consulting helped the chicken change to<br /> become more successful.</p>\n<p>I hope that this will finally answer the question and end all the<br /> controversy surrounding it once and for all.]

[The Pope met with the College of Cardinals to discuss a proposal from Shimon Peres, the former leader of Israel. "Your holiness," said one of the Cardinals, "Mr. Peres wants to determine whether Jews or Catholics are superior, by challenging you to a golf match." The Pope was greatly disturbed, as he had never held a golf club in his life. "Not to worry," said the Cardinal, "we''ll call America and talk to Jack Nicklaus. We''ll make him a Cardinal, he can play Shimon Peres... We can''t lose!" Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made and, of course, Jack was honored and agreed to play. The day after the match, Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the Pope of his success in the match. "I came in second, your Holiness," said Nicklaus. "Second?!!" exclaimed the surprised Pope. "You came in second to Shimon Peres?!!" "No," said Nicklaus, "second to Rabbi Woods."]

[25 Differences Between College And High School </p>\n<p>In high school, you do homework. In college, you study. </p>\n<p>No food is allowed in the hall in high school. In college, food must be provided at an event before students will come. </p>\n<p>In high school, you wear your backpack on one shoulder. In college, on both. </p>\n<p>In college, the professors can tell you the answer without looking at the teacher''s guide. </p>\n<p>In college, there are no tardy slips. </p>\n<p>In high school, you have to live with your parents. In college, you get to live with your friends. </p>\n<p>In college, you don''t have to wait in a certain lunch line to be cool. </p>\n<p>Only nerds e-mailed in high school. (Cool kids hadn''t heard of it.) </p>\n<p>In high school, you''re told what classes to take. In college, you get to choose. That is, as long as the classes don''t conflict and you have the prerequisites and the classes aren''t closed and you''ve paid your tuition. </p>\n<p>In high school, if you screw up you can usually sweet-talk your way out of it. In college, you''re lucky to ever talk with the professor. </p>\n<p>In high school, fire drills are planned by the administration. In college, by the drunk frat boys on their way home when the bars close. </p>\n<p>In college, any test consists of a larger percentage of your grade than your high school final exams ever did. </p>\n<p>In high school, when the teacher said, "Good morning," you mumbled back. In college, when the professor says, "Good morning," you write it down. </p>\n<p>In high school, freshman guys hit on senior girls. In college, senior guys hit on freshman girls. </p>\n<p>In college, weekends start on Thursday. </p>\n<p>In college, it''s much more difficult to figure out the course schedule of the man/woman you have a crush on, in order to figure out where he/she will be walking around campus and at what time to find them there. </p>\n<p>Once you''ve obtained the information described in #16, it''s much more time-consuming to run between classes to that place where you know he/she will be in order to "just happen to bump into him/her." </p>\n<p>In college, there''s no one to tell you not to eat pizza three meals a day. </p>\n<p>In college, your dad doesn''t pay for dates. </p>\n<p>In high school, it never took 3 or 4 weeks to get money from Mom and Dad. </p>\n<p>College men are cuter than high school boys (or college woman are developed). </p>\n<p>College women are legal. </p>\n<p>In college, when you miss a class (or two or three), you don''t need a note from your parents saying you were skip....uh, sick that day. </p>\n<p>In high school, you can''t go out to lunch because it''s not allowed. In college, you can''t go out to lunch because you can''t afford it. </p>\n<p>In college, you can blow off studying by writing lists like this.]
[It was graduation night at Cox High School and they were about halfway through the ceremony when the principal said, "Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a problem, Bubba is a few credits short and won''t be able to graduate tonight."Well now, Bubba was the starting right guard for Cox''s football team, and when the student body heard that he wasn''t going to graduate, they all jumped up and started to chant, "Give Bubba another chance, give Bubba another chance!"Pat Dye and the principal had a quick conference and afterward, the principal announced that they have decided to give Bubba another chance. Bubba is told that he will be given a "One Question" math test and if he passes, he can graduate.The question is, "What is 2 plus 3?" Bubba thinks for about 20 minutes and finally says, "I have it! The answer is 5!"There is complete silence in the auditorium for a couple of seconds and then the entire Cox High School football team jumps up and begins to chant, "Give Bubba one more chance. Give Bubba one more Chance!"]
[It''s a beautiful, warm spring morning and a man and his wife are spending the day at the zoo. She''s wearing a cute, loose-fitting, pink spring dress, sleeveless with straps. He''s wearing his normal jeans and a T-shirt. The zoo is not very busy this morning.As they walk through the ape exhibit, they pass in front of a very large hairy gorilla. Noticing the girl, the gorilla goes ape. (No pun intended)He jumps up on the bars, and holding on with one hand (and 2 feet), he grunts and pounds his chest with his free hand. He is obviously excited at the pretty lady in the wavy dress.The husband, noticing the excitement, thinks this is funny. He suggests that his wife teases the poor fellow some more. The husband suggests she pucker her lips, wiggle her bottom at him, and play along.She does, and Mr. Gorilla gets even more excited, making noises that would wake the dead.Then the husband suggests that she let one of her straps fall to show a little more skin.She does, and Mr. Gorilla is about to tear the bars down."Now try lifting your dress up your thighs and sort of fan it at him." he says.... this drives the gorilla absolutely crazy and now he''s doing flips.Then the husband grabs his wife by the hair, rips open the door to the cage, flings her in with the gorilla and slams the cage door shut."Now, tell HIM you have a headache."]

[From the Geek:</p>\n<p>1. When IT say they''re coming right over, log out and go for<br /> coffee. It''s no problem for us to remember 700 network passwords.</p>\n<p>2. When you call us to have your computer moved, be sure to<br /> leave it buried under half a ton of postcards, baby pictures,<br /> stuffed animals, dried flowers, bowling trophies and children''s<br /> art. We don''t have a life, and we find it deeply moving to catch<br /> a fleeting glimpse of yours.</p>\n<p>3. When IT send you an e-mail with high importance, delete it at<br /> once. We''re probably just testing out the public groups.</p>\n<p>4. When an IT professional is eating lunch at his desk, walk<br /> right in and spill your guts out and expect him to respond<br /> immediately. We exist only to serve and are always ready to<br /> think about fixing computers.</p>\n<p>5. When an IT professional is at the water cooler or outside<br /> having a smoke, ask him a computer question. The only reason why<br /> we drink water or smoke at all is to ferret out all those users<br /> who don''t have email or a telephone line.</p>\n<p>6. Send urgent email ALL IN UPPERCASE. The mail server picks it<br /> up and flags it as a rush delivery.</p>\n<p>7. When you call a helpdesk engineer''s direct line rather than<br /> the helpdesk number, press 5 to skip the greeting that says he''s<br /> on holiday for a week, record your message, and wait exactly 24<br /> hours before you send an email straight to the director because<br /> no one ever returned your call. You''re entitled to common<br /> courtesy.</p>\n<p>8. When the photocopier doesn''t work, call computer support.<br /> There''s electronics in it, right?</p>\n<p>9. When you''re getting a NO DIAL TONE message at home, call the<br /> helpdesk. We can even fix telephone problems from here.</p>\n<p>10. When something''s wrong with your home PC, dump it on a chair<br /> in IT. Leave no name, no phone number, and no description of the<br /> problem. We love a good mystery.</p>\n<p>11. When you have a helpdesk engineer on the phone walking you<br /> through changing a setting; read the paper. We don''t actually<br /> mean for you to DO anything; we just love to hear ourselves talk.</p>\n<p>12. When we offer you training on the upcoming OS upgrade, don''t<br /> bother. We''ll be there to hold your hand after it is done.</p>\n<p>13. When the printer won''t print, re-send the job at least 20<br /> times. Print jobs frequently just disappear into the cosmos for<br /> no reason.</p>\n<p>14. When the printer still won''t print after 20 tries, send the<br /> job to all 68 printers in the office. One of them is bound to<br /> work.</p>\n<p>15. Don''t use online help. Online help is for wimps.</p>\n<p>16. If you''re taking night classes in computer science, feel<br /> free to go around and update the network drivers for yourself<br /> and your co-workers. We''re grateful for the overtime when we<br /> have to stay until 2:30am fixing them.</p>\n<p>17. When you have an IT bod fixing your computer at a quarter to<br /> one, eat your lunch in his face. We function better when<br /> slightly dizzy .</p>\n<p>18. Don''t ever thank us. We love this AND we get paid for it!</p>\n<p>19. When a helpdesk engineer asks you whether you''ve installed<br /> any new software on this computer, lie. It''s nobody''s business<br /> what you''ve got on your computer.</p>\n<p>20. If the mouse cable keeps knocking down the framed picture of<br /> your dog, lift the computer and stuff the cable under it. Mouse<br /> cables were designed to have 45 lbs. of computer sitting on top<br /> of them.</p>\n<p>21. If the space bar on your keyboard doesn''t work, blame it on<br /> the network/mail upgrade. Keyboards work much better with half a<br /> pound of muffin crumbs, nail clippings, and big sticky drops of<br /> Coke under the keys.</p>\n<p>22. When you get the message saying "Are you sure?" click on<br /> that ''Yes'' button as fast as you can. Hell, if you weren''t sure,<br /> you wouldn''t be doing it, would you?</p>\n<p>23. Feel perfectly free to say things like "I don''t know nothing<br /> about that computer crap". It never bothers us to hear our area<br /> of professional expertise referred to as crap.</p>\n<p>24. When you need to change the toner cartridge, call the<br /> helpdesk. Changing a toner cartridge is an extremely complex<br /> task, and Hewlett-Packard recommends that it be performed only<br /> by a professional engineer with a master''s degree in nuclear<br /> physics.</p>\n<p>25. When something''s the matter with your computer, ask your<br /> secretary to call the help desk. We enjoy the challenge of<br /> having to deal with a third party who doesn''t know anything<br /> about the problem.</p>\n<p>26. When you receive a 30-meg movie file, send it to everyone as<br /> a high-priority mail attachment. We''ve got plenty of disk space<br /> and processor capacity on that mail server.</p>\n<p>27. Don''t even think of breaking large print jobs down into<br /> smaller chunks. God forbid somebody else might get a chance to<br /> squeeze into the queue.</p>\n<p>28. When you bump into an IT bod in the supermarket on a<br /> Saturday, ask a computer question. We work 24/7, even while at<br /> the supermarket on weekends.</p>\n<p>29. If your son is a student in computer science, have him come<br /> in on the weekends and do his projects on your office computer.<br /> We''ll be there for you when his illegal copy of Visual Basic 6.0<br /> makes your Access database flip out.</p>\n<p>30. When you bring us your own no-brand home PC to repair for<br /> free at the office, tell us how urgently we need to fix it so<br /> your son can get back to playing DOOM. We''ll get right on it<br /> because we have so much free time at the office.]
[Last night I played a blank tape at full blast. The mime next door went nuts. If a person with multiple personalities threatens suicide, is that considered a hostage situation? Just think how much deeper the ocean would be if sponges didn''t live there. I went for a walk last night and my kids asked me how long I''d be gone. I said, ''The whole time.'' So what''s the speed of dark? After eating, do amphibians need to wait an hour before getting OUT of the water? Why don''t they just make mouse-flavored cat food? If you''re sending someone some Styrofoam, what do you pack it in? I just got skylights put in my place. The people who live above me are furious.Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections? Do they have reserved parking for non-handicapped people at the Special Olympics? Is it true that cannibals don''t eat clowns because they taste funny? If it''s tourist season, why can''t we shoot them? Isn''t Disney World a people-trap operated by a mouse? Whose cruel idea was it for the word `lisp'' to have an ''s'' in it? How come ''abbreviated'' is such a long word? If it''s zero degrees outside today and it''s supposed to be twice as cold tomorrow, how cold is it going to be? Why do you press harder on a remote control when you know the battery is dead? Why are they called buildings when they''re already finished? Shouldn''t they be called builts? Why are they called apartments when they''re all stuck together? Why do banks charge you a ''non-sufficient funds'' fee on money they already know that you don''t have? If the universe is everything, and scientists say that the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? What would a chair look like if your knees bent the other way? If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to see it, do the other trees make fun of it? Why is a carrot more orange than an orange? When two aeroplanes almost collide, why do they call it a near miss? It sounds like a near hit to me! Do fish get cramps after eating? Why are there five syllables in the word ''monosyllabic''? Why do scientists call it ''research'' when they are looking for something new? If vegetarians eat vegetables, what do humanitarians eat? When I erase a word with a pencil, where does it go? Why is it that when a door is open, it''s ajar, but when a jar is open, it''s not a door? Tell a man that there are 400 billion stars and he''ll believe you. Tell him a bench has wet paint and he has to touch it. How come Superman could stop bullets with his chest, but always ducked when someone threw a gun at him? Why is it fake lemon juice contains mostly artificial ingredients, but dishwashing liquid contains real lemons?Why do we wait until a pig is dead to ''cure'' it? Why do we wash bath towels? Aren''t we clean when we use them? Why do we put suits in a garment bag and put garments in a suitcase? Why doesn''t glue stick to the inside of the bottle? Do Roman paramedics refer to IVs its ''4s''? What do little birdies see when they get knocked unconscious? Why doesn''t Tarzan have a beard? If man evolved from monkeys and apes, why do we still have monkeys and apes? Should you trust a stockbroker who''s married to a travel agent? Is boneless chicken considered to be an invertebrate? Do married people live longer than single people do, or does it just SEEM longer? I went to a book store and asked the saleswoman, ''Where''s the self-help section?'' She said if she told me it would defeat the purpose. If all those psychics know the winning lottery numbers, why are they all still working? Isn''t the best way to save face to keep the lower part shut?]
[A man, while playing on the front nine of a complicated golf course, became<br /> confused as to where he was on the course. </p>\n<p>Looking around, he saw a lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her,<br /> explained his confusion and asked her if she knew what hole he was playing. </p>\n<p>She replied, "I''m on the 7th hole, and you are a hole behind me, so you must<br /> be on the 6th hole." </p>\n<p>He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the back nine the same thing<br /> happened; and he approached her again with the same request. She said, "I''m on<br /> the 14th hole, you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the<br /> 13th hole." </p>\n<p>Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. He finished his round and<br /> went to the clubhouse where he saw the same lady sitting at the end of the bar.<br /> He asked the bartender if he knew the lady. The bartender said that she was a<br /> sales lady and played the course often. </p>\n<p>He approached her and said, "Let me buy you a drink in appreciation for your<br /> help.

So, he directed that a nearby Air Force base be opened and that all elgible young men and women be invited. As he and his staff were standing near an brand new F-15 Fighter, a pair of twin brothers who looked like they had just stepped off a Marine Corps recruiting poster walked up to them. The chief of staff walked up to them, stuck out his hand and introduced himself. He looked at the first young man and asked, "Son, what skills can you bring to the Air Force?" The young man looks at him and says, "I''m a pilot!" The general gets all excited, turns to his aide and says, "Get him in today, all the paper work done, everything, do it!" The aide hustles the young man off. The general looks at the second young man and asked,"What skills to you bring to the Air Force?" The young man says, "I chop wood!" "Son," the general replies, "we don''t need wood choppers in the Air Force, what do you know how to do?" "I chop wood!" "Young man," huffs the general, "you are not listening to me, we don''t need wood choppers, this is the 20th century!" "Well," the young man says, "you hired my brother!" "Of course we did," says the general, "he''s a pilot!" The young man rolls his eyes and says, "Dang it, I have to chop it before he can pile it!"]

[A man goes to the doctor with a long history of migraine headaches. When the<br /> doctor does his history and physical, he discovers that his poor patient has had<br /> practically every therapy known to man for his migraines and STILL no<br /> improvement. </p>\n<p>"Listen," says the Doc, "I have migraines, too and the advice I''m going to<br /> give you isn''t really anything I learned in medical school, but its advice that<br /> I''ve gotten from my own experience.</p>\n<p>When I have a migraine, I go home, get in a nice hot bathtub, and soak for a<br /> while. Then I have my wife sponge me off with the hottest water I can stand,<br /> especially around the forehead. This helps a little. Then I get out of the tub,<br /> take her into the bedroom, and even if my head is killing me, I force myself to<br /> have intercourse with her. Almost always, the headache is immediately gone. Now,<br /> give it a try, and come back and see me in six weeks." </p>\n<p>Six weeks later, the patient returns with a big grin. "Doc! I took your advice<br /> and it works! It REALLY WORKS! I''ve had migraines for 17 years and this is the<br /> FIRST time anyone has ever helped me!" </p>\n<p>"Well," says the physician, "I''m glad I could help." </p>\n<p>"By the way, Doc," the patient adds, "You have a REALLY nice house."</p>\n<p>Shakey went to a psychiatrist. "Doc," he said, "I''ve got trouble. Every time I<br /> get into bed, I think there''s somebody under it. Then, when I get under the bed,<br /> I think there''s somebody on top of it. Doc, you''ve gotta help me, I''m going<br /> crazy!"<br /> "Just put you in my hands for two years," said the psychiatrist. "Come to me<br /> three times a week, and I''ll cure your fears."<br /> "How much do you charge?"<br /> "My fee is per visit."<br /> "That''s awfully expensive, Doc," reckoned Shakey. "Let me sleep on it, and<br /> I''ll get back to you."<br /> Six months later, the doctor and Shakey crossed paths. "Why didn''t you ever<br /> come to see me again?" asked the psychiatrist.<br /> "For a visit? Heck, a bartender cured me for!"<br /> "How do you figure?" asked the psychiatrist.<br /> "He told me to cut the legs off the bed!"<br /> A man answers the telephone to find a doctor from the hospital''s emergency<br /> room on the other end. "Sir," explains the doctor, "Your wife was in a serious<br /> car accident. I have bad news and good news."<br /> The man, taken back, asks hesitantly, "What''s the bad news?"<br /> "The bad news is your wife has lost all use of both arms and both legs. She<br /> will likely be on a respirator for the rest of her life."<br /> "Heavens, Doc, what''s the good news?"<br /> The doctor replies, "I''m kidding. She''s dead."<br /> One day, Paul complained to his friend, "You know, my elbow is killing me. I<br /> guess I should see a doctor."<br /> "Don''t do that!" said his friend. "There''s a computer at the drug store that<br /> can diagnose anything, quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply feed the<br /> computer a sample of your urine and it will diagnose your problem for only<br /> bucks."<br /> Paul figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample<br /> and walked to the drug store. Then, he poured the urine sample into the computer<br /> and deposited bucks. The computer started making some noise and a number of<br /> lights started flashing. After a brief moment, out popped a small slip of paper<br /> which read:<br /> ''You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy labor. It<br /> will be better in two weeks.''<br /> That evening, while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it<br /> would change medical science forever, Paul began to wonder if the computer could<br /> be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a<br /> stool sample from his pet dog, and urine samples from both his wife and<br /> daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the mix.<br /> The next day, Paul returned to drug store and poured the sample into the<br /> computer. Next, he deposited bucks. The computer started making some noise and a<br /> number of lights started flashing. After a brief moment, out popped a small slip<br /> of paper which read:<br /> ''Your tap water is too hard... getting a water softener. Your dog has<br /> ringworm... bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. Your daughter is using<br /> cocaine... put her in a rehab clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls and<br /> they aren''t yours... get a lawyer. And, if you don''t stop jerking off, your<br /> tennis elbow will never get better.'']
[Dear Santa: We''re worried about you.</p>\n<p>From your rosy red cheeks to your legendary girth to your all-night sleigh ride around the world, you may be at risk for diseases, maladies, mishaps and lawsuits that send chills through our Santa-loving hearts. The latest warning comes from the National Rosacea Society in Barrington, Ill.</p>\n<p>Dermatologist Dr. Jerome Litt says you have "a clear-cut case of rosacea," a skin condition that also affects millions of Americans, particularly at middle age. Unable to examine you personally, the good doctor based his finding on a well-circulated report that your "cheeks were like roses, (your) nose like a cherry."</p>\n<p>Sadly, many observers conclude that red-skin condition comes from hitting the Christmas-punch bowl a little too hard. Sadder still, rosacea can be aggravated by holiday stress, hot chocolate and overexertion -- all things you may encounter this time of year. The one bright note in Litt''s message is that certain antibiotics can help, and he advises you to see a North Pole dermatologist. But the news about you facial tint is only our latest source of concern.</p>\n<p>A careful examination of what we know about you and your lifestyle raises a host of other trouble signs:</p>\n<p>OBESITY: Frankly, Santa, this may be your biggest area of concern. Studies show overweight men have more than double the normal risk of heart attacks and increased chances of many other diseases. We''ve seen the pictures; we''ve noticed you in the malls. And we''ve heard that your tummy shakes "like a bowlful of jelly" when you chuckle. On this, we''ll take part of the blame. All these years, we''ve set out milk and cookies on Christmas Eve. With 102 million homes in the U.S. alone, even if 1 in 100 homes put out two cookies and a cup of milk, that would make and overnight snack of 2 million cookies and 63,750 gallons of milk. Maybe it''s time for Mrs. Claus to get you a NordicTrack or a Thighmaster. But be sure to have the old ticker checked out before you start an exercise regimen.</p>\n<p>PIPE SMOKING: You''ve been pictured with a pipe, and even though an apologist in The New York Times once claimed it''s only a prop, a witness who encountered you in his home said "the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath." According to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, pipe and cigar smokers have twice a nonsmoker''s risk for lung cancer, four times the risk for larynx cancer and two to three times the risk for cancers of the mouth and esophagus. Even if the pipe''s just a prop, it might be a good idea to lose it. Remember, you''re not just a saint, you''re a role model.</p>\n<p>STRESS: Dealing with Christmas wishes from millions of kiddies could certainly put one on the emotionsl hot seat. And anxiety can surpass even smoking as a risk for certain heart problems. On this point, though, we have some good news: A medical news service says laughter -- as evidenced by your trademark "Ho, ho, ho" -- is one of the best stress-busters.</p>\n<p>SOOT: We admire your ability to slip up and down the average chimney, an opening about 12 inches by 16 inches. But creosote flakes on the chimney walls are toxic and can lead to respiratory problems. Brent Rigby of Emerald City Chimney Sweeps in Kirkland said his people never actually go into a chimney, and wear protective masks when they reach up through the fireplace to vacuum the soot.</p>\n<p>RSI (REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY): Cards and letters by the bagful arrive on your doorstep through regular mail, but this year we''ve noticed you''re also receiving -- and answering -- e-mail on at least four Internet addresses, including one based in Seattle, santa@cyberspace.com.</p>\n<p>We applaud your move onto the information superhighway, with this caution: too much keyboard work can result in painful injuries to the hands, wrists and arms.</p>\n<p>DEER MITES: Close, continuous contact with your trusty reindeer means if they get mites, so might you, says Dr. David DuClos, a veterinary dermatologist in Lynnwood. Watch out for itchy rashes, and keep the deer out of your bed.</p>\n<p>FROSTBITE, HYPOTHERMI<br /> A: You usually bundle up, and that''s good. A Weather Service satelilite recently showed the temperature at the North Pole was 13 below zero, and high winds are common. Exposure to such conditions can cause frostbite in minutes.</p>\n<p>MALL THUGS: You spend a lot of time in shopping malls, so you already know things are getting a little tough out there. Try not to walk back to your sleigh at night alone.</p>\n<p>MEMORY TROUBLE: It''s been said that you make a list, then check it twice. Just being careful, or developing a little memory problem?</p>\n<p>SAD (SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER): This time of year, there is virtually no daylight at the North Pole, and a lack of sunlight can trigger depression in some people. Maybe a full-spectrum light would help keep you jolly.</p>\n<p>VIRAL INFECTIONS: A young witness saw you kissing Mommy underneath the mistletoe last night. You know this is colds and flu season, don''t you?</p>\n<p>SLEIGH ACCIDENTS: We''ve seen plenty of pictures of you in that sleigh, but never with a seat belt, and we''d sure hate to see you get hurt. By the way, when you cruise through Seattle this year, be sure to cover the load.</p>\n<p>JET LAG: Fatigue, dizziness and insomnia are all dangers that travelers face when they cross through several times zones. And few travelers cross all 24 of them in a night, like you do.</p>\n<p>SKYJACKERS: OK, you''ve been lucky so far, but they''re out there.</p>\n<p>Knowing all the dangers you face makes us feel that much more fortunate that you''re still faithfully delivering the goodies to good boys and girls every Christmas.</p>\n<p>But you might want to try to reduce some of those risks before your insurance company decides to boost your rates. Which reminds us: You DO have insurance, don''t you?]

[I always love the "Doc Smith" approach to mathematics, where Our Hero glances at an equation (sorry, "formula"), and instantly says "of course...!"My experience is usually more like "I don''t know what on earth that means" ... scribble, scribble, scribble ..."Oh, yes, but what a weird way of writing it" ... scribble, scribble, scribble ..."now *this* should be a much clearer way" ... scribble, scribble, scribble ..."oh, it''s identical to what I started with.

[Men''s Rules for Women </p>\n<p>* If we say something that can be interpreted in two ways, and one of those ways makes you sad or angry... we meant it the other way. </p>\n<p>* Department stores and malls were purposely designed so that when you want to look at bed linens, shower curtains or handbags, speakers, tires or sporting equipment are always nearby. </p>\n<p>* We don''t know ANYTHING about handbags. Please, don''t even ask. </p>\n<p>* We DID water the plants. They died anyway. Nobody knows why... </p>\n<p>* Silence does not always need to be filled with discussions about "us" and "the relationship." </p>\n<p>* It is in neither your best interest or ours to take those stupid magazine quizzes together. </p>\n<p>* Actually, you probably don''t want to know what we''re thinking. </p>\n<p>* Good things for you to help us with: the Sunday crossword puzzle, yard work, the dishes, cleaning, and grocery shopping. </p>\n<p>* Things you should let us do alone: figuring out where we are, watching ESPN, playing cards, and home repair. </p>\n<p>* Christopher Columbus didn''t need directions and neither do we. </p>\n<p>* Curley is the bald one. </p>\n<p>* Unless you are willing to follow the careers of Cal Ripken, Michael Jordan, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, don''t expect us to know what Helen Gurley Brown, Hilary Clinton, Kathy Lee Gifford or Suzanne Summers are up to. </p>\n<p>* Socks never constitute a gift. </p>\n<p>* Dinner out is a pretty good birthday present. Two tickets to a ball game are even better. </p>\n<p>* Two hot dogs and a drink at a baseball game do, in fact, constitute going out to dinner. </p>\n<p>* Anything we said six or eight months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments become null and void after seven days. </p>\n<p>* You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done - not both! </p>\n<p>* Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials or time-outs. </p>\n<p>* When we''re turning the wheel and the car is nosing onto the off ramp, your saying "This is our exit" is not necessary. </p>\n<p>* No, you can''t have the remote control.]

The skinny man headed for the tree, and in five minutes he was back knocking on the lumberjack''s door. "I cut the tree down," said the man. The lumberjack couldn''t believe his eyes and said, "Where did you get the skill to chop down trees like that?" "In the Sahara Forest," replied the puny man. "You mean the Sahara Desert," said the lumberjack. The little man laughed and answered back, "Oh sure, that''s what they call it now!"]
[This one woman who was in her late 40''s went to the plastic surgen. She wanted an entire face lift and so the doctor said he had this new technique. The woman asked how it was done so the doctor explained it. He said that he would cut two slits on top of her head and tie them into a knot. The woman asked why he would put a knot, and the doctor said that it was so if her face felt a little droopy, when she twisted it to the right, it would tighten the skin on her face. The woman decided to get the surgery done.The doctor told her to come back in four months so he could check up on how she was doing. During the four months the woman had tightened the knot quite a bit. When the woman had finally gone back to see the doctor, she had been complaining about her bags under her eyes being heavy.The doctor examined her for one minute and said, lady, those aren''t bags under your eyes, they''re your tits!

[What does your profession say about you?</p>\n<p>1. MARKETING - You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to<br /> avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and<br /> socializing which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least<br /> compatible with Sales.</p>\n<p>2. SALES - Laziest of all signs, often referred to as "marketing without a<br /> degree." You are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and<br /> begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with customers so you<br /> can "concentrate on the big picture." You seek admiration for your golf game<br /> throughout your life.</p>\n<p>3. TECHNOLOGY - Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are<br /> instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace.<br /> Often even YOU don''t understand what you are saying but who the hell can tell.<br /> It is written that Geeks shall inherit the Earth.</p>\n<p>4. ENGINEERING - One of only two signs that actually studied in school. It is<br /> said that ninety percent of all Personal Ads are placed by engineers. You can be<br /> happy with yourself; your office is full of all the latest "ergo dynamic"<br /> gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your "carpal tunnel<br /> syndrome."</p>\n<p>5. ACCOUNTING - The only other sign that studied in school. You<br /> are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the<br /> organization; combined with your extreme organizational traits, the majority of<br /> rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane.</p>\n<p>6. HUMAN RESOURCES - Ironically, given your access to confidential<br /> information, you tend to be the biggest gossip within the organization. Possibly<br /> the only other person that does less work than marketing, you are unable to<br /> return any calls today because you have to get a haircut, have lunch AND then<br /> mail a letter.</p>\n<p>7. MANAGEMENT/MIDDLE MANAGEMENT - Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless,<br /> you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable<br /> to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of<br /> meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other "Middle<br /> Managers" as everyone in you social circle is a "Middle Manager."</p>\n<p>8. SENIOR MANAGEMENT - (See above - Same sign, different title)</p>\n<p>9. CUSTOMER SERVICE - Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride<br /> from taking your own life. As children very few of you asked your parents for a<br /> little cubicle for your room and a headset so you could pretend to play<br /> "Customer Service." Continually passed over for promotions, your best bet is to<br /> sleep with your manager.</p>\n<p>10. CONSULTANT - Lacking any specific knowledge, you use acronyms to avoid<br /> revealing your utter lack of experience. You have convinced yourself that your<br /> "skills" are in demand and that you could get a higher paying job with any other<br /> organization in a heartbeat. You will spend an eternity contemplating these<br /> career opportunities without ever taking direct action.</p>\n<p>11. RECRUITER, "HEADHUNTER" - As a "person" that profits from the success of<br /> others, you are disdained by most people who actually work for a living. Paid on<br /> commission and susceptible to alcoholism, your ulcers and frequent heart attacks<br /> correspond directly with fluctuations in the stock market.</p>\n<p>12. PARTNER, PRESIDENT, CEO - You are brilliant or lucky. Your inability to<br /> figure out complex systems such as the fax machine suggest the latter.</p>\n<p>13. GOVERNMENT WORKER - Paid to take days off. Government workers are genius<br /> inventors, like the invention of new Holidays. They usually suffer from deep<br /> depression or anxiety and usually commit serious crimes while on the job... Thus<br /> the term "GO POSTAL"]

But since he was a regular<br /> customer, he didn''t want to insult the man by accusing him of lying. </p>\n<p>Finally, one day, the pro decided to accompany the old man on his daily round,<br /> just to see for himself. </p>\n<p>On the first tee, the older gentleman sliced the ball way off into the rough.<br /> He found his ball, but his second shot was even worse. Finally, putting it into<br /> the first hole (a par 4) took him 8 swings. </p>\n<p>The golf pro thought to himself, "I knew it! This guy''s been lying all this<br /> time.

Sven says that Ole has something to say. He''s at a loss of words and all that comes out of his mouth is ''GUESS WHO DIED IN THE WOODS TODAY ....!'']

Well,<br /> one young sperm decided that he would be the first one to the<br /> egg, so he immediately began a rigorous exercise program to get<br /> in prime condition for the upcoming race.

[This fundamentalist Christian couple felt it important to own an equally fundamentally Christian pet. So, they went shopping. At a kennel specializing in this particular breed, they found a dog they liked quite a lot. When they asked the dog to fetch the Bible, he did it in a flash. When they instructed him to look up Psalm 23, he complied equally fast, using his paws with dexterity. They were impressed, purchased the animal, and went home (piously, of course). That night they had friends over. They were so proud of their new fundamentalist dog and his major skills, they called the dog and showed off a little. The friends were impressed, and asked whether the dog was able to do any of the usual dog tricks, as well. This stopped the couple cold, as they hadn''t thought about ''normal'' tricks. "Well," they said, "let''s try this out." Once more they called out to the dog, and then clearly pronounced the command, "Heel!" Quick as a wink, the dog jumped up, put his paw on the man''s forehead, closed his eyes in concentration, and bowed his head.]

[One day, a man had an accident at work, which resulted in him getting his eye<br /> gouged out. He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency<br /> operation, was told by the doctor that he''d been given a glass eye. The man<br /> looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his<br /> original eye color was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged.<br /> ''''I can''t walk around like this!!"<br /> "Sir," the doctor said, "there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to<br /> give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it<br /> here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.''''<br /> A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a<br /> big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the<br /> road before finally hitting a tree. The man screeched to a halt, and ran down<br /> the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled<br /> out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye! As it was so<br /> late at night and during such a big storm, no one was about. So the man<br /> proceeded to get a screwdriver and removed one of the deceased man''s blue eyes,<br /> replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to<br /> have the replacement blue eye fitted. A few days later, the man was driving<br /> along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene<br /> and towing the car wreck away.

Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad''s mother and tell her he is OK. He can''t write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search &amp; rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn''t been for the lightning. </p>\n<p>Scoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn''t hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn''t burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back. </p>\n<p>We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn''t his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that''s probably why he can''t get insurance on it. We think it''s a neat car. He doesn''t care if we get it dirty, and if it''s hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. </p>\n<p>Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don''t worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn''t any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks. </p>\n<p>This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Webb wouldn''t let me because I can''t swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood. Scoutmaster Webb isn''t crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn''t even get mad about the life jackets. </p>\n<p>He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken, he said they got sick that way with the food they ate in prison. I''m so glad he got out and become our scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time. </p>\n<p>I have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don''t worry about anything. We are fine. </p>\n<p>Love, Cole]

[The other day I went to the local religious book store, where I saw a HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car, and I''m really glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed!</p>\n<p>I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn''t notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, "Jesus Christ!" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, "GO JESUS CHRIST,GO!"</p>\n<p>Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.</p>\n<p>Several cars behind, a very nice man stepped out of his car and yelled something. I couldn''t hear him very well, but it sounded like, "Mother trucker," or "Mother''s from there." Maybe he was from Florida, too. He must really love the Lord.</p>\n<p>A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed to yellow, and stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away.]

[51. If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at<br /> the forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out my opposite<br /> number among his army. </p>\n<p>52. I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an unstoppable<br /> superweapon, I will use it as early and as often as possible instead of<br /> keeping it in reserve. </p>\n<p>53. Once my power is secure, I will destroy all those pesky time-travel<br /> devices. </p>\n<p>54. I will offer oracles the choice of working exclusively for me or being<br /> executed. Those that take more than two seconds to respond will be killed<br /> either way. </p>\n<p>55. When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog, monkey,<br /> ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of untying<br /> ropes and filching keys happens to follow him around. Not that the key<br /> will be anywhere near the hero. </p>\n<p>56. I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the<br /> beautiful rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and good looks<br /> and will gladly betray her companions if I just let her in on my plans. I<br /> will then lie to her, and see if she betrays me. </p>\n<p>57. I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. Those who work<br /> for the pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like even the odds to<br /> give the other guy a sporting chance. </p>\n<p>58. I will not rely entirely upon "totally reliable" spells that can be<br /> neutralized by relatively inconspicuous talisman. </p>\n<p>59. I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is responsible<br /> for what in my organization. For example, if my general screws up I will<br /> not draw my weapon, point it at him, say "And here is the price for<br /> failure," then suddenly turn and kill some random, totally reliable<br /> underling. </p>\n<p>60. If an advisor says to me "My liege, he is but one man. What can one<br /> man possibly do?", I will reply "This." and kill the advisor.]

"Because of my<br /> job, I have to have a bath every night, and I notice you don''t<br /> have a bath. " "That''s not a problem," replied Doris. "We have a<br /> tin bath out in the yard and we bring it in to the living room<br /> in front of the fire and fill it with hot water." "What about<br /> your husband?" asked the model. "Oh, he plays darts most<br /> weekdays, so he will be out in the evenings," replied Doris.<br /> "Good," said the model.

[Some of us Southerners are pretty skeptical of horoscopes and the people that read them. If we are to ever fully understand all the star signs and the people they represent, we need symbols that all true Southerners understand: See the list below...</p>\n<p>OKRA (Dec 22 - Jan 20) Are tough on the outside but tender on the inside. Okras have tremendous influence. An older Okra can look back over his life and see the seeds of his influence everywhere. You can do something good each day if you try.</p>\n<p>CHITLIN (Jan 21 - Feb 19) Chitlins come from humble backgrounds. A Chitlin, however, will make something of himself if he is motivated and has lots of seasoning. In dealing with Chitlins, be careful they may surprise you. They can erupt like Vesuvius. Chitlins are best with Catfish and Okra.</p>\n<p>BOLL WEEVIL (Feb 20 - March 20) You have an overwhelming curiosity. You''re unsatisfied with the surface of things, and you feel the need to bore deep into the interior of everything. Needless to say, you are very intense and driven as if you had some inner hunger. You love to stay busy and tend to work too much. Nobody in their right mind is going to marry you, so don''t worry about it.</p>\n<p>MOON PIE (March 21 - April 20) You''re the type that spends a lot of time on the front porch. A cinch to recognize the physical appearance of Moon Pies. Big and round are the key words here. You should marry anybody who you can get remotely interested in the idea. It''s not going to be easy. You always have a big smile and are happy. This might be the year to think about aerobics. Maybe not.</p>\n<p>POSSUM (April 21 - May 21) When confronted with life''s difficulties, possums have a marked tendency to withdraw and develop a don''t-bother-me-about-it attitude. Sometimes you become so withdrawn, people actually think you''re dead. This strategy is probably not psychologically healthy but seems to work for you. You are a rare breed. Most folks love to watch you work and play. You are a night person and mind your own business.</p>\n<p>CRAWFISH (May 22 - June 21) Crawfish is a water sign. If you work in an office, you''re hanging around the water cooler. Crawfish prefer the beach to the mountains, the pool to the golf course, and the bathtub to the living room. You tend not to be particularly attractive physically, but you have very, very good heads.</p>\n<p>COLLARDS (June 22 - July 23) Collards have a genius for communication. They love to get in the melting pot of life and share their essence with the essence of those around them. Collards make good social workers, psychologists, and baseball managers. As far as your personal life goes, if you are Collards, stay away from Crawfish. It just won''t work. Save yourself a lot of heartache.</p>\n<p>CATFISH (July 24 - Aug 23) Catfish are traditionalists in matters of the heart, although one''s whiskers may cause problems for loved ones. You Catfish are never easy people to understand. You run fast. You work and play hard. Even though you prefer the muddy bottoms to the clear surface of life, you are liked by most. Above all else, Catfish should stay away from Moon Pies.</p>\n<p>GRITS (Aug 24 - Sept 23) Your highest aim is to be with others like yourself. You like to huddle together with a big crowd of other Grits. You love to travel though, so maybe you should think about joining a club. Where do you like to go? Anywhere they have cheese, gravy, bacon, butter, or eggs and a good time. If you can go somewhere where they have all these things, that serves you well. You are pure in heart.</p>\n<p>BOILED PEANUTS (Sept 24 - Oct 23) You have a passionate desire to help your fellow man. Unfortunately, those who know you best, your friends and loved ones, may find that your personality is much too salty, and their criticism will affect you deeply because you are really much softer than you appear. You should go right ahead and marry anybody you want to because in a certain way, yours is a charmed life. On the road of life, you can be sure that people will always pull over and stop for you.</p>\n<p>BUTTER BEAN (Oct 24 - Nov 22) Always invite a Butter Bean to a party because Butter Beans get along well with everybody. You, as a Butter Bean, should be proud. You''ve grown on the vine of life, and you feel at home no matter what the setting. You can sit next to anybody. However, you, too, shouldn''t have anything to do with Moon Pies.</p>\n<p>ARMADILLO (Nov 23 - Dec 21) You have a tendency to develop a tough exterior, but you are actually quite gentle and kind inside. A good evening for you? Old friends, a fire, some roots, fruit, worms, and insects. You are a throwback. You''re not concerned with today''s fashions and trends. You''re not concerned with anything about today. You''re almost prehistoric in your interests and behavior patterns. You probably want to marry another Armadillo, but a Possum is another somewhat kinky mating possibility.]
[When the old golfer died, Peter met him at the gates of<br /> heaven.  "Sorry, old man," Peter said, "But I can''t let you in.<br /> You see the big book here says you committed one unpardonable sin<br /> back in 1978 -- You took the Lord''s name in vain during a golf game."</p>\n<p>"Oh, yes.

Try me, " replied the Lord.</p>\n<p>"Well you see sir, I was playing my best game of golf ever, and I<br /> made it to the 18th hole, and I''d win the tournament if I could<br /> just make par on this hole. I made my shot from the<br /> tee, and it was sailing beautifully, when suddenly the wind<br /> shifted, and took my ball off into the woods, and right behind<br /> this enormous oak tree..."</p>\n<p>"And that''s when you took my name in vain?"</p>\n<p>"Oh, no, sir!  I just took out my 6 iron and knocked that ball<br /> clear out of the woods with one swing!  It was gliding beautifully<br /> toward the green, when suddenly it lost speed, and dropped into<br /> a sand trap, right smack in the middle of a deep hole..."</p>\n<p>"So, that is when you took my name in vain?"</p>\n<p>"No, not then.  I just took out my nine, and with one swing, drove<br /> that ball right onto the green, and it rolled within two inches of the<br /> hole..."</p>\n<p>        "Don''t tell me you missed a goddamn two inch putt!"]

[Joys of Jogging1. For every mile you jog, you add one minute to your life. This enables you, at the age of 85, to spend an additional five months in a nursing home at $5,000/month.2. The only reason I took up jogging was to hear heavy breathing again.3. I joined a health club last year, spending $400 in the process. I haven''t lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.4. I have to exercise early in the morning, before my brain figures out what I''m doing.5. I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.6. The advantage to exercising every day is that you die healthier.7. I have flabby thighs but fortunately my stomach covers them.8. If you are going to take up cross-country skiing, it helps to start with a small country.9. I don''t jog; it makes me spill my milk shake.10. Actually, I don''t exercise at all. If we were meant to touch our toes, we would have them farther up on our body.]
[A man had to go to a strange town to be the guest speaker at a business meeting. When he arrived at the Motel in town, he found that he had a lot of time before the meeting. He asked the clerk where the nearest golf course was and was given directions on how to get there.</p>\n<p>While playing on the front nine, he was going over the speech in his mind and became confused as to where he was on the course. Looking around, he saw a Lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her and told her about his big meeting and the speech he was to make and his confusion about where he was on the course, asked her if she knew what hole he was playing.</p>\n<p>She replied "I''m on the 7th hole and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole."</p>\n<p>He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the back nine the same thing happened. and he approached her again with the same request.</p>\n<p>She said "I''m on the 14th, you are a hole behind me, So you must be on the 13th."</p>\n<p>Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. He finished his round and went into the club house where he saw the Lady sitting at the end of the bar. He asked the bartender if he knew the Lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. He approached her and said, "let me buy you a drink to show my appreciation for your help. I understand that you are a sales lady, well I am in sales also. What do you sell"?</p>\n<p>She replied, "if I told you, you would only laugh." "No I wouldn''t", he said and persisted that she tell him what she sold.</p>\n<p>"Well if you must know", she answered, "I sell Tampax."</p>\n<p>With that, he fell on the floor and laughed so hard he almost lost his breath.

[One day this big, nasty, sweaty woman wearing a raggedy sleeveless sundress<br /> walks into a bar. </p>\n<p>She raises her right arm, revealing a big hairy armpit as she points to all<br /> the people sitting at the bar and asks, ''What man Out there will buy a lady a<br /> drink?''</p>\n<p>The whole bar goes dead silent as the patrons try to ignore her. </p>\n<p>At the end of the bar, a skinny little piss head slams his hand on the bar and<br /> says, ''Barman, I want to buy that ballerina a Drink.''</p>\n<p>The barman pours the drink and the woman chugs it down. </p>\n<p>After she''s completed the drink, she turns again to the throng and points<br /> around at all of them, again revealing the hairy Armpit, saying,</p>\n<p>''What man out there will buy a lady a drink?''</p>\n<p>Once again, the little drunk slaps his hand down on the bar and slurs to the<br /> barman, ''Sir, I would like to buy the ballerina another drink.''</p>\n<p>After serving the lady her second drink, the barman approaches the little<br /> drunkard and says, ''It''s your business if you want to buy the lady a drink, but<br /> why do you keep calling her a ballerina?''</p>\n<p>To which, the drunken replies, ''Sir, in my eyes, any woman who can lift her<br /> leg up that high has got to be a ballerina.]
