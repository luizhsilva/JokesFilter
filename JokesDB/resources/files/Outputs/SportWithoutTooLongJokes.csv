"I''m impressed. Can you run?" </p>\n<p>"Of course I can run," said the freshman. He </p>\n<p>was off like a shot, and, in just over nine </p>\n<p>seconds, he had run a hundred yard dash. </p>\n<p>"Great!" enthused the coach.

Two men were having an awfully slow round of golf because the two ladies in front of them managed to get into every sand trap, lake, and rough on the course. They didn''t bother to wave the men on through (which is proper golf etiquette). </p>\n<p>After two hours of waiting and waiting, one man said, "I think I''ll walk up there and ask those gals to let us play through." </p>\n<p>He walked out the fairway, got halfway to the ladies, stopped, turned around, and came back, explaining, "I can''t do it. One of those women is my wife and the other is my mistress. Maybe you''d better go talk to them." </p>\n<p>The second man walked toward the ladies, got halfway there and, just as his partner had done, stopped, turned around and walked back. He smiled sheepishly and said, "Small world."

Forget about Dog Bites Man. Relegate Man Bites Dog to the back pages. Today we are dealing with Fish swallows dog, an item which reaches us by way of Moscow. </p>\n<p>The dog was swimming across the Pechora River to join its master when it vanished, leaving only a ripple. The dog''s master, who was fishing at the time, hauled in his net and found it contained a giant pike. He looked closely at its mouth and said to himself (probably) "Thereby hangs a tail." </p>\n<p>Yes, it was Fido (or the Russian equivalent). The dog struggled out after the fish was cut open, and, according to Radio Moscow, hurled itself at the pike, "barking excitedly." </p>\n<p>It is often difficult for fishermen to tell stories about the one that got away. In this case, Radio Moscow notwithstanding, will it be any easier to tell about the one that didn''t?

A Delta Airlines pilot was badly embarrassed about the a particularly rough landing. He was reluctantly fulfilling company policy that required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited.  Nevertheless he stood there and gave each person a smile, and said:  ''Thanks for flying Delta.''He had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, awaiting that inevitable harsh comment on the landing, which by extension would impugn his professional skills and probably his manhood as well. There were fewer smiles than normal, but no comments.  Finally, everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane.  She said, ''Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?'' ''Why no M''am,'' said the pilot, ''what is it?'' The little old lady said, ''Did we just land or were we shot down?''

A man with stomach trouble wanted to try the newly introduced automated diagnosis machine at the shopping centre. He inserted his credit card an a urine sample as instructed, waited 30 seconds and then read the printout: "You have a tennis elbow". The man was impressed, but at the same time annoyed as his arms were perfectly alright.

After 30 seconds the printout read: "Your cat is going to have kittens, your wife is perfectly healthy, but you should quit masturbating when you have a tennis elbow."

Susie may be blonde and beautiful, but<br /> sometimes she is, shall we say, lacking in other areas.</p>\n<p>Susie had decided her kitchen needed repainting, and instead of<br /> hiring a professional, decided to do it herself. I thought she<br /> might appreciate a break and brought over some cold beer and<br /> some sandwiches.</p>\n<p>When I arrived, I found Susie working hard painting the kitchen<br /> walls. But instead of wearing old clothes, she was wearing her<br /> fur coat and her ski parka. I asked her why she was dressed that<br /> way on such a hot day. She brought me the paint bucket and told<br /> me to read the instructions. I did.</p>\n<p>It said, "For best results, put on two coats."

Why is there never a working ballpoint pen attached to those chains you see hanging around banks?Once imprisoned, the ballpoint pen soon loses the will to write. Even if released, it develops a deep-seated pattern of skipping and blotching that will soon send it back to the chain gang. Repeat offender ballpoint pens are sent to the post office, where they become federal pens. If not watched carefully, these pens will hang themselves from the writing desks. To prevent this, postal workers are particularly attentive, which is why they so often seem to be standing around staring at the pens. To avoid contributing to this destructive and unwholesome situation, I use a high-resolution dot-matrix printer when I write, and I recommend you do the same.

It seems a pastor from Maine skipped services one Sunday to go bear hunting in the mountains. As he turned the corner along the path, he and a bear collided. The pastor stumbled backwards, slipped off the trail, and began tumbling down the mountain with the bear in hot pursuit. Finally the pastor crashed into a boulder, sending his rifle in one direction and breaking both legs.<br /> As the bear closed in, the pastor cried out in desperation, "Lord, I''m sorry for what I have done.

Fellow goes to confession and tells the priest "Father, I''ve done something terrible. I just know they''re going to throw me out of the church for this one." "Hold, on," says the priest, "what have you done that''s so bad they''re going to throw you out of the church?" "Yesterday, my wife was bent over a sack of potatoes and I looked at her ass and got so turned on I went lifted her skirt and had sex with her right there and then." "There''s nothing wrong with that," says the priest, "you''re allowed to have sex with your wife. Why on earth would you think they would throw you out of the church for that?" "Well," the man said, "they threw us out of the grocery store."
One Sunday, a priest decided to skip church and go hunting in the nieghbooring forest. So while he was hunting he saw a gigantic grizzly bear the had stopped to get honey from a beehive. The priest thought the bear was good game, so he clumsily shot at it, and he missed. The bear, startled by the shot, jumped up and started charging at the priest. The priest used his only option: he dropped to his knees and prayed. "Dear God," he said, "Please let this bear be a good christian, a better one than I was." As the bear drew closer, is dropped to its knees and said, "Dear God, thank you for this meal I am about to receive."

"Did you follow my instructions?" </p>\n<p>The blonde nods. "I''ll tell you, though, I thought I was going to drop dead<br /> that third day." </p>\n<p>"From hunger, you mean?"<br /> "No, from skipping."

On Fred''s 86th birthday one of his female neighbors, from down the hall in the old folks home, came into his room and unzipped his pants. She the proceeded to strip him of his pants and skivvies. She sat down on the bed with him and grasped his withered shlong and held him for an hour. She did this routine of undressing him and holding his dick for an hour, every morning of his birthday. On Fred''s 93 birthday she proceeded to disrobe him when he told her to stop."What do you mean you don''t want me to do it any more", she said baffled by his actions."I just don''t want you to hold me anymore", replied Fred."Why, is there someone else"?"Actually there is," Fred shamefully admitted."Well what does she have that I don''t have"?"Parkinsons", replied Fred.
Three blond men are stranded on one side of a wide river, and don''tknow how to get across. The first man prays to God to make him smart enough to figure out how to cross the river, so God turns him into a brown-haired man and he swims across. The second man prays to God to make him even smarter, so God turns him  into a dark-haired man and he builds a boat and rows across. Then the third man prays to God to make him the smartest of all, so God  turns him into a woman and she walks across the bridge.

Robert A. Chase, 45, was charged with threatening an 11-year-old boy with a<br /> knife in Madison, Wis. The boy was watching Chase play basketball with another<br /> adult when the opponent accused Chase of "traveling" (taking steps without<br /> dribbling the ball). To seek an impartial opinion, Chase asked the boy, but the<br /> boy agreed that Chase had traveled. Chase then allegedly grabbed the boy, held a<br /> knife to his throat, and asked, "Now. Did I travel?"

He came back over to my house a few hours later, with a<br /> face redder than a fire truck. Apparently, when the doctor asked<br /> him what was wrong, he replied that his vulva was sore.

So, as she reached behind again, a pair of strong hands picked her up and placed her on the top step."What do you think you''re doing?", she asked the guy behind her."Well, I figured the second time you undid my fly we were at least good friends!"

With that paul says, why did you do that, now anyone who rents this boat will know where to fish.
I always love the "Doc Smith" approach to mathematics, where Our Hero glances at an equation (sorry, "formula"), and instantly says "of course...!"My experience is usually more like "I don''t know what on earth that means" ... scribble, scribble, scribble ..."Oh, yes, but what a weird way of writing it" ... scribble, scribble, scribble ..."now *this* should be a much clearer way" ... scribble, scribble, scribble ..."oh, it''s identical to what I started with.  But *now* I understand it."  I can''t *read* maths, I can only write it :-)A colleague of mine put it better: "mathematics is not a spectator sport".

Two men were having an awfully slow round of golf because the two ladies in front of them managed to get into every sand trap, lake, and rough on the course. They didn''t bother to wave the men on through, which is proper golf etiquette.<br /> After two hours of waiting and waiting, one man said, "I think I''ll walk up there and ask those gals to let us play through." </p>\n<p>He walked out the fairway, got halfway to the ladies, stopped, turned around, and came back, explaining, "I can''t do it. One of those women is my wife and the other is my mistress! Maybe you''d better go talk to them." </p>\n<p>The second man walked toward the ladies, got halfway there and, just as his partner had done, stopped, turned around and walked back and said: "Small world."

My guess is that most of them are hiding beneath your golf ball for safety."
