She spent the first day packing her belongings into boxes, crates and suitcases. </p>\n<p>On the second day, she had the movers come and collect her things. </p>\n<p>On the third day, she sat down for the last time at their beautiful dining room table by candlelight, put on some soft background music and feasted on a pound of shrimp, a jar of caviar and a bottle of Chardonnay.. </p>\n<p>When she had finished, she went into each and every room and deposited a few half-eaten shrimp shells dipped in caviar, into the hollow of the curtain rods. She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. </p>\n<p>When the husband returned with his new girlfriend, all was bliss for the first few days. Then slowly, the house began to smell. They tried everything; cleaning, mopping and airing the place out. Vents were checked for dead rodents and carpets were steam cleaned. Air fresheners were hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in to set off gas canisters, during which they had to move out for a few days, and in the end they even paid to replace the expensive wool carpeting. </p>\n<p>Nothing worked. People stopped coming over to visit. Repairmen refused to work in the house. The maid quit. </p>\n<p>Finally, they could not take the stench any longer and decided to move.  A month later, even though they had cut their price in half, they could not find a buyer for their stinky house. Word got out and eventually even the local realtors refused to return their calls. Finally, they had to borrow a huge sum of money from the bank to purchase a new place. </p>\n<p>The ex-wife called the man and asked how things were going. He told her the saga of the rotting house. She listened politely and said that she missed her old home terribly, and would be ! willing to reduce her divorce settlement in exchange for getting the house back. Knowing his ex-wife had no idea how bad the smell was, he agreed on price that was about 1/10th of what the house had been worth, but only if she were to sign the papers that very day. She agreed and within the hour his lawyers delivered the paperwork. </p>\n<p>A week later the man and his girlfriend stood smiling as they watched the moving company pack everything to take to their new home, including the curtain rods.

Three men went up to heaven to meet with St. Peter, but upon<br /> arival, they are told that only 33% of the people trying to get<br /> into heaven were being allowed because heaven was getting<br /> overpopulated. To decide who of the three got in, St. Peter went<br /> to the first man and asked him, "If you were to have anybody say<br /> anything at your funeral, what would it be?"</p>\n<p>"I would have somebody say, ''He was a great doctor and a great<br /> man. He was deticated to his work yet he always had time to be a<br /> great family man. He helped the community and everybody in it in<br /> many ways. We are all better people because he exsisted.''" "That<br /> is very nice," said St. Peter.</p>\n<p>He went to the second person and asked the same question. "I<br /> would have somebody say, ''He was a great lawyer who upheld the<br /> constitution and fought for what was right. He was the kindest<br /> man alive who always thought about others before himself. He<br /> cared for his family as well as everybody else around him, and<br /> his death is a great loss to all." "That is very, very nice,"<br /> said St. Peter.</p>\n<p>He went on to the third person and asked him the same question.<br /> "I would have somebody say, ''LOOK, HE''S MOVING!''" The third<br /> person was the only one who got in.

I just thought I''d check out the same way."

C., when, awakening to the sound of a ringing telephone beside his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed instead a Smith &amp; Wesson . 38 Special, which discharged when he drew it to his ear.</p>\n<p>A terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no mark on his body but autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system.</p>\n<p>His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the right combination of foods. It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing from the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed. Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it wouldn''t have been fatal. But the man was shut up in his near airtight bedroom. He was a big man with a huge capacity for creating [this deadly gas]. "Three of the rescuers got sick and one was hospitalized.</p>\n<p>]Man slips, falls 23 stories to his death.

Peter Lauwers, managing partner of the firm Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper that Hoy was "one of the best and brightest" members of the 200-man association.</p>\n<p>Six people drowned Monday while trying to rescue a chicken that had fallen into a well in southern Egypt. An 18-year-old farmer was the first to descend into the 60-foot well. He drowned, apparently after an undercurrent in the water pulled him down, police said. His sister and two brothers, none of whom could swim well, went in one by one to help him, but also drowned.<br /> Two elderly farmers then came to help, but they apparently were pulled by the same undercurrent.  The bodies of the six were later pulled out of the well in the village of Nazlat Imara, 240 miles south of Cairo. The chicken was also pulled out. It survived.</p>\n<p>[Times of London] A thief who sneaked into a hospital was scarred for life when he tried to get a suntan. After evading security staff at Odstock Hospital in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and helping himself to doctor''s paging devices, the thief spotted a vertical sun bed. He walked into the unit and removed his clothes for a 45-minute tan.  However, the high-voltage UV machine at the hospital, which is renowned for its treatment of burns victims, has a maximum dosage of 10 seconds. After lying on the bed for almost 300 times the recommended maximum time, the man was covered in blisters. Hours later, when the pain of the burns became unbearable, he went to Southampton General Hospital, 20 miles away, in Hampshire.  Staff became suspicious because he was wearing a doctor''s coat. After tending his wounds they called the police. Southampton police said:  "This man broke into Odstock and decided he fancied a quick suntan.

Burns'' clothes caught on something, however, and the other man found Burns "wrapped in the drive shaft. " [Kalamazoo Gazette, 4-1-95]</p>\n<p>* Same thing up here in MI. Seems some poor fella thought it would be a good idea to "move" a downed wire from his car. Newspaper reports it took a FULL MINUTE of neighbors whacking away at him with a 2x4 to free their freshly fried former friend from the fatal flashing.</p>\n<p>* Bowling Green, Ohio, student Robert Ricketts, 19, had his head bloodied when he was struck by a Conrail train.

"Sorry, but I<br /> can''t do that," replied the stonecutter giving the lawyer a little elbow nudge,<br /> "In this state, it''s against the law to bury two people in the same grave.

The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.<br /> The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains "I ask you a question, and if you don''t know the answer, you pay me $5, and visa-versa." Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep.<br /> The lawyer, now somewhat agitated, says, "Okay, if you don''t know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don''t know the answer, I will pay you $50!" figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match.<br /> This catches the blonde''s attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game.<br /> The lawyer asks the first question. "What''s the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn''t say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a five-dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer.<br /> Now, it''s the blonde''s turn.

All to no avail.<br /> After over an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $50. The blonde politely takes the $50 and turns away to get back to sleep.<br /> The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, so what IS the answer!?"<br /> Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.

It seems a man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of America,<br /> walked into the branch and wrote, "This iz a stikkup. Put all<br /> your muny in this bag." While standing in line, waiting to give<br /> his note to the teller, he began to worry that someone had seen<br /> him write the note and might call the police before he reached<br /> the teller window. So he left the Bank of America and crossed<br /> the street to Wells Fargo. After waiting a few minutes in line,<br /> he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller. She read it and,<br /> surmising from his spelling errors that he was not the brightest<br /> light in the harbour, told him that she could not accept his<br /> stick up note because it was written on a Bank of America<br /> deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells<br /> Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America.

The prosecutor said the officer didn''t need a warrant<br /> because a "bulge" in Christopher''s jacket could have been a gun.<br /> Nonsense, said Christopher, who happened to be wearing the same<br /> jacket that day in court.

The defendant paused, then<br /> quickly added, " - if I''d been the one that was there." The jury<br /> took 20 minutes to convict Newton and recommended a 30 year<br /> sentence.</p>\n<p>R.C. Gaitlin, 21, walked up to two patrol officers who were<br /> showing their squad car computer equipment to children in a<br /> Detroit neighborhood. When he asked how the system worked, the<br /> officer''s asked him for a piece of identification. Gaitlin gave<br /> them his driver''s license, they entered it into the computer,<br /> and moments later they arrested Gaitlin because information on<br /> the screen showed Gaitlin was wanted for a two-year-old armed<br /> robbery in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>\n<p>New York: As a female shopper exited a convenience store, a man<br /> grabbed her purse and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately and<br /> the woman was able to give them a detailed description of the<br /> snatcher. Within minutes, the police had apprehended the<br /> snatcher. They put him in the car and drove back to the store.<br /> The thief was then taken out of the car and told to stand there<br /> for a positive ID. To which he replied, "Yes Officer..that''s<br /> her. That''s the lady I stole the purse from."</p>\n<p>1st Person: "Do you know anything about this fax-machine?" 2nd<br /> Person: "A little. What''s wrong?" 1st Person: "Well, I sent a<br /> fax, and the recipient called back to say all she received was a<br /> cover-sheet and a blank page. I tried it again, and the same<br /> thing happened." 2nd Person: "How did you load the sheet?" 1st<br /> Person: "It''s a pretty sensitive memo, and I didn''t want anyone<br /> else to read it by accident, so I folded it so only the<br /> recipient would open it and read it."</p>\n<p>I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping beside her car.<br /> "Do you need some help?" I asked. She replied, "I knew I should<br /> have replaced the battery in this remote door unlocker. Now I<br /> can''t get into my car. Do you think they (pointing to a distant<br /> convenience store) would have a battery for this?" "Hmmm, I<br /> dunno. Do you have an alarm, too?" I asked. "No, just this<br /> remote ''thingy,''" she answered, handing it and the car keys to<br /> me. As I took the key and manually unlocked the door, I replied,<br /> "Why don''t you drive over there and check about the<br /> batteries...it''s a long walk."</p>\n<p>My friend called his car insurance company to tell them to<br /> change his address from Texas to Vermont. The woman who took the<br /> call asked where Vermont was. As he tried to explain, she<br /> interrupted and said, "Look, I''m not stupid or anything, but<br /> what state is it in?"</p>\n<p>I was in a car dealership a while ago when a large motor home<br /> was towed into the garage. The front of the vehicle was in dire<br /> need of repair and the whole thing generally looked like an<br /> extra in "Twister." I asked the manager what had happened. He<br /> told me that the driver had set the cruise control, then went in<br /> back to make a sandwich.
A preacher and an attorney were talking one day about the<br /> mistakes they made in their respective professions, and how they<br /> deal with them. </p>\n<p>The lawyer boasted that because he was a lawyer if he made a<br /> really big mistake he just shuffled a few papers and pulled a<br /> few legal maneuvers and covered it all up. If it was a small<br /> mistake he just ignored it and went on with life. The attorney<br /> turned to the preacher and asked, "How do you do it, pastor?" </p>\n<p>The pastor said, "If it is a really large mistake I just turn to<br /> the Lord and ask forgiveness." The attorney interrupted him and<br /> asked, "But what about small mistakes, how do you handle them?"<br /> The preacher replied, "Well, just last Sunday in my sermon I was<br /> quoting Jesus from the gospel of John chapter 8 where he said,<br /> "You are your father the devil, he was a liar from the<br /> beginning." Instead I said, "You are of your father the devil,<br /> he was lawyer from the beginning." Upon hearing this the lawyer<br /> became indignant and retorted, "Well how did you handle it?" The<br /> preacher replied, "It was such a small mistake that I just<br /> ignored it and went on."

At the height of a political corruption trial, the prosecuting attorney attacked a witness. "Isn''t it true," he bellowed, "that you accepted five thousand dollars to compromise this case?" The witness stared out the window, as though he hadn''t hear the question. "Isn''t it true that you accepted five thousand dollars to compromise this case?" the lawyer repeated. The witness still did not respond. Finally, the judge leaned over and said, "Sir, please answer the question." "Oh," the startled witness said, "I thought he was talking to you."

A judge was riding horses one day with a young lawyer friend. They came<br /> upon an open stretch of country and noticed a hangman''s noose hanging from a<br /> tree, solemnly waiving in the wind. The judge turned to his riding companion and<br /> jokingly said, "Jacob, if that gallows had its due, where do you suppose you<br /> would be?" "Riding alone," quickly came the reply.
The bartender asks the guy sitting at the bar, ''What''ll you have?'' The guy answers, ''A scotch, please.'' The bartender hands him the drink, and says ''That''ll be five dollars,'' to which the guy replies, ''What are you talking about? I don''t owe you anything for this.'' A lawyer, sitting nearby and overhearing the conversation, then says to the bartender, ''You know, he''s got you there. In the original offer, which constitutes a binding contract upon acceptance, there was no stipulation of remuneration.'' The bartender was not impressed, but says to the guy, ''Okay, you beat me for a drink. But don''t ever let me catch you in here again.'' The next day, same guy walks into the bar. Bartender says, ''What the heck are you doing in here? I can''t believe you''ve got the audacity to come back!'' The guy says, ''What are you talking about? I''ve never been in this place in my life!'' The bartender replies, ''I''m very sorry, but this is uncanny. You must have a double.'' To which the guy replies, ''Thank you. Make it a scotch.''

A housewife, an accountant and a lawyer were asked "How much is 2 2?"<br /> The housewife replies: "Four!".</p>\n<p>The accountant says: "I think it''s either 3 or 4. Let me run those figures through my spreadsheet one more time."</p>\n<p>The lawyer pulls the drapes, dims the lights and asks in a hushed voice, "How much do you want it to be?"
A lawyer walks into a bar and sits down next to a drunk who is closely examining something held in his fingers. The lawyer watches the drunk for a while till he finally gets curious enough to ask what it is. "Well" said the drunk, "it looks like plastic and feels like rubber." "Let me have it" said the lawyer. Taking it, he began to roll it between his thumb and forefinger, examining it closely. "Yes" he finally said, "it does look like plastic and feel like rubber, but I don''t know what it is. Where did you get it?" "From my nose" the drunk replied.
An elderly patient needed a heart transplant and discussed his options with his doctor.</p>\n<p>The doctor said, "We have three possible donors; tell me which one you want to use. One is a young, healthy athlete who died in an automobile accident. The second is a middle-aged businessman who never drank or smoked and who died in his private plane. The third is an attorney who just died after practicing law for 30 years."</p>\n<p>"I''ll take the lawyer''s heart," said the patient.</p>\n<p>After a successful transplant, the doctor asked the patient why he had chosen the donor he did.</p>\n<p>"It was easy," the patient replied. "I wanted a heart that hadn''t been used."

A lawyer asked a Czechoslovakian friend of his to go hunting one day. While strolling thru the woods a grizzly bear attacked them. While the bear ate the Czech... the lawyer managed to escape. He ran to the forest rangers cabin. </p>\n<p>After telling the ranger what had happenned... the ranger said... ''You''ll have to go with me and identify the bear.'' The ranger grabbed his rifle and the lawyer followed him back into the woods. It didn''t take long to find the bear... but he was with a female bear at the time. </p>\n<p>The ranger took aim... and asked the lawyer: ''Which one is it... the male or the female?''. </p>\n<p>The lawyer said the male. Then all of a sudden .. BANG! The female bear fell to the ground and died. The lawyer perplexed and confused asked the ranger: ''Why did you shot the female? I said it was the male.'' </p>\n<p>To which the ranger replied: ''Do you really expect me to believe: a "lawyer" saying... the Czech is in the male?''
According to today''s regulators and bureaucrats, those of us who were kids in the 60''s, 70''s and early 80''s probably shouldn''t have survived, because our baby cots were covered with brightly coloured lead-based paint which was promptly chewed and licked.</p>\n<p>We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, or latches on doors or cabinets and it was fine to play with pans.</p>\n<p>When we rode our bikes, we wore no helmets, just flip flops and fluorescent ''spokey dokey''s on our wheels.�酶惟</p>\n<p>As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or airbags, riding in the passenger seat was a treat.</p>\n<p>We drank water from the garden hose and not from bottles and it tasted the same.</p>\n<p>We ate chips, bread and butter pudding and drank fizzy pop with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing.</p>\n<p>We shared one drink with four friends, from one bottle or can and no-one actually died from this.</p>\n<p>We would spend hours building go-carts out of scraps and then went top speed down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes.</p>\n<p>After running into stinging nettles a few times, we learned to solve the problem.</p>\n<p>We would leave home in the morning and could play all day, as long as we were back before it got dark.

They actually sided with the law.</p>\n<p>This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever.</p>\n<p>The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas.</p>\n<p>We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all.</p>\n<p>And you''re one of them.

One day, a Chicago lawyer died. He went to the gates of Hell to receive his eternal punishment. The Devil called his servant and told him too take the lawyer to the deepest, hottest pit, get the heaviest sledgehammer and the hardest rocks, and put him to work. The servant did as he was told.The servant decided to check on him an hour later. When he got there, the lawyer was smiling and whistling while he worked. Confused, he asked the man, "Are you enjoying this?"The lawyer replied, "When I was a child I worked on a farm with my father. This actually brings back a lot of good memories."The servant thought for a moment, then snapped his fingers and the deep, hot pit turned into an arctic environment."Maybe this will be a little less satisfying!" said the servant happily.An hour later, the servant went to check on the lawyer and saw that he was still smiling and whistling! "Why are you still happy?" he asked."Well," replied the lawyer, "it''s cold day in Hell, the Bears must have won the Superbowl!"
A witness to an automobile accident was testifying. The following exchange took place between the lawyer and the witness: The lawyer: "Did you actually see the accident?" The witness: "Yes, sir." The lawyer: "How far away were you when the accident happened?" The witness: "Thirty-one feet, six and one quarter inches." The lawyer (thinking he''d trap the witness): "Well, sir, will you tell the jury how you knew it was exactly that distance?" The witness: "Because when the accident happened I took out a tape and measured it. I knew some stupid lawyer would ask me that question."
A small town prosecuting attorney called his first witness to<br /> the stand in a trial--a grandmotherly, elderly woman. He<br /> approached her and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know me?"</p>\n<p>She responded, "Why, yes, I do know you Mr. Williams. I''ve known<br /> you since you were a young boy. And frankly, you''ve been a big<br /> disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you<br /> manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You<br /> think you''re a rising big shot when you haven''t the brains to<br /> realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit<br /> paper pusher. Yes, I know you."</p>\n<p>The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do he pointed<br /> across the room and asked, "Mrs. Williams, do you know the<br /> defense attorney?" </p>\n<p>She again replied, "Why, yes I do. I''ve known Mr. Bradley since<br /> he was a youngster, too. I used to baby-sit him for his parents.<br /> And he, too, has been a real disappointment to me. He''s lazy,<br /> bigoted, he has a drinking problem. The man can''t build a normal<br /> relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the<br /> shoddiest in the entire state. Yes, I know him." </p>\n<p>At this point, the judge rapped the courtroom to silence and<br /> called both counselors to the bench. In a very quiet voice, he<br /> said with menace, "If either of you asks her if she knows me,<br /> you''ll be in jail for contempt within 5 minutes!"
Farmer Joe decided his injuries from the accident were serious enough to take the trucking company responsible for the accident to court. </p>\n<p>In court the trucking company''s fancy lawyer was questioning farmer Joe.</p>\n<p>"Didn''t you say at the scene of the accident, ''I''m fine,"'' asked the lawyer.</p>\n<p>Farmer Joe responded, "Well, I''ll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite mule Bessie into the..."</p>\n<p>"I didn''t ask for any details," the lawyer interrupted, "just answer the question. Did you not say at the scene of the accident, ''I''m fine!''."</p>\n<p>Farmer Joe said, "Well, I had just got Bessie into the trailer and I was driving down the road..."</p>\n<p>The lawyer interrupted again and said, "Judge, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the highway patrolman on the scene that he was fine. </p>\n<p>Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question."</p>\n<p>By this time the judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe''s answer and said to the lawyer, "I''d like to hear what he has to say."</p>\n<p>Joe thanked the Judge and proceeded, "Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side. </p>\n<p>I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. </p>\n<p>I was hurting real bad and didn''t want to move. However, I could hear ol'' Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans. </p>\n<p>Shortly after the accident a highway patrolman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her.</p>\n<p>After he looked at her, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me." He said, "Your mule was in such bad shape I had to shoot her. How are you feeling?

A Jewish lawyer was troubled by the way his son turned out, and went to see his Rabbi about it. "I brought him up in the faith, gave him a very expensive bar mitzvah, cost me a fortune to educate him. Then he tells me last week he has decided to be a Christian. Rabbi... where did I go wrong?"</p>\n<p>"Funny you should come to me," said the Rabbi. "Like you, I, too, brought my boy up in the faith, put him through University, cost me a fortune, then one day he comes and tells me he has decided to become a Christian."</p>\n<p>"What did you do?" asked the lawyer. "I turned to God for the answer," replied the rabbi.</p>\n<p>"And what did he say?"</p>\n<p>He said, "Funny you should come to me..."
Why do they bury Lawyers in 12 foot graves?</p>\n<p>Because deep down, they''re good people.
The lawyer cabled his client overseas: ''Your mother-in-law passed away in her sleep. Shall we order burial, embalming or cremation?''Back came the reply, ''Take no chances - order all three.''
OOPS! I BLEW THAT ONE!A lawyer defending a man accused of burglary tried this creative defense: "My client merely inserted his arm into the window and removed a few trifling articles. His arm is not himself, and I fail to see how you can punish the whole individual for an offense committed by his limb." "Well put," the judge replied. "Using your logic, I sentence the defendant''s arm to one year''s imprisonment. He can accompany it or not, as he chooses." The defendant smiled. With his lawyer''s assistance he detached his artificial limb, laid it on the bench, and walked out.
It''s not hard to meet expenses, they''re everywhere. Jury: Twelve people who determine which client has the better lawyer. Let not the sands of time get in your lunch.

One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend<br /> suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything<br /> quicker and cheaper than a doctor.<br /> ''''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your<br /> problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10." Bill figured<br /> he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the<br /> drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.<br /> The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.<br /> After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: "You<br /> have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be<br /> better in two weeks."<br /> Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how<br /> it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine<br /> could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog<br /> and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into<br /> the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in<br /> the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and<br /> printed out the following message:<br /> "Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him<br /> vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren''t yours. Get a lawyer. And if<br /> you don''t stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better."
Justice, American Style  </p>\n<p>The following exchange happened last March 5 on the show "Politically Incorrect," between Bill Maher, the host, and lawyer Leslie Abramson, who defended the Menendez brothers: </p>\n<p>Bill: When do lawyers give a damn about the facts? </p>\n<p>Leslie: When did you or Geraldo give a damn about the facts? </p>\n<p>Bill: You defended the Menendez kids. What do you care about facts? </p>\n<p>Leslie: I don''t remember seeing you in the courtroom, Bill, so you absolutely don''t know anything about the trial. </p>\n<p>Bill: I knew they blew their parents'' heads off. </p>\n<p>Leslie: No, they didn''t.

Two lawyers were planing to go to Hawaii for their 12th anniversery. The lady told her husband that she has to finish her case and would come down in a week. The husband said ok and left for hawaii. It had been a week and the husband was going to email his wife to make sure she was still coming. He forgot her email address and put down what he remembered. An old woman was sitting in her rocker crying because her husband had died 1 week ago and the computer said you''ve got mail, so she clicked on it and she fell to the floor dead. The House keeper ran in and found the woman dead. She didn''t see why the woman died, but she looked on the computer screen and this is what it said" I have been down here for about a week now and it''s really hot down here.I have been waiting for you.

An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. </p>\n<p>St. Peter checks his dossier and says, "Ah, you''re an engineer -- you''re in the wrong place." </p>\n<p>So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. </p>\n<p>Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. </p>\n<p>After awhile, they''ve got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. </p>\n<p>One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So, how''s it going down there in hell?" </p>\n<p>Satan replies, "Hey, things are going great. We''ve got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there''s no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next." </p>\n<p>God replies, "What??? You''ve got an engineer? That''s a mistake -- he should never have gotten down there; send him up here." </p>\n<p>Satan says, "No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I''m keeping him." </p>\n<p>God says, "Send him back up here or I''ll sue." </p>\n<p>Satan laughs uproariously and answers, "Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?"
One afternoon, a wealthy lawyer was riding in the back of his limousine when<br /> he saw two men eating grass by the road side.

And you, come with us too!", he said to the other man.<br /> "But sir, I have a wife with six children!" the second man answered.<br /> "Bring them as well!" </p>\n<p>They all climbed into the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large<br /> as the limo. Once underway, one of the poor fellows says, "Sir, you are too<br /> kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you." </p>\n<p>The lawyer replied, "No problem, the grass at my home is about two feet tall!"

He instructed his wife to go to the bank and withdraw enough money to fill two pillowcases. He then directed her to take the bags of money to the attic and leave themdirectly above his bed. His plan: When he passed away, he would reach out and grab the bags on his way to Heaven.Several weeks after the funeral, the deceased lawyer''s wife, up in the attic cleaning came upon the two forgotten pillowcases stuffed with cash. "Oh, that old fool," she exclaimed. "I knew he should have had me put the money in the basement."

When Choosing A Mate, Compare These Other Professionals To Computer Programmers<br /> DOCTORS<br /> Supposedly, all women are after a Doctor, so don''t expect your relationship to last more than 5 years. Eventually, he''ll run off with some nurse from his office, or one of his young women patients who is pretending to be sick. He''ll wait until you are stuck with a few kids to do this. </p>\n<p>This is not a problem with your programmer husband. He had a hard enough time meeting you. It is unlikely he''ll ever meet another woman in his profession. </p>\n<p>LAWYER<br /> Do you seriously expect an honest, trusting relationship with someone who gets paid for lying? </p>\n<p>Once again, this is not a problem with your programmer spouse. He doesn''t have enough social skills to lie convincingly. An additional drawback to marrying a lawyer is when the divorce happens you will get nothing. </p>\n<p>SALESMAN<br /> See honesty segment under Lawyer. Plus, he will be traveling to trade shows, etc, where he will be in the company of other equally trustworthy individuals. Don''t be surprised when you get the invitation to show up on the Ricki Lake show. </p>\n<p>The company that your programmer husband works at will keep him in a cage, often called a cubicle, until he is ready to go home to you. </p>\n<p>HAZARDOUS PROFESSIONS, I.E. POLICE OFFICER, FIREFIGHTER, CONSTRUCTION WORKER, ETC.<br /> Your husband, if he is not dead by some accident, will likely be crippled with a back injury, etc, just about the time you are at your sexual peak. </p>\n<p>The only hazards that your programmer husband will face is losing his eyesight by staring at the terminal for too long. This hazard actually has some benefits. For one, he will not notice that you are getting older, since you will be a blur. He will remember you as when he first met you, because the memory will still be sharp. And when you ask "Honey, were you looking at her?" he''ll honestly be able to say that he didn''t even see her. </p>\n<p>TEACHER<br /> The only reason he entered this profession is so that he could be surrounded by newly post-pubescent girls who idolize him. He''ll be in jail soon, and then you''ll have to look for another man.
One day this truck driver was driven down a city street, when he<br /> spotted a lawyer standing next to his parked car. He swerved at<br /> him and hit him.

They were married in a simple ceremony.</p>\n<p>So things went on, for thirty years or so, but they determined, in this time, that eternity was best not spent together.</p>\n<p>They went back to St. Peter, and said, "We thought we would be happy forever, but now we believe that we have irreconcilable differences.  Is there any way we can get divorced?"</p>\n<p>"Are you kidding?" said St. Peter. "It took me a hundred years to get a priest up here to marry you. I''ll never get a lawyer!"

Scene: A court room in Oklahoma where a person is on trial for murder.

His comments were that he knew how, but he just wasn''t sure whether it was his job.</p>\n<p>My eighth husband was from Standards and Regulations and told me that he was up to the standards but that regulations said nothing about how to do it.</p>\n<p>My ninth husband was a Marketing Manager. He said, ''I know I have the product. I''m just not sure how to position it.''</p>\n<p>My tenth husband was a psychiatrist, and all he ever wanted to do was talk about it.</p>\n<p>My eleventh husband was a gynecologist, and all he ever wanted to do was look at it.</p>\n<p>My twelfth husband was a stamp collector, and all he ever wanted to do was -- God I miss him!</p>\n<p>So now I have married a lawyer, so I know I''m going to get screwed!

We''ve never had a lawyer."

An elderly woman walked into the main office of Chase Manhattan<br /> Bank building, holding a large paper bag in her hand. She told<br /> the young man at the teller''s window that she wished to deposit<br /> the $3 million in the bag and open an account at the bank. She<br /> said that first, though, she wished to meet the president of the<br /> bank due to the amount of money involved. The teller thought<br /> that to be a reasonable request, and, after opening the bag and<br /> seeing bundles of $1000 bills, which amounted to approximately<br /> $3,000,000, telephoned the bank president''s secretary for an<br /> appointment for the lady.</p>\n<p>The woman was escorted upstairs and ushered into the president''s<br /> office. Introductions were made, and she stated that she liked<br /> to get to know people she did business with on a more personal<br /> basis. The president then asked her how she came into such a<br /> large sum of cash. "Was it inherited?" he asked. "No," she<br /> replied. He was quiet for several seconds, trying to think of<br /> where this elderly lady could possibly have come into $3 million.</p>\n<p>"I bet," she offered. "As in horses?". "No," she replied, "as in<br /> people". Seeing his confusion, she explained that she just bet<br /> on different things with people. Suddenly, she said, "I''ll bet<br /> you 25,000 that by 10 o''clock tomorrow morning your balls will<br /> be square."</p>\n<p>The bank president figured she must be off her rocker and<br /> decided to take her up on the bet. He didn''t know how he could<br /> lose. For the rest of the day, he was extremely cautious--he<br /> decided to stay home that evening and take no chances. $25,000<br /> was at stake.</p>\n<p>When he got up in the morning and took his shower, he checked to<br /> make certain that everything was O.K. There was no change in his<br /> scrotal appearance. He looked the same as always. He went to his<br /> office and waited for the woman to come in at 10AM, humming as<br /> he went. He knew this was his lucky day. How often did he get<br /> handed $25,000 for doing nothing?</p>\n<p>At 10 o''clock sharp, the woman was shown into his office. With<br /> her was a man. When the bank president asked her what the other<br /> man was with her for, she informed the president that he was her<br /> lawyer and she always took him along when there was this much<br /> money involved in her betting.</p>\n<p>"Well," she asked, "what about our bet?" "I don''t know how to<br /> tell you this," he said, "but I''m the same as I''ve always been,<br /> only $25,000 richer." The old lady asked him to drop his pants<br /> so they could all see. The president complied. The old lady<br /> peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel<br /> them. "Well, okay," said the president, "$25,000 is a lot of<br /> money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure." Just then, he<br /> noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the<br /> wall. The president asked the old lady, "What''s wrong with him?"<br /> She replied, "Nothing, except that I bet him $100,000 that by<br /> 10am today I''d have the Chase Manhattan Bank''s president''s balls<br /> in my hand."
A Brooklyn lawyer, a used car salesman and a banker were gathered by a coffin containing the body of an old friend. In his grief, one of the three said, "In my family, we have a custom of giving the dead some money, so they�酶惟ll have something to spend over there."They all agreed that this was appropriate. The banker dropped a hundred dollar bill into the casket, and the car salesman did the same. The lawyer took out the bills and wrote a check for $300.
Seems there were these three professionals sitting around talking about the oldest profession (not THAT one!). The Doctor says, "Well, the Bible says that God took a rib out of Adam to make woman. Since that clearly required surgery, then the oldest profession is surely medicine." The Engineer shakes his head and replies, "No, no. The Bible also says that God created the world out of void and chaos. To do that, God must surely have been an engineer. Therefore, Engineering is the oldest profession." The Lawyer smiles smugly and leans discreetly forward. "Ah," he says, "but who do you think created the Chaos?"

Q: What do you get when you cross a bad politician with a lawyer?</p>\n<p>A: Chelsea.
An attorney was sitting in his office late one night, when Satan appeared before him. The Devil told the lawyer, "I have a proposition for you. You can win every case you try, for the rest of your life. Your clients will adore you, your colleagues will stand in awe of you, and you will make embarrassing sums of money. All I want in exchange is your soul, and the souls of all your friends and law partners."The lawyer thought about this for a moment, then asked, "So, what''s the catch?"
A defendant was on trial for murder. There was strong evidence indicating guilt, but there was no corpse. In the defense''s closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick: "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all," the lawyer said as he looked at his watch. "Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom." </p>\n<p>He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened. Finally the lawyer said, "Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I therefore put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty." </p>\n<p>The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty. "But how?" inquired the lawyer. "You must have had some doubt, I saw all of you stare at the door." </p>\n<p>The jury foreman replied: "Oh, we looked, but your client didn''t."
Defendant: Your Honor, I want you to appoint me another lawyer. </p>\n<p>Judge: And why is that?</p>\n<p>Defendant: Because the Public Defender isn''t interested in my case.</p>\n<p>Judge (to Public Defender): Do you have any comments on the defendant''s motion?</p>\n<p>Public Defender: I''m sorry, Your Honor. I wasn''t listening.
The staff at a local United Way office realized that it had never received a donation from the town''s most successful lawyer. The person in charge of contributions called him to persuade him to contribute and said, "Our research shows that out of a yearly income of at least $500,000, you give not a penny to charity. Wouldn''t you like to give back to the community in some way?" </p>\n<p>The lawyer mulled this over for a moment and replied, "First, Did your research also show that my mother is dying after a long illness, and has medical bills that are several times her annual income?" </p>\n<p>Embarrassed, the United Way representative mumbled, "Um... No." </p>\n<p>"Or," the lawyer continued, "that my brother, a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a wheelchair?" </p>\n<p>The stricken United Way representative began to stammer out an apology but was interrupted when the lawyer added, "Or that my sister''s husband died in a traffic accident," the lawyer''s voice rising in indignation, "Leaving her pennyless with three children?" </p>\n<p>The humiliated United Way representative, completely beaten, said simply, "I had no idea..." </p>\n<p>On a roll, the lawyer cut him off once again, "So if I don''t give any money to them, why should I give any to you?"
Why are research labratories using lawyers instead of rats? Nobody cares<br /> what happens to a lawyer. The lab assistants don''t get attached to<br /> lawyers. And finally, there are some things a rat won''t do.
A man is walking along the beach and finds a lamp. Upon seeing<br /> it, he rubs it to get the sand off. Poof, out pops a genie. It<br /> immediately says that he gets three wishes, but whatever he<br /> gets, his lawyer will get double. He is not happy, but decides<br /> that he gets something, so its not all bad.</p>\n<p>He immediately wishes for what he has always wanted, a new<br /> Porsche convertible. As he is cruising down the street, he sees<br /> his lawyer outside his house washing his TWO Porsche<br /> convertibles. This makes him mad, seeing his lawyer get<br /> something for nothing.</p>\n<p>His next wish was for $1,000,000. As he is at the bank opening<br /> an account, he oversees his lawyer depositing $2,000,000. Now he<br /> is really steamed and cannot believe his lawyer is getting this<br /> much.</p>\n<p>The next morning, he is still mad about his lawyer and is<br /> thinking about how to use his last wish. Genie pops up, and he<br /> thinks hard. Then, he gets a grin on his face and says "I''d like<br /> to get beaten half to death!"

Little David was in his 5th grade class when the teacher asked the children what their fathers did for a living. All the typical answers came up -- fireman, policeman, salesman, doctor, lawyer, etc.</p>\n<p>David was being uncharacteristically quiet and so he teacher asked him about his father. "My father''s an exotic dancer in a gay cabaret and takes off all his clothes in front of other men. Sometimes, if the offer''s really good, he''ll go out to the alley with some guy and do nasty things with him for money."</p>\n<p>The teacher, obviously shaken by this statement, hurriedly set the other children to work on some exercises and took little David aside to ask him, "Is that really true about your father?"

Two guys, George and Harry, set out in a hot air balloon to cross the Atlantic ocean. After 37 hours in the air, George says "Harry, we better lose some altitude so we can see where we are." Harry lets out some of the hot air in the balloon, and the balloon descends to below the cloud cover. George says, "I still can''t tell where we are, lets ask that guy on the ground." So Harry yells down to the man, "Hey, pardon me but could you tell us where we are?"The man on the ground yells back, "You''re in a balloon 100 feet up in the air." George turns to Harry and says, "that man is a lawyer." "How can you tell?", inquires Harry. George answers, "Because the advice he gave us is 100% accurate, and totally useless."

An engineer dies and reports to hell. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After a while, they''ve got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So, how''s it going down there in hell?" Satan replies, "Hey things are going great. We''ve got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there''s no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next." God replies, "What??? You''ve got an engineer? That''s a mistake -- he should never have gotten down there; send him up here." Satan says, "No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I''m keeping him." God says, "Send him back up here or I''ll sue." Satan laughs uproariously and answers, "Yeah, right. And just where are you going to get a lawyer?"

A guy from Czechslovakia was visiting his cousin the lawyer in California, and they went for a hike in Yellowstone Park. While they were hiking they were attacked by 2 bears, one male and one female. The male bear dismembered and ate the Czechslovakian guy, but the lawyer managed to escape. He ran straight to the nearest Rangers station, and told them what had happened, and they sent out a group of rangers to see what was going on. Sure enough, the Rangers arrived at the place that the lawyer mentioned, and there were the female and the male bears. So one of the Rangers took his rifle and shot the female. The lawyer turned to the ranger and asked "Why did you shoot the female? - it was the male that ate my friend" So the Ranger replies "Would you believe a lawyer if he told you that the Czech is in the male?"

After his graduation from college, the son of a Spanish lawyer was considering his future. He went to his father and asked if he might be given a desk in the corner from which he could observe his father�酶惟s activities and be introduced to his father�酶惟s clients as a clerk. His observations would help him decide whether or not to become a lawyer. His father thought this was a great idea and immediately helped to set it up.The first client the next morning was a tenant farmer--a rough man with calloused hands who was dressed in workman�酶惟s clothing. He said,"Mr. Lawyer, I work for the Gonzales farm on the east side of town. For many years I have tended their crops and animals, including some cows. I have raised the cows, fed them and looked after them. And I was always given the understanding and the belief that I was the owner of these cows. Now Mr. Gonzales has died and his son has inherited the farm. He believes that since the cows were raised on his land and ate his hay, the cows are his. In short, we are in dispute over who owns the cows."The lawyer said, "Thank you. I have heard enough. I will take your case. Don''t worry about the cows!"The next client to come in, a young and well-dressed young man, was obviously a landowner. He said, "My name is Gonzales and I own a farm on the east side of town. We have a tenant farmer who has worked for my family for many years, tending crops and the animals, including some cows. I believe the cows belong to me because they were raised on my land and were fed my hay. But the tenant farmer believes they are his because he raised them and cared for them. In short, we are in dispute over who owns the cows."The lawyer said, "Thank you. I have heard enough. I will take your case. Don''t worry about the cows!"After the client left, the lawyer�酶惟s son could not help but express his concern. "Father, I know very little about the law, but it seems we have a very serious problem concernng these cows.""Don�酶惟t worry about the cows!" the lawyer said. "The cows will be ours!"

There once was a man who was so fanatical about his golf game that he used to play every day without fail. One morning he had played the first hole and was just about to tee off on the second, when he saw the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen putting on the first. </p>\n<p>The man waited until the woman had reached the second tee and asked if she would like to join him and they could finish the round together. To his surprise the woman agreed and they played the remaining holes. Not only was this woman beautiful, she was also a good golfer. When they completed their round, the man told the woman that he was a cordon bleu chef and wine buff. </p>\n<p>He invited her back to his place for a meal and a few drinks. The woman accepted enthusiastically and off they went. Back at the house the man cooked a magnificent meal. In fact it was more than just cooking it was a performance do behold. They enjoyed good food, good wine and good conversation. The man was so taken by the beauty and skill of this woman and desired her no end. </p>\n<p>He then asked if she would like to play golf the following morning, to which she agreed. Once again they enjoyed a great game of golf, a magnificent evening meal. This went on for three weeks when the lawyer finally said to the woman, "Listen, the golf and the company have been fantastic! But, there are only so many performances a man can take.

The scandal was begun when a 21 year<br /> old woman, known only as Mary, claimed that she had given birth to God''s<br /> "only son" last week in a barn in the hamlet of Bethlehem.</p>\n<p>Sources close to Mary claim that she "had loved God for a long time", that<br /> she was constantly talking about her relationship with God, and that she<br /> was "thrilled to have had his child." In a press conference this morning,<br /> God issued a vehement denial, saying that "No sexual relationship<br /> existed", and that "the facts of this story will come out in time, verily".</p>\n<p>Independent counsel Kenneth Beelzebub immediately filed a brief with the<br /> Justice department to expand his investigation to cover questions of<br /> whether any commandments may have been broken, and whether God had<br /> illegally funneled laundered money to his illegitimate child through three<br /> foreign operatives know only as the "Wise Men". Beelzebub has issued<br /> subpoenas to several angels who are rumored to have acted as go-betweens<br /> in the affair.</p>\n<p>Critics have pointed out that these allegations have little to do with the<br /> charges that Beelzebub was originally appointed to investigate, that God<br /> had created large-scale flooding in order to cover up evidence of a failed<br /> land deal.</p>\n<p>In recent months, Beelzebub''s investigation has already been expanded to<br /> cover questions surrounding the large number of locusts that plagued God''s<br /> political opponents in the last election, as well as to claims that the<br /> destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah was to divert attention<br /> away from a scandal involving whether the giveaway of a parcel of public<br /> land in Promised County to a Jewish special interest group was quid pro<br /> quo for political contributions.</p>\n<p>If these allegations prove to be true, then this could be a huge blow to<br /> God''s career, much of which has been spent crusading for stricter moral<br /> standards and harsher punishments for wrongdoers. Indeed, God recently<br /> outlined a "tough-on-crime" plan consisting of a series of 10<br /> "Commandments", which has been introduced in Congress in a bill by Rep.<br /> Moses. Critics of the bill have pointed out that it lacks any provisions<br /> for the rehabilitation of criminals, and lawyers for the ACLU are planning<br /> to fight the "Name in Vain" Commandment as being an unconstitutional<br /> restriction on free speech.

A doctor, a lawyer, and an architect were arguing about who had the smartest dog. They decided to settle the issue by getting all the dogs together and seeing whose could perform the most impressive feat."Okay, Rover," ordered the architect, and Rover trotted over to a table and in four minutes constructed a complete scale model of a Cathedral out of toothpicks. The architect slipped Rover a cookie, and everyone agreed that it was a pretty impressive performance."Hit it, Spot," commanded the doctor. Spot lost no time in performing an emergency Caesarean on a cow. Three minutes later the proud mother of a healthy little heifer was all sewed up and doing fine. Not bad, conceded the onlookers, and Spot got a cookie from the doctor."Your turn, Fella," said the lawyer. Over went Fella, screwed the other two dogs, took their cookies, and went out to lunch. </p>\n<p>There are more jokes like this at http://www.dirtylaughs.com

Murphy''s Laws of Martial Arts Ten scientific principles that apply to the study of all martial arts: The wimp who made it through the eliminations on luck alone will suddenly turn into Bruce Lee when you''re up against him. The referee will always be looking the other way when you score. The day you leave work early to make it to class on time, the sensei will be sick. The sensei will only use you during demonstrations for joint-locking techniques. If you have to use your training in self-defense, your attacker''s father will be a lawyer. After a flawless demonstration, you will trip on your way back to your seat. After years of training without a single injury, you will pull a groin muscle the night before your black belt exam. In an otherwise vacant locker room, the only other person will have the locker right next to yours. No matter how many times you take care of it before your promotion exam, you will invariably have to go to the bathroom when it''s your turn.

"What catch?" he asked. The Genie replied, "Every time you make a wish, every lawyer in the world will receive DOUBLE what you asked for." "Well, I can live with that! No problem!" replied the elated man."What is your first wish?" asked the Genie."Well, I''ve always wanted a Ferrari." POOF! A Ferrari appeared in front of the man."NOW, every lawyer in the world has TWO Ferraris," said the Genie."Next wish?" "I''d LOVE a million dollars..." replied the man. POOF! One million dollars appeared at his feet."NOW, every lawyer in the world has TWO MILLION dollars," said the Genie."Well, that''s okay, as long as I''ve got MY million," replied the man."What is your final wish?" The man thought long and hard, and finally said, "Well, you know, I''ve always wanted to donate a kidney...."

The New York Times, among other papers, recently published a new Hubble Space Telescope photograph of distant galaxies colliding.Of course, astronomers have had pictures of colliding galaxies for quite some time now, but with the vastly improved resolution provided by the Hubble, you can actually see the lawyers rushing to the scene.
A snake and a rabbit were racing along a pair of intersecting forest pathways<br /> one day, when they collided at the point where the pathways meet. They<br /> immediately began to argue with one another as to who was at fault for the<br /> mishap.<br /> When the snake remarked that he had been blind since birth, and thus<br /> should be given additional leeway, the rabbit said that he, too, had been blind<br /> since birth. The two animals then forgot about the collision and began<br /> commiserating concerning the problems of being blind.<br /> The snake said that his greatest regret was the loss of his identity. He had<br /> never been able to see his reflection in water, and for that reason did not know<br /> exactly what he looked like, or even what he was.<br /> The rabbit declared that he had the same problem. Seeing a way that they could<br /> help each other, the rabbit proposed that one feel the other from head to toe,<br /> and then try to describe what the other animal was.<br /> The snake agreed, and started by winding himself around the rabbit. After a<br /> few moments, he announced, "You''ve got very soft, fuzzy fur, long ears, big rear<br /> feet, and a little fuzzy ball for a tail. I think that you must be a bunny<br /> rabbit!"<br /> The rabbit was much relieved to find his identity, and proceeded to return the<br /> favor to the snake. After feeling about the snake''s body for a few minutes, he<br /> asserted, "Well, you''re scaly, you''re slimy, you''ve got beady little eyes, you<br /> squirm and slither all the time, and you''ve got a forked tongue. I think you''re<br /> a lawyer!"
A doctor vacationing on the Riviera met an old lawyer friend and asked him what he was doing there.The lawyer replied, "Remember that lousy real estate I bought? Well, it caught fire, so here I am with the fire insurance proceeds. What are you doing here?"The doctor replied, "Remember that lousy real estate I had in Mississippi? Well, the river overflowed and here I am with the flood insurance proceeds."The lawyer looked puzzled."Gee," he asked, "how do you start a flood?"

Three lawyers and three engineers were traveling by train to the same meeting. At the station, the lawyers each buy a ticket but the engineers buy just one. When asked why, the engineers coyly said "You''ll see."</p>\n<p>They all board the train, the lawyers taking seats, but the three engineers all crowding into the bathroom. After the train has left, the conductor comes around and takes the lawyers tickets and knocks on the bathroom door and says, "Ticket Please." An arm stretches out from the bathroom and the conductor takes the proffered ticket. The lawyers were very impressed.</p>\n<p>On the return trip, the lawyers proposed to emulate the gearheads and bought only one ticket. To their amazement, the engineers bought no ticket at all. When asked, the engineers said, "You''ll see." </p>\n<p>All board the train and the lawyers and engineers cram into seperate bathrooms to await the conductor. After a few minutes, one of the gearheads emerges from the bathroom, goes over to the lawyers bathroom, knocks on the door and says: "Ticket please."
A lawyer''s dog, running about unleashed, beelines for a butcher shop and steals a roast. Butcher goes to lawyer''s office and asks, "if a dog running unleashed steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a right to demand payment for the meat from the dog''s owner?"</p>\n<p>The lawyer answers, "Absolutely."</p>\n<p>"Then you owe me $8.50. Your dog was loose and stole a roast from me today."</p>\n<p>The lawyer, without a word, writes the butcher a check for $8.50 Several days later the butcher opens the mail and finds a bill from the lawyer: $20 due for a consultation.
A woman and her little girl were visiting the grave of the little girl''s grandmother. On their way through the cemetery back to the car, the little girl asked, "Mommy, do they ever bury two people in the same grave?" "Of course not, dear." replied the mother, "Why would you think that?" "The tombstone back there said ''Here lies a lawyer and an honest man."
A man walked into a curio store and was shopping around. After<br /> awhile, he chose a brass rat and brought it up to the counter.<br /> The proprietor said, that will be $10 for the brass rat and<br /> $1,000 for the story behind it. The man said, "Thanks, but I''ll<br /> just pay the $10 and pass on the story." He purchased the brass<br /> rat and left the store. As he was walking down the street, he<br /> started noticing all sorts of rats following him. The further he<br /> walked--the more rats followed. He walked down to the wharf and<br /> still more rats came out and followed him. So, he decided to<br /> walk out into the water, which he did--and all the rats drowned.<br /> He returned to the store shortly and when he walked in, the<br /> proprietor said, "Ah ha! You came back to pay the $1,000 for the<br /> story, right?" "No," replied the man, "I came back to see if you<br /> have any brass lawyers!"
Four surgeons were taking a coffee break and discussing their work. </p>\n<p>"I think accountants are the easiest to operate on," said the first surgeon.<br /> "You open them up and everything inside is numbered." </p>\n<p>"I think librarians are the easiest to operate on," said the second. "You open<br /> them up and everything inside is in alphabetical order." </p>\n<p>"I like to operate on electricians," said the third. "You open them up and<br /> everything inside is color-coded." </p>\n<p>"I like to operate on lawyers," said the fourth. "They''re heartless,<br /> spineless, gutless, and their heads and their asses are interchangeable."
A lawyer walks into a bar and sits down next to a drunk. </p>\n<p>Soon the lawyer realizes that the drunk is studying something in his hand and holding it up to the light. </p>\n<p>"What do you have there?" asks the curious lawyer.</p>\n<p>The drunk shakes his head. "Damned if I know," he says. "It looks like plastic and it feels like rubber." </p>\n<p>"Let me take a look," says the lawyer, and he rolls it between his fingers. </p>\n<p>"You know, you�酶惟re right," he says. "It does look like plastic, yet it feels like rubber. But I don�酶惟t know what it is. Where did you get it?"</p>\n<p>The drunk replies, "Out of my nose."</p>\n<p>Submitted by Curtis<br /> Edited by Tantilazing
Once there were three surgeons engaged in conversation.<br /> They got on the topic of their occupation and each stated who they liked to<br /> operate on.  </p>\n<p>The first doctor said, "I like to work on electricians."<br /> "Why?" the others replied.<br /> He answered, "When you open them up, they are all color coded so you know<br /> where everything goes."</p>\n<p>The second doctor said, "I like to work on librarians."<br /> "Why?" the other doctors asked.<br /> He replied, "Librarians are all orgainized in a sophisticated pattern."</p>\n<p>The third doctor said, "Well, I like to work on lawyers."<br /> "Lawyers?!" replied the others suprised.<br /> "Yes, Lawyers" he stated.<br /> "But why?" they asked him.<br /> "Well, they are gutless, they have no spine, and their heads and butts are<br /> interchangable."

Some years ago, a New Orleans lawyer sought a direct Veterans Administration loan for a client. He was told that the loan would be approved if he could provide proof of clear title to the property offered as collateral. </p>\n<p>The title for the property in question was complicated and he spent a considerable amount of time reviewing all pertinent documents back to 1803. Satisfied with the depth and expanse of his examination, he submitted the information to the VA. </p>\n<p>He soon received a reply from the VA.: "We received your letter today enclosing application for a loan for your client, supported by abstract of title. The application forms are complete, but you have not cleared the title before the year 1803. Therefore, before full review and possible approval can a be accorded the application, it will be necessary that the title be cleared back before that year." </p>\n<p>Annoyed, the lawyer wrote the V.A.: "Your letter regarding titles in case #9378329 received. I note that you wish titles extended further back than I have presented. Your attention is invited to the following information to update your records for the property prior to 1803: </p>\n<p>a) I was unaware that any educated person would not know that the United States gained clear title to Louisiana from France in 1803. This title transfer was a result of a real estate transaction known as The Louisiana Purchase. </p>\n<p>b) France gained clear title to Louisiana by right of conquest from Spain under the Treaty of San Ildefonso (1800). </p>\n<p>c) The land came into the possession of Spain by right of discovery in 1492 by a sailor named Christopher Columbus. He was acting on behalf of Isabella, Queen of Spain, and had her permission to claim newly discovered lands for Spain. </p>\n<p>d) The good Queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles - almost as careful as the V.A.- took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before authorizing the voyage. </p>\n<p>e) The Pope is a servant of God; God created the world. </p>\n<p>f) Therefore, I believe that it is safe to presume that God created title that part of the world called Louisiana and thus was the original holder of the property in question.

A Brooklyn lawyer, a used car salesman and a banker were gathered by a coffin containing the body of an old friend. In his grief, one of the three said, "In my family, we have a custom of giving the dead some money, so they�酶惟ll have something to pay tax''s over there."They all agreed that this was appropriate. The banker dropped a hundred dollar bill into the casket and walked away in tears.The car salesman did the same. The lawyer looked around and seeing no one was near the coffin, he took out the bills and wrote a check for $300.

"A million dollars," he answered, "because I want to donate it to M.I.T."The next applicant, a doctor, was asked the same question. He asked for $2 million. "I want to give a million to my family," he explained, "and leave the other million for the advancement of medical research."The last applicant was a lawyer.

TO: Public Release</p>\n<p>RE: Organizational Changes at the North Pole </p>\n<p>The recent announcement that Donner and Blitzen have elected to<br /> take the early reindeer retirement package has triggered a good<br /> deal of concern about whether they will be replaced, and about<br /> other restructuring decisions at the North Pole. Streamlining<br /> was necessary due to the North Pole''s loss of dominance of the<br /> season''s gift distribution business. Home shopping channels and<br /> mail order catalogs have diminished Santa''s market share. He<br /> could not sit idly by and permit further erosion of the profit<br /> picture. </p>\n<p>The reindeer downsizing was made possible through the purchase<br /> of a late model Japanese sled for the CEO''s annual trip.<br /> Improved productivity from Dasher and Dancer, who summered at<br /> the Harvard Business School, is anticipated. Reduction in<br /> reindeer will also lessen airborne environmental emissions for<br /> which the North Pole has received unfavorable press. I am<br /> pleased to inform you that Rudolph''s role will not be disturbed.<br /> Tradition still counts for something at the North Pole.<br /> Management denies, in the strongest possible language, the<br /> earlier leak that Rudolph''s nose got that way, not from the<br /> cold, but from substance abuse. Calling Rudolph "a lush who was<br /> into the sauce and never did pull his share of the load" was an<br /> unfortunate comment, made by one of Santa''s helpers and taken<br /> out of context at a time of year when he is known to be under<br /> executive stress. </p>\n<p>As a further restructuring, today''s global challenges require<br /> the North Pole to continue to look for better, more competitive<br /> steps. Effective immediately, the following economy measures are<br /> to take place in the "Twelve Days of Christmas" subsidiary: </p>\n<p>The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree never turned<br /> out to be the cash crop forecasted. It will be replaced by a<br /> plastic hanging plant, providing considerable savings in<br /> maintenance; </p>\n<p>The two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not<br /> cost effective. In addition, their romance during working hours<br /> could not be condoned. The positions are therefore eliminated; </p>\n<p>The three French hens will remain intact. After all, everyone<br /> loves the French; </p>\n<p>The four calling birds were replaced by an automated voice mail<br /> system, with a call waiting option. An analysis is underway to<br /> determine who the birds have been calling, how often and how<br /> long they talked; </p>\n<p>The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of<br /> Directors. Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could<br /> have negative implications for institutional investors.<br /> Diversification into other precious metals as well as a mix of<br /> T-bills and high technology stocks appear to be in order; </p>\n<p>The six geese-a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer<br /> be afforded. It has long been felt that the production rate of<br /> one egg per goose per day is an example of the decline in<br /> productivity. Three geese will be let go, and an upgrading in<br /> the selection procedure by personnel will assure management that<br /> from now on every goose it gets will be a good one; </p>\n<p>The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in<br /> better times. The function is primarily decorative. Mechanical<br /> swans are on order. The current swans will be retrained to learn<br /> some new strokes and therefore enhance their outplacement; </p>\n<p>As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under<br /> heavy scrutiny by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the<br /> workforce is being sought. The more militant maids consider this<br /> a dead-end job with no upward mobility. Automation of the<br /> process may permit the maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring or<br /> a-mulching; </p>\n<p>Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number. This function<br /> will be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no<br /> longer do the steps; </p>\n<p>Ten Lords-a-leaping is overkill. The high cost of Lords plus the<br /> expense of international air travel prompted the Compensation<br /> Committee to suggest replacing this group with ten out-of-work<br /> congressmen. While leaping ability may be somewhat sacrificed,<br /> the savings are significant because we expect an oversupply of<br /> unemployed congressmen this year; </p>\n<p>Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple<br /> case of the band getting too big. A substitution with a string<br /> quartet, a cutback on new music and no uniforms will produce<br /> savings which will drop right down to the bottom line; </p>\n<p>We can expect a substantial reduction in assorted people, fowl,<br /> animals, and other expenses. Though incomplete, studies indicate<br /> that stretching deliveries over twelve days is inefficient. If<br /> we can drop ship in one day, service levels will be improved.<br /> Regarding the lawsuit filed by the attorney''s association<br /> seeking expansion to include the legal profession ("thirteen<br /> lawyers-a-suing) action is pending. </p>\n<p>Lastly, it is not beyond consideration that deeper cuts may be<br /> necessary in the future to stay competitive. Should that happen,<br /> the Board will request management to scrutinize the Snow White<br /> Division to see if seven dwarfs is the right number.
The professor of a contract law class asked one of his better students, "If you were to give someone an orange, how would you go about it?" The student replied, "Here''s an orange." The professor was outraged. "No! No! Think like a lawyer!" The student then replied, "Okay. I''d tell him `I hereby give and convey to you all and singular, my estate and interests, rights, claim, title, claim and advantages of and in, said orange, together with all its rind, juice, pulp, and seeds, and all rights and advantages with full power to bite, cut, freeze and otherwise eat, the same, or give the same away with and without the pulp, juice, rind and seeds, anything herein before or hereinafter or in any deed, or deeds, instruments of whatever nature or kind whatsoever to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding...''"</p>\n<p>When the man in the street says: "If it ain''t broke, don''t fix it," the lawyer writes: "Insofar as manifestations of functional deficiencies are agreed by any and all concerned parties to be imperceivable, and are so stipulated, it is incumbent upon said heretofore mentioned parties to exercise the deferment of otherwise pertinent maintenance procedures."
There is a guy who has a dog that doesn''t obey him. Then he sees<br /> an ad in the paper for a great dog trainer. So, he decides to go<br /> to the dog trainer and get his dog trained.</p>\n<p>The guy walks in the room and asks, "Can you train my dog, and<br /> are you a good trainer?" The trainer replies, "Well, I can train<br /> your dog, and I will give you a demonstration of how good I am."</p>\n<p>He dumped a box full of bones on the floor and blew a whistle.<br /> The first dog came in and made a skeleton with the bones. "Wow!"<br /> said the guy, "What kind of dog is that?" "That''s a nurse''s<br /> dog," said the trainer.</p>\n<p>Then he blows the whistle again and a second dog comes in the<br /> room. That dog makes a big building. The man says, "Wow! What<br /> kind of dog is that?" "That''s an architect''s dog," replies the<br /> trainer.</p>\n<p>Then the trainer blows the whistle again and a third dog comes<br /> in. That dog takes the bones, screws the other two dogs and runs<br /> away. "Wow! What kind of dog is that?" says the man. "That''s a<br /> lawyer''s dog!"
At the United Way in a fairly small town a volunteer worker noticed that the most successful lawyer in the whole town hadn''t made a contribution. This guy was making about $600,000 a year so the volunteer thought, "Why not call him up?"He calls up the lawyer."Sir, according to our research you haven''t made a contribution to the United Way, would you like to do so?"The lawyer responds, "A contribution? Does your research show that I have an invalid mother who requires expensive surgery once a year just to stay alive?"The worker is feeling a bit embarrassed and says, "Well, no sir, I''m...""Does your research show that my sister''s husband was killed in a car accident? She has three kids and no means of support!"The worker is feeling quite embarrassed at this point. "I''m terribly sorry...""Does your research show that my brother broke his neck on the job and now requires a full time nurse to have any kind of normal life?"The worker is completely humiliated at this point. "I am sorry sir, please forgive me...""The gall of you people! I don''t give them anything, so why should I give it to you!"
