This chain letter was started in hopes of bringing relief to other tired and discouraged men. Unlike most chain letters, this one does not cost anything.<br /> Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are equally tired and discontented. Then bundle up your wife or girlfriend and send her to the man whose name appears at the top of the following list and add your name to the bottom of the list. </p>\n<p>When your turn comes, you will receive 15,625 women. One of them is bound to be better than the one you already have. At the writing of this letter, a friend of mine had already received 184 women, of whom 4 were worth keeping. </p>\n<p>REMEMBER this chain brings luck. One man''s pit bull died and the next day he received a Playboy swimsuit model. An unmarried man living with his widowed mother was able to choose between a Hooters waitress and a Hollywood super model. </p>\n<p>You can be lucky too, but DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN! One man broke the chain and got his own wife back again. </p>\n<p>Let''s keep it going, men! Just add your name to the list below! </p>\n<p>&gt; Bill Clinton<br /> &gt; 1600 Pennsylvania Ave<br /> &gt; Washington DC<br /> &gt;<br /> &gt; William Jefferson Clinton<br /> &gt; 1600 Pennsylvania Ave<br /> &gt; Washington DC<br /> &gt;<br /> &gt; W.

Two lawyers are walking on the beach. A lovely blond woman in a skimpy bikini walks by.Lawyer #1 says, "Boy, wouldn''t you like to screw her?"Lawyer #2 then asks, "Screw her out of what?"
I never have quite figured out why the sexual urges of men &amp; women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Mars &amp; Venus thing. And, I never have figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart. And, I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene gets thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words "I do".</p>\n<p>One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, "I don''t feel like it, I just want you to hold me."</p>\n<p>I said, "WHAT??" So she says the words that I and every husband on the planet dreads. She explains that I must not be in tune with her emotional needs as a Woman. I''m thinking, "What was her first clue?"</p>\n<p>I finally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to bed. The very next day we went shopping at a big unnamed department store... I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. She couldn''t decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them.</p>\n<p>She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say OK. And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond earrings. Let me tell you ...she was so excited. She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don''t think she cared. I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she doesn''t even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK.</p>\n<p>She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have seen her face when she said, "I''m ready to go, let''s go to the cash register."</p>\n<p>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, "No, honey. I don''t feel like buying all this stuff now." You should have seen her face ... it went completely blank. I then said, "Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while."</p>\n<p>And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, "You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a Man."</p>\n<p>I figure that I should be having sex again sometime during the Spring thaw.

One day this Preacher decided that he would skip church and go hunting. When<br /> in the woods he came upon a bear. He started running, and he ran for a while<br /> until all of a sudden he tripped over a tree root. At this moment he was almost<br /> face to face with the bear. He dropped to his knees and said, "Dear Lord, if<br /> there is one wish I would want for you to give me it would be to make this bear<br /> a Christian." And at that instant�酶惟the bear halted to a stop and dropped to his<br /> knees and said, "Dear Lord, thank you for the food I am about to receive!"
Some things I''ve learned from my children:</p>\n<p>Super glue "is" forever.</p>\n<p>No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can''t walk on water. Pool filters "do not like Jell-O!"</p>\n<p>A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot house 4 inches deep.</p>\n<p>Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.</p>\n<p>Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.</p>\n<p>If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough however to spread paint on all four walls of 20 by 20 foot room.</p>\n<p>You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. And the glass in windows (even double pane) doesn''t stop a<br /> baseball hit by a ceiling fan.</p>\n<p>Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four year old.</p>\n<p>VCR''s do not eject peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, even though TV commercials show they do.</p>\n<p>Always look in the oven before you turn it on. It''s been proven that plastic toys do not like ovens.<br /> Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence.</p>\n<p>If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades, they can ignite.</p>\n<p>The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms dizzy. It will however make cats dizzy. Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy.

To the citizens of the United States of America: </p>\n<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. </p>\n<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. </p>\n<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: </p>\n<p>1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up "aluminium" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. </p>\n<p>Look up "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed". </p>\n<p>2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. </p>\n<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn''t that hard. </p>\n<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. </p>\n<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through. </p>\n<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. </p>\n<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. </p>\n<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for "shit" </p>\n<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day. </p>\n<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. </p>\n<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It''s been driving us crazy. </p>\n<p>Thank you for your cooperation.

It is the Olympic men''s figure skating. Out comes the Russian competitor, he<br /> skates around to some classical music in a slightly dull costume, performs some<br /> excellent leaps but without any great artistic feel for the music. </p>\n<p>The Judges'' scores read: Britain 5.8: Russia 5.9: United States 5.5: Ireland<br /> 6.0 </p>\n<p>Next comes the American competitor in a sparkling stars and stripes costume,<br /> skating to some rock and roll music. He gets the crowd clapping, but is not<br /> technically as good as the Russian. He slightly misses landing a triple Salchow<br /> and loses the center during a spin. But, artistically, it is a more satisfying<br /> performance. </p>\n<p>The Judges'' scores read: Britain 5.8: Russia 5.5: United States 5.9: Ireland<br /> 6.0 </p>\n<p>Finally out comes the Irish competitor wearing a tatty old donkey jacket, with<br /> his skates tied over his wellies. He reaches the ice, trips straight away and<br /> bangs his nose which starts bleeding. He tries to get up, staggers a few paces<br /> then slips again. He spends his entire ''routine'' getting up then falling over<br /> again. Finally he crawls off the ice a tattered and bleeding mess. </p>\n<p>The Judges'' scores read: Britain 0.0: Russia 0.0: United States 0.0: Ireland<br /> 6.0 </p>\n<p>The other 3 judges turn to the Irish judge and demand in unison, "How the hell<br /> can you give that mess 6.0?!" </p>\n<p>To which the Irish judge replies "You''ve gotta remember, it''s damn slippery<br /> out there."
A young blonde was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana. She wanted a pair<br /> of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the<br /> high prices the local vendors were asking.<br /> After becoming very frustrated with the "no haggle" attitude of one of the<br /> shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, "Maybe I''ll just go out and catch my own<br /> alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!"<br /> The shopkeeper said, "By all means, be my guest. Maybe you''ll luck out and<br /> catch yourself a big one!" Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the<br /> swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.<br /> Later in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home, when he spotted the young<br /> woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he saw a<br /> huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She took aim, killed the<br /> creature, and with a great deal of effort hauled it on to the swamp bank. Lying<br /> nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watched in<br /> amazement. Just then the blonde flipped the alligator on its back, and<br /> frustrated, shouts out, "Damn it, this one isn''t wearing any shoes either!"

One day, farmer Williams was in town picking up supplies for his farm.</p>\n<p>He stopped at the hardware store and picked up a bucket and an anvil. Then he stopped by the livestock dealer to buy a couple of chickens and a goose. </p>\n<p>However, he now had a problem, how to carry all his purchases home.</p>\n<p>The livestock dealer said: "Why don''t you put the anvil in the bucket, carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?" </p>\n<p>"Hey thanks!" the farmer said and off he went. While walking he met a little old lady who told him she was lost.</p>\n<p>She asked: "Can you tell me how to get to 123 Township Road?" </p>\n<p>The farmer said: "Well, as a matter of fact, I live at 132 Township Road. Let''s take my shortcut and go down this alley; we''ll be there in no time." </p>\n<p>The little old lady said: "How do I know that when we get in the alley, you won''t hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and ravish me?" </p>\n<p>The farmer said: "Holy smokes lady, I am carrying a bucket, an anvil, two chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?" </p>\n<p>The lady said: "Set the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the anvil on top of the bucket and I''ll hold the chickens...." </p>\n<p>Submitted by calamjo<br /> Editted by curtis

Customer: "Your sound card is defective and I want a new one."<br /> Tech Support: "What seems to be the problem?"<br /> Customer: "The balance is backwards. The left channel is coming out of the right speaker and the right channel is coming out the left.<br /> It''s defective!"<br /> Tech Support: "You can solve the problem by moving the left speaker to the right side of the machine and vice versa."<br /> Customer: (sputter) (click)<br /> Tech Support: (snicker) </p>\n<p>**************** </p>\n<p>I had been doing Tech Support for Hewlett-Packard''s DeskJet division for about a month when I had a customer call with a problem I just couldn''t solve. She could not print yellow. All the other colors would print fine, which truly baffled me because the only true colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. For instance, green is a combination of cyan and yellow, but green printed fine. </p>\n<p>Every color of the rainbow printed fine except for yellow. I had the customer change ink cartridges. I had the customer delete and reinstall the drivers. Nothing worked. I asked my co-workers for help; they offered no new ideas. </p>\n<p>After over two hours of troubleshooting, I was about to tell the customer to send the printer in to us for repair when she asked quietly, </p>\n<p>"Should I try printing on a piece of white paper instead of this "yellow" construction paper?" </p>\n<p>******************* </p>\n<p>A man attempting to set up his new printer called the printer''s tech support number, complaining about the error message: "Can''t find the printer." </p>\n<p>On the phone, the man said he even held the printer up in front of the screen, but the computer still couldn''t find it! (YEE-HAW!) </p>\n<p>***************** </p>\n<p>Customer: "Hello? I''m trying to dial in. I installed the software okay, and it dialed fine. I could hear that. Then I could hear the two computers connecting. But then the sound all stopped, so I picked up the phone to see if they were still connected, and I got the message, ''No Carrier,'' on my screen. What''s wrong?" </p>\n<p>***************** </p>\n<p>An unfailingly polite lady called to ask for help with a Windows installation that had gone terribly wrong. </p>\n<p>Customer: "I brought my Windows disks from work to install them on my<br /> home computer." (Training stresses that we are "not the Soft-ware Police," so I let the little act of piracy slide.)<br /> Tech Support: "Umm-hmm. What happened?"<br /> Customer: "As I put each disk in it turns out they weren''t initialized." </p>\n<p>Tech Support: "Do you remember the message exactly, ma''am?"<br /> Customer:(proudly) "I wrote it down. ''This is not a Macintosh disk. Would you like to initialize it''?"<br /> Tech Support: "Er, what happened next?"<br /> Customer: "After they were initialized all the disks appeared to be blank. And now I brought them back to work, and I can''t read them in the A: drive; the PC wants to format them. And this is our only set of Windows disks for the whole office. Did I do something wrong?" </p>\n<p>****************** </p>\n<p>For a computer programming class, I sat directly across from someone, and our computers were facing away from each other. </p>\n<p>A few minutes into the class, she got up to leave the room. I reached between our computers and switched the inputs for the keyboards. She came back and started typing and immediately got a distressed look on her face. </p>\n<p>She called the teacher over and explained that no matter what she typed, nothing would happen. The teacher tried everything. By this time I was hiding behind my monitor and quaking red-faced. </p>\n<p>I started to type, "Leave me alone!" </p>\n<p>They both jumped back, silenced. "What the . . . " the teacher said.<br /> I typed, "I said leave me alone!" </p>\n<p>The kid got real upset. "I didn''t do anything to it, I swear!"<br /> It was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud. The conversation between them and HAL 2000 went on for an amazing five minutes. </p>\n<p>Me: "Don''t touch me!" </p>\n<p>Her: "I''m sorry, I didn''t mean to hit your keys that hard." </p>\n<p>Me: "Who do you think you are anyway?!" Etc. Finally, I couldn''t contain myself any longer and fell out of my chair laughing. </p>\n<p>After they had realized what I had done, they both turned beet red. Funny, I never got more than a C- in that class. </p>\n<p>*************** </p>\n<p>I have a friend who just bought a computer and was instructed to load a program by typing "A:" and then the name of the program. My friend told me it would not work because his keyboard was no good. He said he couldn''t type the "dot over dot thingie" and that every time he tried to type the "dot over dot thingie" he kept getting the "dot over comma thingie" no matter how careful he was to press only on the very top of<br /> the key.<br /> When I taught him about the shift key, he thought I was a genius. </p>\n<p>***************** </p>\n<p>This guy calls in to complain that he gets an "Access Denied" message every time he logs in. It turned out he was typing his user name and password in capital letters.<br /> Tech Support: "OK, let''s try once more, but use lower case letters." Customer: "Uh, I only have capital letters on my keyboard." </p>\n<p>**************** </p>\n<p>Email from a friend: "CanYouFixTheSpaceBarOnMyKeyboard?" </p>\n<p>**************** </p>\n<p>My friend was on duty in the main lab on a quiet afternoon. He noticed a young woman sitting in front of one of the workstations with her arms crossed across her chest and staring at the screen. After about 15 minutes he noticed that she was still in the same position only now she was impatiently tapping her foot. He asked if she needed help and she replied, "It''s about time! I pushed the F1 button over twenty minutes ago!"<br /> ****************

Ryan rents an apartment in New York and goes to the lobby to put his name on the group mailbox. While he is there, an attractive young lady comes out of the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing a robe. Ryan smiles at the young girl and she strikes up a conversation with him. As they talk, her robe slips open, and it''s quite obvious that she has nothing under the robe. Poor Ryan breaks out into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact. After a few minutes, she places her hand on his arm and says, "Let''s go in my apartment, I can hear someone coming."</p>\n<p>He proceeds with her into the apartment, and after she closes the door, she leans against it allowing her robe to fall off completely. Being completely nude, she purrs at him, "What would you say is my best feature?"</p>\n<p>The flustered, embarrassed Ryan stammers, clears his throat several times, and finally squeaks out, "Oh, it''s got to be your ears!"</p>\n<p>She''s astounded! "Why my ears? Look at these breasts! They are full, don''t sag and they''re 100% natural! My buns -- they are firm and do not sag and have no cellulite! Look at this skin -- no blemishes, or scars! Why in heaven''s name would you say my ears are the best part of my body?!"</p>\n<p>Clearing his throat once again, Ryan stammers, "Outside when you said you heard someone coming -- that was me."

The last 5 minutes of any TV show will explain the entire plot.</p>\n<p>50. The last 5 minutes of any TV show will be stretched out for 20 minutes with commercials.</p>\n<p>51. The crazed killer always steps out from behind the door without the victim seeing or hearing him until he is about to drive a huge carving knife or pitchfork into them.</p>\n<p>52. Whenever someone hears a noise in the dark they always have to check it out.</p>\n<p>53. The crazed killer always walks and still catches the person he wants to kill.</p>\n<p>54. All people chasing someone can catch up to a constant distance behind them quickly, but can''t use that speed to actually catch the person they''re chasing.</p>\n<p>55. No-one ever locks a car when they get out of it (even in New York).

A bloke goes into a pub.<br /> The barmaid asks what he wants. </p>\n<p>''I want to put my head between your tits, and lick the sweat off,'' he<br /> replies.</p>\n<p>''You dirty bastard!'' shouts the barmaid, ''Get out before I get my<br /> husband.''</p>\n<p>The bloke apologizes and says he will never do it again. </p>\n<p>The barmaid, disgusted, accepts his apology and asks what he wants again.</p>\n<p>''I want to pull down your knickers, spread cottage cheese between your arise<br /> cheeks and lick it off,'' he replies.</p>\n<p>''What???'' screams the barmaid, ''that''s it!

With Viagra such a hit, Pfizer Pharmacuticals is bringing forth a whole line of drugs oriented towards improving the performance of men in today''s society. According to company spokesman, Peter Riser, the following drugs are under testing now:</p>\n<p>DIRECTRA - a dose of this drug given to men before leaving on car trips caused 72 percent of them to stop and ask directions when they got lost, compared to a control group of 0.2 percent.</p>\n<p>PROJECTRA - Men given this experimental new drug were far more likely to actually finish a household repair project before starting a new one.</p>\n<p>CHILDAGRA - Men taking this drug reported a sudden, over-whelming urge to perform more child-care tasks - especially cleaning up spills and "little" accidents.</p>\n<p>COMPLIMENTRA - In clinical trials, 82 percent of middle-aged men administered this drug noticed that their wives had a new hairstyle. Currently being tested to see if its effects extend to noticing new clothing.</p>\n<p>BUYAGRA - Married and otherwise attached men reported a sudden urge to buy their sweeties expensive jewelry and gifts after taking this drug for only two days. Still to be seen: whether the drug can be continued for a period longer than your favorite store''s return limit.</p>\n<p>NEGA-VIAGRA - Has the exact opposite effect of Viagra. Currently undergoing clinical trials on sitting U.S. presidents.</p>\n<p>NEGA-SPORTAGRA - This drug had the strange effect of making men want to turn off televised sports and actually converse with other family members.</p>\n<p>FLATULAGRA - This complex drug converts men''s noxious intestinal gases back into food solids. Special bonus: Dosage can be doubled for long car rides.</p>\n<p>FLYAGRA - This drug has been showing great promise in treating men with O.F.D. (Open Fly Disorder). Especially useful for men on Viagra.</p>\n<p>PRYAGRA - About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men in the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal affairs of other people. Note: Apparent overdose turned three test subjects into "special prosecutors."</p>\n<p>LIAGRA - This drug causes men to be less than truthful when being asked about their sexual affairs. Will be available in Regular, Grand Jury and Presidential Strength versions.<br /> ----------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The National Organzation For Women is lobbying congress and the FDA to make these new drugs available for sale over the counter, as well as available in men''s rooms everywhere.</p>\n<p>In order to appeal to a boader customer base, Pfizer is also developing the following drugs intended primarily for women:</p>\n<p>NagAgra -  Causes Women not to nag their spouse.</p>\n<p>HonydewAgra - Causes women to actually do house hold maintenance instead of just writing things down.</p>\n<p>InformAgra - Causes women to tell their spouses about plans they have made that involve said spouse.</p>\n<p>Butt-outAgra - Causes women not to pry into the personal lives of others and mind their own business.</p>\n<p>PersonalAgra - Causes women not to discuss their sex lives with aquaintances of their spouse</p>\n<p>SportAgra - Makes women understand the male need for consuming large quantities of fermented beverages while watching contact sports.</p>\n<p>Cindi CrawfordAgra - Need I say more?
A rogue guide dog has been destroyed after leading four of its blind owners<br /> to their deaths.</p>\n<p>Charity workers were last night facing an investigation into how<br /> four-year-old Labrador Gamer was allowed to continue his murderous spree.<br /> Officials have admitted how: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Victim Nunmber 1 was dragged under the wheels of a bus. </li>\n<li>Victim Nunmber 2 drowned when she was led off the end of a pier. </li>\n<li>Victim Nunmber 3 was shoved into the path of a speeding train. </li>\n<li>Victim Nunmber 4 was left stranded as a truck mowed him down. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Trainer Rudi Jones, 48, told newsmen in South Africa:<br /> "He was basically a good dog who needed brushing up on his skills.It''s so<br /> sad that he had to be put down."</p>\n<p>Gamer''s terror trail began with the death of 43-year-old Selmer Draznower<br /> from Johannesburg. Witnesses told how Gamer dragged his master under the<br /> wheels of an approaching bus before scampering off.</p>\n<p>Amazingly, Gamer was then given to 68-year-old Wilma Hassamore who survived<br /> just three months after his arrival.  Gamer decided to cut short her<br /> seaside holiday by leading her off the end of a pier. The dog pulled back<br /> at the last second but Wilma plunged into the sea and drowned.</p>\n<p>Next was Marvin Wurtenheim, 28, who thought his prayers had been answered<br /> when Gamer arrived. But the misguided mutt butted Marvin off a railway<br /> platform.</p>\n<p>Unbelievably, the dog was then given to retired Clarence MacDuff, 67, also<br /> from Johannesburg. As Gamer was guiding the unlucky Clarence to his doctor,<br /> the hapless hound dragged him under the wheels of a delivery truck.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for the Guide Dogs For The Blind Association, in Durban, South<br /> Africa, said: "We had no choice but to have him put down."</p>\n<p>Last night, the chief trainer for Britain''s Guide Dogs For The Blind<br /> Association, Bob Steele, said: "This could never happen here. If there are<br /> any doubts about the animal, it is dropped from our training programme at<br /> once."
A couple of elderly gentleman are playing a leisurely round of golf one fine<br /> afternoon when the gentleman lining up his tee shot notices a funeral procession<br /> approaching on a nearby road. He stops what he''s doing, removes his cap, and<br /> stands in silence as the procession passes by. His fellow golfer stands watching<br /> in astonishment, "that was very decent of you Frank!" he stutters. "Aye�酶惟, says<br /> Frank putting his cap back on "she was a good wife to me".
1. Golf can best be defined as an endless series of tragedies obscured by the<br /> occasional miracle.</p>\n<p>2. "I wish I could play my normal game...just once."</p>\n<p>3. "Golf is harder than baseball. In golf, you have to play your foul balls."</p>\n<p>4. If you find you do not mind playing golf in the rain, the snow, even during<br /> a hurricane, here''s a valuable tip: your life is in trouble.</p>\n<p>5. Golfers who try to make everything perfect before taking the shot rarely<br /> make a perfect shot.</p>\n<p>6. The term "mulligan" is really a contraction of the phrase "maul it again."</p>\n<p>7. A "gimme" can best be defined as an agreement between two golfers...neither<br /> of whom can putt very well.</p>\n<p>8. An interesting thing about golf is that no matter how badly you play;it is<br /> always possible to get worse.</p>\n<p>9. Golf''s a hard game to figure. One day you''ll go out and slice it and shank<br /> it, hit into all the traps and miss every green. The next day you go out and for<br /> no reason at all you really stink.</p>\n<p>10.I play in the low 80s. If it''s any hotter than that, I won''t play.

One day in class the teacher brought a bag full of fruit. </p>\n<p>"Now class, I''m going to reach into the bag and describe a piece of fruit, and you tell what fruit I''m talking about." </p>\n<p>"Okay, first: it''s round, plump and red." </p>\n<p>Of course, Johnny raised his hand high, but the teacher, wisely ignored him and picked Deborah, who promptly answered, "An apple." </p>\n<p>The teacher replied, "No, Deborah, it''s a beet, but I like your thinking." </p>\n<p>"Now for the second. It''s soft, fuzzy,and colored red and brownish." </p>\n<p>Johnny is hopping up and down in his seat trying to get the teacher to call on him. But she skips him again and calls on Billy. </p>\n<p>"Is it a peach?" Billy asks. "No, Billy, I''m afraid it''s a potato. But I like your thinking," the teacher replies. </p>\n<p>"Here''s another: it''s long, yellow, and fairly hard." </p>\n<p>By now Johnny is about to explode as he waves his hand frantically. The teacher skips him again and calls on Sally. </p>\n<p>"A banana," she says. </p>\n<p>"No," the teacher replies, "it''s a squash, but I like your thinking." </p>\n<p>Johnny is kind of irritated now, so he speaks up loudly. "Hey, I''ve got one for you teacher; let me put my hand in my pocket. Okay, I''ve got it: it''s round, hard, and it has a head on it." </p>\n<p>"Johnny!" she cries. "That''s disgusting!" </p>\n<p>"Nope," answers Johnny, "it''s a quarter, but I like your thinking!" </p>\n<p>Submitted by Curtis<br /> Edited by Glaci

The other day I went to the local religious book store where I saw a "HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on my back bumper and I''m glad I did. </p>\n<p>What an uplifting experience followed. That bumper sticker really worked!!</p>\n<p>I found lots of people who loved Jesus. </p>\n<p>I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. </p>\n<p>He must REALLY love Jesus because pretty soon he leaned out of his window and yelled "JESUS CHRIST!" as loud as he could. </p>\n<p>It was like a football game with him shouting, "GO!...JESUS CHRIST!...GO!" Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out the window and smiled and waved to all those loving people. </p>\n<p>There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I heard him yell something about a sunny beach and saw him waving with only his middle finger. </p>\n<p>I asked my kids what he meant by that and they laughed and said it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So I leaned out of the window and gave him the good luck sign back. </p>\n<p>A couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started running towards me! </p>\n<p>I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed so I stepped on the gas. </p>\n<p>It''s a good thing that I did because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. </p>\n<p>I looked back and everyone was still standing there so I leaned way out the window and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away. </p>\n<p>Praise the Lord for such wonderful people!

The five toughest questions women ask - and their answers:<br /> 1. `What are you thinking?''<br /> 2. `Do you love me?''<br /> 3. `Do I look fat?''<br /> 4. `Do you think she''s prettier than me?''<br /> 5. `What would you do if I died?''</p>\n<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example:</p>\n<p>1. `What are you thinking?''<br /> The proper answer to this question, of course, is: ''I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you.'' Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things:<br /> a - football.<br /> b - baseball.<br /> c - How fat you are.<br /> d - How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>The best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married with Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. His answer: ''If I wanted you to know I''d be talking instead of thinking''</p>\n<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers:</p>\n<p>2. ''Do you love me?''<br /> The correct answer to this question is, ''Yes.''<br /> For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer. ''Yes dear.'' </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I suppose so.<br /> b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> c - That depends on what you mean by ''love''.<br /> d - Does it matter?<br /> e - Who, me?</p>\n<p>3. ''Do I look fat?''<br /> The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state,<br /> ''No, of course not'' and then quickly leave the room. </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either.<br /> b - Compared to what?<br /> c - A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d - I''ve seen fatter.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>\n<p>4. ''Do you think she''s prettier than me?''<br /> The ''she'' in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passerby you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw.<br /> In any case, the correct response is: ''No, you are much prettier.'' </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.<br /> b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things.<br /> c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.<br /> d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>\n<p>5. ''What would you do if I died?'' </p>\n<p>Correct answer: ''Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first truck that came my way.''</p>\n<p>This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke:</p>\n<p>''Dear,'' said the wife, `what would you do if I died?'' </p>\n<p>''why, dear, I would be extremely upset,'' said the husband. ''Why do you ask such a question?'' </p>\n<p>''Would you remarry?'' persevered the wife. </p>\n<p>''No, of course not, dear,'' said the husband. </p>\n<p>''Don''t you like being married?'' said the wife. </p>\n<p>''Of course I do, dear,'' he said. </p>\n<p>''Then why wouldn''t you remarry?'' </p>\n<p>''All right,'' said the husband, ''I''d remarry.'' </p>\n<p>''You would?'' said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>\n<p>''Yes,'' said the husband. </p>\n<p>`Would you sleep with her in our bed?'' said the wife after a long pause. </p>\n<p>''Well yes, I suppose I would,'' replied the husband. </p>\n<p>''I see,'' said the wife indignantly. ''And would you let her wear my old clothes?'' </p>\n<p>''I suppose, if she wanted to,'' said the husband. </p>\n<p>''Really,'' said the wife icily. `And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?'' </p>\n<p>''Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do.'' </p>\n<p>''Is that so?'' said the wife, leaping to her feet. ''And I suppose you''d let her play with my golf clubs, too.'' </p>\n<p>''Of course not, dear,'' said the husband. ''She''s left-handed.''

Yo mama so short when she got off the bus she yelled to everybody, "please dont spit because i dont know how to swim!!"
THE COWBOY CODE</p>\n<p>1.  A cowboy removes his hat when entering the presence of a lady, although he may leave it on if she works in a saloon.</p>\n<p>2. A cowboy says EXCUSE ME, MA''AM, when leaving a lady''s presence.</p>\n<p>3.  A cowboy says PARDON ME, MA''AM, when bumping into a lady, or treading on her feet.</p>\n<p>4.  A cowboy never sits, while a lady is standing, unless he feels particularly tired, or his feet hurt.</p>\n<p>5.  A cowboy allows a lady to go through a doorway, first, especially if he thinks one of his enemies may try to shoot him in a cowardly ambush. She would provide good cover.</p>\n<p>6 . A cowboy does not spit on the floor, but if he does, he will point it out to the ladies so they will not drag their skirts through it.</p>\n<p>7.  A cowboy never tracks horse poop into a lady''s house. He should leave his boots outside the door, unless his feet stink as bad as the horse poop, in which case, he should just go someplace else. Maybe the saloon, where the stench of horse poop is no worse than the stench of cow poop.</p>\n<p>8.  A cowboy does not pick his nose at the table, unless it will help him breath better or eliminate a whistle that otherwise might become annoying to the ladies.</p>\n<p>9.  A cowboy does not scratch his groin, his armpits, or suck on the ends of his mustache, when a lady is near.</p>\n<p>10. A cowboy does not swear or make reference to bodily functions, in the presence of a lady.</p>\n<p>11. A cowboy must not sneeze at the table. If a strong need arises that cannot be resisted, he will turn his head away from the lady, so she won''t be sprayed and perhaps be struck by a stray booger.</p>\n<p>12. A cowboy does not noisily slurp his coffee in the presence of a  lady. Instead, he should hold the saucer steady with both hands, tip it toward his mouth, and slurp silently.</p>\n<p>13. A cowboy does not fart in the presence of a lady...not even silently. If he does, it might stink, and she may smell it and possibly think that he is not actually a gentleman.</p>\n<p>14. A cowboy will grasp a lady''s elbow to help her onto a horse or into a carriage. He should never, ever push on her derriere to give her a boost, because she might kick his teeth out, unless she works in the saloon.

There were three guys sitting behind three nuns at a football game. The men<br /> decided to antagonize the nuns, to get them to move. So the first guy says to<br /> the others (loud enough for the women ahead to hear), "I think I want to move to<br /> California, there are only 100 Catholics living there."</p>\n<p>The second guy speaks up and says, "I want to move to Washington, there are<br /> only 50 Catholics living there." The third guy speaks up and says, "I want to<br /> move to Idaho, there are only 25 Catholics living there."</p>\n<p>One of the nuns turns around, looks the third guy in the eye and calmly says,<br /> "Why don''t you go to hell? There aren''t any Catholics there."

Dear Tech Support:</p>\n<p>I am desperate for some help. I recently upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that the new program began unexpected child processing and also took up a lot of space and valuable resources. This wasn''t mentioned in the product brochure.</p>\n<p>In addition Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialisation where it monitors all other system activity.</p>\n<p>Applications such as Boys Night Out 2.5, and Golf 5.3 no longer run and crash the system whenever selected. Attempting to operate Sunday Football 6.3 always fails but Saturday Shopping 7.1 runs instead. I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background whilst attempting to run any of my favourite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0 but de-install doesn''t work on this program.</p>\n<p>Can you please help!<br /> Joe.</p>\n<p>Dear Joe,</p>\n<p>This is a very common problem resulting from a basic misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>Many men upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 thinking that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT program. Whereas Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM designed by its creator to run everything.</p>\n<p>You are unlikely to be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0 as Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this and it is impossible to de-install, delete or purge the program files from the system once installed.</p>\n<p>Some people have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0, but have<br /> ended up with even more problems. (See in manual under Alimony/Child Support and Solicitors Fees). Having Wife 1.0 installed myself I recommend you keep it installed and deal with the difficulties as best you can.</p>\n<p>When any faults or problems occur, whatever you think has caused them, you must run the C: IAPOLOGISE program and avoid attempting to use the *Esc-key. It may be necessary to run C: I APOLOGISE a number of times, but hopefully eventually the operating system will return to normal.</p>\n<p>Wife 1.0 although a very high maintenance program can be very rewarding. To get the most out of it consider buying additional software such as Flowers 2.0 and Chocolates 5.0.</p>\n<p>Do not under any circumstances install Secretary (Short Skirt version) as this is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and the system will almost certainly crash.</p>\n<p>Best of luck!<br /> Tech Support

What do you call a guy with no arms and no legs water skiing?</p>\n<p>- Skip
There once was a gay guy that was very desperate for some good<br /> loving. He had just gotten dumped by an amazing guy. He had a<br /> very long, hard day so he decided to go to a bar and have a few<br /> drinks.He went to the bar, had a drink and sat down. In came two<br /> guys who had just came from a long game of tennis. One of the<br /> guys said to the bartender"Oh my god! I am so thirsty. I would<br /> drink the sweat off of a cows balls." suddenly the guy runs up<br /> to the tennis player and yells "moomooomoomooo!"

Three guys died and when they got to the pearly gates, St. Peter met them<br /> there.<br /> St. Peter said, "I know that you guys are forgiven because you''re here. But<br /> before I let you into heaven, I have to ask you a couple of questions. Make sure<br /> you tell the truth because if you don''t, we''ll have to ask you to visit the<br /> beast below. Your answers will also determine what kind of car you will get. You<br /> have to have a car here in heaven because it is so huge!"<br /> St. Peter asked the first man, "How long were you married?"<br /> The guy replied, "24 years."<br /> St. Peter then asked, "Did you ever cheat on your wife?"<br /> The guy said, "Yeah, about 10 times... but you said I was forgiven."<br /> Peter said, "Yes, but that''s not too good. Here''s a Pinto for you to drive."<br /> The second guy got the same questions from Peter to whom he replied, "I was<br /> married for 41 years and cheated on her only once, but that was during our first<br /> year and we worked it out. I was faithful thereafter."<br /> Peter said, "I''m pleased to hear that. Here''s a Mercedes SUV for you to<br /> drive."<br /> The third guy said, "Peter, I know what you''re going to ask. I was married for<br /> 63 years and didn''t even look at another woman! I treated my wife like a queen!" </p>\n<p>Peter said, "Now that''s what I like to hear! Here''s a Jaguar for you to<br /> drive."<br /> A little while later, the two guys with the Lincoln and the Pinto saw the guy<br /> with the Jaguar crying on the golden sidewalk, so they went to see what the<br /> matter was. When they asked him what was wrong he wearily said, "I just saw my<br /> wife and she was on a skateboard!"
A little boy was overheard talking to himself as he strutted through the backyard, wearing his baseball cap and toting a ball and bat. "I''m the greatest hitter in the world," he<br /> announced.</p>\n<p>Then, he tossed the ball into the air, swung at it, and missed.</p>\n<p>"Strike One!" he yelled. Undaunted, he picked up the ball and said again, "I''m the greatest hitter in the world!"</p>\n<p>He tossed the ball into the air. When it came down he swung again and missed. "Strike Two!" he cried.</p>\n<p>The boy then paused a moment to examine his bat and ball carefully. He spit on his hands and rubbed them together. He straightened his cap and said once more, "I''m the greatest<br /> hitter in the world!"</p>\n<p>Again he tossed the ball up in the air and swung at it. He missed. "Strike Three!"</p>\n<p>"Wow!" he exclaimed. "I''m also the greatest pitcher in the world!"

There was this basically-good man who died and appeared before St. Peter at<br /> the Holy Gates. St. Peter checks out his books and discovers that there is a<br /> problem. He says that there is no clear answer in the books on where the man is<br /> supposed to go, Heaven or Hell. He suggests that the man go to Hell and check it<br /> out, so that he may make the decision himself. If he didn''t like what he saw<br /> there, he could come back to Heaven. </p>\n<p>Well, this man had only one true vice while he was alive. It seems he had an<br /> uncontrollable desire to play golf at any opportunity. He had traveled the world<br /> playing all the famous golf courses. </p>\n<p>When the man arrived in Hell, Satan welcomed him, but he too was surprised at<br /> the man''s situation. He had assumed that since the question about the man''s<br /> ultimate destination wasn''t clear, the man would go to Heaven. The man could<br /> just see behind Satan a Most Beautiful Golf Course. It had beautiful trees, blue<br /> ponds, water separating the fairways, everything. The man fell in love with at<br /> at first site, and he couldn''t control himself. He just had to play a round. </p>\n<p>The devil showed him a wonderful electric golf cart, a perfect leather bag, a<br /> matched set of clubs. Satan reached into his pocket and presented the man with a<br /> Golden Tee. The devil then said that only members could play. The man couldn''t<br /> control himself. He just had to play there. </p>\n<p>He goes back up to Heaven and tells St. Peter that he has decided to stay in<br /> Hell so he could play on the Beautiful Golf Course there. When the man returns<br /> to Hell, he approaches Satan and asks for a tee time. The devil says that<br /> anytime at all, the man could play. No one else uses the course. </p>\n<p>Chuckling with glee, the man approaches the first tee. He gets out of his<br /> beautiful golf cart, reaches for his perfectly matched clubs and selects his<br /> driver, reaches into his pants pocket and pulls out his Golden Tee, then<br /> frantically searches everywhere for a ball. </p>\n<p>Satan comes up and the man asks him for a ball. </p>\n<p>"That''s the Hell of it," says Satan with a devilish laugh.

Question: Why did the chicken cross the road?</p>\n<p>KINDERGARTEN TEACHER: To get to the other side.</p>\n<p>PLATO: For the greater good.</p>\n<p>ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross roads.</p>\n<p>KARL MARX: It was a historical inevitability.</p>\n<p>TIMOTHY LEARY: Because that''s the only trip the establishment<br /> would let it take.</p>\n<p>SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we<br /> were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.</p>\n<p>RONALD REAGAN: I forget.</p>\n<p>CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone<br /> before.</p>\n<p>HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.</p>\n<p>ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken''s side of the<br /> road was threatening its dominant market position. The chicken<br /> was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the<br /> competencies required for the newly competitive market. Andersen<br /> Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped<br /> the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and<br /> implementation processes. Using the Poultry Integration Model<br /> (PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its skills,<br /> methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to align the<br /> chicken''s people, processes and technology in support of its<br /> overall strategy within a Program Management framework. Andersen<br /> Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts<br /> and best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep<br /> skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day<br /> itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal<br /> knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them<br /> to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit<br /> goals of delivering and successfully architecting and<br /> implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the<br /> continuum of poultry cross-median processes. The meeting was<br /> held in a park-like setting, enabling and creating an impactful<br /> environment which was strategically based, industry-focused, and<br /> built upon a consistent, clear, and unified market message and<br /> aligned with the chicken''s mission, vision, and core values.<br /> This was conducive towards the creation of a total business<br /> integration solution. Andersen Consulting helped the chicken<br /> change to become more successful.</p>\n<p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man.<br /> The chicken ''crossed'' the black man in order to trample him and<br /> keep him down.</p>\n<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens<br /> will be free to cross roads without having their motives called<br /> into question.</p>\n<p>MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the<br /> chicken, "Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed<br /> the road, and there was much rejoicing.</p>\n<p>FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How<br /> many more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?</p>\n<p>RICHARD M. NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat,<br /> the chicken did NOT cross the road.</p>\n<p>MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who<br /> cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever<br /> motive there was.</p>\n<p>JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why<br /> doesn''t anyone ever think to ask, What the heck was this chicken<br /> doing walking around all over the place, anyway?"</p>\n<p>FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken<br /> crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.</p>\n<p>BILL GATES: I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000,<br /> which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your<br /> important documents, and balance your checkbook.</p>\n<p>OLIVER STONE: The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross<br /> the road?" Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same<br /> time, whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken<br /> crossing?"</p>\n<p>DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been<br /> naturally selected in such a way that they are now genetically<br /> disposed to cross roads.</p>\n<p>EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved<br /> beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.</p>\n<p>BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.</p>\n<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road .. it<br /> transcended it.</p>\n<p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die.

Sid and Barney head out for their usual 9 holes. Sid offers Barney, "let''s say we make the time worth the while, at least for one of us, and spot $5 on the lowest score for the day." </p>\n<p>Barney agrees and they enjoy a great game. After the 8th hole, Barney is ahead by 1 stroke, but cuts his ball into the rough on the 9th. </p>\n<p>"Help me find my ball, you look over there," he says to Sid. </p>\n<p>After 5 minutes, neither has had any luck, and since a lost ball carries a four-point penalty, Barney pulls a ball from his pocket and tosses it to the ground. </p>\n<p>"I''ve found my ball!" he announces triumphantly. </p>\n<p>Sid looks at him forlornly, "After all the years we''ve been friends, you''d cheat me on golf for a measly five bucks?!?" </p>\n<p>"What do you mean cheat? I found my ball sitting right here!" </p>\n<p>"And a liar, too!!!" Sid says with amazement. "I''ll have you know I''ve been standing on your ball for the last five minutes!"
A lady was a huge Paul MCCartney fan and wanted a tattoo of him on the inside of her thigh. She went to the parlour and told the guy what she wanted.</p>\n<p>He says: "OK, take your skirt and underwear off and sit in the chair with your legs apart".</p>\n<p>She did that and he started on the tattoo. Pretty soon he''s done, blows off the dust and admires his work.</p>\n<p>"Who the heck''s that?" she says.<br /> "It''s Paul McCartney", he replies.</p>\n<p>"Doesn''t look like him at all" says she. "Now get it right or I''ll report you".</p>\n<p>So the tattooist starts on the other thigh. Really trying hard to do a better job. Finally he''s done, blows off the dust and feels pretty good.</p>\n<p>The woman is pissed off "No way that''s Paul Mccartney" she says.<br /> "It bloody well is" says the man. "Listen I''ll get a second opinion"</p>\n<p>He goes out of his store and grabs the first person he sees. The guy is a drunk who''s been stumbling along the sidewalk. The tattooist drags the drunk into his store. There''s the woman, sitting legs apart with nothing on below her waist.</p>\n<p>The tattoist says to the drunk (pointing at the womans legs)...<br /> "Tell me who the hell you think that is".</p>\n<p>The drunk says (in a drunken slur voice), "I''ve no idea who the people are on her thighs but the guy in the middle is a dead ringer for Willie Nelson"!

During the Super Bowl, there was another football game of note between the big<br /> animals and the small animals. The big animals were crushing small animals and<br /> at half-time, the coach made a passionate speech to rally the little animals.<br /> At the start of the second half the big animals had the ball. The first play,<br /> the elephant got stopped for no gain. The second play, the rhino was stopped for<br /> no gain. On third down, the hippo was thrown for a 5 yard loss. </p>\n<p>The defense huddled around the coach and he asked excitedly,<br /> "Who stopped the elephant?" </p>\n<p>"I did," said the centipede. </p>\n<p>"Who stopped the rhino?" </p>\n<p>"Uh, that was me too," said the centipede. </p>\n<p>"And how about the hippo? Who hit him for a 5 yard loss?" </p>\n<p>"Well, that was me as well," said the centipede. </p>\n<p>"So where were you during the first half?" demanded the coach. </p>\n<p>"Well," said the centipede, "I was having my ankles taped."

Indians capture 3 people they want to kill for skin for a canoe.<br /> An American, a Russian, and a Frenchman. The Indians ask the<br /> Frenchman "How would you like to die?" The Frenchman said "I<br /> want to be hung." So the Indians hang him. They ask the Russian<br /> "How do you want to die?" The Russian said "I want to be<br /> poisoned." So the Indians poison him. Then they ask the<br /> American"How do you want to die?" The American says "I want to<br /> be forked." "What''s forked?" asked the Indians. "Give me and<br /> I''ll show you." So the American takes the fork and pounds it on<br /> his chest saying "Screw your canoe!"

An Erie, Pennsylvania executive with a new young wife and a yen for golf<br /> decided about December one year that he couldn''t take it any longer.  So he<br /> said to his wife one evening, "Honey, next Friday we''re going to Hilton Head<br /> for the weekend.  We''ll get a condo on the golf course and I''m going to play<br /> golf all weekend."</p>\n<p>"That sounds fine," she purred.  And, sure enough, next Saturday morning at 6<br /> a.m., found him on the golf course, all alone.  After playing two holes, he<br /> noticed a man carrying a golf bag walking toward him across a fairway.  The<br /> exec. waited, and the other man arrived, saying, "Mind if I play along?"</p>\n<p>The exec. said, "Fine.  Glad to have the company."</p>\n<p>All went well for a couple of holes, until each approached the sixth green.<br /> When the new fellow laid down his clubs, the cover came off one club.  The<br /> exec. noticed, however, that it wasn''t a club at all.  It was a high powered<br /> rifle.</p>\n<p>"Whoa," he said.  "That''s a high powered rifle!"</p>\n<p>"Look," said the other man.  "I''m not out to cause any trouble.  If you want me<br /> to leave, I will.  No hard feelings."</p>\n<p>"No. No," said the exec.  "I''m just curious as to why you have a high-powered<br /> rifle in your bag."</p>\n<p>The other man pondered for a moment and then said, "Well, I''ll tell you.  It''s<br /> my business.  It''s what I do for a living."</p>\n<p>"Wow," said the other.  "I''ve heard about guys like you, but I''ve never met one<br /> before."</p>\n<p>"Still want me to play?" said the other.</p>\n<p>"Sure," said the Erie exec.  "As a matter of fact, you know, I do a little<br /> hunting.  Would you mind if I look at it?"</p>\n<p>The other man showed him the rifle.  It was beautiful--an inlaid Weatherby with<br /> a huge powerful scope mounted on it.</p>\n<p>The exec. picked it up, looked through the scope, and said, "Gee, I can see the<br /> window of my condo with this thing.  Matter of fact, there''s my wife."  He<br /> lowered the gun for a moment and said, "she doesn''t have any clothes on."  He<br /> looked through the scope again.  "Damn, there''s a guy with her."</p>\n<p>The Erie exec. lowered the rifle and looked at the other man.  "How much do you<br /> charge?"</p>\n<p>"$10,000 a bullet," said the man.</p>\n<p>The Erie man thought for a moment, and said, "Do it."</p>\n<p>"Which one?" said the hit man.</p>\n<p>"Both," said the exec.</p>\n<p>"That''s $20,000, you know."</p>\n<p>"I don''t care.  hit ''em both."</p>\n<p>The hit man took two cartridges from his bag and loaded the rifle.  "Where do<br /> you want me to get the man?"  he asked.</p>\n<p>"You know where to hit him," said the exec.</p>\n<p>"How about the woman?"</p>\n<p>"In the mouth.  She''s always flapping her gums anyway."</p>\n<p>"Ok," said the hit man as he raised the rifle.  Taking careful aim, he clicked<br /> off the safety, but then he paused and chuckled.  "Mister," he said, "I think<br /> I''m going to be able to save you ten thousand dollars."
One day a man was dumped by his girlfriend and goes to a bar. He<br /> sits down and orders a beer. He turns to his left and sees a gay<br /> guy smiling at him. The gay guy asks him if he would play "Bar<br /> Football" with him. The man was very drunk and says, "What the<br /> hell, how do you play?" The gay guy says, "What you do is take a<br /> beer and chug it down without stopping, that''s 6 pionts. Then<br /> for the extra piont you must pull your pants down and lay a big<br /> fart."</p>\n<p>The gay guy takes his beer and chugs it down, pulls down his<br /> pants and lays a high piched fart. The gay guy says, "Your<br /> turn!". The man takes his beer and chugs it down. The gay guy<br /> says "6 pionts!" As the man pulls his pants down the gay guy<br /> whips his penis out and sticks it up the man''s ass and starts<br /> screaming, "Block that kick, block that kick!!!"
There were these three guys at a football game and it just so happened that they were sitting behind three nuns. They couldn''t see really well over their habits, so one of the guys says, "Man, I wish I lived in Ohio, there''s only 25 Catholics there." One of the other guys says, "Well, I wish I lived in Idaho because there is only 20 Catholics there." Then the last guy says, "Well, I wish I lived in Oregon there are only 15 Catholics there.

A fellow, who had spent his whole life in the desert, comes to visit a friend. He''d never seen a train or the tracks they run on. While standing in the middle of the railroad tracks one day, he hears this whistle -- Whooee da Whoee! -- but doesn''t know what it is. Predictably, he''s hit and is thrown to the side of the tracks. It was only a glancing blow, so he was fortunate to receive some minor internal injuries, a few broken bones, and some bruises. After weeks in the hospital recovering, he''s at his friend''s house attending a party one evening. While in the kitchen, he suddenly hears the tea kettle whistling. He grabs a baseball bat from the nearby closet and proceeds to batter and bash the tea kettle into an unrecognizable lump of metal. His friend, hearing the ruckus, rushes into the kitchen, sees what''s happened and asks the desert man, ''Why''d you ruin my good tea kettle?'' The desert man replies, ''Man, you gotta kill these things when they''re small.''

A man staggers into an emergency room with two black eyes and a five iron wrapped tightly around his throat. Naturally the doctor asks him what happened. </p>\n<p>"Well, it was like this," said the man, "I was having a quiet round of golf with my wife when she sliced her ball into a pasture of cows. We went to look for it and while I was rooting around, I noticed one of the cows had something white at its rear end. I walked over and lifted up the tail and sure enough, there was my wife''s golf ball--stuck right in the middle of the cow''s butt. That''s when I made my mistake."</p>\n<p>"What did you do?" asks the doctor.</p>\n<p>"Well, I lifted the tail and yelled to my wife, ''Hey, this looks like yours!''"

The recreational director of a mental hospital wanted to take a well<br /> behaved group of inmates to a baseball game. The General Manager of<br /> the club was a little leery of this. When the Recreational Director<br /> said: "If I prove to you how well behaved they are, will you let<br /> them in?" The General Director agreed.</p>\n<p>The group of inmates came in and sat down. The Recreational Director<br /> shouted: "Stand up, nuts!" Everyone stood up. "Sit down, nuts!"<br /> Everyone sat down. "Look behind you, nuts!" Everyone turned around.</p>\n<p>Pleased with that, the General Manager let them in. About the third<br /> inning or so, he heard a tremendous commotion! People were running<br /> helter skelter. He asked what happened and was told that someone had<br /> called out: "Peanuts!"
A local bakery decided to hire a part-time counter person and<br /> ended up with a local co-ed who could work evenings and weekends. </p>\n<p>She had one eccentric characteristic (which was unknown when she was hired)<br /> she wore short skirts and no underwear.  Needless to say she was a real beauty and<br /> had a figure to die for.  </p>\n<p>The bakery has a small storefront so it was necessary to<br /> have the various products on shelves and then use a ladder to reach the uppermost<br /> items.  The item that had previously been least popular but was fast becoming the most<br /> popular with gentlemen in particular was rasin bread, which was kept on the<br /> uppermost shelf.</p>\n<p>One day an elderly gentleman came in and ordered a loaf of bread.  The young lady without<br /> thinking scurried up the ladder and then realized she had not asked the<br /> gentleman what kind of bread he had wanted so she nodded and<br /> asked, "Raisin?" </p>\n<p> "No, he replied but it is beginning to twitch just a little."
A woman decided to have a face lift for her birthday. She spent $5000 and felt really good about the result. On her way home she stopped at a dress shop to look around. As she was leaving, she said to the sales clerk, "I hope you don''t mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?" "About 35," was the reply.<br /> "I''m actually 47," the woman said, feeling really happy.</p>\n<p>After that she went into McDonalds for lunch, and asked the order taker the same question, to which the reply was, "Oh you look about 29?"<br /> "I am actually 47." That made her feel really good.</p>\n<p>While standing at the bus stop she asked an old man the same question.<br /> He replied, "I am 85 years old and my eyesight is going. But when I was young there was a sure way of telling a woman''s age. If I put my hand up your skirt I will be able to tell your exact age."</p>\n<p>As there was no one around, the woman thought, "What the hell", and let him slip his hand up her skirt. After feeling around for a while, the old man said, "Ok, You are 47."</p>\n<p>Stunned the woman said, "That was brilliant! How did you do that?"</p>\n<p>The old man replied, "I was behind you in line at McDonalds!"

The jumbo jet is just coming into an Airport in Toronto on its final approach. The pilot comes on over the intercom."This is Capt Johnson. We''re on our final descent into Toronto. I want to thank you for flying with us today, and I hope you enjoy your stay in Toronto. He forgets to switch off the intercom. The whole plane can now hear the conversation from the cockpit. The co-pilot says to the pilot, "Well skipper, watcha gonna do in Toronto? Now all ears in the plane are listening in to this conversation."Well," says the skipper, "first I''m gonna check into the hotel and take a crap. Then I''m gonna take that new stewardess out for supper, you know, the one with the huge tits. I''m gonna wine and dine her , take her back to my room, and shag her all night."Everyone in the plane is trying to get a look at the new stewardess. She''s so embarrassed that she runs from the back of the plane to try and get to the cockpit to turn the intercom off. Halfway down the aisle, she trips over an old lady''s bag and down she goes. The old lady leans over and says, "No need to run, dear, he''s gotta take a shit first!"

Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses<br /> pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in<br /> the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly<br /> Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the<br /> other side, safe and sound.</p>\n<p>Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one<br /> directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the<br /> center of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus<br /> casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the<br /> green.</p>\n<p>The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed<br /> out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street.<br /> It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it<br /> bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into<br /> the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and<br /> straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond,<br /> the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily<br /> pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog<br /> jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth.<br /> Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew<br /> away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with<br /> fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup<br /> for a hole in one.</p>\n<p>Moses turned to Jesus and said, "I hate playing with your Dad."

The second no legs, and the third has no body, just a head.They all line up, the whistle blows and "splash" they''re all in the pool.The guy with no arms takes the lead instantly but the guy with no legs is closing fast. The head of course sank straight to the bottom.Ten lengths later and the guy with no legs finishes first. He can still see bubbles coming from the bottom of the pool, so he decides he had better dive down to rescue him.He pick up the head, swims back up to the surface and places it at the side of the pool, where-upon the head starts coughing and spluttering. Eventually the head catches his breath and shouts:"Three long years I''ve spent learning to swim with my ears, then two minutes before the whistle, some prick puts a swimming cap on me !!"

And my other friend is 200 pounds, world arm wrestling champion and is also a natural blonde. Do you still want to tell me that blonde joke?'''' The man thinks for a while and replies, ''''Not if I have to explain it three times.''''

One day a woman who was about 65 years old wanted to get a tatoo. She went to the nearest tatoo parlor and told the man the she wanted one tatoo of Mike Tyson on one thigh and one of Evander Holyfield on the other. The man said to the woman that he wasn''t sure if he could do that, but he would try. So the woman said ok and went to the back with the man. It was a long process. When it was finally finished the woman lifted up her skirt and asked the man, "Does this look like Mike Tyson and does this look like Evander Holyfield?""Not really," said the man, "But it looks ok."The woman was very pleased and walked out of the tatoo parlor. When she walked out she asked a younger man if the tatoos on her thighs loked like Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield. The man replied with a yeah sort of. Next the woman saw and older man. She went up to him and lifted up her skirt and asked him, "Does this look like Mike Tyson and does this look like Evander Holyfield?"The man said, "No, but the one in the middle looks like Don King."

This is a long one so I apologise now! </p>\n<p>3 men die and go to heaven. At the gates, they meet St Peter who tells them </p>\n<p>''Before you come in here, you have to answer one question. According to how you answer the question you will get a mode of transport. The mode of transport you have determines your status in heaven, do you understand?'' </p>\n<p>''yes'' answer the men </p>\n<p>''ok'' says Peter and he turns to the first man. ''Tell me truthfully, how many times have you had an affair???'' </p>\n<p>''Well'' said the first man ''I must admit I''ve had an affair 5 times'' </p>\n<p>''You get a bicycle then'' said Peter and off the man goes into heaven </p>\n<p>The second man answers, ''I''ve had an affair 2 times'' and so he gets a mini and goes off into heaven </p>\n<p>Finally the last man answers ''I can honestly say I have never had an affair in my life, I love my wife'' and so he gets a brand new bmw and goes off into heaven. </p>\n<p>A time later, the first man sees the last man sat next to his brand new bmw crying. </p>\n<p>''What could possibly be wrong, you have this wonderfull car?'' asks the first man. </p>\n<p>''It''s not that, I think that''s great'' says the man crying, ''it''s just that I''ve just seen my wife go by on a skateboard!''
The big-game hunter walked into the bar and bragged to everyone<br /> about his skills as a hunter. The man was undoubtedly a good<br /> shot and no one could dispute that. But then he said that he<br /> could recognize any animal''s skin by feeling it, and he could<br /> tell what caliber rifle was used to shoot it by locating the<br /> bullet hole. This was a bit too much for the other customers,<br /> and soon a heated argument started.</p>\n<p>The hunter said that he was willing to prove it if they would<br /> put up the drinks, and the bet was on. They blindfolded him and<br /> took him to his first animal skin.</p>\n<p>After feeling it for a few moments, he announced, "Springbok."<br /> Then he felt for the bullet hole and declared, "And it was shot<br /> with a .22 rifle." He was right! The others could not believe it<br /> and the argument was even hotter than before. When someone<br /> suggested that he must have peeped, he said that he was prepared<br /> to do it again for another round.</p>\n<p>So they blindfolded him again, very thoroughly this time, and<br /> they brought a skin that someone happened to have in the trunk<br /> of his car. He took a bit longer this time and then said,<br /> "Kalahari Lion." Fingering the bullet hole, he added, "The rifle<br /> was a .308." He was right again! This only made the crowd more<br /> curious, and he had to prove his skills over and over again,<br /> every time winning a round of drinks.</p>\n<p>Finally he staggered home, bombed out of his mind, and went to<br /> sleep. The next morning he got up and saw in the mirror that he<br /> had one hell of a shiner. So he said to his wife, "Listen, I<br /> know I was drunk last night, but not too drunk to know that I<br /> didn''t get into a fight. So where did I get this black eye?" His<br /> wife replied angrily, "From me!" "What did I do?" he asked. She<br /> replied, "You got into bed and put your hand inside my panties.<br /> Then you fiddled around a bit and announced, ''Skunk, killed with<br /> an ax!''"
A doctor at an (insane) asylum decided to take his inmates to a baseball game.<br /> For weeks in advance, he coached his patients to respond to his commands. When<br /> the day of the game arrived, everything seemed to be going well.<br /> As the national anthem started, the doctor yelled, ''''Up nuts!''''<br /> And the inmates complied by standing up. After the anthem he yelled, ''''Down<br /> nuts!'''' And they all sat.<br /> After a home run he yelled, ''''Cheer nuts!'''' And they all broke into applause<br /> and cheers.<br /> Thinking things were going very well; he decided to go get a beer and a hot<br /> dog, leaving his assistant in charge.<br /> When he returned there was a riot in progress. Finding his assistant, he asked<br /> what happened.<br /> The assistant replied, ''''Well...everything was fine until some guy walked by<br /> and yelled, ''''PEANUTS!''''

When you''re 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: "Just because you''ve reached middle age, that doesn''t mean you shouldn''t take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it." </p>\n<p>This is the voice of Satan. </p>\n<p>I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales. </p>\n<p>I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. "I''ll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets" is a typical breakfast order for me these days. </p>\n<p>This is because I went snowboarding. </p>\n<p>For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough. </p>\n<p>These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, "Cool." </p>\n<p>People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together. </p>\n<p>We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill). </p>\n<p>If anybody asks if you''re OK, you say, "I''m just catching my breath!" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you''re going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you''re planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw. </p>\n<p>At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance. </p>\n<p>So I thought I''d take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing. </p>\n<p>In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range. </p>\n<p>Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can''t stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you. </p>\n<p>Skiers hate snowboarders. It''s a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc. </p>\n<p>Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd. </p>\n<p>I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope. </p>\n<p>Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who''s going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete. </p>\n<p>You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.) </p>\n<p>We learned snowboarding via a two step method: </p>\n<p>STEP ONE: Watching Brad do something. </p>\n<p>STEP TWO: Trying to do it ourselves. </p>\n<p>I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics. </p>\n<p>I''d struggle to my feet, and I''d be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot. </p>\n<p>"Keep your knees bent!" Brad would yell, helpfully. </p>\n<p>Have you noticed that whatever sport you''re trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if THAT would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, "FORGET MY KNEES! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE GRAVITY CHUNKS!" </p>\n<p>Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me. </p>\n<p>If I hadn''t gotten out of there, they''d have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding. </p>\n<p>So I think, when my body heals, I''ll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you''ll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.

Good afternoon all. I''m Al Gore, and I''d like to tell you a<br /> little about myself. </p>\n<p>I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a<br /> poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I<br /> was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands. I taught<br /> myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers<br /> and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi<br /> River steamboat. Frequently we would stop the ship and I would<br /> cut and split five cords of wood for fuel overnight for the<br /> steam engines. </p>\n<p>My mother taught me the value of education, so every day, I<br /> would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a<br /> mischievous, fun loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one<br /> day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for<br /> "Huckleberry Finn." </p>\n<p>Back then, we Jewish black folks in the south were second-class<br /> citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I<br /> asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee<br /> civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an<br /> impression. You see, the minister''s name was Martin Luther King,<br /> Jr. </p>\n<p>My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his<br /> knee and said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama,<br /> someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to<br /> an exclusive prep school." As a young Hindu boy, these were very<br /> valuable lessons. But life of privilege was not for me. </p>\n<p>Being Chinese, after getting my high school diploma, I took a<br /> job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the<br /> treatment of the workers there that I organized a union. Later,<br /> that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my<br /> close friends at the AFL-CIO call me "Norma Rae." </p>\n<p>When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done,<br /> Harvard University called and offered me a scholarship. I<br /> captained the hockey team to four consecutive national<br /> championships, but I also played football and was good enough to<br /> win the Heisman Trophy. </p>\n<p>During my college years, I lived in a housing project and<br /> moonlighted writing songs and playing lead guitar for a little<br /> rock band. You may have heard of us - The Rolling Stones. I''m<br /> the one with the lips. </p>\n<p>But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my<br /> country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I<br /> was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier<br /> and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de<br /> Guerre. My battlefield expertise is current requisite reading<br /> material for Officers Candidates to this very day. My being a<br /> wounded female officer serving in disguise as a journalist was a<br /> full time project, but my military knowledge helped save tens of<br /> thousands of lives. Many cities in Southeast Asia are named<br /> after me to this very day. Statues of me are still commonplace<br /> in many official Government buildings in Viet Nam. </p>\n<p>When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of<br /> ours. I''ve crossed the deserts bare, man, I''ve breathed the<br /> mountain air, man, I''ve traveled, I''ve done my share, man, I''ve<br /> been everywhere. I''ve hunted all the dangerous species of big<br /> game in five continents using only a handmade spear or my<br /> handmade laser sighted compound bow. </p>\n<p>And the people I met at truck stops and campgrounds and homeless<br /> shelters on that journey all said the same thing: "Al, we need<br /> you in Washington." </p>\n<p>I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some<br /> other business---building the World Trade Center, finding a low<br /> cost, more reliable nuclear weapon trigger design, founding the<br /> Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking<br /> caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field''s<br /> chocolate chip cookies. I was, in fact, the third (still silent)<br /> partner of Ben &amp; Jerry with over half of the flavors personally<br /> developed by Tipper and me in our own kitchen.</p>\n<p>My extensive knowledge of Arctic Sea life keeps me busy in the<br /> research laboratory, but those endangered species need love too!<br /> Translating the dead sea scrolls is one of my favorite hobbies,<br /> and my current volume is in print in over 73 languages and is<br /> being studied in Seminaries worldwide. Being Indian, both Native<br /> American and the Mid East kind, this is valuable experience for<br /> me. Have towel and Tee Pee, will travel.</p>\n<p>Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee<br /> and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and<br /> the Senate. And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for<br /> no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once<br /> again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the<br /> United States. </p>\n<p>I also invented the Internet. Since then, I''ve been part of the<br /> most successful administration in American history. My friend,<br /> Bill Gates has asked me many times why I gave him the ideas of<br /> software development and asked for no money. Gosh, it just<br /> wouldn''t be right! </p>\n<p>Many times President Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave<br /> decision and has asked me what to do. And when I would give him<br /> my thoughts, he would invariable say, "Of course. That''s<br /> brilliant. Why didn''t I think of that?" During the darkest days<br /> of the impeachment battles, the President told me he only wished<br /> he had listened when I told him to stay away form that<br /> dark-haired intern with the big hooters. </p>\n<p>So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and<br /> asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my<br /> campaign. And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of<br /> advice-words I''ll never forget. He looked me in the eye and he<br /> said, "Al, just tell the truth, it''s always worked well for me." </p>\n<p>Thanks, I''m Al Gore and I want to be your next President.

A young guy out on the town with his mates spies the girl of his dreams across the dance floor. Having admired her from afar he plucks up the courage to talk to her. Everything goes better than expected and she agrees to accompany him on a date the following Saturday evening. </p>\n<p>Saturday night arrives and the man arrives at her house laden with flowers and chocolates. To his amazement she answers the door in nothing but a towel. </p>\n<p>"I''m sorry," she exclaims, "I am running a bit late. Please come in and I''ll introduce you to my parents who will entertain you while I finish getting dressed. I should warn you however, that they are both deaf mutes." </p>\n<p>With this she ushers him into the living room, introduces him to her parents and promptly disappears. As you can imagine this is a little uncomfortable as both parents are completely silent. Dad is sitting in his arm chair watching the soccer game, and Mom is busy knitting. After about ten minutes of complete silence, Mom suddenly jumps from her chair, pulls up her skirt pulls down her knickers and pours a glass of water over her arse. </p>\n<p>Just as suddenly Dad launches himself across the room bends her over the couch and takes her from behind. He then sits back down in his chair and places a match stick under each eye lid. The room is plunged back into eerie silence and the young man is shocked into disbelief. After a further ten minutes the mother again rises from her chair, pulls up her skirt, pulls down her pants and throws another glass of water over her arse. Dad leaps up gives her one from behind and places two more match sticks under his eyelids. No sooner have they concluded this strange behaviour and the daughter returns fully dressed ready for their date. </p>\n<p>The evening is a complete disaster with the young man completely distracted by the goings on in the living room. At the end of the evening the girl asks, "What''s the matter? Have I done something wrong?" </p>\n<p>"It''s not you," replied her date, "It''s just that the strangest thing happened while I was waiting for you and I am still a bit shocked." </p>\n<p>After pleading with him to explain in more detail the young man reluctantly recounts the story. ''Well, first your Mother jumps from her chair and lifts up her skirt. She then pulls down her pants and throws a glass of water over her behind." </p>\n<p>"I see," says the girl, "What happened then?" </p>\n<p>"Well, if that isn''t enough your Father races from his chair leans Mom over the couch and does her from behind. He then sits back down and places a match stick under each eye lid.'' </p>\n<p>"Oh, is that all?" replies the girl. </p>\n<p>The young man can''t believe the casual response to this weird practice. "It''s easily explained. Mom was simply saying, ''Are you going to get this asshole a drink?'' and Dad was replying, ''No, fuck him. I''m watching the match.''"
There was a blond woman driving on the open highway when she looked out her window and noticed another blond sitting in the middle of a field rowing a boat.<br />     The woman driving her car then yelled at the other blond, "hey! Why are you rowing a boat with no water?" Then the blond with the boat said, "What are you talking about?" The lady in the car replied, "If I could swim, i would come out there and give you a peice of my mind!"
One day a blonde lady went to a local Florida Department Store to buy a pair of alligator shoes.  As she was looking at a very nice pair of shoes she noticed the very expensive price.  She didn''t have enough to pay for the shoes, and she was outraged.  She marched right up to the counter and told the clerk exactly what she thought of him.She left very angrily, but on her way out she made a comment to the clerk and in that comment she said,"With prices like these I should just go out buy me a gun and kill my own alligators." the clerk replied very sarcastically,"Good Luck!"The clerk went on with his day not even thinking about the lady that came in early. As he was locking up to go home at the end of the day something caught his eye.  There in the swamp was the lady waist deep with a gun in her hand.  At that moment something else caught his eye, off to the left about 25 yards away was an alligator swimming right towards her.The man started jumping up and down screaming at her trying to get her attention.  She turned seen the alligator took aim and shot.She drug it to shore where there was about eight other alligators laying dead on their backs.Then she flipped it over too and said,"damn this one is not wearing shoes either."
There were these 3 ducks all swimming in a lake one sunny<br /> morning and when a 4th duck came across he started having a<br /> conversation with the three to make some new friends. He asked<br /> the first duck what his name was and what he liked to do in the<br /> pond. The first duck answered, "My name is Joe and I like to<br /> blow bubbles." So the fourth duck asked the second duck the same<br /> questions. The response was, "My name is Freddy and I also like<br /> to blow bubbles all the time in the pond."

One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend<br /> suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything<br /> quicker and cheaper than a doctor.<br /> ''''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your<br /> problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10." Bill figured<br /> he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the<br /> drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.<br /> The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.<br /> After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: "You<br /> have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be<br /> better in two weeks."<br /> Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how<br /> it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine<br /> could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog<br /> and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into<br /> the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in<br /> the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and<br /> printed out the following message:<br /> "Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him<br /> vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren''t yours. Get a lawyer. And if<br /> you don''t stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better."

A pretty terrible golfer was playing a round of golf for which he had hired a caddie. The round proved to be somewhat tortuous for the caddie to watch and he was getting a bit exasperated by the poor play of his employer. At one point the ball lay about 180 yards from the green and the as the golfer sized up his situation, he asked his caddie, "Do you think I can get there with a 5-iron?"And the caddie replied, "Eventually."

A man calls the Animal Control in his town, because there is a crazed gorilla<br /> on his roof, and he can''t figure out how to get it down safely. Soon, a van<br /> pulls up, and an old man gets out, carrying a small dog, a baseball bat, and a<br /> gun. He hands the man the gun.</p>\n<p>''''Okay, here''s what we do. I''m going to go up onto your roof, and threaten the<br /> gorilla with this baseball bat until he falls down.

''''But what''s the gun for?''''</p>\n<p>''''In case I fall down instead of the gorilla �酶惟 shoot the dog.''''
Two college football players were taking an important final<br /> exam. If they failed, they would be on academic probation and<br /> not allowed to play in the Sugar Bowl the following week. The<br /> exam was fill-in-the-blank. The last question read, "Old<br /> MacDonald had a _________." </p>\n<p>Bubba was stumped. He had no idea of the answer. He knew he<br /> needed to get this one right to be sure he passed. Making sure<br /> the professor wasn''t watching, he tapped Tiny on the shoulder. </p>\n<p>"Pssst. Tiny. What''s the answer to the last question?" </p>\n<p>Tiny laughed. He looked around to make sure the professor hadn''t<br /> noticed then he turned to Bubba. </p>\n<p>"Bubba, you''re so stupid. Everyone knows Old MacDonald had a<br /> farm." </p>\n<p>"Oh yeah," said Bubba. "I remember now." He picked up his No. 2<br /> pencil and started to write the answer in the blank. He stopped. </p>\n<p>Reaching to tap Tiny''s shoulder again, he whispered, "Tiny, how<br /> do you spell farm?" </p>\n<p>"You are really dumb, Bubba. That''s so easy. Farm is spelled E<br /> -I-E-I-O."

The good news is that you get to choose how you die."</p>\n<p>The Frenchman says, "I take ze sword." the chief gives him a sword, he shouts,"Vive la France!" and runs himself through.</p>\n<p>The Englishman says, "a pistol for me, please." The chief gives him a pistol, he points it at his head, says, "God save the queen!" and pulls the trigger.</p>\n<p>The New Yorker says, "gimme the fawkin'' fork." the chief is puzzled, but he shrugs and gives him a fork. The new Yorker takes the fork and starts jabbing himself all over--the stomach, the sides, the chest, everywhere. There''s blood gushing out all over, it''s horrible.</p>\n<p>The chief is appalled, and asks, "my God almighty, what are you doing?"</p>\n<p>The New Yorker says, "so much for your canoe, you stupid asshole!"

Her bowel will engorge whenever and quite often I''m afraid. Of course you must clean her immediately to avoid accumulation of the putrid effluent she''ll be emitting regularly."<br /> Now Mr. Jones is convulsing and sobbing uncontrollably and beginning to wither off the bench into a sobbing pitiful mass. </p>\n<p>Just then Dr. Smith reaches out his hand and pats Mr. Jones on the shoulder and says -<br /> "Hey, I''m just messinging with you, dude...<br /> You don''t have to do all that stuff - she''s dead!"

"You are so<br /> focused on your possessions that you don''t notice anything<br /> else."  "How can you say such a thing?" asked the woman.

Two men,one a brunette and the other a blonde,were comparing their luck picking up girls at the beach. The brunette guy says, "what works for me is this : go to a grocery store, buy a potato and put it in your swim trunk." The blonde guy thanks him and spends the next 5 hours roaming the beach with a potato in his swim trunks - with no luck. He says to his brunette friend that he DID put a potato in his swim trunks and  had no luck.    The brunette guy says to the blonde guy, "you ass-hole! The potato goes in the FRONT of your trunks, not the back!!!"

When they finally get back to the club house they decide to complain to the owner. They say,"Hey, we love golfing at your club but there were three guys ahead of us that were just taking forever - " "Oh, you mean the the three blind fireman." The owner interupted. "Well whoever they were they were taking too long!" the three golfers replied. The owner replied,"Those three blind firemen can take as long as they want. They saved this club from burning down!" The preist then said, "Wow, that''s fantastic, I''ll keep them in my prayers!" The doctor replied, "Hey, that''s a great story. I''ve got a friend who''s an optometrist, I''ll see what he can do for them!" The engineer looks at them and asks,"Well why can''t they golf at night?"

''Twas the Night Before Christmas: Texas Version </p>\n<p>T''was the night before Christmas, in Texas, you know.<br /> Way out on the prairie, without any snow.<br /> Asleep in their cabin, were Buddy and Sue,<br /> A dreamin'' of Christmas, like me and you.<br /> Not stockings, but boots, at the foot of their bed,<br /> For this was Texas, what more need be said,<br /> When all of a sudden, from out of the still night,<br /> There came such a ruckus, it gave me a fright.<br /> And I saw ''cross the prairie, like a shot from a gun,<br /> A loaded up buckboard, come on at a run,<br /> The driver was ''''Geein'''' and ''''Hawin'''', with a will,<br /> The horses (not reindeer) he drove with such skill.<br /> ''''Come on there Buck, Poncho, &amp; Prince, to the right,<br /> There''ll be plenty of travelin'' for you all tonight.''''<br /> The driver in Levi''s and a shirt that was red,<br /> Had a ten-gallon Stetson on top of his head.<br /> As he stepped from the buckboard, he was really a sight,<br /> With his beard and moustache, so curly and white.<br /> As he burst in the cabin, the children awoke,<br /> And were so astonished, that neither one spoke.<br /> And he filled up their boots with such presents galore,<br /> That neither could think of a single thing more.<br /> When Buddy recovered the use of his jaws,<br /> He asked in a whisper, ''''Are you really Santa Claus?''''<br /> ''''Am I the real Santa? Well, what do you think?''''<br /> And he smiled as he gave a mysterious wink.<br /> Then he leaped in his buckboard, and called back in his drawl,<br /> ''''To all the children in Texas, Merry Christmas, You-all!''''
Talk about bad luck - this lot takes the cake!</p>\n<p>A fierce gust of wind blew 45-year-old Vittorio Luise''s car into a river near Naples, Italy, in 1983. He managed to break a window, climb out and swim to shore - where a tree blew over and killed him.</p>\n<p>Mike Stewart, 31, of Dallas, was filming a movie in 1983 on the dangers of low-level bridges when the truck he was standing on passed under a low-level bridge - and killed him.</p>\n<p>Walter Hallas, a 26-year-old store clerk in Leeds, England, was so afraid of dentists that in 1979 he asked a fellow worker to try to cure his toothache by punching him in the jaw. The punch caused Hallas to fall down, hitting his head and he died of a fractured skull.</p>\n<p>George Schwartz, owner of a factory in Providence, Rhode Island, narrowly escaped death when a 1983 blast flattened his factory except for one wall. After treatment for minor injuries, he returned to the scene to search for files. The remaining wall then collapsed, killing him.</p>\n<p>Depressed that he could not find a job, 42-year-old Romolo Ribolla sat in his kitchen near Pisa, Italy, with a gun in his hand threatening to kill himself. His wife pleaded with him not to do it, and after about half an hour he burst into tears and threw the gun to the floor. It went off and killed his wife.</p>\n<p>In 1976, a 22-year-old Irishman, Bob Finnegan, was crossing the busy Falls Road in Belfast when he was struck by a taxi and flung over its roof. The taxi drove away and, as Finnegan lay stunned in the road, another car ran into him, rolling him into the gutter. It too drove on. As a lot of gawkers gathered to examine the magnetic Irishman, a delivery van ploughed through the crowd, leaving in its wake three injured bystanders and an even more battered Bob Finnegan. When a fourth vehicle came along, the crowd wisely scattered and only one person was hit - Bob Finnegan. In the space of two minutes, Finnegan suffered a fractured skull, broken pelvis, broken leg, and other assorted injuries, but hospital officials said he would recover.</p>\n<p>Hitting on a novel idea that he could end his wife''s incessant nagging by giving her a good scare, Hungarian Jake Fen built an elaborate harness to make it look as if he had hanged himself. When his wife came home and saw him she fainted. Hearing a disturbance a neighbor came over and, finding what she thought were two corpses, seized the opportunity to loot the place. As she was leaving the room, her arms laden, the outraged and suspended Mr Fen kicked her stoutly in the backside. This so surprised the lady that she dropped dead of a heart attack. Happily, Mr Fen was acquitted of manslaughter and he and his wife were reconciled.

Sol thinks about it for a minute and replies, "I dunno. But let''s make a deal: if I die first, I''ll come back and tell you if there''s baseball in heaven, and if you die first, you do the same."

So in desperation the kid goes to the lifeguard and asks, "How can I do something to get these girls interested in me? What can I do to show off?"The lifeguard takes pity on this poor guy, with his puny muscles and baggy trunks and lanky hair, and finally he says, "Tell you what - why don�酶惟t you take a potato and stick it down your swim trunks.

You said they�酶惟d like me if I put a potato in my shorts!"Without even batting an eye, the lifeguard says, "You gotta put the potato in the FRONT, kid!"

It''s Saturday morning and John''s just about to set off on a round of golf when he realizes that he forgot to tell his wife that the guy who fixes the washing machine is coming around at noon. So John heads back to the clubhouse and phones home. "Hello?" says a little girl''s voice. "Hi, honey, it''s Daddy," says John."Is Mommy near the phone?" "No, Daddy. She''s upstairs in the bedroom with Uncle Fred." After a brief pause, John says, "But you haven''t got an Uncle Fred, honey!" "Yes, I do, and he''s upstairs in the bedroom with Mommy!" "Okay, then. Here''s what I want you do. Put down the phone, run upstairs and knock on the bedroom door and shout in to Mommy and Uncle Fred that my car''s just pulled up outside the house." "Okay, Daddy!" A few minutes later, the little girl comes back to the phone."Well, I did what you said, Daddy." "And what happened?" "Well, Mommy jumped out of bed and ran around screaming, then she tripped over the rug and went out the front window and now she''s all dead." "Oh, my God! What about Uncle Fred?" "He jumped out of bed too, and he was all scared, and he jumped out the back window into the swimming pool. But he must have forgot that last week you took out all the water to clean it, so he hit the bottom of the swimming pool and now he''s dead too." There is a long pause. "Swimming pool? Is this 555-3097?"

One hot summer afternoon a woman is at the local public swimming<br /> pool when she notices a man smoking a cigarette underwater.</p>\n<p>She is astounded that such a thing can be so she asks him how he<br /> does it.</p>\n<p>"It''s easy." He said. "I just use a condom."</p>\n<p>"Where can I get them?" The woman asked.</p>\n<p>"Just go into any drugstore and ask for them." The man tells her.</p>\n<p>The next day she goes into her local drugstore and asks the<br /> clerk for a condom.</p>\n<p>"Any particular kind?" He asks.</p>\n<p>"Yes," she replied. "One that will fit a camel."

My sharp sense of hearing lets me aim." </p>\n<p>Tiger is impressed, and Stevie suggests that they play a round.<br /> When Tiger agrees, Stevie asks, "How about if we play for $100,000?"<br /> Tiger insists he couldn''t possibly play him for money because of his sight handicap. </p>\n<p>But Stevie argues and badgers Tiger until Tiger finally relents and says, "OK, it''s your money... when do you want to play?" </p>\n<p>Stevie replies, "I''ll play on any NIGHT you choose!"

Two friends had arranged a round of golf and were now on the first tee,<br /> preparing to start their game at 7 a.m. Just as the first was half way up his<br /> backswing, a good looking young lady ran across the course about 10 yards in<br /> front of him, peeling off her clothes as she went until she was totally naked.<br /> As she disappeared into the woods he turned, dazed, to his companion, "What was<br /> that about?!!!" </p>\n<p>"Take no notice. Just get on with the game," replied the other. </p>\n<p>Settling down and lining up for his drive, the first golfer then noticed four<br /> men in white coats running across the course on a similar track to the young<br /> lady. "What......?!?" </p>\n<p>"Look. Just get on with the game," said the second. "We don''t have all day,<br /> and you know the course closes at 9 p.m.," the second says with a chuckle. </p>\n<p>For the third time the golfer squared up to the ball, only to be distracted by<br /> another man in a white coat running across the fairway, lugging two buckets of<br /> sand. "Now, hold on a minute," said the first golfer, "I''m not playing until you<br /> tell me what''s going on." </p>\n<p>"OK," said the second. "Just over the wall there is an asylum. The young lady<br /> is a patient who escapes and runs around naked from time to time. The guys in<br /> white coats are chasing her." </p>\n<p>"I''ll buy that," said the first, "but what''s with the guy and the two buckets<br /> of sand?" </p>\n<p>"He''s the guy who caught her the last time. That''s his handicap."
A friend just got back from a holiday ski trip to Utah with the kind of story that warms the cockles of anybody''s heart. Conditions were perfect, 12 below, no feeling in the toes, basic numbness all over.  The "Tell me when we''re having fun" kind of day.</p>\n<p>One of the women in the group complained to her husband that she was in dire need of a restroom. He told her not to worry, that he was sure there was relief at the top of the lift in the form of a powder room for female skiers in distress. He was wrong, of course, and the pain did not go away.</p>\n<p>If you''ve ever had nature hit its panic button in you, then you know That a temperature of 12 below zero doesn''t help matters. So with time running out, she weighed her options.</p>\n<p>Her husband, picking up on the intensity of the pain, suggested that since she was wearing an all white ski outfit, she should go off in the woods. No one would ever notice, he assured her. The white will provide more than adequate camouflage. So she headed for the tree line, began disrobing and proceeded to do her thing. If you''ve ever parked on the side of a slope, then you know there is a right way and a wrong way to set your skies so you don''t move. Yup, you got it. She had the skies positioned the wrong way.</p>\n<p>Steep slopes are not forgiving, even during embarrassing moments. Without any warning, the woman found herself skiing backward, out of control racing through the trees, somehow missing all of them, and on to the slope. Her derriere and the reverse side were still bare, her pants down around her knees, and she was picking up speed all the while she continued on backwards, totally out-of-control, creating an unusual sight for the other skiers.</p>\n<p>The woman skied, if you define that verb loosely, back under the lift, and finally collided violently with a pylon. The bad news was she broke her arm and was unable to pull up the ski pants. At long last her husband arrived, put an end to her nude show, then went to the base of the mountain and summoned the ski patrol, who transported her to a hospital.</p>\n<p>In the emergency room she was regrouping when a man with a broken leg was put in a bed next to hers.</p>\n<p>"So, how''d you break your leg?" She asked, making small talk.</p>\n<p>"It was the darndest thing you ever saw," he said "I was riding up this ski lift and suddenly I couldn''t believe my eyes. There was this crazy woman skiing backwards out of control down the mountain with her bare bottom hanging out. I leaned over to get a better look and I guess I didn''t realize how far I''d moved.  I fell out of the lift."</p>\n<p>"So how''d you break your arm?"

To the citizens of the United States of America:</p>\n<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today.</p>\n<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you&nbsp; noticed.</p>\n<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:</p>\n<p>1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up "aluminium" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.</p>\n<p>Look up "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed".</p>\n<p>2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.</p>\n<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn''t that hard.</p>\n<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.</p>\n<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.</p>\n<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football.</p>\n<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.</p>\n<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for "shit"</p>\n<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day.</p>\n<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.</p>\n<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It''s been driving us crazy.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your cooperation.
It was a particularly tough football game, and nerves were on edge. The home<br /> team had been the victim of three or four close calls and they were now trailing<br /> the visitors by a touchdown and a field goal. When the official called yet<br /> another close one in the visitors'' favor, the home quarterback blew his top. </p>\n<p>"How many times can you do this to us in a single game?" he screamed. "You<br /> were wrong on the out-of-bounds, you were wrong on that last first down and you<br /> missed an illegal tackle in the first quarter." the official just stared.</p>\n<p>The quarterback seethed, but he suppressed the language that might get him<br /> tossed from the game. "What it comes down to," he bellowed, "is that you stink!" </p>\n<p>The official stared a few more seconds. Then he bent down, picked up the<br /> ball, paced off 15 yards, and put the ball down. He turned to face the steaming<br /> quarterback. The official finally replied, "and how do I smell from here,<br /> a******?"
1.Have a torrid one-night stand with a street mutt. </p>\n<p>2.Try to understand that the cat is from Venus and I am from Mars. </p>\n<p>3.I will no longer be beholden to the sound of the can opener. </p>\n<p>4.Circulate petition that Leg Humping be a juried competition in major dog shows. </p>\n<p>5.Call PETA and tell them what that surgical mask-wearing freak does to us when no one is around.</p>\n<p>6.Take time from busy schedule to stop and smell the behinds. </p>\n<p>7.Hamster: Don''t let them figure out I''m just a rat on ''roids, or they''ll flush my ass. </p>\n<p>8.Always scoot before licking. </p>\n<p>9.Grow opposable thumb; break into pantry; decide for MYSELF how much food is *too* much. </p>\n<p>10.Get out of the castle more, maybe swim counter-clockwise this year. </p>\n<p>11.January 1st: Kill the sock!

Questions concerning love and wisdom were posed to a group of children (ages 5 to 10). Their responses were amazingly astute and very enlightening, thus proving that all we need to know, we probably learned in kindergarten.</p>\n<p>WHAT IS THE PROPER AGE TO GET MARRIED?</p>\n<p>"Eighty-four. Because at that age, you don''t have to work anymore, and you can spend all your time loving each other." (Judy, 8)</p>\n<p>"Once I''m done with kindergarten, I''m going to find me a wife." (Tommy, 5)</p>\n<p>WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?</p>\n<p>"On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date." (Mike, 10)</p>\n<p>WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?</p>\n<p>"You should never kiss a girl unless you have enough bucks to buy her a big ring and her own VCR, ''cause she''ll want to have videos of the wedding." (Jim, 10)</p>\n<p>"Never kiss in front of other people. It''s a big embarrassing thing if anybody sees you. But if nobody sees you, I might be willing to try it with a handsome boy, but just for a few hours." (Kally, 9)</p>\n<p>THE GREAT DEBATE:</p>\n<p>IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?</p>\n<p>"It''s better for girls to be single, but not for boys. Boys need somebody to clean up after them." (Lynette, 9)</p>\n<p>"It gives me a headache to think about that stuff. I''m just a kid. I don''t need that kind of trouble." (Kenny, 7)</p>\n<p>CONCERNING WHY LOVE HAPPENS BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE:</p>\n<p>"No one is sure why it happens, but I heard it has something to do with how you smell. That''s why perfume and deodorant are so popular." (Jan, 9)</p>\n<p>"I think you''re supposed to get shot with an arrow or something, but the rest of it isn''t supposed to be so painful."

(Jeanne, 8)</p>\n<p>"It isn''t always just how you look. Look at me. I''m handsome like anything and I haven''t got anybody to marry me yet." (Gary, 7)</p>\n<p>"Beauty is skin deep. But how rich you are can last a long time." (Christine, 9)</p>\n<p>CONCERNING WHY LOVERS OFTEN HOLD HANDS:</p>\n<p>"They want to make sure their rings don''t fall off, because they paid good money for them." (David, 8)</p>\n<p>CONFIDENTIAL OPINIONS ABOUT LOVE:</p>\n<p>"I''m in favor of love as long as it doesn''t happen when ''The Simpsons'' are on TV." (Anita, 6)</p>\n<p>"Love will find you, even if you are trying to hide from it. I''ve been trying to hide from it since I was five, but the girls keep finding me." (Bobby, 8)</p>\n<p>"I''m not rushing into being in love. I''m finding fourth grade hard enough." (Regina, 10)</p>\n<p>PERSONAL QUALITIES NECESSARY TO BE A GOOD LOVER:</p>\n<p>"One of you should know how to write a check.

(Ava, 8)</p>\n<p>SOME SUREFIRE WAYS TO MAKE A PERSON FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU:</p>\n<p>"Tell them that you own a whole bunch of candy stores." (Del, 6)</p>\n<p>"Don''t do things like have smelly, green sneakers. You might get attention, but attention ain''t the same thing as love." (Alonzo, 9)</p>\n<p>"One way is to take the girl out to eat. Make sure it''s something she likes to eat. French fries usually works for me." (Bart, 9)</p>\n<p>HOW CAN YOU TELL IF TWO ADULTS EATING DINNER AT A RESTAURANT ARE IN LOVE ?</p>\n<p>"Just see if the man picks up the check. That''s how you can tell if he''s in love." (John, 9)</p>\n<p>"Lovers will just be staring at each other and their food will get cold. Other people care more about the food." (Brad, 8)</p>\n<p>"It''s love if they order one of those desserts that are on fire. They like to order those because it''s just like their hearts are on fire." (Christine, 9)</p>\n<p>WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE THINKING WHEN THEY SAY, "I LOVE YOU":</p>\n<p>"The person is thinking: Yeah, I really do love him, but I hope he showers at least once a day."

Once there was a man who had a parrot who said nothing but,<br /> "Polly wanna cracker." The man got tired of hearing this from<br /> his pet so one day he let his parrot go and told it to go learn<br /> some new words and not to come back until he had.</p>\n<p>So the parrot began his journey and the first place that he saw<br /> was a mechanics body shop, so the parrot flew into the garage<br /> and he heard the mechanic say, "Man, it is hot as hell in<br /> here!!" So the parrot continued on his trip and kept repeating,<br /> "Man it is hot as hell in here!!"</p>\n<p>The next place the parrot flew by was a baseball stadium, and he<br /> heard someone yell, "Let it fly!" So the parrot continued on his<br /> journey saying, "let it fly, let it fly!"</p>\n<p>The next day the parrot flew over a farm and he overheard a<br /> farmer telling his workhand to look at that cow lying over in<br /> the pasture. The farmer told his farmhand, "Go over there and<br /> kick that ol'' bitch and see if she is alive." So the parrot went<br /> around saying that as well.</p>\n<p>On the way back to his home the parrot stopped by a church to<br /> see what was going on. Once he entered the church, the parrot<br /> loudly said, "Man, it is hot as hell in here." The preacher<br /> immediatly stopped preaching, turned around and said, "You hush<br /> your mouth or I will throw the good book at you." So the parrot<br /> proudly reiterated, "Let it fly, let it fly." About that time,<br /> the big fat lady that was playing the piano fainted and hit the<br /> floor very hard. "Go over there and kick that ol'' bitch and see<br /> if she is alive." shouted the parrot.

What do you call two Mexicans playing basketball?</p>\n<p>Juan on Juan. </p>\n<p>Submitted by Curtis<br /> Edited by Glaci
A woman takes a lover during the day while her husband is at work. Her 9-year old son comes home unexpectedly, so she shoves the kid in the closet and shuts the door. The husband also comes home, so she puts her lover in the closet, with the little boy. The little boy says, "Dark in here." The man says, "Yes, it is." The boy says, "I have a baseball." Man, "That''s nice." Boy, "Want to buy it?" Man, "No, thanks." Boy, "My dad''s outside." Man, "OK, how much?" Boy, "$250." The next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together. Boy, "Dark in here." Man, "Yes, it is." Boy, "I have a baseball glove." The lover remembering the last time, asks the boy, "How much?" Boy, "$750." Man, "Fine." A few days later, the father says to the boy, "Grab your glove, let''s go outside and have a game of catch." The boy says, "I can''t, I sold my baseball and my glove." The father asks, "How much did you sell them for?" Boy, "$1,000" The father says, "That''s terrible to overcharge your friends like that...that is way more than those two things cost. I''m going to take you to church and make you confess." They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door. The boy says, "Dark in here." The priest says, "Don''t start THAT again."

An 85 year old couple, having been married almost 60 years, had died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years mainly due to her interest in health food, and exercise. When they reached the pearly gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and master bath suite and Jacuzzi. As they "oohed and aahed" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost. "It''s free," Peter replied, "this is Heaven." Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, "What are the green fees?" Peter''s reply, "This is heaven, you play for free." Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine''s of the world laid out. "How much to eat?" asked the old man. "Don''t you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!" Peter replied with some exasperation. "Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?" the old man asked timidly. Peter lectured, "That''s the best part . . . you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven." With that the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and shrieking wildly. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong. The old man looked at his wife and said, "This is all your fault. If it weren''t for your bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!"

While sports fishing off the Florida coast, a tourist capsized his boat. He could swim, but his fear of alligators kept him clinging to the overturned craft. Spotting and old beachcomber standing on the shore, the tourist shouted, "Are there any gators around here?!"</p>\n<p>"Naw," the man hollered back, "they ain''t been around for years!"</p>\n<p>"Feeling safe, the tourist started swimming leisurely toward the shore.</p>\n<p>About halfway there he asked the guy, "How''d you get rid of the gators?"</p>\n<p>"We didn''t do nothin''," the beachcomber said. "The sharks got ''em."

(100 ways to keep your Testosterone flowing)</p>\n<p>1. Don''t call, ever. </p>\n<p>2. If you don''t like a girl, don''t tell her. It''s more fun to let her figure it out by herself. </p>\n<p>3. Lie. </p>\n<p>4. Name your penis. Be sure it is something narcissistic and unoriginal, such as "spike". </p>\n<p>5. If you lose something that belongs to someone else, tell them you mailed it to them. </p>\n<p>6. Here''s a good pickup line,: "My girlfriend''s pregnant, will you go out with me? </p>\n<p>7. Drink Vernors. </p>\n<p>8. Play with yourself. Talk about it. </p>\n<p>9. Be as ambiguous as possible. If you don''t want to answer, a nice grunt will do. </p>\n<p>10. Always remember: you are a man. Therefore, no matter what, it isn''t your fault.</p>\n<p>11. Lie. </p>\n<p>12. Never ask for help. Even if you really, really need help - don''t ask. People will think you have no penis.</p>\n<p>13. Women like it when you ignore them. It arouses them. </p>\n<p>14. Vanity is the most important trait for a man to have. Whenever you pass a reflective surface, check your hair, clothing, etc.</p>\n<p>15. If you don''t like a girl but can''t think of a good enough reason why, just come up with trite, meaningless explanations like: "I don''t know. I just don''t like her personality." </p>\n<p>16. Girls find it attractive if a man has had more women than baths. </p>\n<p>17. If, GOD FOrbiD, you have to talk to a girl on the phone, use only monosyllabic words and noises. Bodily noises are permissible. </p>\n<p>18. TWO WORDS: Hack and spit. </p>\n<p>19. Everyone finds a man more attractive if he can write his name in urine. </p>\n<p>20. One sure way to make a girl like you is to go after her best friend. She will then see what she''s missing and love you for not giving up on her. </p>\n<p>21. Tell her you will call, then refer back to Rule 1. </p>\n<p>22. Say things like "Wha...?" </p>\n<p>23. Don''t wear matching clothes. People will think your girlfriend picked them out, and it will cramp your style on picking up chicks. </p>\n<p>24. Lie. </p>\n<p>25. Deny everything. Everything. </p>\n<p>26. Good break up line: "it''s not you, it''s me." </p>\n<p>27. If you like a girl, tell all your female friends about her because if any of your female friends like you, they''ll really want to know. </p>\n<p>28. Don''t have a clue. </p>\n<p>29. If you get a clue, pretend you didn''t and disregard it. </p>\n<p>30. No means yes. </p>\n<p>31. Yes means no. </p>\n<p>32. If you don''t get sex whenever you want, your balls will shrivel. Enforce this rule at all times. </p>\n<p>33. If anyone asks, you have had sex in all possible positions and locations. Improvise. </p>\n<p>34. Much like an orgasm signifies the end of a sexual peak, sex often signifies the end of a relationship. </p>\n<p>35. Feelings? What feelings? </p>\n<p>36. Tell this to your girl before you have sex: "don''t worry. If you don''t have an orgasm, you won''t get pregnant." </p>\n<p>37. Life is one big competition. If someone is better than you at anything, either pretend it''s not true or kick some ass. </p>\n<p>38. Gays are an unacceptable part of our society. Take it upon yourself to eradicate all of them from the planet. </p>\n<p>39. DO NOT make decisions about relationships. If you are backed into a corner and must make a decision, stall. If you still must come up with an answer, leave yourself a loophole for escape. Example: question: "Honey, will you take me out for a romantic dinner?" Answer: "Yes, if you can guess how many sperm I produce each day." </p>\n<p>40. Every sentence that anyone says can be contorted to have sexual meaning. Do so. </p>\n<p>41. At any given opportunity, point out how things look like various genitalia. If, by chance, you have Play-Doh, make sure you make an exact replica of your penis. Measure to make sure it''s right. </p>\n<p>42. Lie. </p>\n<p>43. "Love" is not in your vocabulary. Don''t even think about saying it. </p>\n<p>44. A general rule: if whatever you''re doing does not satisfy you completely in 5 minutes, it''s really not worth it. </p>\n<p>45. Diss your girlfriend. Beg and plead until you get her back. Diss her again. Repeat cycle. </p>\n<p>46. Lie. </p>\n<p>47. ALWAYS apologize. NEVER mean it.</p>\n<p>48. If you hurt someone, pretend you care. Don''t. </p>\n<p>49. Try to have a good memory but it''s OK if you forget trivial things. You know, like your girlfriend''s birthday and eye colour. </p>\n<p>50. Ignorance solves problems. If you can''t see them, they can''t see you. </p>\n<p>51. It is never your duty to take responsibility for your actions. </p>\n<p>52. Create new words and phrases to describe genitalia, sex, semen, etc. </p>\n<p>53. Complain about not getting any mail. When people FINALLY feel sorry for you and send you mail, ignore it and continue complaining. </p>\n<p>54. Lie.</p>\n<p>55. Play with your food only if you are in a public place with people you don''t know. </p>\n<p>56. Play with your penis only if you are in a public place with people you don''t know. </p>\n<p>57. If people express extreme disgust at whatever you are doing, DON''T STOP! This is the desired reaction. </p>\n<p>58. You are NOT a virgin, ever. Males are born without virginity. </p>\n<p>59. You are male, therefore you are superior. </p>\n<p>60. Agenda for a boring evening: get beer, drink beer, play with yourself, have sex, drink more beer, pass out. </p>\n<p>61. Females do not care what you do to them as long as they get to please you. </p>\n<p>62. Don''t ever notice anything. </p>\n<p>63. If you''re going out with someone but you love someone else, don''t say anything. Wait until the girl you are going out with falls in love with YOU, and then tell her. </p>\n<p>64. Basic fundamental rule of dating: quantity, not quality. </p>\n<p>65. Basic fundamental rule of sex: quantity IS quality. </p>\n<p>66. Lie. </p>\n<p>67. If you cheat on a girl but no one finds out, then technically you''ve done nothing wrong. </p>\n<p>68. Crying is not manly. Then again, if you are a man, what do you have to cry about anyway? </p>\n<p>69. If the question begins with "why", the answer is "I don''t know." </p>\n<p>70. Women are your napkins. Use them and throw them away. </p>\n<p>71. Remember: every virgin girl is saving herself for YOU. </p>\n<p>72. If you ever find yourself in a position where you have been proven wrong, blame others. Come up with creative and believable excuses why they are at fault - not you. </p>\n<p>73. Don''t ever let anyone say "I told you so". If you hear this phrase and it didn''t come out of your mouth, go ballistic. </p>\n<p>74. If your woman makes you go shopping with her, drive around until a parking spot right near the door opens up. If this takes hours, so be it. You will have the coveted "door spot" and others will worship your skills. </p>\n<p>75. Keep track of how many seconds in your life you have thought about sex. Compare with others. </p>\n<p>76. Other people''s pain is strictly for your amusement. Laugh long and loud. </p>\n<p>77. Lie. </p>\n<p>78. General Rule: different is BAD. </p>\n<p>79. If anyone asks you for a favour:- (a) make a big deal about how hard it is for you to do it; (b) remind them of this huge favour you''ve done for them at least every 5 minutes for the rest of their life. </p>\n<p>80. Each penny you save will be worth at least a dollar in the long run. </p>\n<p>81. If you do something really mean to a girl and she doesn''t want to talk to you, pretend nothing happened. If she still doesn''t talk to you, casually ask: "is something wrong?" </p>\n<p>82. Three words: "let''s be friends". Translation: "I never want to speak to you again but it''s bad for my nice-guy image if you are mad at me, so I''ll pretend I want to be your friend." </p>\n<p>83. Lie. </p>\n<p>84. If you''re on a date and there is a lull in the conversation, tell the girl how many different dorms you''ve been laid in. </p>\n<p>85. When you tell a girl about your past, it''s good to say: "God, I was such a pimp back then." </p>\n<p>86. Here''s a good trick. Tell a girl that you''re going to leave and when you come back, you want her naked, sprawled on the bed. Leave and go into her dad''s room and tell him he should go check on his daughter. Then drive like hell (true story). </p>\n<p>87. If a girl breaks up with you because you''re in love with someone else, she has no right to be upset because, you know, SHE''s the one who wanted to end the relationship. </p>\n<p>88. The best sex position is you, lying face up... and twenty girls on top. </p>\n<p>89. Practice your blank stare. </p>\n<p>90. Spend your spare time thinking of excuses and shove them up your ass. Then, whenever you need one, you can pull it out of your ass. </p>\n<p>91. If you''re ever forced to show emotion, just pick random emotions like rage and lust and insanity and display them at random, inconvenient times. You won''t be asked to do it again. </p>\n<p>92. If you are asked to do something you REALLY DON''T want to do, first try your manly best to get out of it. If that doesn''t work, go ahead and do what you were asked to do but complain that you don''t know how to do it and continuously ask questions on how to do each little part. If no one rushes in to do it for you YET, finish the job in the most half-assed way you possibly can and then say: "SEE? I TOLD you I couldn''t do it." Eventually, people will stop asking you to do things. </p>\n<p>93. Work out day and night to make your body even more beautiful than it already is. When people ask if you''ve been working out, say things like: "no, Baby, I was BORN like this!" </p>\n<p>94. Do not listen to "pussy music" such as Erasure, Color Me Badd or Oldies. </p>\n<p>95. Beer, Then more beer. </p>\n<p>96. Scratch your balls. See if you can embarrass people. </p>\n<p>97. One word: FOOTBALL! </p>\n<p>98. Real men beat up others who are inferior. I mean, we don''t want the inferior of the species to get to reproduce ever, do we? </p>\n<p>99. Diss your girl friends for an occasional night or 5 out with "The Gang". </p>\n<p>100. Lie.</p>\n<div id="nodevote result">Score: 0.0, votes: 0</div>\n
(100 ways to keep your Testosterone flowing)</p>\n<p>1. Don''t call, ever. </p>\n<p>2. If you don''t like a girl, don''t tell her. It''s more fun to let her figure it out by herself. </p>\n<p>3. Lie. </p>\n<p>4. Name your penis. Be sure it is something narcissistic and unoriginal, such as "spike". </p>\n<p>5. If you lose something that belongs to someone else, tell them you mailed it to them. </p>\n<p>6. Here''s a good pickup line,: "My girlfriend''s pregnant, will you go out with me? </p>\n<p>7. Drink Vernors. </p>\n<p>8. Play with yourself. Talk about it. </p>\n<p>9. Be as ambiguous as possible. If you don''t want to answer, a nice grunt will do. </p>\n<p>10. Always remember: you are a man. Therefore, no matter what, it isn''t your fault.</p>\n<p>11. Lie. </p>\n<p>12. Never ask for help. Even if you really, really need help - don''t ask. People will think you have no penis.</p>\n<p>13. Women like it when you ignore them. It arouses them. </p>\n<p>14. Vanity is the most important trait for a man to have. Whenever you pass a reflective surface, check your hair, clothing, etc.</p>\n<p>15. If you don''t like a girl but can''t think of a good enough reason why, just come up with trite, meaningless explanations like: "I don''t know. I just don''t like her personality." </p>\n<p>16. Girls find it attractive if a man has had more women than baths. </p>\n<p>17. If, GOD FOrbiD, you have to talk to a girl on the phone, use only monosyllabic words and noises. Bodily noises are permissible. </p>\n<p>18. TWO WORDS: Hack and spit. </p>\n<p>19. Everyone finds a man more attractive if he can write his name in urine. </p>\n<p>20. One sure way to make a girl like you is to go after her best friend. She will then see what she''s missing and love you for not giving up on her. </p>\n<p>21. Tell her you will call, then refer back to Rule 1. </p>\n<p>22. Say things like "Wha...?" </p>\n<p>23. Don''t wear matching clothes. People will think your girlfriend picked them out, and it will cramp your style on picking up chicks. </p>\n<p>24. Lie. </p>\n<p>25. Deny everything. Everything. </p>\n<p>26. Good break up line: "it''s not you, it''s me." </p>\n<p>27. If you like a girl, tell all your female friends about her because if any of your female friends like you, they''ll really want to know. </p>\n<p>28. Don''t have a clue. </p>\n<p>29. If you get a clue, pretend you didn''t and disregard it. </p>\n<p>30. No means yes. </p>\n<p>31. Yes means no. </p>\n<p>32. If you don''t get sex whenever you want, your balls will shrivel. Enforce this rule at all times. </p>\n<p>33. If anyone asks, you have had sex in all possible positions and locations. Improvise. </p>\n<p>34. Much like an orgasm signifies the end of a sexual peak, sex often signifies the end of a relationship. </p>\n<p>35. Feelings? What feelings? </p>\n<p>36. Tell this to your girl before you have sex: "don''t worry. If you don''t have an orgasm, you won''t get pregnant." </p>\n<p>37. Life is one big competition. If someone is better than you at anything, either pretend it''s not true or kick some ass. </p>\n<p>38. Gays are an unacceptable part of our society. Take it upon yourself to eradicate all of them from the planet. </p>\n<p>39. DO NOT make decisions about relationships. If you are backed into a corner and must make a decision, stall. If you still must come up with an answer, leave yourself a loophole for escape. Example: question: "Honey, will you take me out for a romantic dinner?" Answer: "Yes, if you can guess how many sperm I produce each day." </p>\n<p>40. Every sentence that anyone says can be contorted to have sexual meaning. Do so. </p>\n<p>41. At any given opportunity, point out how things look like various genitalia. If, by chance, you have Play-Doh, make sure you make an exact replica of your penis. Measure to make sure it''s right. </p>\n<p>42. Lie. </p>\n<p>43. "Love" is not in your vocabulary. Don''t even think about saying it. </p>\n<p>44. A general rule: if whatever you''re doing does not satisfy you completely in 5 minutes, it''s really not worth it. </p>\n<p>45. Diss your girlfriend. Beg and plead until you get her back. Diss her again. Repeat cycle. </p>\n<p>46. Lie. </p>\n<p>47. ALWAYS apologize. NEVER mean it.</p>\n<p>48. If you hurt someone, pretend you care. Don''t. </p>\n<p>49. Try to have a good memory but it''s OK if you forget trivial things. You know, like your girlfriend''s birthday and eye colour. </p>\n<p>50. Ignorance solves problems. If you can''t see them, they can''t see you. </p>\n<p>51. It is never your duty to take responsibility for your actions. </p>\n<p>52. Create new words and phrases to describe genitalia, sex, semen, etc. </p>\n<p>53. Complain about not getting any mail. When people FINALLY feel sorry for you and send you mail, ignore it and continue complaining. </p>\n<p>54. Lie.</p>\n<p>55. Play with your food only if you are in a public place with people you don''t know. </p>\n<p>56. Play with your penis only if you are in a public place with people you don''t know. </p>\n<p>57. If people express extreme disgust at whatever you are doing, DON''T STOP! This is the desired reaction. </p>\n<p>58. You are NOT a virgin, ever. Males are born without virginity. </p>\n<p>59. You are male, therefore you are superior. </p>\n<p>60. Agenda for a boring evening: get beer, drink beer, play with yourself, have sex, drink more beer, pass out. </p>\n<p>61. Females do not care what you do to them as long as they get to please you. </p>\n<p>62. Don''t ever notice anything. </p>\n<p>63. If you''re going out with someone but you love someone else, don''t say anything. Wait until the girl you are going out with falls in love with YOU, and then tell her. </p>\n<p>64. Basic fundamental rule of dating: quantity, not quality. </p>\n<p>65. Basic fundamental rule of sex: quantity IS quality. </p>\n<p>66. Lie. </p>\n<p>67. If you cheat on a girl but no one finds out, then technically you''ve done nothing wrong. </p>\n<p>68. Crying is not manly. Then again, if you are a man, what do you have to cry about anyway? </p>\n<p>69. If the question begins with "why", the answer is "I don''t know." </p>\n<p>70. Women are your napkins. Use them and throw them away. </p>\n<p>71. Remember: every virgin girl is saving herself for YOU. </p>\n<p>72. If you ever find yourself in a position where you have been proven wrong, blame others. Come up with creative and believable excuses why they are at fault - not you. </p>\n<p>73. Don''t ever let anyone say "I told you so". If you hear this phrase and it didn''t come out of your mouth, go ballistic. </p>\n<p>74. If your woman makes you go shopping with her, drive around until a parking spot right near the door opens up. If this takes hours, so be it. You will have the coveted "door spot" and others will worship your skills. </p>\n<p>75. Keep track of how many seconds in your life you have thought about sex. Compare with others. </p>\n<p>76. Other people''s pain is strictly for your amusement. Laugh long and loud. </p>\n<p>77. Lie. </p>\n<p>78. General Rule: different is BAD. </p>\n<p>79. If anyone asks you for a favour:- (a) make a big deal about how hard it is for you to do it; (b) remind them of this huge favour you''ve done for them at least every 5 minutes for the rest of their life. </p>\n<p>80. Each penny you save will be worth at least a dollar in the long run. </p>\n<p>81. If you do something really mean to a girl and she doesn''t want to talk to you, pretend nothing happened. If she still doesn''t talk to you, casually ask: "is something wrong?" </p>\n<p>82. Three words: "let''s be friends". Translation: "I never want to speak to you again but it''s bad for my nice-guy image if you are mad at me, so I''ll pretend I want to be your friend." </p>\n<p>83. Lie. </p>\n<p>84. If you''re on a date and there is a lull in the conversation, tell the girl how many different dorms you''ve been laid in. </p>\n<p>85. When you tell a girl about your past, it''s good to say: "God, I was such a pimp back then." </p>\n<p>86. Here''s a good trick. Tell a girl that you''re going to leave and when you come back, you want her naked, sprawled on the bed. Leave and go into her dad''s room and tell him he should go check on his daughter. Then drive like hell (true story). </p>\n<p>87. If a girl breaks up with you because you''re in love with someone else, she has no right to be upset because, you know, SHE''s the one who wanted to end the relationship. </p>\n<p>88. The best sex position is you, lying face up... and twenty girls on top. </p>\n<p>89. Practice your blank stare. </p>\n<p>90. Spend your spare time thinking of excuses and shove them up your ass. Then, whenever you need one, you can pull it out of your ass. </p>\n<p>91. If you''re ever forced to show emotion, just pick random emotions like rage and lust and insanity and display them at random, inconvenient times. You won''t be asked to do it again. </p>\n<p>92. If you are asked to do something you REALLY DON''T want to do, first try your manly best to get out of it. If that doesn''t work, go ahead and do what you were asked to do but complain that you don''t know how to do it and continuously ask questions on how to do each little part. If no one rushes in to do it for you YET, finish the job in the most half-assed way you possibly can and then say: "SEE? I TOLD you I couldn''t do it." Eventually, people will stop asking you to do things. </p>\n<p>93. Work out day and night to make your body even more beautiful than it already is. When people ask if you''ve been working out, say things like: "no, Baby, I was BORN like this!" </p>\n<p>94. Do not listen to "pussy music" such as Erasure, Color Me Badd or Oldies. </p>\n<p>95. Beer, Then more beer. </p>\n<p>96. Scratch your balls. See if you can embarrass people. </p>\n<p>97. One word: FOOTBALL! </p>\n<p>98. Real men beat up others who are inferior.

A golfer and his buddies where playing a big round of golf for $200. At the eighteenth green the golfer had a ten foot putt to win the round, and the $200. </p>\n<p>As he was lining up his putt, a funeral procession started to pass by. The golfer set down his putter, took his hat off, placed it over his chest, and began to wait for the funeral procession to pass. After it passed, he picked up his putter and returned to lining up his putt. </p>\n<p>One of his buddies said, "That was the most touching thing I have ever seen. I can''t believe you stopped playing, possibly loosing your concentration, to pay your respects." </p>\n<p>"Well, we were married for 25 years!"
Two men were having an awfully slow round of golf because the two ladies in front of them managed to get into every sand trap, lake, and rough on the course. They didn''t bother to wave the men on through, which is proper golf etiquette.<br /> After two hours of waiting and waiting, one man said, "I think I''ll walk up there and ask those gals to let us play through." </p>\n<p>He walked out the fairway, got halfway to the ladies, stopped, turned around, and came back, explaining, "I can''t do it. One of those women is my wife and the other is my mistress! Maybe you''d better go talk to them." </p>\n<p>The second man walked toward the ladies, got halfway there and, just as his partner had done, stopped, turned around and walked back and said: "Small world."

Two buddies Bob and Earl were two of the biggest baseball fans in America. For their entire adult lives, Bob and Earl discussed baseball history in the winter and they pored over every box score during the season. They went to 60 games a year. They even agreed that whoever died first would try to come back and tell the other if there was baseball in heaven. One summer night, Bob passed away in his sleep after watching the Yankee victory earlier in the evening. He died happy. A few nights later, his buddy Earl awoke to the sound of Bob''s voice from beyond. ''Bob is that you?'' Earl asked. ''Of course it me,'' Bob replied. ''This is unbelievable!'' Earl exclaimed. ''So tell me, is there baseball in heaven?'' ''Well I have some good news and some bad news for you. Which do you want to hear first?'' ''Tell me the good news first.'' ''Well, the good news is that, yes, there is baseball in heaven, Earl.'' ''Oh, that is wonderful! So what could possibly be the bad news?'' ''You''re pitching tomorrow night.''

You''re not going to put Deep Heat on that are you?''</p>\n<p>The man says, ''No, it''s for my arms. The girls didn''t show up.''
In the first book of the Bible, Guinness''s, God got tired of creating the<br /> world, so He took the Sabbath off. Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree.<br /> Noah''s wife was called Joan of Ark. Lot''s wife was a pillar of salt by day, but<br /> a ball of fire by night. </p>\n<p>Moses led the Hebrews to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which<br /> is bread made without any ingredients. Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the<br /> Ten Amendments. The First Commandment was when Eve told Adam to eat the apple.<br /> The Fifth Commandment is to humour thy father and mother. The Seventh<br /> Commandment is thou shalt not admit adultery. </p>\n<p>Moses died before he ever reached Canada. Then Joshua led the Hebrews in the<br /> battle of Geritol. The greatest miracle in the Bible is when Joshua told his son<br /> to stand still and he obeyed him. </p>\n<p>David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar. He fought with the<br /> Finklesteins, a race of people who lived in Biblical times. Solomon, one of<br /> David''s sons, had 300 wives and 700 porcupines. </p>\n<p>Jesus enunciated the Golden Rule, which says to do one to others before they<br /> do one to you. He also explained, "Man doth not live by sweat alone." </p>\n<p>The people who followed the Lord were called the 12 decibels. The epistles<br /> were the wives of the apostles. One of the opossums was St. Matthew, who was by<br /> profession a taximan. </p>\n<p>St. Paul cavorted to Christianity. He preached holy acrimony, which is another<br /> name for marriage. A Christian should have only one wife. This is called<br /> monotony.
One day, little jonny asked his mom what sex was.</p>\n<p>"Tonight, go into your sister''s room, hide behind the curtain, and watch what she and her boyfriend do.</p>\n<p>The following morning, jonny''s mom asked what happened.</p>\n<p>Little jonny explained "well at first, they were just kinda talking and laughing, but after a while they started kissing and hugging, sister got a fever, cuz she said she was feeling hot. </p>\n<p>So sister''s boyfriend put his hand under her shirt to find her heart, just like the doctor would. </p>\n<p>Except he''s not so smart because both of them got sick and they started panting and getting all out of breath. </p>\n<p>His other hand must have been cold because he put it under her skirt. </p>\n<p>About this time sis got worse and began to moan and sigh, and squirm around and slide to the end of her bed. then i finally found out what was making them sick - a big eel had gotten inside her boyfriend''s pants somehow. </p>\n<p>It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long! anyways he grapped it in one hand to keep it from getting away. </p>\n<p>When sis saw it, she got really scared - her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open, and she started calling to God and stuff like that. </p>\n<p>She said it was the biggest one she had ever seen, I should tell her about the ones by the lake, anyway sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and tried to keep it from biting again. </p>\n<p>Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it, and the boyfriend helped by lying on top of the eel. </p>\n<p>The eel put on a heck of a fight. Sis started moaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squishing it between them. </p>\n<p>After a while, they both stopped moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough they had killed the eel! </p>\n<p>I knew because it just hung there and also because some of its insides were dripping out. </p>\n<p>Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back to the bed anyway! </p>\n<p>He started hugging and kissing her again! by golly, the eel wasn''t dead!It jumped straight up and started to fight again. </p>\n<p>I guess eels are like cats-they have nine lives or something like that. this time, sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it. </p>\n<p>After a 35 minute struggle they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead because I saw sis boyfriend peel it''s skin off and flush it down the toilet!"</p>\n<p>Little jonny''s mom fainted
Relationships: When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled ''All Men Are Idiots.'' Then she will get on with her life. A mail has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3 am on a Sunday morning, he will call and say, ''I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I''ll never forgive you, and hate you, and you''re a total floozy. But I want you to know that there''s always a chance for us.'' This is known as the ''I Hate You, I Love You'' drunken phone call and 99 percent of all men have made it at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need.Sex: Women prefer 30 to 40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30 to 40 seconds of foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.Maturity: Women mature much faster than men do. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.Magazines: Men''s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women''s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman''s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.Bathrooms: A man has five items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman''s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.Groceries: A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampetts'' car on The Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10?items?or?less lane.Cats: Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren''t looking, men kick cats.Offspring: Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.Dressing Up: A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.Laundry: Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a van and take his mountain of clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by reruns of old American sitcoms.Eating Out: When the bill comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it''s only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.Mirrors: Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror. Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any, shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, bald boyfriend''s/father''s heads.Menopause: When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, biological Changes. Nature provokes a uniform reaction in men. He buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.Richard Gere: Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because lie reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.Madonna: Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.Toys: Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical. Examples of men''s toys: little miniature TVs. Cell phones. Complicated juicers and blenders. Graphic equalizers. Small robots that serve cocktails on command. Video games. Anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least six big batteries to operate.Locker Rooms: In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don''t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about one thing in the locker room: sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.Movies: Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man. Men will only show their arse, because arse size doesn''t really matter.Jewelry: Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that''s it. Any more than that and he will look like a lounge singer named Ramone.Time: When a woman says she''ll be ready to go out in five more minutes, she''s using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football game just has five minutes left. Neither of them is counting time outs, commercials, or replays.Friends: Women on a ''girls'' night out'' talk the whole time. Men on a ''boys'' night out'' say about 20 words all night, most of which are ''Pass the chips'' or ''Got am more beer?''Toilets: Men use toilets for purely biological reasons. Women use toilets as social lounges. Men in toilets will never speak a word to each other. Women who''ve never met will leave a toilet giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, ''Hey Tom, I, was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?''

Two confirmed bachelors were sitting and talking. Their conversation drifted from sports to cooking. "I got a cookbook once," said the first, "but I could never do anything with it.""Too much fancy cooking in it, eh?" asked the second."You said it.

One day, John''s tennis elbow was acting up and he decided to stop in and see a doctor. When he got to the doctor''s office the nurse told him he could see the doctor in 15 minutes but, first he''d have to give a urine sample. John said that this was absurd but, the nurse insisted and John complied. 15 minutes later, John was ushered in to see the doctor.</p>\n<p>"So that tennis elbow is really acting up, huh?" the doctor said.</p>\n<p>"The nurse must have told you," said John, wondering how the Doctor knew.</p>\n<p>"No. It was in your urinalysis." and the doctor continued to say that he had just purchased this new machine that could diagnose every physical condition with total accuracy based on the urine contents.  John didn''t believe a word of this but he did agree to provide another urine sample on check-up visit.</p>\n<p>Two days later, John was sitting at the kitchen table with his wife and his teenage daughter. He was telling them about this ridiculous machine. When John decided to have a little fun with the doctor. John pissed in the bottle as did his wife and teenage daughter. Then while walking to his garage he had a brainstorm. John put a few drops of oil from his crankcase in the jar and finally beat off and put a few drops of semen in the jar. He drove to the doctors office, shook the bottle, then handed it to the nurse. This time his urinalysis took half an hour. Finally, John was ushered in to see the doctor.</p>\n<p>The doctor looked at him and said, "I''ve got some bad news, smartass. Your daughter is pregnant, your wife''s got V. D., your car is about to throw a rod, and if you don''t stop beating off, that tennis elbow is never gonna heal!"

He was telling them about this ridiculous machine. When John decided to have a little fun with the doctor. John pissed in the bottle as did his wife and teenage daughter. Then while walking to his garage he had a brainstorm. John put a few drops of oil from his crankcase in the jar and finally beat off and put a few drops of semen in the jar. He drove to the doctors office, shook the bottle, then handed it to the nurse. This time his urinalysis took half an hour. Finally, John was ushered in to see the doctor.</p>\n<p>The doctor looked at him and said, "I''ve got some bad news, smartass. Your daughter is pregnant, your wife''s got V. D., your car is about to throw a rod, and if you don''t stop beating off, that tennis elbow is never gonna heal!"
There was this guy who went golfing every Saturday and Sunday, it didn''t<br /> matter what kind of weather it was he was hooked on a round of golf. One<br /> Saturday he left the house early and headed for the golf course, but it was so<br /> bitter cold that he decided he wouldn''t golf that day and went back home. </p>\n<p>His wife was still in bed when he got there, so he took of his clothes and<br /> snuggled up to his wife''s backside and said "Terrible weather out there." </p>\n<p>She replied, "Yeah, and can you believe my stupid husband went golfing?"
An avid duck hunter was in the market for a new bird dog. His search ended<br /> when he found a dog that could actually walk on water to retrieve a duck.<br /> Shocked by his find, he was sure none of his friends would ever believe him.<br /> He decided to try to break the news to a friend of his, a pessimist by nature,<br /> and invited him to hunt with him and his new dog. As they waited by the shore, a<br /> flock of ducks flew by. They fired, and a duck fell. The dog responded and<br /> jumped into the water. The dog, however, did not sink but instead walked across<br /> the water to retrieve the bird, never getting more than his paws wet.<br /> The friend saw everything but did not say a single word.<br /> On the drive home the hunter asked his friend, "Did you notice anything<br /> unusual about my new dog?"<br /> I sure did," responded his friend. "He can''t swim.
A country preacher decided to skip services one Sunday and head<br /> to the hills to do some bear hunting. As he rounded the corner<br /> on a perilous twist in the trail, he and a bear collided,<br /> sending him and his rifle tumbling down the mountainside. Before<br /> he knew it, his rifle went one way and he went the other,<br /> landing on a rock and breaking both legs. That was the good<br /> news. The bad news was the ferocious bear charging at him from a<br /> distance, and he couldn''t move. "Oh, Lord," the preacher prayed,<br /> "I''m so sorry for skipping services today to come out here and<br /> hunt. Please forgive me and grant me just one wish...please make<br /> a Christian out of that bear that''s coming at me. Please, Lord!"</p>\n<p>That very instant, the bear skidded to a halt, fell to its<br /> knees, clasped its paws together and began to pray aloud right<br /> at the preacher''s feet. "Dear God, bless this food I am about to<br /> receive...."
Everyday I give thanks to God,        I have two mounds upon my bod.         I shave my legs,     sit down to pee,         I can justify any shopping spree.   Don''t go to a barber,       but a beauty salon,         Can get a massage, without a hard-on.         Can balance the checkbook,     can pump my own gas,         Can talk to my friends about the size of my ass.     My beauty''s a masterpiece, and yes,     it takes long,         At least I can admit to others when I''m wrong.         I don''t drive in circles at any cost,         And I don''t have a problem admitting I''m lost.         Don''t act like I''m in a timed marathon,         Every time I have to go to the john.         I don''t brag about the size of my "cup",         Hey, put the seat down,     ''cause I won''t leave it up!     I never forget an important date,         You just gotta deal,      I''m usually late.         I don''t watch movies with lots of gore,         Don''t need instant replay to remember the score.         I won''t lose my hair,         I don''t get jock itch.         And just cause I''m assertive,     Don''t call me a bitch.         I don''t wear the same underwear everyday,     The food in my fridge has no sign of decay.     Don''t burp, don''t belch and I certainly don''t fart,         Ballet, not football, is what I consider an art.     Don''t say to your friends,     "Oh yeah, I can get her",         In your dreams, my dear, I can do better!     Flowers are okay,     but jewelry''s best,        Would you look at my face,     not at my chest!       I don''t have a problem expressing my feelings,         I know when you''re lying,         you look at the ceiling.     Don''t call me a girl,         a babe or a chick,         I am a WOMAN, get it,         you prick?     Let me tell all you men,     Listen to me boys,        Those things in your pants,         That you treat as toys     You love them more then we ever will         We would rather suck on a cold pickled dill.       I know all you men         Think that you''re "IT",         But compared to a woman,         You just ain''t SHIT!

When Choosing A Mate, Compare These Other Professionals To Computer Programmers<br /> DOCTORS<br /> Supposedly, all women are after a Doctor, so don''t expect your relationship to last more than 5 years. Eventually, he''ll run off with some nurse from his office, or one of his young women patients who is pretending to be sick. He''ll wait until you are stuck with a few kids to do this. </p>\n<p>This is not a problem with your programmer husband. He had a hard enough time meeting you. It is unlikely he''ll ever meet another woman in his profession. </p>\n<p>LAWYER<br /> Do you seriously expect an honest, trusting relationship with someone who gets paid for lying? </p>\n<p>Once again, this is not a problem with your programmer spouse. He doesn''t have enough social skills to lie convincingly. An additional drawback to marrying a lawyer is when the divorce happens you will get nothing. </p>\n<p>SALESMAN<br /> See honesty segment under Lawyer. Plus, he will be traveling to trade shows, etc, where he will be in the company of other equally trustworthy individuals. Don''t be surprised when you get the invitation to show up on the Ricki Lake show. </p>\n<p>The company that your programmer husband works at will keep him in a cage, often called a cubicle, until he is ready to go home to you. </p>\n<p>HAZARDOUS PROFESSIONS, I.E. POLICE OFFICER, FIREFIGHTER, CONSTRUCTION WORKER, ETC.<br /> Your husband, if he is not dead by some accident, will likely be crippled with a back injury, etc, just about the time you are at your sexual peak. </p>\n<p>The only hazards that your programmer husband will face is losing his eyesight by staring at the terminal for too long. This hazard actually has some benefits. For one, he will not notice that you are getting older, since you will be a blur. He will remember you as when he first met you, because the memory will still be sharp. And when you ask "Honey, were you looking at her?" he''ll honestly be able to say that he didn''t even see her. </p>\n<p>TEACHER<br /> The only reason he entered this profession is so that he could be surrounded by newly post-pubescent girls who idolize him. He''ll be in jail soon, and then you''ll have to look for another man.

If you receive an email entitled "Badtimes," delete it immediately! Do not open it. Apparently, this one is pretty nasty.</p>\n<p>It will not only erase everything on your hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your computer. It demagnetizes the stripes on ALL of your credit cards. It reprograms your ATM access code, screws up the tracking on your VCR and uses subspace field harmonics to scratch any CD''s you attempt to play. It will re-calibrate your refrigerator''s coolness settings so all your ice cream melts and your milk curdles. It will program your phone''s autodial to call only your mother-in-law''s number. This virus will mix antifreeze into your fish tank. It will drink all your beer. It will leave dirty socks on the coffee table when you are expecting company. Its radioactive emissions will cause your toe jam and bellybutton fuzz (be honest, you have some)to migrate behind your ears. It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine, all while dating your current boy/girlfriend behind your back and billing their hotel rendezvous to your Visa card. It will cause you to run with scissors and throw things in a way that is only fun until someone loses an eye. It will give you Dutch Elm Disease and Tinea. It will rewrite your backup files, changing all your active verbs to passive tense and incorporating undetectable misspellings, which grossly change the interpretations of key sentences. If the "Badtimes" message is opened in a Windows95 environment, it will leave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously close to a full bathtub. It will not only remove the forbidden tags from your mattresses and pillows, but it will also refill your skim milk with whole milk. It will replace all your luncheon meat with Spam. It will molecularly rearrange your cologne or perfume, causing it to smell like dill pickles. It is insidious and subtle. It is dangerous and terrifying to behold. It is also a rather interesting shade of mauve.   These are just a few signs of infection. PLEASE FORWARD THIS MESSAGE TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!! LIFE IS UNCERTAIN; EAT YOUR DESSERT FIRST!
This guy is stranded on a desert island, all alone for ten years. One day he sees a speck in the horizon. He thinks to himself, "It''s not a ship." </p>\n<p>The speck gets a little closer and he thinks, "It''s not a boat." </p>\n<p>The speck gets even closer and he thinks, "It''s not a raft." </p>\n<p>Then, out of the surf comes this gorgeous blonde woman, wearing a wet suit and scuba gear. She comes up to the guy and she says, "How long has it been since you''ve had a cigarette?" </p>\n<p>"Ten years!" he says. She reaches over, unzips this waterproof pocket on her left sleave and pulls out a pack of fresh cigarettes. He takes one, lights it, takes a long drag and says, "Man , oh man! Is that good!" </p>\n<p>Then she asked, "How long has it been since you''ve had a drink of whiskey? </p>\n<p>"He replies, "Ten years!" She reaches over, unzips her waterproof pocket on the right, pulls out a flask and gives it to him. He takes a long swig and says, "Wow, that''s fantastic!" </p>\n<p>Then she starts unzipping this long zipper that runs down the front of her wet suit and she says to him, "And how long has it been since you''ve has some REAL fun?" </p>\n<p>And the mans replies, "My God! Don''t tell me that you''ve got golf clubs in there!"
A guy goes to his local church during the week to see the priest and confess his sins. He goes into the confessional box and says, "Father during the week I said the F-word." </p>\n<p>The priest says, "Well my son, say 3 Hail Mary''s and your sins will be forgiven." </p>\n<p>The guy however was quite eager to explain to the priest why he had used the F-word and grudgingly the priest agreed to listen to his explanation. </p>\n<p>"Well I was playing golf last Sunday instead of coming to church," said the guy. </p>\n<p>"Is that why you said the F-word?" the priest asked. </p>\n<p>"No," the guy replied. "I was on the first tee and I duck hooked my drive into this terrible rough." </p>\n<p>"Is that why you said the F-word?" the priest asked. </p>\n<p>"No," the guy replied getting quite annoyed with the constant interruptions to his story. "My ball took a lucky kick out of the rough and I was left with a perfect shot to the green." </p>\n<p>"Is that why you said the F-word?" the priest asked. </p>\n<p>"No," the guy said. "As I went to play my ball a squirrel grabbed it and took off with it." </p>\n<p>"Is that why you said the F-word?" the priest asked. </p>\n<p>"No," the guy replied. "As the squirrel was running away with my ball an eagle swooped down on it and took off with the squirrel and my ball." </p>\n<p>"Is that why you said the F-word?" the priest asked. </p>\n<p>"No," the guy replied. "The eagle dropped the squirrel over the green and the ball rolled out of its mouth and finished 5 inches from the hole." </p>\n<p>The priest said, "Don''t tell - me you missed the fucking putt!"

A pretty woman is driving down a country road in her new sports car when the car breaks down. Luckily, she happens to be near a farmhouse. She goes up to the farmhouse and knocks on the door. When the farmer answers, she says to him, "Oh, it''s Sunday night and my car broke down! Can I stay here for the night until tomorrow when I can get some help?""Well," drawls the farmer, "you can stay here, but I don''t want you messin'' with my sons Jed and Luke."She looks through the screen door and sees two young men standing behind the farmer. She judges them to be in the early twenties. "Okay," she says.After they have gone to bed for the night the woman begins to get a little horny just thinking about the two boys in the room next to her. So she quietly goes into their room and says, "Boys, how would you like for me to teach you the ways of the world?"They say, "Huh?"She says, "The only thing is, I don''t want to get pregnant, so you have to wear these rubbers." She puts them on the boys, and the three of them go at it all night long.Forty years later Jed and Luke are sitting on the front porch, rocking back and forth. Jed says, "Luke?"Luke says, "Yeah, Jed?"Jed says, "You remember that woman that came by here about forty years ago and showed us the ways of the world?""Yeah," says Luke, "I remember.""Well, do you care if she gets pregnant?" asks Jed."Nope," says Luke, "I reckon not.""Me, neither," says Jed, "Let''s take these things off."
Here are some basic descriptions of what may happen if airplanes had different operating systems running them.DOS: Everybody pushes it till it glides, then jumps on and lets it coast till it skids, then jumps off, pushes, jumps back on, etc.DOS with QEMM:  Same as DOS, but with more leg room for pushing.Macintosh:  All the flight attendants, captains and baggage handlers look the same, act the same and talk the same.  Every time you ask a question, you are told you don''t need to know, don''t want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can''t even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.  Then they go on the runway and piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they''re building.CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13 airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don''t need to know where the airplane is or who it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don''t fly the airplane itself; you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don''t go anywhere. But that''s okay, because when the world is at your fingertips you never need to leave home.

Two little boys go into the grocery store. One is nine, one is four. The<br /> nine-year-old grabs a box of tampons from the shelf and carries it to the<br /> register for checkout. The cashier asks, "Oh, these must be for your mom, huh?" </p>\n<p>The nine-year-old replies, "Nope, not for my mom." Without thinking, the<br /> cashier responded, "Well, they must be for your sister then?" The nine-year-old<br /> responded, "Nope, not for my sister either."</p>\n<p>The cashier had now become curious. "Oh. Not for your mom and not for your<br /> sister -- then who are they for?" </p>\n<p>The nine-year old say, "They''re for my four-year-old little brother." The<br /> cashier is surprised: "Your four year-old-brother?" </p>\n<p>The nine-year-old explains: "Well yeah, they say on TV if you wear one of<br /> these, you can swim or ride a bike -- and my little brother can''t do either of<br /> those things."

A blonde was terribly overweight, so her doctor put her on a Diet. "I want you<br /> to eat regularly for 2 days, then skip a day, and repeat this procedure for 2<br /> weeks. The next time I see you, you''ll have lost at least 5 pounds."<br /> When the blonde returned, she shocked the doctor by losing nearly 20 pounds. </p>\n<p>"Why, that''s amazing!" the doctor said, "Did you follow my instructions?" </p>\n<p>The blonde nodded. "I''ll tell you though, I thought I was going to drop dead<br /> that 3rd day." </p>\n<p>"From hunger, you mean?" </p>\n<p>"No, from skipping.
A guy about to tee off was approached by a man who held out a card that read, "I am a deaf mute. May I please play through?" The first man gave the card back, angrily shaking his head, and saying, "No, you CANNOT play through." He assumed the guy read lips so he mouthed, "I can''t believe you would try to use your handicap to your own advantage like that! Shame on you!"The deaf man walked away and the first man whacked the ball onto the green and then walked off to finish the hole. Just as he was about to put the ball into the hole he was hit in the head with a golf ball that knocked him out cold. When he came to a few minutes later, he looked around and saw the deaf mute sternly looking at him, one hand on his hip, the other hand holding up four fingers.
There was a 10 year old boy, who''s left arm was damaged in an accident and subsequently amputated. He decided to learn judo. His Sensei (teacher) was an old Chinese judo expert. The boy learned quickly. After three months, he had learned only one move. He asked his teacher to teach him more moves. The Sensei told him that this was all he would need.Soon after, the boy entered a tournament, where he quickly advanced to the finals, where his opponent was bigger and more experienced. The boy seemed very out matched. After a long match, the opponent seemed to loose concentration. Quickly the boy took advantage and pinned what seemed to be his superior opponent. On the ride home, the boy asked his Sensei."How could I win with only one move?"The Sensei replied, "You have nearly mastered one of the most difficult moves in all of judo. And, the only defence against that move, is for your opponent to grab your left arm."
A man had to go to a strange town to be the guest speaker at a business meeting. When he arrived at the Motel in town, he found that he had a lot of time before the meeting. </p>\n<p>He asked the clerk where the nearest golf course was and was given directions on how to get there. </p>\n<p>While playing on the front nine, he was going over the speech in his mind and became confused as to where he was on the course. </p>\n<p>Looking around, he saw a Lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her and told her about his big meeting and the speech he was to make and his confusion about where he was on the course, asked her if she knew what hole he was playing. </p>\n<p>She replied "I''m on the 7th hole and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole." </p>\n<p>He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the back nine the same thing happened. and he approached her again with the same request. </p>\n<p>She said "I''m on the 14th, you are a hole behind me, So you must be on the 13th." </p>\n<p>Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. He finished his round and went into the club house where he saw the Lady sitting at the end of the bar. He asked the bartender if he knew the Lady. </p>\n<p>The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. He approached her and said, "let me buy you a drink to show my appreciation for your help. I understand that you are a sales lady, well I am in sales also. What do you sell"? </p>\n<p>She replied, "if I told you, you would only laugh." "No I wouldn''t", he said and persisted that she tell him what she sold. </p>\n<p>"Well if you must know", she answered, "I sell Tampax." </p>\n<p>With that, he fell on the floor and laughed so hard he almost lost his breath. She said "see I knew you would laugh." </p>\n<p>"That''s not what I''m laughing at" he replied, "I''m a toilet paper salesman, so I''m still a hole behind you!"
One day three peole were late for school. One came in, half an<br /> hour late, and said to the person in charge of coming in late:<br /> "I''m sorry I''m late, sir but I was up Holly Lane." The teacher<br /> knows there is a town called Holy Lane miles away from the<br /> school, and the boy looked tired. the teacher forgave him and<br /> sent him to class.</p>\n<p> Two hours later, another tired-looking boy walks in.His excuse<br /> was also "I was up Holly Lane," so, like the first boy, he is<br /> allowed to go to class. The teacher thinks there must have been<br /> a sport event in Holy Lane, so he is not bothered by the two<br /> boys'' lateness.</p>\n<p> A while later, a tired looking girl walks in. The teacher<br /> smiles, and asks "I suppose you were up Holy Lane?"<br />  The girl,shocked, said "I am Holly Lane."

Two men walk into a bar. one is straight and one is gay. The<br /> bartender asks them, "Do you wanna play barroom football?"<br />    "Sure.

An engineer, a system''s analyst, and a programmer were on their way to a tech<br /> conference on the other side of the mountains. </p>\n<p>Half way down the other side, the brakes gave out, and the engineer steered<br /> for all his life to keep the car from going clean off the edge. </p>\n<p>It was at the last second, skidding sideways towards doom that the car finally<br /> stopped. One tire dropped over the edge. </p>\n<p>The three sprang from the car, shaking and panting. The engineer was the first<br /> to speak. </p>\n<p>"We could have been killed! I would like to get under the car and see just<br /> what happened to those brakes. Something has to be fixed." </p>\n<p>The system''s analyst agreed. "Yes, but I''d like to see the design blueprints.<br /> We could fix the problem with these cars with a little research." </p>\n<p>The programmer was scratching his head. "I wonder if that''s repeatable."
Morris was in his usual place in the morning sitting at the table, reading the paper after breakfast. He came across an article about a beautiful actress that was about to marry a football player who was known primarily for his lack of IQ and common knowledge.<br /> He turned to his wife Sherry, with a look of question on his face. "I''ll never understand why the biggest schmucks get the most attractive wives."</p>\n<p>His wife replies, "Why thank you, dear!"
Relationships:<br /> First of all, a man does not call a relationship a relationship - he refers to it as "that time when me and Suzie were doing it on a semi-regular basis".</p>\n<p>When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled "All Men Are Idiots". Then she will get on with her life.</p>\n<p>A man has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will call and say, "I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I''ll never forgive you, and I hate you, and you''re a total floozy. But I want you to know that there''s always a chance for us". This is known as the "I Hate You / I Love You" drunken phone call, that 99% if all men have made at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need; alas, these classes rarely prove effective.</p>\n<p>Admitting Mistakes:<br /> Women will sometimes admit making a mistake. The last man who admitted he was wrong was General George Custer.</p>\n<p>Bathrooms:<br /> A man has six items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream, razor, a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman''s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.<br /> Most men take only 2-3 minutes to relieve themselves. Women''s Restrooms always have long lines.</p>\n<p>Cameras:<br /> Men take photography very seriously. They''ll shell out $4000 for state of the art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography classes. Women purchase Kodak Instamatics.  Of course, women always end up taking better pictures.</p>\n<p>Cats:<br /> Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren''t looking, men kick cats.</p>\n<p>Cheerleaders:<br /> Female cheerleaders are cute, sexy, fresh, and all-American. Male<br /> cheerleaders are scary.</p>\n<p>Comedy:<br /> Let''s say a small group of men and women are in a room, watching television, and an episode of the Three Stooges comes on. Immediately, the men will get very excited; they will laugh uproariously, and even try to imitate the actions of Curly, man''s favorite Stooge. The women will roll their eyes and groan and wait it out.</p>\n<p>David Letterman:<br /> Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the Earth. Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always has a bad haircut.</p>\n<p>Directions:<br /> If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings, she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions. Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. Men will never stop and ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, "Looks like I''ve found a new way to get there." and, "I know I''m in the general neighborhood. I recognize that 7-11 store."</p>\n<p>Dressing Up:<br /> A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for: weddings, funerals.</p>\n<p>Eating out:<br /> When the check comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it''s only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller, and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their check, out come the pocket calculators.</p>\n<p>Garages:<br /> Women use garages to park their cars and store their lawnmowers. Men use garages for many things. They hang license plates in garages, they watch TV in garages, and they build useless lopsided benches in garages.</p>\n<p>Going Out:<br /> When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she **will** be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earring, finishes putting on her makeup...</p>\n<p>Groceries:<br /> A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reached the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter that the Clampett''s car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane.</p>\n<p>Handwriting:<br /> To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken- scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their "i''s" with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their "p''s" and "g''s". It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she''s dumping you, she''ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.</p>\n<p>Hats:<br /> Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.</p>\n<p>Jewelry:<br /> Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that''s it. Any more than that, and he will look like a lounge singer named Vic.</p>\n<p>Laundry:<br /> Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul, and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of "Love, American Style."</p>\n<p>Leg Warmers:<br /> Leg warmers are sexy. A woman, even if she''s walking the dog or doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers. She can wear them any time she wants. A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the "Gimme the Ball" number in "A Chorus Line."</p>\n<p>Locker Rooms:<br /> In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don''t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one thing in the locker room, sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.</p>\n<p>Low Blows:<br /> Let''s say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says "Oh, gee. That must have hurt." The man groans and doubles over, and actually *feels* the pain.</p>\n<p>Magazines:<br /> Men''s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women''s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman''s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.</p>\n<p>Maturity:<br /> Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.</p>\n<p>Menopause:<br /> When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree ofthese changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction; he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather drivin gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.</p>\n<p>Mirrors:<br /> Men are vain; they will always check themselves out in a mirror.  Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe Garagiola''s head.</p>\n<p>Moustaches:<br /> Some men look good with moustaches. Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. There are no women who look good with moustaches.</p>\n<p>Movies:<br /> Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.  This is because most movies in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh<br /> for the first time in "Gone With the Wind". For men, it''s when Jimmy Cagney shoves grapefruit in May Clark''s face in "Public Enemy".</p>\n<p>Nicknames:<br /> With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like "Ultimate Pecs" and "Big Turk," women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dave, Rob, and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.</p>\n<p>Offspring:<br /> Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.</p>\n<p>Plants:<br /> A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens.</p>\n<p>Politics:<br /> Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such as voting. Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy''s is growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign for them and cry on election night.</p>\n<p>Restrooms:<br /> Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms associal lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other. Womenwho''ve never met will leave a restroom giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, "Hey, Bob, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?</p>\n<p>This difference may be due to the fact that women don''t have to hold their genitals in the bathroom, which might make one feel self-conscious. Not having this problem, women can chat away quite comfortably while "powdering their noses". And yes, they are talking about men in their chats.</p>\n<p>Another theory is that when women "powder their noses", all they have to do is sit there. What else is there for them to do but talk to other women. Men, however, must be much more attentive to such matters. If a male turns too much to talk to someone, he''ll be leaking on his shoe. Men must be very serious and patient because heaven only knows if the stream of urine will suddenly change direction. And after all is done, men must try to remove any excess moisture unless he soils his underwear. And unlike women, there is no tissue paper nearby with which to wipe. A man must use his own skills at "towel snapping" to do the job. But no man wants to shake it forever because he might look like he''s playing with himself. The shaking routine also varies culturally as most men inthe U.K. are ''pullers'' as opposed to ''shakers''. Of course, no matter how much a man shakes or pulls, chances are still good that he''ll get that little dribble down the leg, which will expand to the size of Lake Ontario if he is wearing synthetics.</p>\n<p>After the shaking or pulling comes the tucking-it-all-back-in routine, where the male tries to not leave anything delicate in the path of the approaching zipper. As the men are all leaving the restroom, trying to button up their Levi''s, they are still trying not to look as if they''re playing with themselves. For a man, a trip to the bathroom is a very serious matter. You wouldn''t gossip and chatter at a board meeting would you?</p>\n<p>For the male, there are also the considerations like seeing how far up the trough he can pee, bombing the cigarette butt, peeling off the killer fart that he didn''t want to loose off at the bar and, his favorite, making that grunt/sigh noise as the first gush lets go, sort of a "Nnnngwwwwwaaaaa". Actually, that''s about the time the first fart goes too.</p>\n<p>Richard Gere:<br /> Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.</p>\n<p>Madonna:<br /> Same as above, but reversed.  Same reason.</p>\n<p>Sex:<br /> Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of<br /> foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.</p>\n<p>Shoes:<br /> When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip on Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes all day.</p>\n<p>Socks:<br /> Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks. Socks that are cut way below the ankles, that have pictures of clouds on them, that have a big fuzzy ball on the back.</p>\n<p>Sports Arenas:<br /> Simply put, men can always find their way around stadiums and arenas. The women usually end up following men.</p>\n<p>Telephone:<br /> Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.</p>\n<p>Toys:<br /> Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical.</p>\n<p>Examples of men''s toys: little miniature TV''s, car phones, complicated juicers and blenders, graphic equalizers, small robots that serve cocktails on command, video games, anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least 6 "D" batteries to operate. However, the only toys women still keep around when they grow up still require batteries, only few in number and smaller in size.</p>\n<p>Underwear:<br /> Colored underwear. Women are allowed, in fact encouraged, to wear colored underwear. There is no reason for a man to ever, ever, wear anything besides solid white.</p>\n<p>Weddings:<br /> When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about "the ceremony". Men talk about "the bachelor party".</p>\n<div id="nodevote result">Score: 0.0, votes: 0</div>\n
Relationships:<br /> First of all, a man does not call a relationship a relationship - he refers to it as "that time when me and Suzie were doing it on a semi-regular basis".</p>\n<p>When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled "All Men Are Idiots". Then she will get on with her life.</p>\n<p>A man has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will call and say, "I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I''ll never forgive you, and I hate you, and you''re a total floozy. But I want you to know that there''s always a chance for us". This is known as the "I Hate You / I Love You" drunken phone call, that 99% if all men have made at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need; alas, these classes rarely prove effective.</p>\n<p>Admitting Mistakes:<br /> Women will sometimes admit making a mistake. The last man who admitted he was wrong was General George Custer.</p>\n<p>Bathrooms:<br /> A man has six items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream, razor, a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman''s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.<br /> Most men take only 2-3 minutes to relieve themselves. Women''s Restrooms always have long lines.</p>\n<p>Cameras:<br /> Men take photography very seriously. They''ll shell out $4000 for state of the art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography classes. Women purchase Kodak Instamatics.  Of course, women always end up taking better pictures.</p>\n<p>Cats:<br /> Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren''t looking, men kick cats.</p>\n<p>Cheerleaders:<br /> Female cheerleaders are cute, sexy, fresh, and all-American. Male<br /> cheerleaders are scary.</p>\n<p>Comedy:<br /> Let''s say a small group of men and women are in a room, watching television, and an episode of the Three Stooges comes on.

Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their "i''s" with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their "p''s" and "g''s". It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she''s dumping you, she''ll put a smiley face at the end of the note.</p>\n<p>Hats:<br /> Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.</p>\n<p>Jewelry:<br /> Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that''s it. Any more than that, and he will look like a lounge singer named Vic.</p>\n<p>Laundry:<br /> Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul, and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of "Love, American Style."</p>\n<p>Leg Warmers:<br /> Leg warmers are sexy. A woman, even if she''s walking the dog or doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers. She can wear them any time she wants. A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the "Gimme the Ball" number in "A Chorus Line."</p>\n<p>Locker Rooms:<br /> In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don''t know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one thing in the locker room, sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.</p>\n<p>Low Blows:<br /> Let''s say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says "Oh, gee. That must have hurt." The man groans and doubles over, and actually *feels* the pain.</p>\n<p>Magazines:<br /> Men''s magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women''s magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman''s body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.</p>\n<p>Maturity:<br /> Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.</p>\n<p>Menopause:<br /> When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree ofthese changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction; he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather drivin gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.</p>\n<p>Mirrors:<br /> Men are vain; they will always check themselves out in a mirror.  Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe Garagiola''s head.</p>\n<p>Moustaches:<br /> Some men look good with moustaches. Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. There are no women who look good with moustaches.</p>\n<p>Movies:<br /> Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.  This is because most movies in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh<br /> for the first time in "Gone With the Wind". For men, it''s when Jimmy Cagney shoves grapefruit in May Clark''s face in "Public Enemy".</p>\n<p>Nicknames:<br /> With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like "Ultimate Pecs" and "Big Turk," women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dave, Rob, and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.</p>\n<p>Offspring:<br /> Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.</p>\n<p>Plants:<br /> A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens.</p>\n<p>Politics:<br /> Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such as voting. Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy''s is growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign for them and cry on election night.</p>\n<p>Restrooms:<br /> Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms associal lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other. Womenwho''ve never met will leave a restroom giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, "Hey, Bob, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?</p>\n<p>This difference may be due to the fact that women don''t have to hold their genitals in the bathroom, which might make one feel self-conscious. Not having this problem, women can chat away quite comfortably while "powdering their noses". And yes, they are talking about men in their chats.</p>\n<p>Another theory is that when women "powder their noses", all they have to do is sit there. What else is there for them to do but talk to other women. Men, however, must be much more attentive to such matters. If a male turns too much to talk to someone, he''ll be leaking on his shoe. Men must be very serious and patient because heaven only knows if the stream of urine will suddenly change direction. And after all is done, men must try to remove any excess moisture unless he soils his underwear. And unlike women, there is no tissue paper nearby with which to wipe. A man must use his own skills at "towel snapping" to do the job. But no man wants to shake it forever because he might look like he''s playing with himself. The shaking routine also varies culturally as most men inthe U.K. are ''pullers'' as opposed to ''shakers''. Of course, no matter how much a man shakes or pulls, chances are still good that he''ll get that little dribble down the leg, which will expand to the size of Lake Ontario if he is wearing synthetics.</p>\n<p>After the shaking or pulling comes the tucking-it-all-back-in routine, where the male tries to not leave anything delicate in the path of the approaching zipper. As the men are all leaving the restroom, trying to button up their Levi''s, they are still trying not to look as if they''re playing with themselves. For a man, a trip to the bathroom is a very serious matter. You wouldn''t gossip and chatter at a board meeting would you?</p>\n<p>For the male, there are also the considerations like seeing how far up the trough he can pee, bombing the cigarette butt, peeling off the killer fart that he didn''t want to loose off at the bar and, his favorite, making that grunt/sigh noise as the first gush lets go, sort of a "Nnnngwwwwwaaaaa". Actually, that''s about the time the first fart goes too.</p>\n<p>Richard Gere:<br /> Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.</p>\n<p>Madonna:<br /> Same as above, but reversed.  Same reason.</p>\n<p>Sex:<br /> Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of<br /> foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.</p>\n<p>Shoes:<br /> When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip on Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes all day.</p>\n<p>Socks:<br /> Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks. Socks that are cut way below the ankles, that have pictures of clouds on them, that have a big fuzzy ball on the back.</p>\n<p>Sports Arenas:<br /> Simply put, men can always find their way around stadiums and arenas. The women usually end up following men.</p>\n<p>Telephone:<br /> Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.</p>\n<p>Toys:<br /> Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical.</p>\n<p>Examples of men''s toys: little miniature TV''s, car phones, complicated juicers and blenders, graphic equalizers, small robots that serve cocktails on command, video games, anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least 6 "D" batteries to operate. However, the only toys women still keep around when they grow up still require batteries, only few in number and smaller in size.</p>\n<p>Underwear:<br /> Colored underwear. Women are allowed, in fact encouraged, to wear colored underwear. There is no reason for a man to ever, ever, wear anything besides solid white.</p>\n<p>Weddings:<br /> When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about "the ceremony". Men talk about "the bachelor party".</p>\n<div id="nodevote result">Score: 0.0, votes: 0</div>\n

After Quasimodo''s death, the bishop of the cathedral of  Notre Dame sent word<br /> through the streets of Paris that a  new bell ringer was needed. The bishop<br /> decided that he  would conduct the interviews personally and went up into  the<br /> belfry to begin the screening process. </p>\n<p> After observing while several applicants demonstrated their  skills, he<br /> decided to call it a day. Just then a lone,  armless man approached him and<br /> announced that he was there  to apply for the bell ringer''s job. </p>\n<p> The bishop was incredulous.  "You have no arms!" </p>\n<p> "No matter," said the man, "observe!"  He then began  striking the bells with<br /> his face, producing a beautiful  melody on the carillon. </p>\n<p> The bishop listened in astonishment, convinced that he had  finally found a<br /> suitable replacement for Quasimodo.Suddenly, while rushing forward to strike a<br /> bell, the  armless man tripped and plunged headlong out of the belfry  window to<br /> his death in the street below. </p>\n<p> The stunned bishop immediately rushed down the stairways.When he reached  the<br /> street, a crowd had gathered around  the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful<br /> music they had  heard only moments before.  As they silently parted to let  the<br /> bishop through, one of them asked, "Bishop, who was  this man?" </p>\n<p> "I don''t know his name," the bishop sadly replied, "but his  face rings a<br /> bell."

Jesus, Moses, and an old man were playing golf one day.</p>\n<p>Jesus stepped up to the tee, swung, but caught a real bad slice and the ball caught hard left straight into the pond. </p>\n<p>"No problem!" he said, and then made the ball rise so he could walk out on the pond, and chip it right onto the green.</p>\n<p>"Not bad, young fella!" Said Moses. But he suffered the same fate dropping the ball into the pond. </p>\n<p>Stepping to the edge, he parted the water, stepped in and chipped it onto the green.</p>\n<p>Finally the old man steps up. not quite certain on how the game was played, tees off. </p>\n<p>The ball also caught hard to the left, and straight to the pond. </p>\n<p>Before the ball hit, a fish dove out and ate it, but before entering the water again, a bird swoops down and eats the fish. </p>\n<p>Flying over the green, the bird coughs up the fish, when the fish hit the green, the ball popped out, onto the green and rolled right into the cup!</p>\n<p>"Hooray!!!

Women understand that babies do not come from the stork. When a women is pregnant and craves pickle and mustard sandwich�酶惟s, the man groans and wines until they remind him that you are the one having the baby HERE! But when the man craves a six pack, she diligently goes to the store and returns five hours later with a romantic movie. When women see a ''''caution'''' sign, they carefully avoid it, while men assume that it was meant for someone else, and come home with every bone broken. Women characterize the first date, by seeing how you act and eat. Men check to see if you can name at least one football, basketball or baseball star. Women can stand to be wrong, while men make about excuses ''''misunderstanding'''' and some how it is always the women''s fault. When a man attends a concert, he whoops, yells, shrieks and yelps, while gobbling down anything he can get his hands on. While women enjoy the show, dancing and socializing with friends. When women stay in the bathroom for over 45 seconds, men assume that something is wrong, and walk in to examine the situation. Women understand about privacy, and won''t come in the room until 2 hours have passed. When in a hospital, women will share all emotions. While men, being the ''''tough'''' guys that they are, will ''''stay calm'''' until someone finally notices that he has wet the chair he is sitting in. Women love to help.

One evening, three gay guys were discussing what they thought their favorite<br /> sport would be. The first decides on football, because of all those gorgeous<br /> guys bending over in their tight pants.</p>\n<p>"Definitely wrestling," sighs the second gay guy. "Those skimpy little<br /> costumes, and think of the holds!"</p>\n<p>"Definitely baseball," says the third gay guy.</p>\n<p>"Why?" asked the other two guys.</p>\n<p>Well, I''d be pitching with the bases loaded, the batter would hit a line drive<br /> right to me. I''d catch it, and I''d just stand there while the other guys rounded<br /> the bases. Meanwhile, the crowd would be going crazy, screaming, ''Throw the<br /> ball, you c**k-sucker!'' And, that''s what I like - The recognition."

There once was a man who had three girlfriends, and he couldn�酶惟t decide which one to marry. He decided to give five thousand dollars to each woman to see what she would do with it.The first woman bought new clothes for herself. She got an expensive new hairdo, a massage, a facial, a manicure, and a pedicure. She said, I spent the money so that I would look pretty for you because I love you so much.The second woman bought a VCR, a CD player, a set of golf clubs, and a tennis racket and gave them to the man. I used the money to buy you these gifts because I love you, she told him.The third woman invested the money in the stock market and within a short time had doubled her investment. She returned the initial five thousand dollars to the man and reinvested the profit. Im investing in our future because I love you so much, she said.The man carefully considered how each woman had spent the money, and married the woman with the biggest tits.

Many parents today are concerned that their offspring might somehow be involved in the world of illegal pharmaceuticals, or "drugs".  This is a healthy concern.  Knowing your kids are "high" is the first step toward helping them avoid problems with their health, their grades,  the law, and getting those hard-to-clean vomit stains out of the Oriental rug.</p>\n<p>KNOW THE WARNING SIGNS- select the option which best describes your child.</p>\n<p>1. Your child''s idea of a fun sport to play is: </p>\n<p>A) tossing a pigskin ball around </p>\n<p>B) throwing an orange rubber ball into a netted hole </p>\n<p>C) inserting a pointy needle into a vein and mixing foreign substances into the human bloodstream.</p>\n<p>2.

NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCETo the citizens of the United States of America,In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today.Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The right honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up "aluminium". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed".2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn''t that hard.4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.6. You should stop playing American "football". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays "American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American "football", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys."Merde" is French for "sh*t".8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called "Indecisive Day".9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It''s been driving us bonkers.Thank you for your co-operation.
A man came home from work sporting two black eyes.</p>\n<p>"What happened to you?" asked his wife.</p>\n<p>"I''ll never understand women," he replied.

A football coach walked into the locker room before a big game, looked over to his star player and said, "I''m not supposed to let you play since you failed math, but we really need you in there. So, what I have to do is ask you a math question, and if you get it right, you can play."</p>\n<p>The player agreed, so the coach looked into his eyes intently and asked, - "Okay, now concentrate hard and tell me the answer to this: What is two plus two?"</p>\n<p>The player thought for a moment and then answered, "4?"<br /> "Did you say 4?!" the coach exclaimed, excited that he had given the right answer.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, all the other players on the team began screaming, "Come on coach, give him another chance!"

Three guys died and when they get to the pearly gates, St. Peter meets them there.</p>\n<p>St. Peter said, "I know that you guys are forgiven because you''re here. Before I let you into Heaven, I have to ask you a couple of questions. Make sure you tell the truth because if you don''t you will forfeit your privilege of being here and we''ll have to ask you to visit our friend below. Your answers will also determine what kind of car you get. You have to have a car here in Heaven because it is so big!"</p>\n<p>The first guy walks up and Peter asks him, "How long were you married?"</p>\n<p>The guy replies, "24 years."</p>\n<p>St. Peter then asks, "Did you ever cheat on your wife?"</p>\n<p>The guy says, "Yes, about 10 times...but you said I was forgiven."</p>\n<p>Peter said, "yeah, but that''s not too good. Here''s a Pinto for you to drive."</p>\n<p>The second guy walks up and gets the same questions from Peter to which he replies, "I was married for 41 years and cheated on her only once, but that was during our first year and we worked it out and I was faithful there after."</p>\n<p>Peter said, "I''m pleased to hear that, here''s a Lincoln Town Car for you to drive."</p>\n<p>The third guy walked up and said, "Peter, I know what you''re going to ask. I was married for 63 years and didn''t even look at another woman! I treated my wife like a queen!"</p>\n<p>Peter said, "That''s what I like to hear. Here''s a Jaguar for you to drive" </p>\n<p>A little while later, the two guys with the Lincoln and the Pinto saw the guy with the Jaguar crying on the golden sidewalk so they went to see what was the matter. When they asked him what was wrong he tearily said, "I just saw my wife and she was on a skateboard!"

These are stories and test questions accumulated by music teachers in the state of Missouri.Music EducationAgnus Dei was a woman composer famous for her church music.Refrain means don''t do it.  A refrain in music is the part you better not try to sing.A virtuoso is a musician with real high morals.John Sebastian Bach died from 1750 to the present.Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English.  He was rather large.Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf.  He was so deaf he wrote loud music.  He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was calling him.  I guess he could not hear so good.  Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died from this.Henry Purcell is a well known composer few people have ever heard of.Aaron Copland is one of your most famous contemporary composers.  It is unusual to be contemporary.  Most composers do not live until they are dead.An opera is a song of bigly size.In the last scene of Pagliacci, Canio stabs Nedda who is the one he really loves.  Pretty soon Silvio also gets stabbed, and they all live happily ever after.When a singer sings, he stirs up the air and makes it hit any passing eardrums.  But if he is good, he knows how to keep it from hurting.Music sung by two people at the same time is called a duel.I know what a sextet is but I had rather not say.Caruso was at first an Italian.  Then someone heard his voice and said he would go a long way.  And so he came to America.A good orchestra is always ready to play if the conductor steps on the odium.Morris dancing is a country survival from times when people were happy.Most authorities agree that music of antiquity was written long ago.Probably the most marvelous fugue was the one between the Hatfields and McCoys.My very best liked piece of music is the Bronze Lullaby.My favorite composer is Opus.A harp is a nude piano.A tuba is much larger than its name.Instruments come in many sizes, shapes and orchestras.You should always say celli when you mean there are two or more cellos.Another name for kettle drums is timpani.  But I think I will just stick with the first name and learn it good.A trumpet is an instrument when it is not an elephant sound.While trombones have tubes, trumpets prefer to wear valves.The double bass is also called the bass viol, string bass, and bass fiddle.  It has so many names because it is so huge.When electric currents go through them, guitars start making sounds.  So would anybody.Question:  What are kettle drums called?  Answer:  Kettle drums.Cymbals are round, metal CLANGS!A bassoon looks like nothing I have ever heard.Last month I found out how a clarinet works by taking it apart.  I both found out and got in trouble.Question:  Is the saxophone a brass or a woodwind instrument?  Answer: Yes.The concertmaster of an orchestra is always the person who sits in the first chair of the first violins.  This means that when a person is elected concertmaster, he has to hurry up and learn how to play a violin real good.For some reason, they always put a treble clef in front of every line of flute music.  You just watch.I can''t reach the brakes on this piano!The main trouble with a French horn is it''s too tangled up.Anyone who can read all the instrument notes at the same time gets to be the conductor.Instrumentalist is a many-purposed word for many player-types.The flute is a skinny-high shape-sounded instrument.The most dangerous part about playing cymbals is near the nose.A contra-bassoon is like a bassoon, only more so.Tubas are a bit too much.Music instrument has a plural known as orchestra.I would like for you to teach me to play the cello.  Would tomorrow or Friday be best?My favorite instrument is the bassoon.  It is so hard to play people seldom play it.  That is why I like the bassoon best.It is easy to teach anyone to play the maracas.

I never had 3 girls at once, I need something to keep me horny, keep me potent." </p>\n<p>So the pharmacist reaches under the counter, unlocks the bottom drawer and takes out a small black cardboard box marked with an "X" and says "Here, if you eat this you''ll go NUTS for 12 hours!" </p>\n<p>The guy says "gimmee 3 boxes". </p>\n<p>Same guy walks into the same pharmacy, right up to the same pharmacist and pulls down his pants. The pharmacist looks in horror as he notices the man''s dick is black blue, the skin''s hanging off in places. The man says "gimmee a bottle of Absorbine Jr." </p>\n<p>To which the pharmacist replies "ABSORBINE JR.? You''re not going to put ABSORBINE JR. on that are you?" </p>\n<p>The guy says, "No it''s for my arms, the girls didn''t show up".

A man dressed in a suit comes up to the front porch of house juggling a clipboard, some papers, and a briefcase. He knocks on the door and it''s answered by a middle-aged man, "Mornin'' stranger, what can I do for ya?". </p>\n<p>"Well sir, I represent Schneller, Barnum, and Holtz. We''re paid by private companies to canvas thousands of consumers like yourself for feedback on their products. Today we''re soliciting comments on Vaseline petroleum jelly. Would you have time to answer just a couple of questions?" </p>\n<p>"I don''t see how a couple of questions could hurt, fire away young man", says the homeowner. </p>\n<p>Looking down at his clipboard, the survey-taker asks, "Okay...first, you do use Vaseline, correct?"</p>\n<p>"Yessir, for as long as I can remember". </p>\n<p>"Great, now what exactly do you use it for?" replies the survey-taker with his pen poised over his clipboard, ready to record the answer. </p>\n<p>"Let''s see.....we use it for dry skin, chapped lips, and sex." </p>\n<p>The well-dressed man stops writing abruptly. He looks around, leans forward and in a low voice says "We pride ourselves in being very thorough sir. I know how you''d use Vaseline for dry skin and chapped lips. But would you mind telling me how you use it for sex?" </p>\n<p>"No problem," the homeowner says in a whisper, "we put it on our bedroom doorknob". </p>\n<p>The survey-taker gets a strange look on his face and takes a step backwards before the homeowner continues, "It keeps the kids out".
I took some clients out to dinner last week, and I noticed a spoon in the<br /> shirt pocket of our waiter as he handed us the menus. It seemed a little odd,<br /> but I dismissed it as a random thing. Until our busboy came with water and<br /> tableware; he too, sported a spoon in his breast pocket. I looked around the<br /> room, and all the waiters and busboys had spoons in their pockets. When our<br /> waiter returned to take our order, I just had to ask, "Why the spoons?" </p>\n<p>"Well," he explained, "our parent company recently hired some Andersen<br /> Consulting efficiency experts to review all our procedures, and after months of<br /> statistical analyses, they concluded that our patrons drop spoons on the floor<br /> 73% more often than any other utensil, at a frequency of 3 spoons per hour per<br /> workstation. By preparing our workers for this contingency in advance, we can<br /> cut our trips to the kitchen down and save time... nearly 1.5 extra man-hours<br /> per shift." Just as he concluded, a "ch-ching" came from the table behind him,<br /> and he quickly replaced the fallen spoon with the one from his pocket."I''ll grab<br /> another spoon the next time I''m in the kitchen instead of making a special<br /> trip," he proudly explained. </p>\n<p>I was impressed. "Thanks, I had to ask." </p>\n<p>"No problem," he answered. Then he continued to take our orders. As the<br /> members of our dinner party took their turns, my eyes darted back and forth from<br /> each person ordering and my menu. That''s when, out of the corner of my eye, I<br /> spotted a thin black thread protruding from our waiter''s fly. Again, I dismissed<br /> it; yet I had to scan the room and, sure enough, there were other waiters and<br /> busboys with strings hanging out of their trousers. My curiosity overrode<br /> discretion at this point, so before he could leave I had to ask. "Excuse me,<br /> but...uh...why, or what about that string?" </p>\n<p>"Oh, yeah," he began, in a quieter tone, "not many people are that observant.<br /> That same efficiency group found we could save time in the Men''s Room, too." </p>\n<p>"How''s that?" I asked. </p>\n<p>"You see, by tying a string to the end of our, uh, selves, we can pull it out<br /> at the urinals literally hands-free and thereby eliminate the need to wash our<br /> hands, cutting time spent in the washroom by over 93%!" </p>\n<p>"Hey, wait a minute. If the string helps you pull it out, how do you get it<br /> back in?" </p>\n<p>"Well," he whispered, "I don''t know about the other guys, but I use the<br /> spoon."

Most diets fail because we are still thinking and eating like people. For those us who have never had any success dieting. Well now there is the new Miracle Cat Diet! This diet will also work on humans! Except for cats that eat like people -- such as getting lots of table scraps -- most cats are long and lean (or tiny and petite). the Cat Miracle Diet will help you achieve the same lean, svelte figure. Just follow this diet for one week and you''ll find that you not only look and feel better, but you will have a whole new outlook on what constitutes food. Good Luck! </p>\n<p>DAY ONE </p>\n<p>Breakfast: Open can of expensive gourmet cat food. Any flavor as long as it cost more the .75 per can -- and place 1/4 cup on your plate. Eat 1 bite of food; look around room disdainfully. Knock the rest on the floor. Stare at the wall for awhile before stalking off into the other room. </p>\n<p>Lunch: Four blades of grass and one lizard tail. Throw it back up on the cleanest carpet in your house. </p>\n<p>Dinner: Catch a moth and play with it until it is almost dead. Eat one wing. Leave the rest to die.</p>\n<p>Bedtime snack: Steal one green bean from your spouse''s or partner''s plate. Bat it around the floor until it goes under the refrigerator. Steal one small piece of chicken and eat half of it. Leave the other half on the sofa. Throw out the remaining gourmet cat food from the can you opened this morning. </p>\n<p>DAY TWO </p>\n<p>Breakfast: Picking up the remaining chicken bite from the sofa. Knock it onto the carpet and bat it under the television set. Chew on the corner of the newspaper as your spouse/partner tries to read it. </p>\n<p>Lunch: Break into the fresh French bread that you bought as your part of the dinner party on Saturday. Lick the top of it all over. Take one bite out of the middle of the loaf. </p>\n<p>Afternoon snack: Catch a large beetle and bring it into the house. Play toss and catch with it until it is mushy and half dead. Allow it to escape under the bed. </p>\n<p>Dinner: Open a fresh can of dark-colored gourmet cat food -- tuna or beef works well. Eat it voraciously. Walk from your kitchen to the edge of the living room rug. Promptly throw up on the rug. Step into it as you leave. Track footprints across the entire room. </p>\n<p>DAY THREE </p>\n<p>Breakfast: Drink part of the milk from your spouse''s or partner''s cereal bowl when no one is looking. Splatter part of it on the closest polished aluminum appliance you can find. </p>\n<p>Lunch: Catch a small bird and bring it into the house. Play with on top of your down filled comforter. Make sure the bird is seriously injured but not dead before you abandon it for someone else to have to deal with. </p>\n<p>Dinner: Beg and cry until you are given some ice cream or milk in a bowl of your own. Take three licks/laps and then turn the bowl over on the floor. </p>\n<p>FINAL DAY </p>\n<p>Breakfast: Eat 6 bugs, any type, being sure to leave a collection of legs, wings, antennae on the bathroom floor. Drink lots of water. Throw the bugs and all of the water up on your spouse''s or partner''s pillow. </p>\n<p>Lunch: Remove the chicken skin from last night''s chicken-to-go leftovers your spouse or partner placed in the trash can. Drag the skin across the floor several times. Chew it in a corner and then abandon.</p>\n<p>Dinner: Open another can of expensive gourmet cat food. Select a flavor that is especially runny, like Chicken and Giblets in Gravy. Lick off all the gravy and leave the actual meat to dry and get hard.

Three guys died and when they get to the pearly gates, St. Peter meets them<br /> there.</p>\n<p>St. Peter said, "I know that you guys are forgiven because you''re<br /> here. Before I let you into Heaven, I have to ask you a couple of questions.<br /> Make sure you tell the truth because if you don''t you will forfeit your<br /> privilege of being here and we''ll have to ask you to visit our friend below.<br /> Your answers will also determine what kind of car you get. You have to have a<br /> car here in Heaven because it is so big!"</p>\n<p>The first guy walks up and Peter asks him, "How long were you married?"</p>\n<p>The guy replies, "24 years."</p>\n<p>St. Peter then asks, "Did you ever cheat on your wife?"</p>\n<p>The guy says, "Yes, about 10 times...but you said I was forgiven."</p>\n<p>Peter said, "yeah, but that''s not too good. Here''s a Pinto for you to drive."</p>\n<p>The second guy walks up and gets the same questions from Peter to whom he<br /> replies, "I was married for 41 years and cheated on her only once, but that was<br /> during our first year and we worked it out and I was faithful there after."</p>\n<p>Peter said, "I''m pleased to hear that, here''s a Lincoln Town Car for you to<br /> drive."</p>\n<p>The third guy walked up and said, "Peter, I know what you''re going to<br /> ask. I was married for 63 years and didn''t even look at another woman! I treated<br /> my wife like a queen!"</p>\n<p>Peter said, "That''s what I like to hear. Here''s a Jaguar for you to drive" A<br /> little while later, the two guys with the Lincoln and the Pinto saw the guy with<br /> the Jaguar crying on the golden sidewalk so they went to see what was the<br /> matter. When they asked him what was wrong he wearily said, "I just saw my wife<br /> and she was on a skateboard!"

THE MAN''S POINTS SYSTEM</p>\n<p>For all you guys out there who just can''t figure it out, here it<br /> is:</p>\n<p>In the world of romance, one single rule applies: Make the woman<br /> happy.

A man had been out in the back woods for weeks, cutting logs. He was a bit scruffy and didn''t smell very good. Finally he needed a break and came in to town for a few beers.In the bar, he saw the local jock of the town''s football team. He was bragging about his girlfriend and how she was lucky to have him for a boyfriend.The lumberjack, after drinking six bottles of beer, was heard to say, "Buddy, if she went out with me, she''d never go out with you ever again."To which the local jock replied, "Hey buddy, if she went out with you, she''d never go out with ANYONE ever again."

A golfer and his buddies where playing a big round of golf for $200. At the eighteenth green the golfer had a ten foot putt to win the round, and the $200.</p>\n<p>As he was lining up his putt, a funeral procession started to pass by. The golfer set down his putter, took his hat off, placed it over his chest, and began to wait for the funeral procession to pass. After it passed, he picked up his putter and returned to lining up his putt.</p>\n<p>One of his buddies said, "That was the most touching thing I have ever seen.  I can''t believe you stopped playing, possibly loosing your concentration, to pay your respects."</p>\n<p>"Well, we were married for 25 years!"
Two blondes were playing golf at a foggy par three, and could see the flag, but not the green. Each hit their ball anyway. When they walked to the green, they discovered one about three feet from the cup, while the other somehow had gone directly in. They tried to figure out which ball belonged to who, since they were both using Titleist number threes. Unable to decide, they returned to the Club House and asked the golf pro for a ruling. </p>\n<p>After hearing their story and congratulating them both on their superb shots under such adverse conditions he asked, "OK, so who was playing the yellow ball ?"
Two Rednecks went bear hunting. While one stayed in the cabin, the other went out looking for a bear. He soon found a huge bear, shot at it but only wounded it. The enraged bear charged toward him, he dropped his rifle and started running for the cabin as fast as he could. He ran pretty fast but the bear was just a little faster and gained on him with every step. Just as he reached the open cabin door, he tripped and fell flat. Too close behind to stop, the bear tripped over him and went rolling into the cabin. The man jumped up, closed the cabin door and yelled to his friend inside, "You skin this one while I go and get another!"

The room was full of pregnant women and their partners, and the Lamaze class<br /> was in full swing.</p>\n<p>The instructor was teaching the women how to breathe properly, along with<br /> informing the men how to give the necessary assurances at this stage of the<br /> plan.</p>\n<p>The teacher then announced, "Ladies, exercise is good for you.

Here are answers to 5 of the toughest questions women ask men. </p>\n<p>1 - "What are you thinking?" </p>\n<p>2 - "Do you love me?" </p>\n<p>3 - "Do I look fat?" </p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she is prettier than me?" </p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example:</p>\n<p>1 - "What are you thinking?" </p>\n<p>The proper answer to this question, of course is, "I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you." </p>\n<p>Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things: </p>\n<p>a - Baseball </p>\n<p>b - Football </p>\n<p>c - How fat you are </p>\n<p>d - How much prettier she is than you </p>\n<p>e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. "If I wanted you to know," Al said, "I''d be talking instead of thinking." </p>\n<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers: </p>\n<p>2 - "Do you love me?" </p>\n<p>The correct answer to this question is, "Yes." For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, "Yes, dear." </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - I suppose so. </p>\n<p>b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes? </p>\n<p>c - That depends on what you mean by "love". </p>\n<p>d - Does it matter? </p>\n<p>e - Who, me? </p>\n<p>3 - "Do I look fat?" </p>\n<p>The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, "No, of course not" and then quickly leave the room. </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either. </p>\n<p>b - Compared to what? </p>\n<p>c - A little extra weight looks good on you. </p>\n<p>d - I''ve seen fatter. </p>\n<p>e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she''s prettier than me?" </p>\n<p>The "she" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, "No, you are much prettier." </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. </p>\n<p>b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things. </p>\n<p>c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality. </p>\n<p>d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner. </p>\n<p>e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>Correct answer: "Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino''s Pizza truck that came my way." </p>\n<p>This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid exchange: </p>\n<p>"Dear," said the wife. "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>"Why, dear, I would be extremely upset," said the husband. "Why do you ask such a question?" </p>\n<p>"Would you remarry?" persevered the wife. </p>\n<p>"No, of course not, dear" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Don''t you like being married?" said the wife. </p>\n<p>"Of course I do, dear" he said. </p>\n<p>"Then why wouldn''t you remarry?" </p>\n<p>"Alright," said the husband, "I''d remarry." </p>\n<p>"You would?" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>\n<p>"Yes" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Would you sleep with her in our bed?" said the wife after a long pause. </p>\n<p>"Well yes, I suppose I would." replied the husband. </p>\n<p>"I see," said the wife indignantly. </p>\n<p>"And would you let her wear my old clothes?" </p>\n<p>"I suppose, if she wanted to" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Really," said the wife icily. </p>\n<p>"And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?" </p>\n<p>"Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do." </p>\n<p>"Is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet. </p>\n<p>"And I suppose you''d let her play with my golf clubs, too." </p>\n<p>"Of course not, dear," said the husband. "She''s left-handed..."

I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she''s prettier than me?" </p>\n<p>The "she" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, "No, you are much prettier." </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. </p>\n<p>b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things. </p>\n<p>c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality. </p>\n<p>d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner. </p>\n<p>e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>Correct answer: "Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino''s Pizza truck that came my way." </p>\n<p>This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid exchange: </p>\n<p>"Dear," said the wife. "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>"Why, dear, I would be extremely upset," said the husband. "Why do you ask such a question?" </p>\n<p>"Would you remarry?" persevered the wife. </p>\n<p>"No, of course not, dear" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Don''t you like being married?" said the wife. </p>\n<p>"Of course I do, dear" he said. </p>\n<p>"Then why wouldn''t you remarry?" </p>\n<p>"Alright," said the husband, "I''d remarry." </p>\n<p>"You would?" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>\n<p>"Yes" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Would you sleep with her in our bed?" said the wife after a long pause. </p>\n<p>"Well yes, I suppose I would." replied the husband. </p>\n<p>"I see," said the wife indignantly. </p>\n<p>"And would you let her wear my old clothes?" </p>\n<p>"I suppose, if she wanted to" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Really," said the wife icily. </p>\n<p>"And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?" </p>\n<p>"Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do." </p>\n<p>"Is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet. </p>\n<p>"And I suppose you''d let her play with my golf clubs, too." </p>\n<p>"Of course not, dear," said the husband. "She''s left-handed..."

Morris walks out into the street and manages to get a taxi just going by. He gets into the taxi, and the cabbie says, "Perfect timing. You''re just like Dave." </p>\n<p>"Who?" </p>\n<p>"Dave Aronson. There''s a guy who did everything right. Like my coming along when you needed a cab.

An institution for the mentally ill arranged for its inmates to attend a baseball game. The director spent days training the patients to obey his commands, so there wouldn''t be any trouble. The day of the game was bright and sunny and the group arrived just before the first pitch. When it was time for the National Anthem, the director yelled, ''''Up, nuts!'''' and the inmates immediately rose. When the National Anthem was over, the director yelled, ''''Down, nuts!'''' and the inmates sat. The game proceeded and the inmates were well-behaved. When the home team made a good play, the director yelled, ''''Clap, nuts!'''' and the patients applauded just like normal fans. Things were going so well that the director left his seat to go get a hot dog and a beer. But when he came back, there was a riot going on. The director finally located his assistant and demanded, ''''What happened?'''' ''''Everything was fine,'''' the assistant said, ''''until some guy came over and yelled, ''Peanuts''!''''
A traveling salesman was driving down a farm road when his car suddenly<br /> stopped and wouldn''t start again. A farmer on a tractor was passing by and<br /> stopped to help the salesman fix his car. By the time they were finished, it was<br /> almost sundown, so the farmer told the salesman he could spend the night at his<br /> home if he didn''t mind sharing the bed with his twin daughters. The salesman<br /> thought the twins were kids, so he said it was okay. They farmer took the<br /> salesman to his home and went into the house.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes of talking and cleaning up, the men were called to the<br /> dinner table by the farmer''s wife. As they sat down, the salesman saw the two<br /> most beautiful young ladies he had ever seen. The farmer introduced them as his<br /> twin daughters. During the entire meal all the salesman thought about was he was<br /> sleeping in the same bed as the girls and he was going to have a good time that<br /> night. They all finished their supper and the men went and talked while the<br /> women finished cleaning up. The salesman couldn''t keep his mind off what was to<br /> be a good time. Finally it was time to go to bed and the salesman anxiously got<br /> prepared. The twins got into the bed, one on each side of the salesman. Just as<br /> the lights were going to be turned off, the farmer came into the bedroom and<br /> placed one egg on both sides of the salesman. The farmer said, "This is to make<br /> sure you don''t do anything with my daughters tonight!! If I come in tomorrow<br /> morning and find one or both eggs broken, I''ll know you did something and I''ll<br /> shoot you!! You understand? Well, the salesman looked at the eggs, the farmer,<br /> and the shotgun in the farmer''s hand and quietly replied that he understood.<br /> With that, the farmer told them goodnight and turned off the light.</p>\n<p>During the night, the salesman turned over and accidentally broke one of the<br /> eggs. "What the hell," he thought, "I''m dead anyway," and screwed the first<br /> twin. After several minutes of bliss, he rolled off of her and broke the other<br /> egg. "Might as well go out smiling," he thought and had his way with the second<br /> twin. When he was finished, he noticed that it was almost sunup and the farmer<br /> was starting to stir. Thinking quickly, he looked into his sales bag and got out<br /> a tube of superglue and glued the eggs back together. The glue dried quickly and<br /> the salesman jumped back into the bed and had just put both eggs back when the<br /> farmer entered.</p>\n<p>"I see the eggs are alright, so I guess I won''t shoot you. Want some<br /> breakfast?"</p>\n<p>"What are you making?" the salesman asked.</p>\n<p>Holding up the eggs, he said, "Eggs."</p>\n<p>"No thanks, I''ll eat later, I got to get going!!!" the salesman quickly said<br /> and grabbed his clothes and left.</p>\n<p>The farmer went to the stove and broke the first egg over the skillet, but<br /> nothing came out. He then broke the second egg and again, nothing came out.<br /> Extremely pissed off, the farmer walked out to the hen house and shouted,<br /> "Alright...which one of you roosters is wearing a rubber???"
By Barbara Florio GrahamFrom McCall''s, June, 1983I read every diet I can get my hands on.  I even follow their suggestions.  But eventually, inevitably, I always get fat again.  Now, at last, I''ve found The Answer.  After living for almost 14 years with a man who never gains an ounce no matter what I serve him, I''ve found out what it is that keeps him thin: He thinks differently.  The real difference between fat and thin people is that thin people:avoid eating popcorn in the movies because it gets their hands greasy;split a large combination pizza with three friends;think Oreo cookies are for kids;nibble cashews one at a time;think that doughnuts are indigestible;read books they have to hold with both hands;become so absorbed in a weekend project they forget to have lunch;fill the candy dish on their desks with paper clips;counteract the midafternoon slump with a nap instead of a cinnamon Danish;exchange the deep-fryer they received for Christmas for a clock-radio;lose their appetites when they''re depressed;think chocolate Easter bunnies are for kids;save leftovers that are too skimpy to use for another meal in order to make interesting soups;throw out stale potato chips;will eat only Swiss or Dutch chocolate, which cannot be found except in a special store;think it''s too much trouble to stop at a special store just to buy chocolate;don''t celebrate with a hot-fudge sundae every time they lose a pound;warm up after skiing with black coffee instead of hot chocolate and whipped cream;try all the salads at the buffet, leaving room for only one dessert;find iced tea more refreshing than an ice-cream soda;get into such interesting conversations at cocktail parties that they never quite work their way over to the hors-d''oeuvre table;have no compulsion to keep the candy dish symmetrical by reducing the jelly beans to an equal number of each color;think that topping brownies with ice cream makes too rich a dessert;bring four cookies into the TV room instead of a box;think banana splits are for kids.
Callus Collection </p>\n<p>Florence Franklin of Peoria, IL, holds the record. As of Sept 12, 1992, Florence had over 200 pounds of callus in her collection. "I shave it off people," Florence told us. "They don''t mind. Some people even autograph the big pieces." </p>\n<p>Infestation of Mites (Group) </p>\n<p>This record belongs to the 3,859 residents of Itchy Butt, Montana. In 1989, visiting doctors certified that every person in the town was suffering from scabies, a skin disease caused by mite infection. "The mites seemed to be jumping from one person to another," the mayor of Itchy Butt told us, "so we decided to get together and go for the record." </p>\n<p>Snail-Sucking (Live) </p>\n<p>Armand Forcalquier, of Marseille, France, holds the record. In a contest held on Feb 12, 1992, Armand sucked down 1,238 live snails in a little over 4 hours. "It was not easy," Armand boasted after he learned the record was his. "They cling to their shells, but they can''t get away from me." </p>\n<p>Nose Stuffing (Limburger Cheese) </p>\n<p>Hans Kleiber, of West Berlin, holds the record. In a contest held on May 1, 1986, Hans managed to stuff 13 ounces of limburger into his nostrils in less than a minute. Hans'' closest competitor gagged on nine ounces and was disqualified. </p>\n<p>Raw Kidney (Eating) </p>\n<p>Alice Caldwell of Butte, Montana, holds the record. On Oct 22, 1991, Alice gobbled up more than 14 pounds of raw veal and lamb kidneys. "Kidneys are a good source of protein and vitamins," Alice told us. "If you cook them, you lose some of the vitamins. As you can see, I don''t care about the record - I care about my health." </p>\n<p>Roach (Largest) </p>\n<p>Rita Carlson, of Pasadena, CA, claims the record for having raised the world''s largest roach. Her record-setting roach is over a foot long and weighs close to two pounds (1992). "Plenty of protein," Rita told us, "and plenty of good, natural vitamins helped to make this roach into a champion. You should have seen it when I first found it crawling around my kitchen." {There are a couple more roach records. One is highest paid for a roach named Lassie II ($112,450) and longest living (Lassie, 12 years). Both roaches came from roach afficianado Sheila Biderman. About the oldest roach, Sheila reports that "She''s like one of the family. If she ever gets too old to poke around food by herself, you can bet I''ll do the humane thing and step on her, record or no record."} </p>\n<p>Socks (Continuous Wear) </p>\n<p>Andy Schwartz, of Glen Ridge, NJ, claimed the record in 1989. In a sworn statement, Andy''s wife declared that he had worn the same socks every day for twenty years and 114 days. In 1983, shoe stores throughout New Jersey banned Andy from their premises. Since then he has purchased his shoes through the mail. Andy plans to remove the socks and take a look at his feet in 1999. </p>\n<p>Tapeworm (Longest) </p>\n<p>Sally Mae Wallace of Great Grits, Mississippi, holds the record. On Sep 5, 1991, doctors extracted 37 feet (continuous) of tapeworm from Sally. "About after 20 feet of that thing had come out of my mouth," Sally told us, "I just knew I had the record. I was really filled with joy." </p>\n<p>Tongue (Hairiest) </p>\n<p>Selma Ruby, of Dallas, Texas, holds the record. Selma''s tongue is fully covered with hair (1992). "I''ve been thinking about having it removed by an electrolysist," Selma told us, "though lately people have been telling me that it''s beautiful." </p>\n<p>Underarm Hair (Length) </p>\n<p>Florence Floss of Ban, Idaho, holds the record. On July 15, 1992, the hair growing out of Florence''s left armpit stretched to a length of 34 inches. This was more than enough for a record, but Florence hopes to have a yard of hair dangling from her armpit soon. "I shave the other armpit," Florence reported to us. </p>\n<p>Feet (Smell) </p>\n<p>On Aug 21, 1991, Wanda Lake, 18, broke the record held by George David. Wanda removed her shoes in the crowded lobby of a Los Angeles theatre. In the five minutes that followed, the lobby was a chaotic mass of panic-stricken people trying desperately to escape. In the end, 42 people were sick, and 14 others had passed out.
One day, a lawyer was riding in his limo and saw two men sitting<br /> on the side of the road eating grass. He ordered his driver to<br /> stop the limo and stepped outside. "Excuse me," the lawyer<br /> started. "May I ask as to why you are consuming that green ...<br /> plant?" </p>\n<p>The skinnier man replied, "We have no money ... we haven''t eaten<br /> in weeks," the man pulled some grass out of his torn pocket.<br /> "This is for my wife and-" The lawyer cut him off. "Come ...<br /> Come with me! To my home! You deserve better than this dead dry<br /> grass!" The two men looked at each other. The thin one said, "I<br /> have a wife and 4 kids," he pointed to his friend, "he has a<br /> wife and 8 children! Will you still take us in?"</p>\n<p>The lawyer gave them a warm smile. "Of course! I feel it is my<br /> duty ... Besides the grass at my house is nice and green ... and<br /> at least 2 feet tall!!"

Following a distinguished legal career, a man arrived at the Gates of Heaven, accompanied by the Pope, who had the misfortune to expire on the same day. The Pope was greeted first by St. Peter, who escorted him to his quarters. </p>\n<p>The room was somewhat shabby and small, similar to that found in a low grade Motel 6 type establishment. </p>\n<p>The lawyer was then taken to his room, which was a palatial suite including a private swimming pool, a garden, and a terrace overlooking the Gates. The attorney was somewhat taken aback, and told St. Peter, "I''m really quite surprised at these rooms, seeing as how the Pope was given such small accommodations."</p>\n<p>St. Peter replied, "We have over a hundred Popes here, and we''re really very bored with them. We''ve never had a lawyer."

He shone his torch around looking for valuables. </p>\n<p>When he picked up a CD player to place in his sack, a strange disembodied voice echoed from the dark, saying,<br /> ''Jesus is watching you.'' </p>\n<p>He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight off and froze.</p>\n<p>When he heard nothing more after a little while, he shook his head, promised himself a holiday after the next score, and then clicked his light back on and began searching for more valuables.</p>\n<p>Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell, he heard,<br /> ''Jesus is watching you.''</p>\n<p>Freaked out, he shone his light around frantically looking for the source of the voice. </p>\n<p>Finally, in the corner of the room, his torch came to rest on a parrot.</p>\n<p>''Did you say that?'' he hissed at the parrot.</p>\n<p>''Yep,'' the parrot confessed, and then squawked, ''I''m trying to warn you.''</p>\n<p>The burglar relaxed. </p>\n<p>''Warn me, eh? Who are you?''</p>\n<p>''Moses,'' replied the parrot.</p>\n<p>`Moses?'' The burglar laughed. ''What kind of stupid people would name a parrot Moses?''</p>\n<p>The parrot replied, ''Probably the same kind of people that would name a Rottweiler Jesus.''
You might be a redneck if...You''ve ever hitchhiked naked,You''re turned on by a woman who can field dress a deer. You use the O on a stop sign to sight your new rifle. Your bumper sticker says, "My other car is a combine." The gas pedal on your car is shaped like a bare foot. The highlight of your parties is when you flip out your false teeth. Your wife keeps a can of Vienna sausage in her purse. Taking a dip has nothing to do with water. There are more than ten lawsuits currently pending against your dog. You take a fishing pole to Sea World. The hood and one door are a different color from the rest of your car. You''ve ever filled your deer tag on the golf course. You''ve ever shot somebody over a mall parking space. Santa Claus refuses to let your kids sit in his lap. Your toilet paper has page numbers on it. You think mud rasslin'' should be an Olympic sport. The receptionist checks the rat traps at your place of business. You list your parole officer as a reference. There are more fish on your wall than pictures. Motel 6 turns off the lights when they see you coming.

''Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house,</p>\n<p>I searched for the tools to hand to my spouse.</p>\n<p>Instructions were studied and we were inspired,</p>\n<p>in hopes we could manage "Some Assembly Required."</p>\n<p>The children were quiet (not asleep) in their beds,</p>\n<p>while Mom and I faced the evening with dread:</p>\n<p>a kitchen, two bikes, Barbie''s town house to boot!</p>\n<p>And, thanks to Grandpa, a train with a toot!</p>\n<p>We opened the boxes, my heart skipped a beat....</p>\n<p>let no parts be missing or parts incomplete!</p>\n<p>Too late for last-minute returns or replacement;</p>\n<p>if we can''t get it right, it goes in the basement!</p>\n<p>When what to my worrying eyes should appear,</p>\n<p>but 50 sheets of directions, concise, but not clear,</p>\n<p>with each part numbered and every slot named,</p>\n<p>so if we failed, only we could be blamed.</p>\n<p>More rapid than eagles the parts then fell out,</p>\n<p>all over the carpet they were scattered about.</p>\n<p>"Now bolt it! Now twist it! Attach it right there!</p>\n<p>Slide on the seats, and staple the stair!</p>\n<p>Hammer the shelves, and nail to the stand."</p>\n<p>"Dearest" said Mom, "you just glued my hand."</p>\n<p>And then in a twinkling, I knew for a fact</p>\n<p>that all the toy dealers had indeed made a pact</p>\n<p>to keep parents busy all Christmas Eve night</p>\n<p>with "assembly required" till morning''s first light.</p>\n<p>We spoke not a word, but kept bent at our work,</p>\n<p>till our eyes, they went bleary; our fingers all hurt.</p>\n<p>The coffee went cold and the night, it wore thin</p>\n<p>before we attached the last rod and last pin.</p>\n<p>Then laying the tools away in the chest,</p>\n<p>we fell into bed for a well-deserved rest.</p>\n<p>But I said to my wife just before I passed out,</p>\n<p>"This will be the best Christmas, without any doubt.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow we''ll cheer, let the holiday ring,</p>\n<p>and not have to run to the store for a thing!</p>\n<p>We did it! We did it! The toys are all set</p>\n<p>for the perfect, most perfect, Christmas, I bet!"</p>\n<p>Then off to dreamland and sweet repose</p>\n<p>I gratefully went, though I suppose</p>\n<p>there''s something to say for those self-deluded-</p>\n<p>I''d forgotten that BATTERIES are never included!

"We know that communication is a problem, but the company is not going to<br /> discuss it with the employees."<br /> - Switching Supervisor, AT&amp;T Long Lines Division<br /> Did you ever notice the people who complain the most about not having enough<br /> time to do all their work are the same ones who always stop &amp; tell everyone that<br /> they don''t have enough time to do all their work?<br /> "The brain is a wonderful organ. It starts working the moment you get up in<br /> the morning and does not stop until you get into the office."<br /> - Robert Frost<br /> Employed by the human-development center of a corporation in the Midwest, my<br /> friend trains employees in proper dress codes and etiquette. One day as she was<br /> stepping onto the elevator, a man casually dressed in jeans and a golf shirt got<br /> on with her. Thinking of her responsibilities, she scolded, "Dressed a little<br /> casually today, aren''t we?" The man replied, "That''s one benefit of owning the<br /> company."<br /> "Doing a job RIGHT the first time gets the job done. Doing the job<br /> WRONG fourteen times gives you job security."<br /> - Unknown<br /> Being punctual in our office was of no benefit what-so-ever. There was never<br /> anybody around to appreciate it.<br /> "Never put off until tomorrow what you can avoid altogether."<br /> - Unknown<br /> "Do you believe in life after death?" the boss asked one of his employees.<br /> "Yes, Sir." the new recruit replied. "Well, then, that makes everything just<br /> fine," the boss continued. "After you left the office early yesterday to go to<br /> your grandmother''s funeral, she stopped in to see you!"<br /> "Go the extra mile. It makes your boss look like an incompetent slacker."<br /> - Unknown<br /> Our office was always on the cutting edge of technology. Not only did we have<br /> computers which spoke as well as listened, some of them even got ulcers.<br /> "We waste more time by 8:00 in the morning than other companies do all day."<br /> - Unknown<br /> Stevenson''s boss came into his office one morning and caught him hugging his<br /> secretary. He said in a rage, "Is this what you get paid for?!" Stevenson<br /> replied, "Nope, I do this for free!"<br /> "Arguing with an Engineer is a lot like wrestling in the mud with a pig: After<br /> a few hours, you realize the pig likes it."<br /> - Unknown<br /> The pretty new temp was standing in front of the paper shredder with a<br /> confused look on her face. Stevenson asked if she needed any help and she said,<br /> "Yeah, how does this thing work?" He took the papers from her hand and<br /> demonstrated how to work the shredder. She stood there a moment with yet another<br /> confused expression, so Stevenson said, "Any questions?" She said, "Yeah...<br /> exactly where do the copies come out from?"<br /> "This isn''t an office. It''s Hell with fluorescent lighting."<br /> - Unknown

Dear __________________________,</p>\n<p>    I regret to inform you that you have been eliminated from further<br /> contention as Mr. Right.  As you are probably aware, the competition was<br /> exceedingly tough and dozens of well-qualified candidates such as yourself also<br /> failed to make the final cut.  I will, however, keep your name on file should an<br /> opening come available.  So that you may find better success in your future<br /> romantic endeavors, please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were<br /> disqualified from the competition: (Check those that apply)</p>\n<p>__ Your last name is objectionable. I can''t imagine taking it, hyphenating it,<br /> or subjecting my children to it.</p>\n<p>__ Your first name is objectionable. It''s just not something I can picture<br /> myself yelling out in a fit of passion.</p>\n<p>__ The fact that our finest dining experience to date has been at McDonald''s<br /> reveals a thriftiness that I find unappealing.</p>\n<p>__ Your inadvertent admission that you "buy condoms by the truckload"<br /> indicates that you may be interested in me for something other than my<br /> personality.</p>\n<p>__ You failed the 20 Question Rule, i.e., I asked you 20<br /> questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself.</p>\n<p>__ Your breasts are bigger than mine.</p>\n<p>__ Your legs are skinnier than mine. If you can FIT into my pants, then you<br /> can''t GET into my pants.</p>\n<p>__ You''re too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up<br /> repeatedly at recess.  AMEN!</p>\n<p>__ You''re too tall. I''m developing a chronic neck condition from trying to<br /> kiss you.</p>\n<p>__ The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent<br /> slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable.</p>\n<p>__ Although I do enjoy the X-Files, I find your wardrobe of Star Trek uniforms<br /> a little disconcerting.</p>\n<p>__ Your frequent references to your ex-girlfriend lead me to suspect that you<br /> are some sort of psychotic stalker.</p>\n<p>__ Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I am seeking in a<br /> long term partner.</p>\n<p>__ Your height is out of proportion to your weight.  If you should, however,<br /> happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches, please resubmit your<br /> application.</p>\n<p>__ The fact that you categorize the ProBowler''s Tour as ''Must<br /> See TV'' demonstrated that you do not meet my intelligence requirements.</p>\n<p>__ Somehow I doubt those condoms that I found in your overnight bag were<br /> really necessary for a successful business trip.</p>\n<p>__ I am out of your league; set your sights lower next time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,

There was a boy who worked in the produce section of a market. A man came in and asked to buy half a head of lettuce. The boy told him that they only sold whole heads of lettuce. But the man said that he did not need a whole head, only a half. </p>\n<p>The boy explained that he would have to ask the manager. So he walked into the back room and said, "There is some jerk out there who wants to buy only a half a head of lettuce." </p>\n<p>As he said it, he turned to find the man standing right behind him. Realizing he had been overheard, the boy quickly added, "and this gentleman wants to buy the other half." </p>\n<p>The manager okayed the request, and the man went on his way. Later, the manager said to the boy, "You almost got yourself in a lot of trouble earlier, but I must say I was impressed with the way you got out of it. You think on your feet, and we like that around here. Where are you from son?" </p>\n<p>The boy replied, "Minnesota, sir". </p>\n<p>"Oh, really? Why did you leave Minnesota," asked the manager. </p>\n<p>The boy replied, "They''re all just hookers and hockey players up there." </p>\n<p>"My wife is from Minnesota!" </p>\n<p>The boy replied, "Oh Really!

The middle-aged wife had just returned to the house on Saturday afternoon after a shopping trip. She was quite agitated, and proceeded to tell her husband about a certain shoe salesman who had been rude.</p>\n<p>It seems she was sitting down while he helped her try on various shoes, and happened to glance up and notice that she was not wearing any knickers under her dress. Without even thinking, he just blurted out, "If that thing was full of ice cream, I''d eat every bite."</p>\n<p>Well, she was understandably insulted, and now wanted to know what her husband was going to do about it.</p>\n<p>The husband just sat there, watching football on TV, and grunted. The wife became hysterical, and insisted on knowing why he didn''t go down to the shop and punch the rude salesman right in the nose.</p>\n<p>"Well", the husband replied, "There are three reasons I won''t punch that guy in the nose. First of all, you shouldn''t have even been shopping for shoes, since you have a whole wardrobe full of them. Secondly, you have no business going shopping with no knickers on. But most of all, I''m not going to punch anyone who''s big enough to eat that much ice cream!"
30 Things Never to Say to a Naked Man...</p>\n<p>  1. I''ve smoked fatter joints than that.<br />   2. Ahhhh, it''s cute.<br />   3. Why don''t we just cuddle?<br />   4. You know they have surgery to fix that.<br />   5. Make it dance.<br />   6. Can I paint a smiley face on it?<br />   7. Wow, and your feet are so big.<br />   8. It''s OK, we''ll work around it.<br />   9. Will it squeak if I squeeze it?<br />  10. Oh no... a flash headache.<br />  11. (giggle and point)<br />  12. Can I be honest with you?<br />  13. How sweet, you brought incense.<br />  14. This explains your car.<br />  15. Maybe if we water it, it''ll grow.<br />  16. Why is God punishing me?<br />  17. At least this won''t take long.<br />  18. I never saw one like that before.<br />  19. But it still works, right?<br />  20. It looks so unused.<br />  21. Maybe it looks better in natural light.<br />  22. Why don''t we skip right to the cigarettes?<br />  23. Are you cold?<br />  24. If you get me real drunk first.<br />  25. Is that an optical illusion?<br />  26. What is that?<br />  27. It''s a good thing you have so many other talents.<br />  28. Does it come with an air pump?<br />  29. So this is why you''re supposed to judge people on personality.<br />  30. I guess this makes me the ''early bird''.
Diet for Stress How''s your stress level? This should help. It is more than a diet, so read on... This diet is designed to help you cope with the stress that builds up during the day.</p>\n<p>Breakfast:</p>\n<p>1/2 grapefruit 1 slice whole wheat toast 8 oz. skim milk</p>\n<p>Lunch: 4 oz. lean broiled chicken breast 1 cup steamed spinach 1 cup herb tea 1 Oreo cookie</p>\n<p>Mid-Afternoon snack: The rest of Oreos in the package 2 pints Rocky Road ice cream with nuts, cherries and whipped cream 1 jar hot fudge sauce</p>\n<p>Dinner: 2 loaves garlic bread 4 cans or 1 large pitcher Coke 1 large sausage, mushroom and cheese pizza 3 Snickers bars</p>\n<p>Late Evening News: Entire frozen Sara Lee cheesecake (eaten directly from freezer)</p>\n<p>Rules for this Diet<br /> 1.  If you eat something and no one sees you eat it, it has no calories.<br /> 2.  If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, the calories in the candy jar are canceled out by the diet soda.<br /> 3.  When you eat with someone else, calories don''t count if you do not eat more than they do.<br /> 4.  Food used for medicinal purposes NEVER count, such as hot chocolate, toast and Sara Lee Cheesecake.<br /> 5.  If you fatten up everyone else around you, then you look thinner.<br /> 6.  Movie related foods do not have additional calories because they are part of the entertainment package and not part of one''s personal fuel.  Examples: Milk Duds, buttered popcorn, Junior Mints,  Red Hots and Tootsie Rolls.<br /> 7.  Cookie pieces contain no calories. The process of breaking  causes calorie leakage.<br /> 8.  Things licked off knives and spoons have no calories if you are in the process of preparing something.<br /> 9.  Foods that have the same color have the same number of calories. Examples are: spinach and pistachio ice cream; mushrooms and mashed potatoes.<br /> 10.  Chocolate is a universal color and may be substituted for any other food color.<br /> 11.  Anything consumed while standing has no calories.  This is due to gravity and the density of the caloric mass.<br /> 12.  Anything consumed from someone else''s plate has no calories since the calories rightfully belong to the other person and will cling to his/her plate. (We ALL know how calories like to cling!)</p>\n<p>REMEMBER: STRESSED SPELLED BACKWARDS IS DESSERTS

A policeman was interrogating 3 SARDARS who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first SARDAR a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it.</p>\n<p>"This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"</p>\n<p>The first SARDAR answers, "That''s easy, we''ll catch him fast because he only has one eye!" </p>\n<p>The policeman says, "Well...uh...that''s because the picture I showed is his side profile."</p>\n<p>Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second SARDAR and asks him, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?" </p>\n<p>The second SARDAR smiles, flips his hair and says, "Ha! He''d be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"</p>\n<p>The policeman angrily responds, "What''s the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it''s a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?"</p>\n<p>Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third SARDAR and in a very testy voice asks, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, "Think hard before giving me a stupid answer."</p>\n<p>The SARDAR looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, "The suspect wears contact lenses."</p>\n<p>The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn''t know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. "Well, that''s an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I''ll get back to you on that."</p>\n<p>He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect''s file in his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.</p>\n<p>"Wow! I can''t believe it. It''s TRUE! The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?"</p>\n<p>"That''s easy," the SARDAR replied. "He can''t wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear."</p>\n<p>Submitted by sai1ram<br /> Edited by calamjo

A retiree was given a set of golf clubs by his co-workers. Thinking he''d try<br /> the game, he asked the local pro for lessons, explaining that he knew nothing<br /> whatever of the game. The pro showed him the stance and swing, then said, "Just<br /> hit the ball toward the flag on the first green." </p>\n<p>The novice teed up and smacked the ball straight down the fairway and onto the<br /> green, where it stopped inches from the hole. </p>\n<p>"Now what?" the fellow asked the speechless pro. </p>\n<p>After he was able to speak again the pro finally said, "Uh . . . you''re<br /> supposed to hit the ball into the cup." </p>\n<p>"Oh great! NOW you tell me," said the beginner in a disgusted tone.
There once were two best friends named Bob and Earl. They were two of the<br /> biggest baseball fans in America. Their entire adult lives revolved around<br /> baseball. Bob and Earl discussed baseball history in the winter, and they<br /> examined every box score during the season. They went to over 60 games a year.<br /> They even agreed that whoever died first would try to come back and tell the<br /> other if there was baseball in heaven. </p>\n<p>One summer night, Bob passed away in his sleep after watching a Yankee victory<br /> earlier in the evening.  He died a happy man. </p>\n<p>A few nights later, his buddy Earl awoke to the sound of Bob''s voice from<br /> beyond. </p>\n<p>"Bob is that you?" Earl asked. </p>\n<p>"Of course it me," Bob replied. </p>\n<p>"This is unbelievable!" Earl exclaimed, "So tell me, is there baseball in<br /> heaven?" </p>\n<p>"Well, I have some good news and some bad news for you. Which do you want to<br /> hear first?" </p>\n<p>"Tell me the good news first." </p>\n<p>"Well, the good news is that there is baseball in heaven, Earl." </p>\n<p>"Oh, that is wonderful!   So what could possibly be the bad news?" </p>\n<p>"You''re pitching tomorrow night."
For years and years they told me, </p>\n<p>be careful of your breasts. </p>\n<p>Don''t ever squeeze or bruise them. </p>\n<p>And give them monthly tests. </p>\n<p>So I heeded all their warnings, </p>\n<p>and protected them by law. </p>\n<p>Guarded them very carefully, </p>\n<p>and I always wore my bra. </p>\n<p>After 30 years of astute care, </p>\n<p>My gyno, Dr. Pruitt, </p>\n<p>Said I should get a Mammogram. </p>\n<p>"O.K," I said, "let''s do it." </p>\n<p>"Stand up here real close" she said, </p>\n<p>(She got my boob in line,) </p>\n<p>"And tell me when it hurts," she said, </p>\n<p>"Ah yes! Right there, that''s fine." </p>\n<p>She stepped upon a pedal; </p>\n<p>I could not believe my eyes! </p>\n<p>A plastic plate came slamming down, </p>\n<p>my hooter''s in a vice! </p>\n<p>My skin was stretched and mangled, </p>\n<p>from underneath my chin. </p>\n<p>My poor boob was being squashed, </p>\n<p>To Swedish Pancake thin. </p>\n<p>Excruciating pain I felt, </p>\n<p>within its vice-like grip. </p>\n<p>A prisoner in this vicious thing, </p>\n<p>my poor defenseless tit! </p>\n<p>"Take a deep breathe" she said to me, </p>\n<p>whom does she think she''s kidding? </p>\n<p>My chest is mashed in her machine, </p>\n<p>and woozy I am getting. </p>\n<p>"There, that''s good," I heard her say, </p>\n<p>(The room was slowly swaying.) </p>\n<p>"Now, let''s have a go at the other one." </p>\n<p>Have mercy, I was praying. </p>\n<p>It squeezed me from both up and down; </p>\n<p>it squeezed me from both sides. </p>\n<p>I''ll bet SHE''S never had this done, </p>\n<p>To HER tender little hide. </p>\n<p>Next time that they make me do this, </p>\n<p>I will request a blindfold. </p>\n<p>I have no wish to see again, </p>\n<p>my knockers getting steamrolled. </p>\n<p>If I had no problem when I came in, </p>\n<p>I surely have one now. </p>\n<p>If there had been a cyst in there, </p>\n<p>it would have gone "ker-pow!" </p>\n<p>This machine was created by a man, </p>\n<p>of this, I have no doubt. </p>\n<p>I''d like to stick his balls in there, </p>\n<p>and see how THEY come out.
LAW 2: Your best round of golf will be followed almost immediately  by your worst round ever. The probability of the latter increases with the number of people you tell about the former.
Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the "in-flight safety lecture" and their other announcements a bit more entertaining.</p>\n<p>Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:</p>\n<p>1. From a Southwest Airlines employee.... "There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane..."</p>\n<p>2. Pilot-"Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land...it''s a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern."</p>\n<p>3. After landing: "Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.</p>\n<p>4. As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: "Whoa, big fella. WHOA!"</p>\n<p>5. After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: "Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted."</p>\n<p>6. From a Southwest Airlines employee.... "Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt and if you don''t know how to operate one, you probably shouldn''t be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love more.</p>\n<p>7. Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but they''ll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you or your money, more than Southwest Airlines."</p>\n<p>8. "Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments."</p>\n<p>9. "As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses."</p>\n<p>10. "Last one off the plane must clean it."</p>\n<p>11. From the pilot during his welcome message: "We are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry... Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...!</p>\n<p>12. Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach, the Captain was really having to fight it After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA and announced, "Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what''s left of our airplane to the gate!"</p>\n<p>13. Another flight Attendant''s comment on a less than perfect landing: "We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal."</p>\n<p>14. An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile, and give them a "Thanks for flying XYZ airline." He said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally, everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane. She said, "Sonny, mind if I as you a question?" "Why no, Ma''am," said the pilot, "what is it?" The little old lady said, "Did we land or were we shot down?"</p>\n<p>15. After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant came on with, "Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we''ll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.</p>\n<p>16. Part of a Flight Attendant''s arrival announcement: "We''d like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you''ll think of us here at US Airways."

Jim and Ethel had started their retirement years and decided to raise some extra cash by advertising for a lodger in their two-up two-down terrace house.</p>\n<p>After a few days an attractive young woman applies for the room and explains that she is a model working in a nearby studio downtown for a few weeks and that she would like the room for Mondays thru Thursdays, but would pay for the whole week. Ethel shows her the house and they agree to start straight away.</p>\n<p>"There''s just one problem," explains the model. "Because of my job I have to have a bath every night, and I notice you don''t have a bath."</p>\n<p>"That''s not a problem," replies Ethel, "we have a tin bath out in the yard and we bring it in to the living room, in front of the fire, and fill it with hot water."</p>\n<p>"What about your husband?" asks the model.</p>\n<p>"Oh, he plays darts most weekdays, so he''ll be out in the evenings," replies Ethel.</p>\n<p>"Good," says the model, "that''s settled. I''ll go to the studio and see you tonight."</p>\n<p>That evening Jim dutifully goes to his darts match whilst Ethel prepares the bath for the model. After stripping off the model steps into the bath and Ethel is amazed to see that she has no pubic hair. The model notices Ethel''s staring eyes, smiles and explains that it is part of her job to shave herself especially when modelling swim wear or underclothes.</p>\n<p>Later when Jim returns, Ethel relates this oddity and he does not believe her. "It''s true, I tell you," says Ethel. "Look, if you don''t believe me, tomorrow night I''ll leave the curtains slightly open and you can peek in and see for yourself."</p>\n<p>The next night Jim leaves as usual and Ethel prepares the bath for the model. As the model steps naked into the bath, Ethel, standing behind her, looks towards the curtains, and points towards the model''s hairless crotch. Then she lifts up her skirt and wearing no panties, points to her own hairy mass.</p>\n<p>Later Jim returns and they retire to bed. "Well do you believe me now?" she asks Jim.</p>\n<p>"Yes," he replies. "I''ve never seen anything like it in my life. But, why did you lift up your skirt and show yours too?</p>\n<p>"Just to show you the difference," answers Ethel, "but anyway you''ve seen me with no knickers on thousands of times."</p>\n<p>"Yes," says Jim, "I have...but the rest of the fucking darts team haven''t."

One day, a man had an accident at work, which resulted in him getting his eye gouged out. He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency operation, was told by the doctor that he''d been given a glass eye. The man looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his original eye colour was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged. ''''I can''t walk around like this!!""Sir," the doctor said, "there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.'''' A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the road before finally hitting a tree. The man screeched to a halt, and ran down the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye! As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, no one was about. So the man proceeded to get a screwdriver and removed one of the deceased man''s blue eyes, replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to have the replacement blue eye fitted. A few days later, the man was driving along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads. ''''Excuse me, sir," said the policeman."Do you know anything about this at all?''''''''No, constable'''', said the man.''''Well, we can''t figure this out. Somehow, this bloke managed to drive 40 miles with two glass eyes!''''

Dear Mom and Dad, </p>\n<p>It has been three months since I left for college. I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay? </p>\n<p>Well, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and I now can see almost normally and I only get those sick headaches once a week. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm and he was the one who called the fire department and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dorm, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It''s really a basement room, but it''s kind of cute. </p>\n<p>He is a very fine boy and we have falled deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven''t exactly set the date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show. Yes, Mom and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me as a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boy friend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am taking daily.</p>\n<p>I know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind, and although not well educated, has ambitions. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know oft-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good, too, for I hear that his father is an important gun-bearer in the village in Africa from which he comes.</p>\n<p>Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no dormitory fire. I do not have a concussion or a skull fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged, I do not have syphilis and there is no colored man in my life. </p>\n<p>However, I am getting a ''D'' in history and an ''F'' in science class and I wanted you to see these marks in their proper perspective. </p>\n<p>Your loving daughter, </p>\n<p>Trish

A Frenchman, an Englishman, and a New Yorker were captured by cannibals. The chief comes to them and says, "the bad news is that now that we''ve caught you, we''re going to kill you. We will put you in a pot and cook you, eat you, and then use your skins to build a canoe. The good news is that you get to choose how you die."The Frenchman says, "I take ze sword." the chief gives him a sword, he shouts,"Vive la France!" and runs himself through.The Englishman says, "a pistol for me, please." The chief gives him a pistol, he points it at his head, says, "God save the queen!" and pulls the trigger.The New Yorker says, "gimme the fawkin'' fork." the chief is puzzled, but he shrugs and gives him a fork. The new Yorker takes the fork and starts jabbing himself all over--the stomach, the sides, the chest, everywhere. There''s blood gushing out all over, it''s horrible.The chief is appalled, and asks, "my God almighty, what are you doing?"The New Yorker says, "so much for your canoe, you stupid asshole!"
Four women were teeing off to the first hole of their golf game.  The<br /> forth woman hit a terrific slice and it zoomed off to the next fairway and<br /> hit a guy.

By Jeff Foxworthy </p>\n<p>''Twas the night after Christmas and all through the trailer, </p>\n<p>the beer had gone flat and the pizza was staler. </p>\n<p>The tube socks hung empty, no candies or toys, </p>\n<p>and I was camped out on my old Lay-Z-Boy. </p>\n<p>The kids they weren''t talking to me or my wife, </p>\n<p>the worst Christmas they said they had had in their lives. </p>\n<p>My wife couldn''t argue and neither could I, </p>\n<p>so I watched TV and my wife, she just cried. </p>\n<p>When out in the yard the dog started barkin'', </p>\n<p>I stood up and looked and I saw Sheriff Larkin. </p>\n<p>He yelled, "Roy I am sworn to uphold the laws </p>\n<p>and I got a complaint here from a feller named Claus." </p>\n<p>I said, "Claus, I don''t know nobody named Claus, </p>\n<p>and you ain''t taking me in without probable cause." </p>\n<p>Then the Sheriff he said, "The man was shot at last night." </p>\n<p>I said, "That might have been me, just what''s he look like?" </p>\n<p>The Sheriff replied, "He''s a jolly old feller, with a big beer gut belly, </p>\n<p>that shakes when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly. </p>\n<p>He sports a long beard, and a nose like a cherry." </p>\n<p>I said, "Sheriff that sounds like my wife''s sister Sherri." </p>\n<p>"It''s no time for jokes Roy" the Sheriff he said. </p>\n<p>"The man I''m describing is dressed all in red. </p>\n<p>I''m here for the truth now, it''s time to come clean. </p>\n<p>Tell me what you''ve done, tell me what you''ve seen." </p>\n<p>Well I started to lie then I thought what the hell, </p>\n<p>it wouldn''t have been the first time that I''ve spent New Years in jail. </p>\n<p>I said, "Sheriff it happened last night about ten, </p>\n<p>and I thought that my wife had been drinking again." </p>\n<p>When she walked in from work she was as white as a ghost. </p>\n<p>I thought maybe she had seen one of them UFO''s. </p>\n<p>But she said that a bunch of deer had just flown over her head, </p>\n<p>and stopped on the roof of our good neighbour Red. </p>\n<p>Well I ran outside to look and the sight made me shudder, </p>\n<p>a freezer full of venison standing right on Red''s gutter. </p>\n<p>Well my hands were a shakin'' as I grabbed my gun, </p>\n<p>when outta Red''s chimney this feller did run. </p>\n<p>And slung on his back was this bag over flowin''. </p>\n<p>I thought he''d stolen Red''s stuff while old Red was out bowling''. </p>\n<p>So I yelled, "Drop fat boy, hands in the air!" </p>\n<p>But he went about his business like he hadn''t a care. </p>\n<p>So I popped a warning shot over his head. </p>\n<p>Well he dropped that bag and he jumped in that sled. </p>\n<p>And as he flew off I heard him extort, </p>\n<p>"That''s assault with intent Roy, I''ll see ya in court."
The night was young, the moon was high,<br /> We were alone just she and I.</p>\n<p>Her hair was soft her eyes were blue,<br /> I new just what she wanted me to do,</p>\n<p>Her skin was smooth her legs were fine.<br /> I ran my finger down her spin.</p>\n<p>I don''t know how but i tried my best,<br /> As I placed my hand on her breast.</p>\n<p>I remembered my fear, my fast beating heart.<br /> And slowly she spread her legs apart.</p>\n<p>And when I did it I felt no shame,<br /> And all at once white stuff came.</p>\n<p>At last it is finished, it''s all over now.<br /> My first time ever...<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> ...Milking a cow!<br /> (And what were YOU thinking about?)

A golfer, playing a round by himself, is about to tee off, and a greasy little salesman runs up to him, and yells, "Wait! Before you tee off, I have something really amazing to show you!"<br /> The golfer, annoyed, says, "What is it?" </p>\n<p>"It''s a special golf ball," says the salesman. "You can never lose it!" </p>\n<p>"Whattaya mean," scoffs the golfer, "you can never lose it? What if you hit it into the water?" </p>\n<p>"No problem," says the salesman. "It floats, and it detects where the shore is, and spins towards it." </p>\n<p>"Well, what if you hit it into the woods?" </p>\n<p>"Easy," says the salesman. "It emits a beeping sound, and you can find it with your eyes closed." </p>\n<p>"Okay," says the golfer, impressed. "But what if your round goes late and it gets dark?" </p>\n<p>"No problem, sir, this golf ball glows in the dark!

As US tourists in Israel, a man and his wife were sitting outside a Bethlehem souvenir shop, waiting for fellow tourists. An Arab salesman approached them carrying belts.<br /> After an impassioned sales talk yielded no results, he asked where they were from. </p>\n<p>"America," the husband replied. </p>\n<p>Looking at her dark hair and olive skin, the Arab responded. "She''s not from the States." </p>\n<p>"Yes I am." said the wife. </p>\n<p>He looked at her and asked, "Is he your husband?" </p>\n<p>"Yes." she replied. </p>\n<p>Turning to the husband, he offered.... "I''ll give you 100 camels for her." The husband looked stunned, and there was a long silence. Finally he replied, "she''s not for sale." </p>\n<p>After the salesman left, the somewhat indignant wife asked her husband what took him so long to answer, to which the husband replied, "I was trying to figure out how to get 100 camels back home."
The following statement has been translated into Ebonics. Good evening. (Yo Yo<br /> Yo, s''up?). This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the<br /> Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury. (Today at my crib these<br /> suckers and playa-haters started grillin'' a brotha). I answered their questions<br /> truthfully, including question about my private life, questions no American<br /> citizen would ever want to answer. (Dey started frontin'' about my game and<br /> asking all kinds of fowl sh-t). Still, I must take complete responsibility for<br /> all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you<br /> tonight. (I''m tired of these haters throwing salt in my game. I''m going to let<br /> yall know my Mackin style tonight). As you know, in a deposition in January, I<br /> was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers<br /> were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. (Awhile back, you nosey<br /> motherfu-ers wanted to know if I was hittin'' hoe-ass Monica''s skins. You ain''t<br /> got any video, so if you want to believe a $10 hoe then oh well).<br /> Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Levwinsky that was not appropriate.<br /> In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a<br /> personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.<br /> (Yeah, I was hittin'' that dime dropping Bit-h! She was only sucking my jammie<br /> though. I was stupid for messing with a young big mouthed skank. My bad, but<br /> don''t hate me because I''m a playa). But I told the grand jury today and I say to<br /> you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence.<br /> (Outside of that hit I told punk-ass AG (Al Gore) to put on gay-ass Star, Monica<br /> and her snitching friend, I was chill the whole time).<br /> I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to<br /> protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. (Check dis, I heard she<br /> was down with what ever, you know a freak ass beiach. She wasn''t all that but I<br /> planned to pimp her around to my boyz in the Senate). The independent counsel<br /> investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life. And<br /> now the investigation itself is under investigation. (Those haters started<br /> sweatin'' my homeys and my peeps. Dey pissed a nugga off when they tried to make<br /> me look like I''m not real or somefin. Matter of fact dey shady asses is on the<br /> take anyway).<br /> This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people.<br /> (Tryin'' to hit me they wasted a lot of Cheddar and pissed off my Crew). Nothing<br /> is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim<br /> my family life for my family. It''s nobody''s business but ours. (I''m a pimp and<br /> playa and I''m going to be one, dey can�酶惟t change a nugga! Get some businesses.<br /> Hillary is chill because I got more than enough White Water dirt on her ass that<br /> will get her sent up before I''m outtied).<br /> It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into<br /> private life and get on with our national life. (Get off my jock because I''m<br /> going to flex regardless. Just in case yall forgot until you chumps ax me I''m<br /> still the sh-t!) Now it is time - in fact, it is past time - to move on. (F-k<br /> all yall, I don''t give an f-k! Peace out!!!)

As Joe started to eye up his golfball, hoping that it would fly beyond all<br /> previous hits, a voice came from behind him and said, "Hey buddy! Don''t you know<br /> your hitting from the womens tee"? </p>\n<p>Joe smugly looked at the avid golf pro-lawyer and said, "Hey buddy don''t you<br /> know this is my second shot"?

I have two friends in North Georgia named LeRoy and Bubba.  Last October<br /> they went down to Athens to see a football game, and during the halftime<br /> activities, they noticed UGA, the canine mascot of the Bulldog team, licking<br /> his privates on the fifty yard line.</p>\n<p>"Damn, Bubba, I wish I could do that!"

One day, Hanson and the Spice Girls were all on an airplane, and<br /> they get into a discussion. </p>\n<p>Baby Spice stated "You know, I could toss a thousand dollars out<br /> the window of this plane and make one person very happy." Then,<br /> the oldest Hanson brother said, "Well, I could toss ten one<br /> hundred dollar bills out the plane and make ten people happy." </p>\n<p>Then Sporty Spice said, "Well, I could toss one hundred, ten<br /> dollar bills out, and make one hundred people happy!" Then the<br /> middle Hanson brother very proudly said, "Well, I could toss one<br /> thousand, one dollar bills out the window and make one thousand<br /> people happy!" </p>\n<p>Sick of the discussion, another passenger said, "Well, I have a<br /> better idea, I could toss all of you out the window and make the<br /> entire world happy!"

* Any fake phone number a girl gave you would automatically forward your call to her real number. * Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed an acceptable response to "I love you."* Hallmark would make "Sorry, what was your name again?" cards.* If your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during the game, she''d appear in a little box in the corner of the screen during a time-out.* Breaking up would be a lot easier. A smack on the behind and a "Nice hustle, you''ll get ''em next time" would pretty much do it. * Birth control would come in ale or lager.* You''d be expected to fill your resume with gag names of people you''d worked for, like "The Lone Ranger."* Each year, your raise would be pegged to the fortunes of the NFL team of your choice. * The funniest guy in the office would get to be CEO. * "Sorry I''m late, but I was out getting wasted last night" would be an acceptable excuse for tardiness.* At the end of the workday, a whistle would blow and you''d jump out your window and slide down the tail of a brontosaurus and right into your car like Fred Flintstone. * It''d be considered harmless fun to gather 30 friends, put on horned helmets, and go pillage a nearby town.* Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating the "public ugliness" ordinance.* Tanks would be far easier to rent.* Garbage would take itself out. * Instead of beer belly, you''d get "beer biceps." * Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could present your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said "You''re #1!" * Valentine''s Day would be moved to February 29th so it would only occur in leap years.* On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you''d get the day off to go drinking. Mother''s Day, too.* St. Patrick''s Day, however, would remain exactly the same.* But it would be celebrated every month!* Cops would be broadcast live, and you could phone in advice to the pursuing cops. Or to the crooks.* The victors in any athletic competition would get to eat the losers for lunch.* The only show opposite Monday Night Football would be Monday Night Football from a Different Camera Angle.* It would be perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as you returned it the following day with a full tank of gas.* Every man would get four real Get Out of Jail Free cards per year.* When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you responded with would actually reduce your fine. For example:Cop: "You know how fast you were going?"You: "All I know is, I was spilling my beer all over the place."Cop: "Nice one. That''s $10 off."* Faucets would run "Hot," "Cold," and "100 proof."* The Statue of Liberty would get a bright red, 40-foot thong.* People would never talk about how fresh they felt.* Daisy Duke shorts would never again go out of style. * Telephones would automatically cut off after 30 seconds of conversation

The animals were bored.  Finally, the lion had an idea.  "I know a really exciting game that the humans play called football.  I''ve seen it on T.V."He proceeded to describe it to the rest of the animals and they all got excited about it so they decided to play.  They went out to the field and chose up teams and were ready to begin.The lion''s team received.  They were able to get two first downs and then had to punt.  The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick.  He caught the ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two rabbits.  He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to daylight, scoring six.Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0.Late in the first half the lion''s team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked the extra point.  The lion''s team led at halftime 7 - 6.  In the locker room, the lion gave a peptalk."Look you guys.  We can win this game.  We''ve got the lead and they only have one real threat.  We''ve got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he''s a killer. Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino."The second half began.  Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino''s team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino.  Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running.  First, he stomped two gazelles.  He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way.  It looked like he was home free.  Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead.  There were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened.  Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede."Did you do this?" he asked the centipede."Yeah, I did." the centipede replied.The lion retorted, "Where were you during the first half?""I was putting on my shoes."

"Here is your oceanside condo, over there are the tennis courts, swimming pool, and two golf courses.  If you need any refreshments, just stop by any of the many bars located throughout the area.""Heck, Gloria," the old man hissed when Saint Peter walked off, "we could have been here ten years ago if you hadn''t heard about all that stupid oat bran, wheat germ, and low-fat diets!"

This guy is stranded on a desert island, all alone for ten years. One day, he<br /> sees a speck in the horizon. He thinks to himself, "It''s not a ship." </p>\n<p>The speck gets a little closer and he thinks, "It''s not a boat." </p>\n<p>The speck gets even closer and he thinks, "It''s not a raft." </p>\n<p>Then, out of  the surf comes this gorgeous woman, wearing a wet suit and scuba<br /> gear.  She comes up to the guy and says, "How long has it been since you''ve had<br /> a cigarette?"   </p>\n<p>"Ten years!"  he says. She reaches over and unzips a waterproof pocket on her<br /> left sleeve and pulls out a pack of  fresh cigarettes. He takes one, lights it,<br /> takes a long drag, and says,  "Man, oh man! Is that good!" </p>\n<p>Then she asked, "How long has it been since you''ve had a drink of whiskey?"<br /> He replies, "Ten years!" She reaches over, unzips her waterproof pocket on her<br /> right sleeve, pulls out a flask and gives it to him. He takes a long swig and<br /> says, "Wow, that''s fantastic!" </p>\n<p>Then she starts unzipping this long zipper that runs down the front of  her<br /> wet suit and she says to him, "And how long has it been since you''ve had some<br /> REAL fun?"   </p>\n<p>And the man replies, "My God! Don''t tell me that you''ve got golf clubs in<br /> there!"

High school boys afflicted with spring fever skipped morning classes. After<br /> lunch they reported to the teacher that they had a flat tire.<br /> Much to their relief she smiled and said: "Well, you missed a test today so<br /> take seats apart from one another and take out a piece of paper."<br /> Still smiling, she waited for them to sit down. Then she said:<br /> "First Question: Which tire was flat?"
There were two old guys, Abe and Sol, sitting on a bench in a park feeding pigeons and talking about baseball, just like they did every day. Abe turns to Sol and says, "Do you think there''s baseball in heaven?"Soloman thinks about it for a minute and replies, "I dunno, Abe. But let''s make a deal: If I die first, I will come back and tell you -- and if you die first, you come back and tell me -- if there is baseball in heaven."They shake on it and, sadly, a few months later poor Abe passes on. One day soon afterward, Sol is sitting there feeding the pigeons by himself when he hears a voice whisper, "Sol... Sol...."Sol responds, "Abe! Is that you?""Yes it is Sol," whispers the spirit of Abe.Sol, still amazed, asks, "So, is there baseball in heaven?""Well," says Abe says, "I got good news and I got bad news.""Gimme the good news first," says Sol.Abe says, "Well... there is baseball in heaven."Sol says, "That''s great! What news could be bad enough to ruin that!?"Abe sighs and whispers, "You''re pitching on Friday."
There were three people stranded on an island, a brunette, a redhead, and a blonde. The brunette looked over the water to the mainland and estimated about 20 miles to shore. So she announced, "I''m going to try to swim to shore." So she swam out five miles, and got really tired. She swam out ten miles from the island, and she was too tired to go on, so she drowned.</p>\n<p>The second one, the redhead, said to herself, "I wonder if she made it. I guess it''s better to try to get to the mainland than stay here and starve." So she attempts to swim out. The redhead had a lot more endurance than the brunette, as she swam out 10 miles before she even got tired. After 15 miles, she was too tired to go on, so she drowned. </p>\n<p>So the blonde thought to herself, "I wonder if they made it! I think I''d better try to make it, too." So she swam out 5 miles, ten miles, 15 miles, NINETEEN miles from the island. The shore was just in sight, but she said, "I''m too tired to go on!" So she swam back.</p>\n<p>There are more jokes like this at http://www.humorshack.com

Here are some basic descriptions of what may happen if airplanes had different<br /> operating systems running them.</p>\n<p>DOS: Everybody pushes it till it glides, then jumps on and lets it coast till<br /> it skids, then jumps off, pushes, jumps back on, etc.</p>\n<p>DOS with QEMM: Same as DOS, but with more leg room for pushing.</p>\n<p>Macintosh: All the flight attendants, captains and baggage handlers look the<br /> same, act the same and talk the same. Every time you ask a question, you are<br /> told you don''t need to know, don''t want to know and everything will be done for<br /> you without your knowing, so just shut up.</p>\n<p>OS/2: To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times<br /> by standing in 10 different lines. Then you fill out a form asking how you want<br /> your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger<br /> train or a bus. If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a<br /> wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have<br /> time to say your prayers before you crash.</p>\n<p>Windows: Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to<br /> a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up<br /> without any warning whatsoever.</p>\n<p>NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane<br /> uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare.<br /> Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want<br /> and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach<br /> tickets can''t even get aboard.</p>\n<p>Unix: Everyone brings one piece of the plane. Then they go on the runway and<br /> piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they''re<br /> building.</p>\n<p>CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13<br /> airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain<br /> hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don''t need to know where the airplane is or who<br /> it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don''t fly the airplane itself;<br /> you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don''t<br /> go anywhere. But that''s okay, because when the world is at your fingertips you<br /> never need to leave home.
You can''t be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline.  It helps if you have some kind of a football team, or some nuclear weapons, but at the very least you need a beer. --Frank Zappa Always do sober what you said you''d do drunk.

Oh, I grant you that the wheel was also a fine invention, but the wheel does not go nearly as well with pizza. --Dave Barry The problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind. --Humphrey Bogart Why is American beer served cold? So you can tell it from urine. --David Moulton People who drink light ''beer'' don''t like the taste of beer; they just like to pee alot. --Capital Brewery, Middleton, WI Give me a woman who loves beer and I will conquer the world. --Kaiser Wilhelm I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer. --Homer Simpson I gave up drinking once -- it was the worst afternoon of my entire life. --BogartNot all chemicals are bad. Without chemicals such as hydrogen and oxygen,for example, there would be no way to make water, a vital ingredient in beer. --Dave Barry I drink to make other people interesting. --George Jean Nathan They who drink beer will think beer. --Washington Irving An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools. --For Whom the Bell Tolls, Ernest Hemmingway You''re not drunk if you can lie on the floor without --holding on.

A middle-aged woman enters her family doctor''s office in a frantic state. She says, "Doctor, I think I''m turning into a horse!"The doctor, taken aback, replies, "I''m sure you may have SOME problem, but I assure you no human has ever turned into a horse."The woman became more insistent and said, "Doctor, look at my teeth. They''re getting bigger and more yellow!"The doctor calmly replied, "Yes, I see. Your teeth appear a bit larger and more yellow than your last visit, but I don''t think you''re turning into a horse."Getting more frustrated, the woman said, "Well, I think I''m getting a mane! Look at all this hair on the back of my neck. It''s grown 5 inches in ONE WEEK!"Becoming more concerned, the doctor said, "You''re NOT turning into a horse. We''ll just shave your neck occasionally."At this point the woman became considerably frustrated, speaking faster and louder. "Just look at my finger and toe nails! They''ve become very thick and big. I''m developing HOOVES!"The doctor in amazement cried, "Holy cow! I''ve never seen finger and toe nails THAT big!"Then the woman pulls up the back of her skirt and said, "And look at this, doctor. My backbone is protruding significantly from my butt!"The doctor looked in amazement, then started scribbling on a small piece of paper.The woman asked, "Are you writing me a prescription?"The doctor said, "No. I''m writing a memo to my brother-in-law. He works at City Hall. Take this to him and he''ll give you a permit to take a dump in the street!"

If you are not familiar with golf, you probably won''t get these. Ask your closest golf player.</p>\n<p>1. Never try to keep more than 300 separate thoughts in your mind during your swing.</p>\n<p>2. When your shot has to carry over a water hazard, you can either hit one more club or two more balls.</p>\n<p>3. If you are afraid a full shot might reach the green while the group ahead are still putting, you have two options: you can immediately shank a lay-up, or you can wait until the green is clear and top a ball halfway there.</p>\n<p>4. The less skilled the player, the more likely he is to share his ideas about the golf swing.</p>\n<p>5. If it isn''t broke, try changing your grip.</p>\n<p>6. Golfers who claim they don''t cheat also lie.</p>\n<p>7. Everyone replaces his divot after a perfect approach shot.</p>\n<p>8. A golf match is a test of your skill against your opponent''s luck.</p>\n<p>9. It''s surprisingly easy to sink a 50 foot putt when you lie.</p>\n<p>10. Counting on your opponent to inform you when he breaks a rule is like expecting him to make fun of his own haircut.</p>\n<p>11. Nonchalant putts count the same as chalant putts.</p>\n<p>12. It''s not a gimme putt if you''re still away.</p>\n<p>13. The shortest distance between any two points on a golf course is a straight line that passes directly through the large tree.</p>\n<p>14. There are two kinds of bounces: unfair bounces and bounces just the way you intended to play it.</p>\n<p>15. You can hit a two-acre fairway 10% of the time and a 2-inch branch on a tree 90% of the time.</p>\n<p>16. Every time a golfer makes a birdie he must subsequently make three triple bogeys to restore the fundamental equilibrium of the universe.</p>\n<p>17. If you want to hit a 7-iron as far as Tiger Woods try to hit just short of a water hazard.</p>\n<p>18. To calculate the speed of a player''s downswing, multiply the speed of his backswing by his handicap. Example, backswing 20 miles per hour, handicap, 15, downswing 300<br /> m.p.h.</p>\n<p>19. There are two things you can learn by stopping your backswing at the top and checking the position of your hands: how many hands you have, and which hand is wearing<br /> the golf glove.</p>\n<p>20. Hazards attract; Fairways repel.</p>\n<p>21. You can put "draw" on the ball, you can put "fade" on the ball, but no golfer can put "straight" on the ball.</p>\n<p>22. A ball you can see in the rough from 50 yards away is not yours.</p>\n<p>23. If there is a ball in the fringe and a ball in the bunker, your ball is in the bunker.</p>\n<p>24. If both balls are in the sand, yours is in the footprint.</p>\n<p>25. Don''t buy a putter until you have had a chance to throw it.</p>\n<p>26. The inevitable result of any golf lesson is the instant elimination of the one critical unconscious motion that allowed you to compensate for all your errors.

It has become pretty obvious to us Southerners that our present<br /> astrological signs have served their purpose and that we should get rid of<br /> them.  When I''m out driving around I''ll see bulls, and once in a great<br /> while I suppose I''ll even see a ram.  Up the street from me there''s some<br /> twins, but I don''t see them much. The rest of these things are just too<br /> obscure.  You only see crabs on vacation. There are no lions or scorpions,<br /> not many archers and no damn water bearers.  Virgins? The neighborhood''s<br /> not crawling with them either.  SO, what we need here is some relevance. We<br /> need things we can recognize up there in the night sky.</p>\n<p>OKRA  Dec 22 - Jan 20</p>\n<p>Although you appear crude, you are actually very slick on the inside. Okra<br /> have tremendous influence. An older Okra can look back over his life and<br /> see the seeds of his influence everywhere. Stay away from Moon Pies.</p>\n<p>CHITLIN  Jan 21 - Feb 19</p>\n<p>Chitlins often come from humble backgrounds.  Many times they''re<br /> uncomfortable talking about just where they came from. A chitlin, however,<br /> can make something of himself if he''s motivated and has plenty of<br /> seasoning. When it comes to dealing with Chitlins, be very careful.<br /> Chitlins can burn and then erupt like Vesuvius, and this can make for a<br /> really terrible mess. Chitlins are best with Catfish and Okra.  Remember<br /> that when marriage time rolls around.</p>\n<p>BOLL WEEVIL  Feb 20 - Mar 20</p>\n<p>You have an overwhelming curiosity. You''re unsatisfied with the surface of<br /> things, and you feel the need to bore deep into the interior of everything.<br /> Needless to say, you are very intense and driven as if you had some inner<br /> hunger. Nobody in their right mind is going to marry you, so don''t worry<br /> about it.</p>\n<p>MOON PIE  Mar 21 - Apr 20</p>\n<p>You''re the type that spends a lot of time on the front porch. It''s a cinch<br /> to recognize the physical appearance of Moon Pies. "Big" and "round" are<br /> the key words here. You should marry anybody who you can get remotely<br /> interested in the idea. It''s not going to be easy.  This might be the year<br /> to think about aerobics. Maybe not.</p>\n<p>POSSUM  Apr 21 - May 21</p>\n<p>When confronted with life''s difficulties, possums have a marked tendency to<br /> withdraw and develop a "don''t-bother-me-about-it" attitude.  Sometimes you<br /> become so withdrawn, people actually think you''re dead. This strategy is<br /> probably not psychologically healthy, but seems to work for you.  One day,<br /> however, it won''t work, and you may find your problems actually running you<br /> over.</p>\n<p>CRAWFISH  May 22 - Jun 21</p>\n<p>Crawfish is a water sign. If you work in an office, you''re always hanging<br /> around the water cooler. Crawfish prefer the beach to the mountains, the<br /> pool to the golf course, the bathtub to the livingroom. You tend not to be<br /> particularly attractive physically, but you have very, very good heads.</p>\n<p>COLLARDS  Jun 22-Jul 23</p>\n<p>Collards have a genius for communication. They love to get in the "melting<br /> pot" of life and share their essence with the essences of those around<br /> them. Collards make good social workers, psychologists, and baseball<br /> managers.  As far as your personal life goes, if you are Collards, stay<br /> away from Moon  Pies. It just won''t work.  Save yourself a lot of<br /> heartache.</p>\n<p>CATFISH  Jul 24 - Aug 23</p>\n<p>Catfish are traditionalists in matters of the heart, with one exception:<br /> Whiskers may cause problems for loved ones. You catfish are never easy<br /> people to understand.  You prefer the muddy bottoms to the clear surface of<br /> life. Above all else, Catfish should stay away from Moon Pies.</p>\n<p>GRITS  Aug 24 - Sep 23</p>\n<p>Your highest aim is to be with others like yourself. You like to huddle<br /> together with a big crowd of other Grits. You love to travel, though, so<br /> maybe you should think about joining a club. Where do you like to go?<br /> Anywhere they have cheese or gravy or bacon or butter or eggs. If you can<br /> go somewhere where they have all these things, that serves you well.</p>\n<p>BOILED PEANUTS  Sep 24 - Oct 23</p>\n<p>You have a passionate desire to help your fellow man. Unfortunately, those<br /> who know you best --your friends and loved ones-- may find that your<br /> personality is much too salty, and their criticism will probably affect you<br /> deeply because you are really much softer than you appear. You should go<br /> right ahead and marry anybody you want to because in a certain way, yours<br /> is a charmed life.  On the road of life, you can be sure that people will<br /> always pull over and stop for you.</p>\n<p>BUTTER BEAN  Oct 24 - Nov 22</p>\n<p>Always invite a Butter Bean because Butter Beans get along well with<br /> everybody. You, as a Butter Bean, should be proud. You''ve grown on the vine<br /> of life and you feel at home no matter what the setting. You can sit next<br /> to anybody. However, you, too, shouldn''t have anything to do with Moon<br /> Pies.</p>\n<p>ARMADILLO  Nov 23 - Dec 21</p>\n<p>You have a tendency to develop a tough exterior, but you are actually quite<br /> gentle. A good evening for you? Old friends, a fire, some roots, fruit,<br /> worms and insects. You are a throwback. You''re not concerned with today''s<br /> fashions and trends. You''re not concerned with anything about today. You''re<br /> really almost prehistoric in your interests and behavior patterns. You<br /> probably want to marry another Armadillo, but Possum is another, somewhat<br /> kinky, mating possibility.

Her husband is out looking for the other man.</p>\n<p>233. There were three people stranded on an island, a brunette, a redhead, and a blonde.  The brunette looked over the water to the mainland and estimated about 20 miles to shore.  So she announced, "I''m going to try to swim to shore."  So she swam out five miles, and got really tired.  She swam out ten miles from the island, and she was too tired to go on, so she drowned. The second one, the redhead, said to herself, "I wonder if she made it. I guess it''s better to try to get to the mainland than stay here and starve." So she attempts to swim out.  The redhead had a lot more endurance than the brunette, as she swam out 10 miles before she even got tired.  After 15 miles, she was too tired to go on, so she drowned. So the blonde thought to herself, "I wonder if they made it!  I think I''d better try to make it, too."  So she swam out 5 miles, ten miles, 15 miles, NINETEEN miles from the island.  The shore was just in sight, but she said, "I''m too tired to go on!"  So she swam back.</p>\n<p>234.

Two blondes were walking through the woods when one looked down and said "Oh, look at the deer tracks."  The other blonde looks and says "Those aren''t deer tracks, those are wolf tracks."  "No. Those are deer tracks." They keep arguing, and arguing, and one half hour later they were both killed by a train.</p>\n<p>236. The blonde came running downstairs, crying. Her mother asked what was wrong and the blonde said her boyfriend had just dropped her. Her mother (a blonde) nodded wisely and proceeded to tell her about the birds and the bees and the blonde said: "No ma. I can fuck and suck with the best of them. But he says I can''t cook"</p>\n<p>237. A dumb Blonde died and went to Heaven.   When she got to the Pearly Gates, she met Saint Peter who said, "Before you get to come into Heaven, you have to pass a test." "Oh No!" she said but Saint Peter said not to worry he''d make it easy. "Who was God''s son?" said Saint Peter. The dumb Blonde thought for a few minutes and said "Andy!" "That''s interesting...  What made you say that?" said Saint Peter. Then She started to sing "Andy walks with me!  Andy talks with me! Andy tells me..."</p>\n<p>238. Two blondes observed in a parking lot trying to unlock the door of their Mercedes with a coat hanger.</p>\n<p>Blonde#1: I can''t seem to get this door unlocked!</p>\n<p>Blonde#2: Well, you''d better hurry up and try harder, its starting to rain and the top is down!</p>\n<p>239.

Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound. Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one. Moses turned to Jesus and said, "I hate playing with your Dad."

There once was a man who was so fanatical about his golf game that he used to play every day without fail. One morning he had played the first hole and was just about to tee off on the second, when he saw the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen putting on the first. </p>\n<p>The man waited until the woman had reached the second tee and asked if she would like to join him and they could finish the round together. To his surprise the woman agreed and they played the remaining holes. Not only was this woman beautiful, she was also a good golfer. When they completed their round, the man told the woman that he was a cordon bleu chef and wine buff. </p>\n<p>He invited her back to his place for a meal and a few drinks. The woman accepted enthusiastically and off they went. Back at the house the man cooked a magnificent meal. In fact it was more than just cooking it was a performance do behold. They enjoyed good food, good wine and good conversation. The man was so taken by the beauty and skill of this woman and desired her no end. </p>\n<p>He then asked if she would like to play golf the following morning, to which she agreed. Once again they enjoyed a great game of golf, a magnificent evening meal. This went on for three weeks when the lawyer finally said to the woman, "Listen, the golf and the company have been fantastic! But, there are only so many performances a man can take. When are we going to have sex?" </p>\n<p>"We can''t," said the woman. </p>\n<p>"Why not?" came the reply. </p>\n<p>"Because I''m a transvestite" replied the woman. </p>\n<p>"YOU BITCH!" screamed the lawyer, "...I CAN''T BELIEVE that you''ve been playing off the LADIES TEE FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS!"

Every time you ask a question, you are told you don''t need to know, don''t want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can''t even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.  Then they go on the runway and piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they''re building.CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13 airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don''t need to know where the airplane is or who it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don''t fly the airplane itself; you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don''t go anywhere. But that''s okay, because when the world is at your fingertips you never need to leave home.</p>\n<p>Joke found on http://www.ahajokes.com
Morris was in his usual place in the morning sitting at the table, reading the<br /> paper after breakfast. He came across an article about a beautiful actress that<br /> was about to marry a football player who was known primarily for his lack of IQ<br /> and common knowledge.<br /> He turned to his wife Sherry, with a look of question on his face. "I''ll never<br /> understand why the biggest schmucks get the most attractive wives."</p>\n<p>His wife replies, "Why thank you, dear!"
One day, Jim and Bob are out golfing. Jim slices his ball deep into a wooded ravine. He grabs his 8-iron and proceeds down the embankment into the ravine in search of his ball.</p>\n<p>The brush is quite thick, but Jim searches diligently and suddenly he spots something shiny. As he gets closer, he realizes that the shiny object is in fact an 8-iron in the hands of a skeleton lying near an old golf ball.</p>\n<p>Jim calls out to his golfing partner in excitement, "Hey Bob, come here, I got trouble down here."</p>\n<p>Bob comes running over to the edge of the ravine and calls out, "What''s the matter Jim?"</p>\n<p>Jim shouts back in a nervous voice, "Throw me my 7-iron...<br /> You can''t get out of here with an 8-iron!"

My Dear Husband, </p>\n<p>I am sending you this letter via this BBS communications thing, so that you will be sure to read it. Please forgive the deception, but I thought you should know what has been going on at home since your computer entered our lives TWO YEARS AGO. </p>\n<p>The children are doing well. Tommy is seven now and is a bright, handsome boy. He has developed quite an interest in the arts. He drew a family portrait for a school project, all the figures were good, and the back of your head is very realistic. You should be very proud of him. </p>\n<p>Little Jennifer turned three in September. She looks a lot like you did at that age. She is an attractive child and quite smart. She still remembers that you spent the whole afternoon with us on her birthday. What a grand day for Jenny, despite the fact that it was stormy and the electricity was out. </p>\n<p>I am doing well. I went blonde about a year ago, and discovered that it really is more fun! George, I mean, Mr. Wilson the department head, has uh, taken an interest in my career and has become a good friend to us all. </p>\n<p>I discovered that the household chores are much easier since I realized that you didn''t mind being vacuumed but that feather dusting made you sneeze. The house is in good shape. I had the living room painted last spring; I''m sure you noticed it. I made sure that the painters cut holes in the drop sheet so you wouldn''t be disturbed. </p>\n<p>Well, my dear, I must be going. Uncle George, uh, Mr. Wilson, I mean, is taking us all on a ski trip and there is packing to do. I have hired a housekeeper to take care of things while we are away, she''ll keep things in order, fill your coffee cup and bring your meals to your desk, just the way you like it. </p>\n<p>I hope you and the computer will have a lovely time while we are gone. Tommy, Jenny and I will think of you often. Try to remember us while your disks are booting. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Your Wife

In a small southern town there was a "Nativity Scene" that showed great skill and talent had gone into creating it. One small feature bothered me.The three wise men were wearing firemen''s helmets.Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation, I left. At a "Quik Stop" on the edge of town, I asked the lady behind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling at me, "You stupid Yankees never do read the Bible!" I assured her that I did, but simply couldn''t recall anything about firemen in the Bible.She jerked her Bible from behind the counter and ruffled through some pages, and finally jabbed her finger at a passage. Sticking it in my face she said "See, it says right here, ''The three wise man came from afar.''"
There were two men who played golf together frequently. One was several strokes better than the other. The lesser player was very proud, and never wanted to take any strokes to even up the game.<br /> One Saturday morning, he shows up with a gorilla at the first tee. He says to his friend, "I''ve been trying to beat you for so long that I''m about ready to give up. But, I heard about this golfing gorilla, and I was wondering if it would be alright if he plays for me today. In fact if you''re game, I''d like to try to get back all the money I''ve lost to you this year. I figure comes to about a thousand bucks. Are you willing?" </p>\n<p>The other guy thought about it for a minute, and then decided to play the gorilla. "After all, how good could a gorilla be at golf?" he thought. </p>\n<p>Well, the first hole was a straightaway par 4 of 450 yards. The guy hits a beautiful tee shot, 275 yards down the middle, leaving himself a 6 iron to the green. The gorilla takes a few powerful practice swings and then laces the ball 450 yards, right at the pin, stopping about 6 inches away from the hole. </p>\n<p>The guy turns to his friend and says "That''s incredible, I would have never believed it if I hadn''t seen it with my own eyes. But, you know what, I''ve seen enough. I''ve got no interest in being totally humiliated by this gorilla golfing machine. You send this frigging gorilla back to where he comes from. I need a drink; better make it a double, and I''ll write you a check." </p>\n<p>After handing over the check, and well into his second double the guy asks, "By the way, how''s that gorilla''s putting?" </p>\n<p>The other guy replies, "Same as his driving." </p>\n<p>"That good, huh?" </p>\n<p>"No, I mean, he hits putts the same way - 450 yards, right down the middle!"
15&gt; You just can''t get your day going without the morning announcements and Pledge of Allegiance. </p>\n<p>14&gt; Despite your having the hottest live dorm sex-cam on campus, the other kids at BYU just don''t seem to accept you. </p>\n<p>13&gt; Forget the kegger with the Tri-Delts this Friday -- you''ve got some Ruminations to write! </p>\n<p>12&gt; Passing high school chemistry by sleeping with your teacher worked well, but the irony of passing freshman ethics by sleeping with your teacher is driving you nuts. </p>\n<p>11&gt; "Aww, c''mon guys. We just went out drinking last night!" </p>\n<p>10&gt; That backpack you made out of your blankie isn''t fooling anyone. </p>\n<p>9&gt; Your fraternity brothers are doubting your claim that the rubber sheets are due to an allergy to cotton. </p>\n<p>8&gt; You''re anxious to find out if you got an A on your cat-dissection project. But you''re not taking a biology class, and your art professor seems to be avoiding you. </p>\n<p>7&gt; Due to a misunderstanding, your cramming for exams involves K-Y Jelly. </p>\n<p>6&gt; You think "carrying a full load" means you haven''t had a girlfriend in awhile. </p>\n<p>5&gt; Animal Husbandry isn''t exactly what you expected when you signed up for it. </p>\n<p>4&gt; The good news: You have a 3.5 average. The bad news: That''s your blood alcohol content. </p>\n<p>3&gt; You feel so awkward and unpopular that you quit the Young Republicans and join the Junior Reform Party. </p>\n<p>2&gt; The friendly wager you made with your new roommate about who would score first apparently has nothing to do with your Pokemon skills. </p>\n<p>1&gt; Your mother turns on Dateline''s story about college binge drinking just in time to see you vomit on Jane Pauley. </p>\n<p>[ The Top 5 List www.topfive.com]</p>\n<p>[ Copyright 1999 by Chris White ]

A blonde is terribly overweight, so her doctor put her on a<br /> diet. "I want you to eat regularly for 2 days, then skip a day,<br /> and repeat this procedure for 2 weeks. The next time I see you,<br /> you''ll have lost at least 5 pounds." </p>\n<p>When the blonde returned, she shocked the doctor by losing<br /> nearly 20 pounds. "Why, that''s amazing!" the doctor said, "Did<br /> you follow my instructions?" The blonde nodded... "I''ll tell you<br /> though, I thought I was going to drop dead that 3rd day." "From<br /> hunger, you mean?", asked the doctor." "No, from skipping."

Dave called home one afternoon to see what his wife was making for dinner. "Hello?" said a little girl''s voice."Hi, honey, it''s Daddy," said Dave. "Is mommy near the phone?" "No, Daddy. She''s upstairs in the bedroom with Uncle Kevin."After a brief pause, Dave said, "But you don''t have an Uncle Kevin, honey!""Yes I do. He''s upstairs in the bedroom with Mommy!""Okay, then. Here''s what I want you to do. Put down the phone, run upstairs, knock on the bedroom door and shout in to Mommy and Uncle Kevin that my car just pulled up outside the house.""Okay, Daddy!"A few minutes later, the little girl came back to the phone. "Well, I did what you said, Daddy.""And what happened?""Well, Mommy jumped out of bed with no clothes on and ran around screaming, then she tripped over the rug and went out the front window and now she''s all dead.""Oh my god! And what about Uncle Kevin?""He jumped out of bed with no clothes on too and he was all scared and he jumped out the back window into the swimming pool, but he must have forgot that you took out all the water last week to clean it, so he hit the bottom of the swimming pool, and now he''s dead too."There was a long pause, then Bob said, "Swimming pool? Is this 555- 7039?"

1. Call</p>\n<p>2. Don''t lie. </p>\n<p>3. Never tape any of her body parts together. </p>\n<p>4. If guys'' night out is going to be fun, invite the girls. </p>\n<p>5. The correct answer to "Do I look fat?" is never, ever "Yes." </p>\n<p>6. Ditto for "Is she prettier than me?" </p>\n<p>7. Victoria''s secret is good. Frederick''s of Hollywood is bad. </p>\n<p>8. Ordering for her is good. Telling her what she wants is bad. </p>\n<p>9. Being attentive is good. Stalking is bad. </p>\n<p>10. "Honey," "Darling," and "Sweetheart," are good. "Nag," "Lardass," and "Bitch," are bad. </p>\n<p>11. Talking is good. Shouting is bad. Slapping is a felony. </p>\n<p>12. A grunt is seldom an acceptable answer to any question. </p>\n<p>13. None of your ex-girlfriends was ever nicer, prettier, or better in bed. </p>\n<p>14. Her cooking is excellent. </p>\n<p>15. That isn''t an excuse for you to avoid coocking. </p>\n<p>16. Dish soap is your friend. </p>\n<p>17. Hat does not equal shower, after-shave does not equal soap, and warm does not equal clean. </p>\n<p>18. Buying her dinner does not equal foreplay. </p>\n<p>19.

Believe it or not, you''re probably not more attractive when you''re all sweaty. </p>\n<p>23. Burping is not sexy. </p>\n<p>24. You''re wrong. </p>\n<p>25. You''re sorry. </p>\n<p>26. She is probably less impressed by your discourse on your cool car than you think. </p>\n<p>27. Ditto for you discourse on football. </p>\n<p>28. Ditto for your ability to jump up and hit any awning in a single bound. </p>\n<p>29. "Will you marry me?" is good. "Let''s shack up together" is bad. </p>\n<p>30. Don''t assume PMS is the cause for every bad mood. </p>\n<p>31. Don''t assume PMS doesn''t exist. </p>\n<p>32. No means No. Yes means Yes. Silence could mean anything she feels like at that particular moment in time, and it could change without notice. </p>\n<p>33. Never let her walk anywhere alone after 11 pm. </p>\n<p>34. Chivalry and feminism are NOT mutually exclusive. </p>\n<p>35. Pick her up at the airport. Don''t whine about it, just do it. </p>\n<p>36. If you want to break up with her, break up with her. Don''t act like a complete jerk until she does it for you. </p>\n<p>37. Don''t tell her you love her if you don''t. </p>\n<p>38. Tell her you love her if you do. Often. </p>\n<p>39. Always, always suck up to her brother. </p>\n<p>40. Think boxers. Silk boxers. </p>\n<p>41. Remember Valentine''s Day, and any cheesy "anniversary" she so names. </p>\n<p>42. Don''t try to change the way she dresses. </p>\n<p>43. Her haircut is never bad. </p>\n<p>44. Don''t let your friends pick on her. </p>\n<p>45. The rules are never fair. Accept this without question. The fact that she has to go through labor while you sit on your butt in the waiting room, smoking cigars, isn''t fair either, and it balances everything.

Some are getting tired of this ongoing saga. Since the media won''t give it a rest and move on, we recommend playing the following game during any network or local news shows, "special reports," news magazines (i.e.,Dateline, 20/20, etc), talk shows, or any other appropriate TV shows.Guaranteed to make watching this story more entertaining or your money back!Beverages required to play the game: Each player must have a beer handy, a liquor appropriate for pouring shots is also required (tequila or rum is preferred).RULES OF PLAY- If a TV announcer says "Castro" everyone in the room must salute with their left hand. The last person to do so must take a shot. If anyone salutes with their right hand accidentally, they also have to take a shot.- If the photo of the SWAT "gunman" is shown, everyone must act scared. The last person to do so must take a shot and then go into a closet until he is "rescued" by another player.- If the TV announcer says "fisherman," everyone must press their palms together and make a swimming move with their hands. The last person to do so must chug whatever beer remains in their glass.- If a child psychologist is interviewed, everyone must stroke his/her chin and say, "I see." The first person to do so becomes the "psychologist" and gets to administer shots to any players he/she deems in need of mood improvement.- During any interview of a Member of Congress, everyone must shout, "bullshit!" The last person to do so drinks.- If the TV announcer says "Miami relatives" everyone must shout out either "Lazaro" or "Marisleysis". A count is made of how many players said each name. Everyone who called out the more popular name has to take a drink of beer.- Whenever the station goes "live to Little Havana" everyone must stand up and dance. The last person on their feet has to do a shot.- If Marisleysis is shown crying everyone must yell "knock it off" and then take a drink of beer.- If Juan Miguel Gonzales is shown carrying his "other son" everyone must yell "wahhhhh" like a baby for as long as they can on one breath. The last person to stop gets to pick a person to do a shot.- If Elian Gonzales returns to Cuba with his father, everyone shouts "Thank God." The game is then over.

Bert and Mabel were a week away from their wedding day. Bert was beginning to get major stirrings so he decided to chance his arm. "Er, Mabel, as it is only a week to the big day, how''s about a quick screw?" said Bert. Mabel''s answer as expected was, "No Bert, it''s only 6 days to go, however you can have a look at your prize."The next night Bert again pesters Mabel. Being an understanding sort, Mabel gives in and says, "It is still 5 days to go and as you''ve been a good fellow,I''ll let you have a little feel of your prize."It only makes matters worse for Bert and by the next night he can hardly contain himself.Seeing his obvious predicament Mabel greets Bert and whispers in his ear, "I can see what your problem is but you''ve still got 4 days to go. I will however let you have a good sniff of your prize."Not being bashful, Bert lifts Mabel''s skirts and sniffs. After a minute he comes up for air, "Mabel, do you think it will keep ''till Saturday?!?"
* A "handicapped golfer" is a man who plays golf with his wife.</p>\n<p>* I have a nephew who''s so good at golf, he''s been offered a<br /> full scholarship to medical school.</p>\n<p>* Then there was the golfer who was sentenced to be hanged. He<br /> asked the warden if he could take a few practice swings first.</p>\n<p>* Just think guys, a golfer can spend the entire weekend with a<br /> bunch of "hookers" and his wife isn''t the least bit concerned.</p>\n<p>* Basically, golf has made more liars out of Americans than all<br /> of the income tax forms ever filed.</p>\n<p>* Contrary to popular belief avid golfers do not lie all the<br /> time. Anytime one golfer calls another a "liar" they''re probably<br /> telling the truth.</p>\n<p>* Some people just have to cheat all the time when it comes to<br /> recording the number of strokes on their golf cards. I knew one<br /> fellow who got a hole-in-one and entered "zero" on his card.</p>\n<p>* Although not condoned, it was well known within the Maryland<br /> State Highway that sometimes people would "sneak-away" for a<br /> game of golf during the day. I had forgotten which course my<br /> friend Dan said to meet him on and called, only to have his<br /> secretary said, "I''m sorry he''s away from his desk right now."<br /> Knowing she''d never admit where he really was, I asked, "Tell<br /> me, is he 10 miles way from his desk or 22 miles away?"

A Frenchman, an Englishman and a New Yorker were exploring the jungle and were<br /> captured by a fierce tribe. As they sit in a hut, awaiting their fate, the chief<br /> comes to them and says, "The bad news is that now that we''ve caught you, we''re<br /> going to kill you, and then use your skins to build a canoe. The good news is<br /> that you get to choose how you die." </p>\n<p>The Frenchman says, "I take ze poison." the chief gives him some poison, the<br /> Frenchman says, "vive la France!" and drinks it down.</p>\n<p>The Englishman says, "A pistol for me, please." the chief gives him a pistol,<br /> he points it at his head, says, "god save the queen!" and blows his brains out.</p>\n<p>The New Yorker says, "Gimme a fork." the chief is puzzled, but he shrugs and<br /> gives him a fork. The New Yorker takes the fork and starts jabbing himself all<br /> over -- the stomach, the sides, the chest, everywhere.</p>\n<p>There�酶惟s blood gushing out all over, it''s horrible.

Shit may just be the most powerful word in the English language.<br /> You can be shit faced, shit out of luck, or have shit for<br /> brains. With a little effort, you can get your shit together,<br /> find a place for your shit or decide to shit or get off the pot.<br /> You can smoke shit, buy shit, sell shit, lose shit, find shit,<br /> forget shit, and tell others to eat shit and die. Some people<br /> know their shit while others can''t tell the difference between<br /> shit and shineola. There are lucky shits, dumb shits, crazy<br /> shits, and sweet shits. There is bull shit, horse shit and<br /> chicken shit. You can throw shit, sling shit, catch shit, shoot<br /> shit, or duck when shit hits the fan. You can give a shit or<br /> serve shit on a shingle. You can find yourself in deep shit or<br /> be happier than a pig in shit. Some days are colder than shit,<br /> some days are hotter than shit, and some days are just plain<br /> shitty. Some music sounds like shit, things can look like shit,<br /> and there are times when you feel like shit. You can have too<br /> much shit, not enough shit, the right shit, the wrong shit or a<br /> lot of weird shit. You can carry shit, have a mountain of shit,<br /> or find yourself up shit''s creek without a paddle. Sometimes<br /> everything you touch turns to shit and other times you swimming<br /> a lake of shit and come out smelling like a rose. When you stop<br /> to consider all the facts, it''s the basic building block of<br /> creation. And remember, once you know your shit, you don''t need<br /> to know anything else!
Little DJ has his first day at school. His Mom was real worried, and when she<br /> picked him up from school at the end of the day, she anxiously asked him how his<br /> day went. ''Well, I came top of the class in Math, I made a touchdown in<br /> football, and I had sex with the teacher.'' ''What! How dare you! Get into your<br /> room and wait till your father gets home!'' Little DJ goes to his room, and when<br /> his father comes home, DJ''s mom tells his father, ''I''m absolutely disgusted with<br /> DJ. He said he came top of the class in Math, made a touchdown in football, and<br /> had sex with the teacher!'' ''That''s my boy'' thinks his Dad. So he goes upstairs<br /> to talk to DJ. ''Don''t worry about your Mom. She''s a bit upset, but it sounds to<br /> me like you had an awesome day at school. In fact, I''m so pleased, you know that<br /> bicycle I said I was going to buy you for Christmas, I think I''ll get it for you<br /> this weekend.'' ''Oh no, Dad, don''t. I don''t think I''ll be able to sit down for a<br /> while.''

"It''s important for young men and women who look at the Nebraska champs to<br /> understand that quality of life is more than just blocking shots." �酶惟George W.<br /> Bush, in remarks to the University of Nebraska women''s volleyball team, the 2001<br /> national champions, May 31, 2001
An African village was troubled by a man-eating lion. So its leaders sent a message to the great white hunter, to come and kill the beast.For several nights the hunter lay in wait for the lion, but it never showed up. Finally, he told the tribal chief to kill a cow and give him its hide. Draping the skin over his shoulders, he went to the pasture to wait for the lion.In the middle of the night, the villagers woke to the sound of bloodcurdling shrieks coming from the pasture. As they carefully approached, they saw the hunter lying there, groaning in pain. There was no sign of the lion."What happened, bwana? Where is the lion? asked the chief."Forget the damn lion !" he howled."Which of you Idiots let the bull loose?"
Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound.<br /> Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the center of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. </p>\n<p>The third guy got up and sort of randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drainspout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a little stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one. </p>\n<p>Moses turned to Jesus and said, "I hate playing with your Dad."

Once there was a little boy named Jimmy. One day jimmy asked his Dad if he could take a shower with him. His Dad said OK but don`t look down. So they got in and Jimmy looked down and said "Daddy what`s that?" His Dad said that is my limo. That same day Jimmy asked his mother if he could take a shower with her. She said OK but only if you don`t look up and you don`t look down. So they got in and Jimmy looked up and asked "What are those?" and his mom said those are my head lights. Then Jimmy looked down and he asked his mom "What is that?" She said that is my garage. Jimmy said Oh! Later that evening Jimmy decided that he wanted to sleep with his parents in their bed. They said OK but don`t look under the covers. The next morning at the breakfast table Jimmy exclamed<br /> "Mommy! Last night I squeesed your head lights to make them turn on but it didn`t work! Jimmy!" his mother yelled. "Why did you do that? Well," Jimmy began, " Daddy was trying to park his limo in your garage but my little sports car beat him in!"
A Texas millionaire had fallen ill. The doctors consulted did not seem to understand what ailed him. The millionaire let it be known that any doctor who could heal him could have whatever he desired.A country doctor was able to cure him and as the doctor was leaving after a week''s stay, the Texan said, "Doc! I am a man of my word. You name it and if it is humanly possible I''ll get it for you.""Well," said the doctor, "my wife and I love to play golf, so if I could have a matching set of golf clubs that would be fine."With that the doctor left. The doctor didn''t hear from the Texan millionaire for some months. Then one day he got a phone call from the millionaire."Doc, I bet you thought that I had gone back on my word. I have your matching set of golf clubs. The reason it took so long is that they didn''t have swimming pools, so I didn''t think they were good enough for ya. I had pools installed and they''re all ready for you now."

I, THE UNDERSIGNED, AGREE THAT...<br /> 1. In the unlikely event of my not having an orgasm after you''ve drunkenly rolled on top of me and pumped away for five minutes, wheezing like an old man with emphysema, I shall politely fake one. And it''ll be a really good act too, with me saying stuff like "So THIS is screwing!" and howling like a cat that''s being repeatedly jabbed with a needle. </p>\n<p>2. I fully understand that a woman''s main role in any relationship is to take the blame. So when you stub your toe in the bathroom or your football teams lose, I agree that - by some complex scientific equation incomprehensible to woman - it will be my fault. Even if I wasn''t there. </p>\n<p>3. Whenever my friends and I get together for a girlie chat, I will tell them that you are better hung than a large-balled Himalayan yak. </p>\n<p>4. And I will also mention this to YOUR friends. A lot. </p>\n<p>5. After sex (which I will NEVER refer to as "making love"), I will not expect you to cuddle me for hours till your arm goes dead. Nor will I let my hair annoyingly get in your face. </p>\n<p>6. I will never, ever give your penis a "cute" nickname. </p>\n<p>7. In bed, I will be happy as can be to try any novel sexual position you fancy. Especially ones where I do all the work and you just lie there, grinning. </p>\n<p>8. I will ruthlessly interrogate my attractive female friends and inform you if any of them have the slightest bisexual tendencies. Then I''ll invite them around for dinner. And hide their car keys so they have to stay. </p>\n<p>9. After we split up, I will never sleep with any of your friends or colleagues. Or anyone else you have ever met. Or may one day meet. And if men attempt to chat me up, I will solemnly inform them that you have "ruined me for other men." </p>\n<p>10. I understand that mechanical objects like cars, computers, and remote control devices are beyond the comprehension of women. I will only make a fool of myself if I attempt to operate them, so you''re in charge of the lot. Except for the oven, iron and the washing machine, of course. </p>\n<p>Signed:_____________________________<br /> Date:________________

The judge then called in duck number two<br /> and asked him the same question. "Judge, I was blowing bubbles."</p>\n<p>He then called in duck number three and said, "So let me quests �酶惟 you were<br /> blowing bubbles too?"</p>\n<p>"No, I''m Bubbles."
It seems that The Count on Sesame Street was giving a lecture on his<br /> thoughts on Godel''s Theorem and there was a great need for extra transportation<br /> services to this event. After all, people like Gordon, Bob, Maria, Mr. Hooper,<br /> and all can only take so much of the "Which is not like the other" mentality.<br /> Anyway, since the Speedy Delivery Service run by Mr.McFeeley (what a name for<br /> a character on a children''s show!) was being pushed out of Mr. Roger''s<br /> Neighborhood by Federal Express, he thought he would sign on as a bus driver<br /> for the Sesame Street Bus Company. Besides, he was do for another trip to the<br /> Magic Kingdom and that was getting expensive these days. </p>\n<p>        On the morning of the big event he kissed his wife goodbye and hopped<br /> onto his bus and began driving his route. At the first stop there were two<br /> rather plump twins, so he stopped. As they got on he said "Hi there! Welcome to<br /> the Sesame St. bus! I''m Mr. McFeeley, who are you?" The twins said "We''re<br /> named Patty" and they then waddled to their seats. He started to drive and at<br /> the next stop he saw a rather dejected looking man and stopped to pick him up.<br /> "Hi there", said Mr. McFeeley,"why do you look so said?" The man said, " I have<br /> no friends and I''m terribly lonely." With that Mr. Mcfeeley replied,"what is<br /> your name?" The man replied, "Saul". "Well, you can be my special friend Saul",<br /> said Mr. McFeeley. The man looked much happier and skipped to his seat. Mr.<br /> McFeeley then went on his way to the next bus stop and saw two men waiting,<br /> though one looked rather familiar. He stopped and gave his greeting to the<br /> first man. Mr. McFeeley learned that his name was Lester Cheese. Mr. McFeeley<br /> then recognized the other man to be Don Rickles. Apparently he looked to be<br /> in some kind of pain. "Welcome to the Sesame Street Bus Mr. Rickles! You look<br /> like you''re in a lot of pain." "That''s right, I''ve got bunyons you hockey puck!"<br /> And with that Mr. McFeeley completed his route to the symposium.</p>\n<p> When Mr. McFeeley returned home his wife said, "How did it go today<br /> dear?" Mr. McFeeley replied, "Just great! I had two obese Patties, a special<br /> friend Saul, Lester Cheese, and Don Rickles with Bunyons all on the Sesame<br /> Bus!" They then took their valium and went to the Magic Kingdom.

A milkman was making his deliveries and found a note attached to a customers door saying "I need 45 gallons of milk."He knocked on the door and a beautiful blond answered it."Is this a mistake?"the milkman asked."No," she said, "I was watching a talk show and it said that bathing in milk is good for your skin.""Really?"replied the milkman."Do you want it pasteurised?""No, up to my tits would be fine," she said
A friend of a guy in the Nutrition School at Tufts was one of the lucky passengers onboard a Northwest Airlines flight to Boston during our recent hurricane "Bob". The captain did his best to skirt the edge of the storm, but it was a pretty rough ride just the same, rough enough that the flight attendants were ordered to strap themselves into their seats for about half an hour, and many of the passengers were putting the little plastic-lined bags in their seat pockets to good use. </p>\n<p>When the turbulence finally abated, the flight attendants unbuckled themselves, and the captain''s voice came on over the intercom. "Well, folks, that was quite some ride, wasn''t it?'' But we came through it fine, just the way we always do, and I''m happy to report that it looks like the remainder of our trip should be much calmer. On behalf of myself and today''s flight crew, I''d like to thank you very much for your calmness and cooperation, and extend our best wishes for a pleasant stay in Boston." </p>\n<p>...after a short pause and several clicks "Jeez Man - whadda bitchin'' ride'''' Boy - I sure could use a cup of good strong coffee and a blow job, right about now''" </p>\n<p>As a stricken stewardess dashed up the aisle to the cabin to inform the captain that his intercom was still on, one of the passengers called after her, "Don''t forget the coffee!"
Murphy''s Laws of Martial Arts Ten scientific principles that apply to the study of all martial arts: The wimp who made it through the eliminations on luck alone will suddenly turn into Bruce Lee when you''re up against him. The referee will always be looking the other way when you score. The day you leave work early to make it to class on time, the sensei will be sick. The sensei will only use you during demonstrations for joint-locking techniques. If you have to use your training in self-defense, your attacker''s father will be a lawyer. After a flawless demonstration, you will trip on your way back to your seat. After years of training without a single injury, you will pull a groin muscle the night before your black belt exam. In an otherwise vacant locker room, the only other person will have the locker right next to yours. No matter how many times you take care of it before your promotion exam, you will invariably have to go to the bathroom when it''s your turn.

An escaped convict broke into a house and tied up a young couple who had been sleeping in the bedroom.As soon as he had a chance, the husband turned to his voluptuous young wife, bound up on the bed in a skimpy night-gown, and whispered, "Honey, this guy hasn`t seen a woman in years.Just co-operate with anything he wants. If he wants to have sex with you, just go along with it and pretend you like it. Our lives depend on it.""Dear," the wife hissed, spitting out her gag, "I`m so relieved you feel that way, because he just told me he thinks you have a really nice ass."

The jumbo jet is just coming into an Airport in Toronto on its final approach. The pilot comes on over the intercom."This is Capt Johnson. We''re on our final descent into Toronto. I want to thank you for flying with us today, and I hope you enjoy your stay in Toronto.  He forgets to switch off the intercom. The whole plane can now hear the conversation from the cockpit. The co-pilot says to the pilot, "Well skipper, watcha gonna do in Toronto?  Now all ears in the plane are listening in to this conversation."Well," says the skipper, "first I''m gonna check into the hotel and take a crap. Then I''m gonna take that new stewardess out for supper, you know, the one with the huge tits. I''m gonna wine and dine her , take her back to my room, and shag her all night."  Everyone in the plane is trying to get a look at the new stewardess.  She''s so embarrassed that she runs from the back of the plane to try and get to the cockpit to turn the intercom off. Halfway down the aisle, she trips over an old lady''s bag and down she goes.  The old lady leans over and says, "No need to run, dear, he''s gotta take a shit first!"

A woman was having a daytime affair while her husband was at work. One wet and dreary day she was in bed with her boyfriend when, to her horror, she heard her husband''s car pull into the driveway. "Oh My God hurry! Grab your clothes," she yelled to her lover, "and jump out the window. My husband''s home early!""I can''t jump out the window!" came the strangled reply from beneath the sheets, "It''s raining out there!""If my husband catches us in here, he''ll kill us both!" she replied. "He''s got a very quick temper and a very large gun! The rain is the least of your problems."So the boyfriend scoots out of bed, grabs his clothes and jumps out the window! As he begins running down the street in the pouring rain, he quickly discovers he has run right into the middle of the town''s annualmarathon. So he starts running along beside the others, about 300 of them.Being naked, with his clothes tucked under his arm, he tries to "blend in" as best he can. After a little while, a small group of runners, who had been studying him with some curiosity, jogged closer. "Do you always run in the nude?" one asked."Oh yes" he replied, gasping in air. "It feels so wonderfully free having the air blow over all your skin while you''re running."Another runner moved alongside. "Do you always run carrying your clothes with you under your arm?""Oh, yes" our friend answered breathlessly. "That way I can get dressed right at the end of the run and get in my car to go home!"Then a third runner cast his eyes a little lower and queried. "Do you always wear a condom when you run?""Only if it''s raining."
Johnny was 8 years old and like other boys his age rather<br /> curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about ''courting'' from<br /> the older boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done.<br /> One day he took his question to his mother, who became rather<br /> flustered. </p>\n<p>Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide<br /> behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her<br /> boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described<br /> EVERYTHING to his mother. "Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked<br /> for a while, then he started kissing and hugging herI figured<br /> ''Sis must be getting sickbecause her face started looking funny.<br /> He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her<br /> blouse to feel her heart, just &gt; the way the doctor would.<br /> Except he''s not as smart as the docotr because he seemed to have<br /> trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too,<br /> because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all<br /> out of breath. His other hand must have been cold because he put<br /> it under her skirt. About this time ''Sis got worse and began to<br /> moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of<br /> the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a<br /> fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. Finally, I<br /> found out what was making them so sick -- a big eel had gotten<br /> inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and<br /> stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway he grabbed it<br /> in one hand to keep it from getting away. When Sis saw it, she<br /> got really scared -- her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open,<br /> and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said<br /> it was the biggest one she''s ever seen; I should tell her about<br /> the ones down at the lake by our house! Anyway, Sis got brave<br /> and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a<br /> sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he<br /> took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel''s<br /> head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her<br /> legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by<br /> lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis<br /> started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset<br /> the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it<br /> between them. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed<br /> the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of<br /> its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a<br /> little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting<br /> anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the<br /> eel wasn''t dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight<br /> again. I guess eels are like cats -- they have nine lives or<br /> something. This time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill it by<br /> sitting on it. After about a 35 minute struggle, they finally<br /> killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because I saw Sis''s<br /> boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet.

The huge college freshman figured he''d try </p>\n<p>out for the football team. "Can you tackle?" </p>\n<p>asked the coach. </p>\n<p>"Watch this," said the freshman, who proceeded </p>\n<p>to run smack into a telephone pole, shattering </p>\n<p>it to splinters. </p>\n<p>"Wow," said the coach. "I''m impressed. Can you run?" </p>\n<p>"Of course I can run," said the freshman. He </p>\n<p>was off like a shot, and, in just over nine </p>\n<p>seconds, he had run a hundred yard dash. </p>\n<p>"Great!" enthused the coach. "But can you pass </p>\n<p>a football?" </p>\n<p>The freshman rolled his eyes, hesitated for a </p>\n<p>few seconds. "Well, sir," he said, "if I can </p>\n<p>swallow it, I can probably pass it."

Spokesman Shows Footage of President Tumbling from Bike</p>\n<p>In what some political insiders were calling an attempt to lower expectations in the days leading up to the first presidential debate, the White House today announced that President Bush has an I.Q. of 67.</p>\n<p>"The president is far, far less intelligent than is commonly thought," White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.  "Even the simplest tasks remain well beyond his reach."</p>\n<p>Reinforcing the impression that the president will be overmatched in Thursday''s debate with Sen. John Kerry, Mr. McClellan showed reporters never-before-seen footage of Mr. Bush oafishly tumbling from his mountain bike.</p>\n<p>"What a moron," Mr. McClellan said.</p>\n<p>The White House spokesman said that Mr. Bush cannot possibly be expected to do well in a debate with Sen. Kerry, who Mr. McClellan said "has an I.Q. of 193" and "is widely considered the best debater on the planet."</p>\n<p>But within minutes of the White House press conference, Kerry spokesman Joe Lockhart fired back, telling reporters, "John Kerry is much stupider than he looks."</p>\n<p>As evidence of Mr. Kerry''s idiocy, Mr. Lockhart referred to the floral-patterned windsurfing pants the senator wears while enjoying his favorite water sport.</p>\n<p>"His ass looks enormous in those pants," Mr. Lockhart said.  "What kind of a moron would leave the house with his ass looking like that?"</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said today that it was unfair to compare the upcoming Iraqi elections to those held in America, "except for Florida."
Two men were having an awfully slow round of golf because the two ladies in front of them managed to get into every sand trap, lake, and rough on the course. They didn''t bother to wave the men on through (which is proper golf etiquette). </p>\n<p>After two hours of waiting and waiting, one man said, "I think I''ll walk up there and ask those gals to let us play through." </p>\n<p>He walked out the fairway, got halfway to the ladies, stopped, turned around, and came back, explaining, "I can''t do it. One of those women is my wife and the other is my mistress. Maybe you''d better go talk to them." </p>\n<p>The second man walked toward the ladies, got halfway there and, just as his partner had done, stopped, turned around and walked back. He smiled sheepishly and said, "Small world."
This truck driver hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers stops for a beer. As he approaches the bar, he sees a big sign on the door  saying ''''Nerds Not Allowed -- Enter At Your Own Risk!''''      He goes in and sits down. The bartender comes over to him.''''You smell kind of nerdy. What do you do for a living?''''       ''''I drive a truck, and the smell is just from  the computers I''m hauling.''''       ''''Okay, truck drivers are not nerds,'''' he says and serves  him a beer.        As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in with tape around his glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils,  and a belt at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away.        The truck driver is totally shocked.''''Why did you do that?''''        ''''Not to worry, the nerds are overpopulating Silicon Valley and are in season now. You don''t even need a license.''''        The truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads back onto the freeway.  Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident,  and the load shifts.  The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming,  grabbing up the computers.They are all engineers, accountants, and programmers wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen.        He can''t let them steal his whole load.  So, remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, felling several of them instantly.  A highway patrol officer comes  zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop.     ''''What''s wrong? I thought nerds were in season," says the truck driver.''''Well, sure,'''' says the patrolman. ''''But you can''t bait ''em.''''

Do you remember primary school/junior high/high school? Do you<br /> remember talking about ''the bases'' with your friends?... Well<br /> forget ''em!! This is **FOOTBALL**. With the all new standardized<br /> guide to Football, you can forget any of the previous<br /> complications of having to remember what second base was or any<br /> of that shit. And you wonder why there is a strike in Baseball<br /> and not Football! Quite simply, Baseball is a boring, confusing,<br /> and often an ambiguous game especially when trying to compare it<br /> to sexual experiences. Whereas Football was invented for the<br /> soul purpose of understanding where you and your friends are at.<br /> Basically the game of Football is one big sex metaphor. No one<br /> has discovered that yet, but as you will soon see, the<br /> complications of modern romance are easily solved here, in The<br /> Original Handbook of Football! </p>\n<p>Okay now for the yard lines. your 10 yrd ln.....holding hands "<br /> 20 yrd ln.....hugging " 30 yrd ln.....kiss on the cheek " 40 yrd<br /> ln.....kiss on the mouth " 50 yrd ln.....tongue kiss (mid-field<br /> means it''s serious) his/her 40 yrd ln.....shirt and bra off<br /> (feeling and carousing) 30 yrd ln.....all clothes off (genital<br /> contact, mutual masturbation) 20 yrd ln.....oral sex 1st and<br /> goal..put on the condom Goal line.....touchdown (sexual<br /> intercourse) </p>\n<p>Now for some important definitions: </p>\n<p>Kickoff-- making the first move (asking for a date) Kicking it<br /> deep-- asking out a virgin (starting out deep in your own end)<br /> On-side kick-- asking out a slut/stud (starting out close to<br /> mid-field) Kick returns-- how far you go on the first date<br /> Downs-- attempt to get more yards (2 down and then you have to<br /> punt again) -- you get an extra down in the NFL Running the<br /> ball-- taking it a yard at a time Passing-- skipping stages /<br /> yards Fumble-- impotency Fumble recovery-- regain erection<br /> Interception-- going the other way (homosexuality) Turnover--<br /> anal sex Field Goal-- only one of you has orgasm (she fakes it)<br /> Touchdown-- mutual orgasm Extra point-- the smoke afterwards 2<br /> point conversion-- a smoke and a phone # High Scoring<br /> Game--multiple orgasms Rain delay-- Parents/ roomate comes back<br /> early </p>\n<p>Some important positions: Quarterback-- the most important<br /> placement (missionary position) Quarterback sneak-- unusual<br /> positions Hupper (center)-- doggie style Tight End--<br /> self-explanatory Wide Receiver-- opposite of a tight end Nose<br /> Tackle-- self-explanatory Running Back-- a hand off Defensive<br /> Line-- protection (all forms) Break in the defense-- condom<br /> breaks </p>\n<p>Penalties: Roughing--S &amp; M Holding-- rope burn or hand cuffs<br /> Offside-- premature ejactulation </p>\n<p>Other important terms: Pile up-- orgy Tackle-- kick in groin<br /> (stopped) Miss the FG-- wide right, wide left, or short 3rd down<br /> and inches-- call for yard stick (measurements) Superbowl--<br /> marriage Grey Cup-- live in (not full status) Fiesta Bowl-- Sex<br /> in South America </p>\n<p>The Plays: Play 1. There was on an on-side kick to what I<br /> thought was a wide receiver but it turned out to be a tight end,<br /> so there was a turnover. Play 2. The ball was kicked deep with<br /> no return. I ran the ball to mid-field but decided to go to the<br /> passing game. The passing play didn''t work because of a rain<br /> delay. When the game resumed, the next down was when the running<br /> back took it to the 10 yard line. With 1st and goal, the action<br /> moved from the Hupper to the Quarterback and then thre was a<br /> quarterback sneak. The game turned out to be the highest scoring<br /> Fiesta Bowl ever!! Play 3. I was tacked in the massive pile<br /> up... Play 4. It was 3rd down and inches on the 20 yard line but<br /> on the Field Goal attempt I was short. Play 5. I was kicked out<br /> of the pile up; I was holding and roughing.

There were three guys waiting to get into heaven, they were at<br /> the pearly gates and Saint Peter told them that to get into<br /> heaven, they had to answer one question, which was, " Have you<br /> been faithful to your wife?". The first man told him, that yes,<br /> he had been faithful and had never even thought about fooling<br /> around. Saint Peter, gave the man a cadillac and let him in the<br /> pearly gates. The second guy said, that yes he had been<br /> faithful, but he did think about fooling around a couple of<br /> times, Saint Peter gave him a bicycle and let him in the pearly<br /> gates. The third guy stepped up, and hanging his head down, said<br /> that he was unfaithful every chance he got, and was deeply sorry<br /> for it. Saint Peter gave him a skateboard and let him in the<br /> pearly gates.<br /> Then one day, the guy on the skateboard, saw the guy in the<br /> cadillac pulled over by a cloud and just crying his eyes out.<br /> The skateboarder asked him why he was crying, he got the<br /> cadillac and he shouldn''t have anything to cry about. The guy in<br /> the cadillac looked up and said, " I just saw my wife skateboard<br /> by"!;)
A jumbo-sized freshman went to try out for the football team. The coach asked him if he could tackle and he said, "Hell yah, get a load of this!"

He finally composed himself and said, "But can you pass a football?"The freshman stopped to think for a few seconds, then said, "Hell yah, if I can swallow it, I can surely pass it!"
A blonde was terribly overweight, so her doctor put her on a diet. "I<br /> want you to eat regularly for 2 days, then<br /> skip a day, and repeat this procedure for 2 weeks.

"I''ll tell you though, I thought I was going to drop<br /> dead that 3rd day."</p>\n<p>"From hunger, you mean?"</p>\n<p>"No, from skipping.

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you would have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee. (Hardly seems worth it!)If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb. (Now that''s more like it!)The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to squirt blood 30 feet.A pig''s orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life I want to be a pig!)Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour. (Still not over that pig thing!)Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure. (Is that why Flipper was always smiling?)On average people fear spiders more than they do death.The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue. (Hmmmmm.....)You can''t kill yourself by holding your breath.Americans on the average eat 18 acres of pizza everyday.Every time you lick a stamp, you''re consuming 1/10 of a calorie.You are more likely to be killed by a champagne cork than by a poisonous spider.Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people do. (If you''re ambidextrous do you split the difference?)In ancient Egypt, Priests plucked every hair from their bodies, including their eyebrows and eyelashes.A crocodile cannot stick its tongue out.The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30 times its own weight and always falls over on its right side when intoxicated. (From drinking little bottles of...?) (Did the gov''t pay for this research??)Polar bears are left handed. (Who knew....?, Who cares!)The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds. That makes the catfish #1 for the animal having the most taste buds.The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It''s like a human jumping the length of a football field.A cockroach will live nine days without it''s head, before it starves to death.

Osama bin Laden has a heart attack and dies. He immediately goes<br /> to hell, where the devil is waiting for him.<br /> "I don''t know what to do here," the devil says. "You''re on my<br /> list, but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to<br /> stay here, so I''ll tell you what I''m going to do: I''ve got a<br /> couple of people here who weren''t quite as bad as you. I''ll let<br /> one of them go, but you have to take their place. I''ll even let<br /> YOU decide who leaves." </p>\n<p>Osama thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil led him<br /> into the first room. </p>\n<p>In it was Manuel Noriega and a large pool of water. He kept<br /> diving in and surfacing empty-handed. Over and over and over.<br /> Such was his fate in hell. </p>\n<p>"No," bin Laden said, "I don''t think so. I''m not a good swimmer<br /> and I don''t think I could do that all day long." </p>\n<p>So the devil led him to the next room. In it was the Ayatollah<br /> Khomeini with a sledgehammer and a huge pile of rocks. All he<br /> did was swing that hammer, time after time after time. </p>\n<p>"No, I''ve got this problem with my shoulder. I''d be in constant<br /> agony if all I did was break rocks all day," bin Laden<br /> commented. </p>\n<p>So the devil opened a third door. In it, bin Laden saw Bill<br /> Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head<br /> and his legs staked in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was<br /> his girl Monica, doing what she does best. Osama bin Laden<br /> stared in disbelief and finally said, "Yeah, I can handle this." </p>\n<p>The devil smiled and said, "OK, Monica, you''re free to go."

A young girl wearing a short skirt was walking back home from school one day. On her way home, she saw an old man standing under a coconut tree.

She ran back home happily with the money that she got and went to tell her mother about it. �酶惟Mummy, Mummy! I got $2 today. �酶惟<br /> After the girl finished telling her mother about what happened earlier, her mother scolded her, �酶惟Why are you so stupid?!! That old man is a sex pervert! He just wants you to climb up that coconut tree so that he can peep at your panties!!! �酶惟 The girl told her mother, �酶惟Don�酶惟t worry Mummy. I won�酶惟t let him see my panties again.�酶惟<br /> The next day, on her way back from school, the little girl saw the same old man again, at the same coconut tree. The old man again, asked her to climb up the coconut tree to pluck a coconut for him and return, he will give her $2. The girl told him, �酶惟No! Mummy said that you are a sex pervert and I�酶惟m not going to help you this time.�酶惟 The old man paused, and then he said, �酶惟Hmm, how about $4?�酶惟 �酶惟Erm�酶惟No!�酶惟 replied the girl. Old man quickly offered her $6.<br /> �酶惟$6?�酶惟 She hesitated for a while before finally agreed to it. So she did the same thing like yesterday and went back home joyfully.<br /> Back home, she called out to her mother, �酶惟Mummy, Mummy! I got $6 today!�酶惟 When the girl told her mother about the old man again, she scolded her, �酶惟Didn�酶惟t I told you about that old pervert!? Why did you let him see your panties again?�酶惟 But the girl told her mum, �酶惟Don�酶惟t worry Mummy, he didn�酶惟t get to see my panties this time.�酶惟 Surprised, her mother asked her why and the girl said,<br /> �酶惟Because I didn�酶惟t wear any today.�酶惟

When asked how he received the injuries, the lad told police that he was simply trying to see how close he could get his head to a moving train before he was hit.</p>\n<p>A man walked into a Louisiana Circle-K, puts a $20 bill on the counter, and asked for change. When the clerk opened the cash drawer, the man pulled a gun and asked for all the cash in the register, which the clerk promptly provided. The man took the cash from the clerk and fled, leaving the $20 bill on the counter. The total amount of cash he got from the drawer? $15. (If someone points a gun at you and gives you money, was a crime committed?)</p>\n<p>A thief burst into a Florida bank one day wearing a ski mask and carrying a gun. Aiming his gun at the guard, the thief yelled, "FREEZE, MOTHER-STICKERS, THIS IS A FUCK-UP!" For a moment, everyone was silent. Then the snickers started. The guard completely lost it and doubled over laughing. It probably saved his life, because he''d been about to draw his gun. He couldn''t have drawn and fired before the thief got him. The thief ran away and is still at large. </p>\n<p>Seems this Arkansas guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that he''d just throw a cinderblock through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinderblock and heaved it over his head at the window. The cinderblock bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. Seems the liquor store window was made of Plexiglas. The whole event was caught on videotape.</p>\n<p>As a female shopper exited a New York convenience store, a man grabbed her purse and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately, and the woman was able to give them a detailed description of the snatcher. Within minutes, the police apprehended the snatcher. They put him in the car and drove back to the store. The thief was then taken out of the car and told to stand there for a positive ID. To which he replied, "Yes, officer, that''s her. That''s the lady I stole the purse from."</p>\n<p>The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan, at 5 a.m., flashed a gun, and demanded cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn''t open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren''t available for breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked away.</p>\n<p>Kentucky: Two men tried to pull the front off a cash machine by running a chain from the machine to the bumper of their pickup truck. Instead of pulling the front panel off the machine, though, they pulled the bumper off their truck. Scared, they left the scene and drove home.</p>\n<p>With the chain still attached to the machine. With their bumper still attached to the chain. With their vehicle''s license plate still attached to the bumper. They were quickly arrested.</p>\n<p>A 5-STAR STUPIDITY AWARD WINNER!<br /> When a man attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on a Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for. Police arrived at the scene to find an ill man curled up next to a motor home near spilled sewage. A police spokesman said that the man admitted to trying to steal gasoline and plugged his siphon hose into the motor home''s sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to press charges, saying that it was the best laugh he''d ever had.

A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first of the twosome Teed Off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole.<br /> Indeed, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in evident agony. </p>\n<p>The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize. She then explained that she was a physical therapist: "Please allow me to help. I''m a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you''d just allow me!" she told him earnestly. </p>\n<p>"Ummph, oooh, nnoo, I''ll be all right.... I''ll be fine in a few minutes," he replied breathlessly as he remained in a fetal position still clasping his hands together at his crotch. </p>\n<p>But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help. She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, loosened his pants and put her hands inside, beginning to massage him. </p>\n<p>"How does that feel?" she asked. "It feels great." He replied. "But my thumb still hurts like the dickens!".

''The Xmas-Files''by Frank Cammuso and Hart Seely  57 Elm Street Bethlehem, Pa. 11:51 p.m., December 24th.''We''re too late! It''s already been here.'' ''Mulder, I hope you know what you''re doing.'' ''Look, Scully, just like the other homes: Douglas fir, truncated, mounted, transformed into a shrine; halls decked with boughs of holly; stockings hung by the chimney, with care.'' ''You really think someone''s been here?'' ''Someone, or something.'' ''Mulder, over here--it''s a fruitcake.'' ''Don''t touch it! Those things can be lethal.'' ''It''s O.K. There''s a note attached: ''Gonna find out who''s naughty and nice.'''' ''It''s judging them, Scully. It''s making a list.'' ''Who? What are you talking about?'' ''Ancient mythology tells of an obese humanoid entity who could travel at  great speed in a craft powered by antlered servants. Once a year, near the winter solstice, this creature is said to descend from the heavens to reward its followers and punish disbelievers with jagged chunks of anthracite.'' ''But that''s legend, Mulder--a story told by parents to frighten children. Surely you don''t believe it?'' ''Something was here tonight, Scully. Check out the bite marks on this gingerbread man. Whatever tore through this plate of cookies was massive--and in a hurry.'' ''It left crumbs everywhere. And look, Mulder, this milk glass has been completely drained.'' ''It gorged itself, Scully. It fed without remorse.'' ''But why would they leave it milk and cookies?'' ''Appeasement. Tonight is the Eve, and nothing can stop its wilding.'' ''But if this thing does exist, how did it get in? The doors and windows were locked. There''s no sign of forced entry.'' ''Unless I miss my guess, it came through the fireplace.'' ''Wait a minute, Mulder. If you''re saying some huge creature landed on the roof and came down this chimney, you''re crazy. The flue is barely six inches wide. Nothing could get down there.'' ''But what if it could alter its shape, move in all directions at once?'' ''You mean, like a bowl full of jelly?'' ''Exactly. Scully, I''ve never told anyone this, but when I was a child my home was visited. I saw the creature. It had long white shanks of fur surrounding its ruddy, misshapen head. Its bloated torso was red and white. I''ll never forget the horror. I turned away, and when I looked back it had somehow taken on the facial features of my father.'' ''Impossible.'' ''I know what I saw. And that night it read my mind. It brought me a Mr. Potato Head, Scully. It knew that I wanted a Mr. Potato Head!'' ''I''m sorry, Mulder, but you''re asking me to disregard the laws of physics. You want me to believe in some supernatural being who soars across the skies and brings gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen to what you''re saying. Do you understand the repercussions? If this gets out, they''ll close the X-files.'' ''Scully, listen to me: It knows when you''re sleeping. It knows when you''re awake.'' ''But we have no proof.'' ''Last year, on this exact date, SETI radio telescopes detected bogeys in the airspace over twenty-seven states. The White House ordered a Condition Red.'' ''But that was a meteor shower.'' ''Officially. Two days ago, eight prized Scandinavian reindeer vanished from the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C. Nobody--not even the zookeeper--was told about it. The government doesn''t want people to know about Project Kringle. They fear that if this thing is proved to exist the public will stop spending half its annual income in a holiday shopping frenzy. Retail markets will collapse. Scully, they cannot let the world believe this creature lives. There''s too much at stake. They''ll do whatever it takes to insure another silent night.'' ''Mulder, I--'' ''Sh-h-h. Do you hear what I hear?'' ''On the roof. It sounds like ... a clatter.'' ''The truth is up there. Let''s see what''s the matter.''
DETROIT--With third-quarter sales sluggish and its share of the domestic<br /> market down 11 percent since 1993, General Motors unveiled a new instant-win<br /> airbag contest Monday. The new airbags, which award fabulous prizes upon<br /> violent, high-speed impact with another car or stationary object, will come<br /> standard in all of the company''s 1997 cars.</p>\n<p>    "Auto accidents have never been so exciting," said GM vice-president of<br /> marketing Roger Jenkins, who expects the contest to boost 1997 sales<br /> significantly. "When you play the new GM Instant Win Airbag Game, your next<br /> fatal collision could mean a trip for two to Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans. Or<br /> a year''s worth of free Mobil gasoline."</p>\n<p>    Though it does not officially begin until Jan. 1, 1997, the airbag<br /> promotion is already being tested in select cities, with feedback overwhelmingly<br /> positive. "As soon as my car started to skid out of control, I thought to<br /> myself, ''Oh, boy, this could be it--I could be a big winner!''" said Cincinnati''s<br /> Martin Frelks, who lost his wife but won $50 Sunday when the Buick LeSabre they<br /> were driving hit an oil slick at 60 mph and slammed into an oncoming truck.<br /> "When the car stopped rolling down the embankment, I knew Ellen was dead, but<br /> all I could think about was getting the blood and glass out of my eyes so I<br /> could read that airbag!"</p>\n<p>    Hartford, CT, resident Jonathan Ryerson was killed Sunday when his 1997<br /> Pontiac LeMans hit a freight train. Ryerson won $50 in the accident. "It''s<br /> really addictive," said Sacramento, CA, resident Marjorie Kamp, speaking from<br /> her hospital bed, where she is listed in critical condition with severe brain<br /> hemorrhaging and a punctured right lung. "I''ve already crashed four cars trying<br /> to win those Super Bowl tickets, but I still haven''t won. I swear, I''m going to<br /> win those tickets--even if it kills me!" </p>\n<p>    Kamp said that as soon as she is well enough, she plans to buy a new<br /> Pontiac Bonneville and drive it into a tree.  GM officials are not surprised the<br /> airbag contest has been so well received. "In the past, nobody really liked car<br /> wrecks, and that''s understandable. After all, they''re scary and dangerous and,<br /> sometimes, even fatal," GM CEO Paul Offerman said. "But now, when you drive a<br /> new GM car or truck, your next serious crash could mean serious cash. Who<br /> wouldn''t like that?" </p>\n<p>    Offerman added that in the event a motorist wins a prize but is killed,<br /> that prize will be awarded to the next of kin.   According to GM''s official<br /> contest rules, odds of winning the grand prize, a brand-new 1997 Cutlass<br /> Supreme, are 1 in 43,000,000. Statistical experts, however, say the real chances<br /> of winning are significantly worse. "If you factor in the odds of getting in a<br /> serious car accident in the first place--approximately 1 in 720,000--the actual<br /> odds of winning a prize each time you step in your car are more like 1 in 31<br /> trillion."  Further, even if one is in an accident, there is no guarantee the<br /> airbag will inflate. "I was recently broadsided by a drunk driver in my new<br /> Chevy Cavalier," said Erie, PA, resident Jerry Polaner. "My car was totaled, and<br /> because it was the side of my car that got hit, my airbag didn''t even inflate.<br /> But what really gets me is the fact that the drunk driver, who rammed my side<br /> with the front of his 1997 Buick Regal, won a $100 Office Depot gift<br /> certificate. That''s just wrong."
Martha Stewart vs Me...</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to prevent ice cream drips.<br /> My way: Just suck the ice cream out of the bottom of the cone, for Pete''s sake, you are probably lying on the couch with your feet up eating it anyway.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Use a meat baster to "squeeze" your pancake batter onto the hot griddle and you''ll get perfectly shape pancakes every time.<br /> My way: Buy the precooked kind you nuke in the microwave for 30 seconds. The hard part is getting them out of the plastic bag.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in thebag with the potatoes.<br /> My way: Buy Hungry Jack mashed potato mix and keep it in the pantry for up to a year.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: To prevent egg shells from cracking, add a pinch of salt to the water before hard boiling.<br /> My way: Who cares if they crack, aren''t you going to take the shells off anyway?</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: To get the most juice out of fresh lemons, bring them to room temperature and roll them under your palm against the kitchen counter before squeezing.<br /> My way: Sleep with the lemons in between the mattress and box springs.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: To easily remove burnt-on food from your skillet, simply add a drop or two of dish soap and enough water to cover bottom of pan, and bring to a boil on stovetop.<br /> My way: Eat at Chili''s every night and avoid cooking.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Spray your Tupperware with nonstick cooking spray before pouring in tomato based sauces and there won''t be any stains.<br /> My way: Feed your garbage disposal and there won''t be any leftovers.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: When a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking pan, use a bit of the dry cake mix instead and there won''t be any white mess on the outside of the cake.<br /> My way: Go to the bakery. They''ll even decorate it for you. </p>\n<p>Martha''s way: If you accidentally over salt a dish while it''s still cooking, drop in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess salt for an instant "fix me up"<br /> My way: If you over salt a dish while you are cooking, that''s too damn bad.<br /> My motto: I made it and you will eat it and I don''t care how bad it tastes.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Wrap celery in aluminum foil when putting in the refrigerator and it will keep for weeks.<br /> My way: Celery? Never heard of the stuff.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Brush some beaten egg white over pie crust before baking to yield a beautiful glossy finish.<br /> My way: The Mrs. Smith frozen pie directions do not include brushing egg whites over the crust and so I don''t do it.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Place a slice of apple inhardened brown sugar to soften it.<br /> My Way: Brown sugar is supposed to be "soft"?</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: When boiling corn on the cob, add a pinch of sugar to help bring out the corn''s natural sweetness.<br /> My Way: The only kind of corn I buy comes in a can.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: To determine whether an egg is fresh, immerse it in a pan of cool, salted water. If it sinks, it is fresh, but if it rises to the surface, throw it away.<br /> My way: Eat, cook, or use the egg anyway. If you feel bad later, you will know it wasn''t fresh.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your forehead. The throbbing will go away.<br /> My way: Martha, dear, the only reason this works is because you can''t rub a lime on your forehead without getting lime juice in your eye, and then the problem isn''t the headache anymore, it is because you are now blind.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Don''t throw out all that leftover wine. Freeze into ice cubes for future use in casseroles and sauces.<br /> My way: Leftover wine?</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: If you have a problem opening jars: Try using latex dishwashing gloves. They give a non slip grip that makes opening jars easy.<br /> My way: Go ask the very cute neighbor to do it.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Potatoes will take food stains off your fingers. Just slice and rub raw potato on the stains and rinse with water.<br /> My way: Mashed potatoes will now be replacing the anti-bacterial soap in the handy dispenser next to my sink.</p>\n<p>Martha''s way: Now look what you can do with Alka Seltzer.<br /> * Clean a toilet. Drop in two Alka-Seltzer tablets, wait twenty minutes, brush and flush. The citric acid and effervescent action clean vitreous china.<br /> * Clean a vase. To remove a stain from the bottom of a glass vase or cruet, fill with water and drop in two Alka-Seltzer tablets.<br /> * Polish jewelry. Drop two Alka-Seltzer tablets into a glass of water and immerse the jewelry for two minutes.<br /> * Clean a thermos bottle. Fill the bottle with water, drop in four Alka-Seltzer tablets, and let soak for an hour (or longer, if necessary).<br /> My way: Put your jewelry, vases, and thermos in the toilet. Add some Alka-Seltzer and you have solved a whole bunch of problems at once.

A young blonde was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana.</p>\n<p>She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking.</p>\n<p>After becoming very frustrated with the "no haggle" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, "Maybe I''ll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!"</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper said, "By all means, be my guest. Maybe you''ll luck out and catch yourself a big one!"</p>\n<p>Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.</p>\n<p>Later in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home, when he spotted the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand.</p>\n<p>Just then, he saw a huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She took aim, killed the creature, and with a great deal of effort hauled it on to the swamp bank.</p>\n<p>Lying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watched in amazement.</p>\n<p>Just then the blonde flipped the alligator on its back. Frustrated, she shouts out, "Damn it, this one isn''t wearing any shoes either!"</p>\n<p>Submitted by Curtis<br /> Edited by Yisman

For all you baseball fans...</p>\n<p>Warning: Explicit... </p>\n<p>Baseball''s Guide to Love </p>\n<p>Do you remember middle school/junior high/high school? If so, do you remember talking about ''the bases'' with your friends? "Yeah man, at the dance, X and Y went behind the gym and they got to second base!" Well that was cool and all, but what the hell was second base? Tongue kissing? Up the shirt? No one was really sure. </p>\n<p>Also, the bases tended to get progressively more intense as you got older. What''s a person to do? Here, we mourn the passing of using baseball ananlogies to describe sexual activity. But let''s face it, there are more than four stages in today''s day and age of sex play. So, in the interests of both bringing baseball sex metaphors in line with the complications of modern romance and with standardizing the bases, we present the "Standardized Guide to the Bases". </p>\n<p>First, let''s examine what the bases could have meant in the old days: </p>\n<p>-- First Base-- </p>\n<p>This was almost always kissing, although one guy I knew thought it meant holding hands. Sometimes it was tongue kissing and sometimes not. </p>\n<p>--Second Base-- </p>\n<p>Variously this meant tongue kissing, breast feeling, or outside the clothes genital contact. </p>\n<p>--Third Base-- </p>\n<p>Usually this was a hand down the pants of you or your partner. </p>\n<p>--Home Run-- </p>\n<p>This was ALWAYS sex, although it was rarely reached in the times when you had to refer to it in terms of bases. </p>\n<p>Well that system is ok, if you are a young teenager with a repressed sex drive. But what happens when you reach maturity and new factors enter the equation, such as oral sex? And what about the exact definitions? Well we have attempted to answer such puzzling questions and present without further ado... </p>\n<p>Standardized Guide to the Bases! </p>\n<p>--On Deck-- </p>\n<p>Having plans for a date </p>\n<p>--Strike-Out-- </p>\n<p>Duh!! </p>\n<p>--Walk-- </p>\n<p>Kissing </p>\n<p>--Bunt-- </p>\n<p>Masturbation </p>\n<p>--Single-- </p>\n<p>Tongue kissing </p>\n<p>--Double-- </p>\n<p>Breasts/chest touched, some clothes off, lots of grabbing and feels </p>\n<p>--Triple-- </p>\n<p>Most of the clothes off, genital contact, mutual masturbation </p>\n<p>--Inside the park home run-- </p>\n<p>Oral Sex </p>\n<p>--Home Run-- </p>\n<p>SEX! </p>\n<p>--Ground Rule Double-- </p>\n<p>would have sex, but no condom </p>\n<p>--Error-- </p>\n<p>condom breaks during sex </p>\n<p>--Banned for life for gambling-- </p>\n<p>sex without condom </p>\n<p>--Hall of Fame-- </p>\n<p>Marriage </p>\n<p>Now that we''ve got the basics, let''s introduce some terms to better explain all the things that can happen now a days. </p>\n<p>--Balk-- </p>\n<p>Premature ejaculation </p>\n<p>--Pine Tar-- </p>\n<p>KY kelly </p>\n<p>--Relief pitcher-- </p>\n<p>Vibrator </p>\n<p>--Rain Delay-- </p>\n<p>parents/roommate return home unexpectedly </p>\n<p>--Box Seats-- </p>\n<p>Waterbed </p>\n<p>--Seventh Inning Stretch-- </p>\n<p>Unusual positions </p>\n<p>--Rookie-- </p>\n<p>Virgin </p>\n<p>--Minor Leagues-- </p>\n<p>Under 18 </p>\n<p>--Loaded Bases-- </p>\n<p>manage a trois </p>\n<p>--Grand Slam-- </p>\n<p>Sex four times in twelve hours </p>\n<p>--Foul tip-- </p>\n<p>VD </p>\n<p>--Three up and three down-- </p>\n<p>impotency </p>\n<p>Now that we have the definitions, lets quickly contrast the old confusion with current clarity. </p>\n<p>OLD WAY- "We, um, got to third base I guess and then we, um, got like past third base, but not to home plate. I really like her. </p>\n<p>NEW WAY- First, there was a triple, then we got an inside the park home run, and I started thinking, it''s hall of fame time. </p>\n<p>NEW WAY- So there I was with the bases loaded and nobody out, when I balked during the seventh inning stretch and I had to call in a relief pitcher. </p>\n<p>Well, there you have it, I hope it has cleared up a lot of the confusion and helps you out.
A young man had seriously dated three girls and was finally faced<br /> with the dilemma of which to marry.

There is a dumb Blonde rowing a boat in the sand and just then a Blonde, who thinks she is smart, pulls up in her car next to the blonde and says, "You know, you are the type of dumb blonde who makes us smart blondes look dumb, and if I knew how to swim I would go out there and slap you in the face!"
There was a man, who walked into a small Chinatown shop to look around.<br /> He saw a golden rat, and asked the oriental behind the counter how much it<br /> cost.</p>\n<p>"Golden Rat, one hundred dollar.  Story behind Golden Rat three<br /> hundred dollar."</p>\n<p>The man decided just to buy the Golden Rat, so he pays<br /> for it and leaves.</p>\n<p>A rat that was in the shop follows him out, as does a<br /> rat in the alley outside.  Before he''s walked a street away, he''s being<br /> followed by ten rats, then a hundred, then a thousand.  The man starts to<br /> panic, and starts running away, while more and more rats follow him.  He<br /> ran right across the town, and got himself trapped by the sea.  He<br /> hesitated for a second, then dives off the wharf  and starts swimming.</p>\n<p>Looking back, he saw that the rats were still following him, but the<br /> second they hit the water, they turned to stone and sank.  About fifteen<br /> minutes later (well, it takes a while to kill ten thousand rats), the man<br /> swam back to shore, and walked back to the shop.</p>\n<p>When he walked in, the<br /> guy behind the counter said "Ahhhh.  You come back for story about Golden<br /> Rat."</p>\n<p>The man replied "No, I was just wondering if you have any Golden<br /> [ethnics]."

While sports fishing off the Florida coast, a tourist capsized his boat. He could swim, but his fear of alligators kept him clinging to the overturned craft. Spotting an old beachcomber standing on the shore, the tourist shouted, ''Are there any gators around here?'' ''Naw,'' the man hollered back, ''they ain''t been around for years!'' Feeling safe, the tourist started swimming leisurely toward the shore. About halfway there he asked the guy, ''How''d you get rid of the gators?'' ''We didn''t do nothin'','' the beachcomber said. ''Really?'' said the tourist. The beachcomber added, ''The sharks got ''em.''

A truck driver hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers stops for a<br /> beer. As he approaches the bar he sees a big sign on the door saying:</p>\n<p>"NERDS NOT ALLOWED -- ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK" He goes in and sits down.</p>\n<p>The bartender comes over to him, sniffs, says he smells kind of nerdy,<br /> asks him what he does for a living. The truck driver says he drives a<br /> truck, and the smell is just from the computers he is hauling. The<br /> bartender says OK, truck drivers are not nerds, and serves him a beer.</p>\n<p>As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in with tape around his<br /> glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils stashed<br /> in his pocket protector, and a belt at least a foot too long. The<br /> bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy<br /> away. The truck driver asks him why he did that. </p>\n<p>The bartender said not to worry, the nerds are overpopulating the Silicon<br /> Valley, and are in season now. You don''t even need a license, he said.</p>\n<p>So the truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads<br /> back onto the freeway. Suddenly he veers to avoid an accident, and the<br /> load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over<br /> the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, grabbing up<br /> the computers. They are all engineers, accountants and programmers wearing<br /> the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen. He can''t let them steal his whole<br /> load. So remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and<br /> starts blasting away, felling several of them instantly.</p>\n<p>A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car<br /> screaming at him to stop. The truck driver said, "What''s wrong? I thought<br /> nerds were in season." </p>\n<p>"Well, sure," said the patrolman, "But you can''t bait ''em."

There is a new virus going around, called ''work''. If you receive any sort of<br /> ''work'' at all, whether via email, internet or simply handed to you by a<br /> colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT. </p>\n<p>Work has been circulating around our building for months and those who have<br /> been tempted to open ''work'' or even look at ''work'' have found that their social<br /> life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly. </p>\n<p>If you do encounter ''work'' via email or are faced with any ''work'' at all, then<br /> to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words ''Sorry...I''m off<br /> to the pub''. The ''work'' should automatically be deleted from your brain. </p>\n<p>If you receive ''work'' in paper-document form, simply lift the document and<br /> drag the ''work'' to your garbage can. Put on your coat and skip to the nearest<br /> bar with two friends and order three pints of beer. </p>\n<p>After repeating this action 14 times, you will find that ''work'' will no longer<br /> be of any relevance to you. </p>\n<p>Send this message to everyone in your address book. If you do not have anyone<br /> in your address book, then I''m afraid the ''work'' virus has already corrupted<br /> your life.

A few years ago, I applied for a job at Kodak.  I made it through all the interviews with flying colours, and the only thing left was the drug test.  I was confident in passing, but there was one slight problem: I have *very* shy kidneys.  I''ve had to sneak out of the doctor''s office on more than one occasion, because I can''t "go" and fill up a cup on command.  Usually, this is a good thing, as I can go to a concert or football game, drink beer all day, and be fine until I get home, while my friends are standing in line in the bathrooms several times during the same time period.So, to prepare, on the morning I had to take the test, I drank my usual 10-cup pot of coffee, and several large glasses of water, and for the 20-minute trip to Kodak, I filled a plastic gallon jug with water, and finished it off on the way.   Now, Kodak has huge parking lots, each containg hundreds and hundreds of cars, and by the time I got there, the visitor''s lots were pretty full, and I had to park way in the back.As soon as I got out of my car, I''m thinking, "Good, it worked, I think I can go!"  By the time I''d finished the 10-minute walk to the entrance, I was thinking, "Boy, no problems now, I can *definitely* go!"To get in, I had to go past a security hut.  I told them why I was there, and they told me where to report, about another 10-minute walk, a little ways into the plant.  I had to pass building after building before I got to the right one, every step of the way, becoming actually painful, and before I was there, I was looking at bushes and doorways and the like, thinking, "Well, if it gets too bad, I could go there, or maybe there, or..."By the time I got to the right building, I was just about in agony. I found the right area, and the receptionist told me to take a seat with about 8 other people.  I sat down, thinking that would help, but 10 seconds later I was up, walking around, trying to read stuff on the wall, anything to keep my mind occuppied, but managing to read 5 or 10 words, and then having to pace again.Finally, I couldn''t take it anymore, and after having asked the girl a couple of times how long, I told her, "look, either you get me in *now*, or I use the bathroom over there, and we reschedule!!" She said she''d see what she could do, and left.  I went back to sit down, and it took all of 5 seconds before I was up pacing again. She came back a few minutes later, and told me to go on in.When I got to the actual room, there were 4 people standing in line.  I hopped up and down a couple of times, before I passed the others, went to the nurses, and told them I have to go **NOW**!!! They asked the others in line if anyone objected, and they said no, so they said as soon as one of the 2 bathrooms come free, I could go.  I snatched the cup out of his hand, and practically raced down the aisle to the bathrooms and just stood waiting.  It couldn''t have been more than 20 seconds or so, but they were some of the most agonizing seconds of my life!!Finally, one of the doors opened, and I nearly flattened some poor girl coming out in my rush to get in.  I closed the door, grabbed my pants, breathed in, and dropped them and then my underwear, and then the world caved in...  I started going.  And going.  And going. I could have knocked down the Berlin wall with the force!   But the problem was, that I couldn''t "grab" it!!  It was whipping around like one of those Water Wiggle things.  I''m trying like heck to reign it it in, but just couldn''t.  I''m dancing around in a circle, with my pants around my ankles, trying to grab it, and it was just about impossible for probably a good 15 seconds.  Finally, I did, and was able to aim in the toilet, just remembering at the end to put a shot or two in the cup to put on the little shelf.   By the time I''d stopped, I was physically spent, and just leaned up against the wall, feeling like I''d just run a marathon...It was then that was able to survey the bathroom.  It was a room, about 7x7, but my god...  I had finished the most intense pee of my life in the john, but before I''d gained control, I''d soaked the entire toilet, the sink, the floor, the walls.  You name it, it was drenched -- including my pants and underwear.  I tried soaking it up with toilet paper (using the whole roll as a sponge), but that was drenched and didn''t work that well.  I''d also soaked the extra rolls on the back of the toilet, the paper towel holder, and the extra roll of paper towels.  I went through the garbage, pulling out half-soaked old towels, just trying to make the place semi-presentable, as in the sink and the mirror, but it didn''t do much good.  I was just ending up pushing the wet around, so I finally gave up.Steeling myself, I pulled up my wet underwear, then my wet pants, and pulled down my semi-wet shirt as much as possible, and went out. I whipped back up the aisle, thanking the nurse, without slowing down, and out the door as fast as my legs would carry me, imagining what the next person to use that bathroom would encounter. The silver lining:  I got the job!!
A married man and his secretary were having a torrid affair. One afternoon they couldn''t contain their passion, so they rushed over to her place where they spent the afternoon making passionate love. When they were finished, they fell asleep, not waking until 8 o''clock. They got dressed quickly. Then the man asked his secretary to take his shoes outside and rub them on the lawn. Bewildered, she did as he asked thinking him pretty weird.</p>\n<p>The man finally got home and his wife met him at the door. Upset, she asked where he''d been. The man replied, "I can not tell a lie. My secretary and I are having an affair. Today we left work early, went to her place, spent the afternoon making love, and then fell asleep. That''s why I''m late."</p>\n<p>The wife looked at him, took notice of his shoes and yelled, "I can see those are grass stains on your shoes. YOU DAMN LIAR! You''ve been playing golf again, haven''t you?"

Veteran Pillsbury spokesman Pop N. Fresh died yesterday of a severe yeast<br /> infection. He was 71. Known to friends as Brown-n-Serve, Fresh was an avid<br /> gardener and tennis player. Fresh was buried in one of the largest funeral<br /> ceremonies in recent years. Dozens of celebrities turned out including Mrs.<br /> Butter worth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Aunt Jemima, Betty Crocker,<br /> the Hostess Twinkies, and Skippy. The graveside was piled high with flours as<br /> longtime friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing fresh as a man who<br /> "never knew how much he was kneaded."</p>\n<p>Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with many<br /> turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough<br /> on half-baked schemes -- conned by those who puttered him up. Still, even as a<br /> crusty old man, he was a roll model for millions. His second wife survives<br /> fresh. They have two children and another bun in the oven. The funeral was held<br /> at 350 for about 20 minutes.

A policeman interrogates three blondes who are training to become detectives.</p>\n<p>To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first blonde a picture for five seconds and then hides it. "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"</p>\n<p>The first blonde answers, "That''s easy, we''ll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"</p>\n<p>The policeman says, "Well, uh, thats because the picture shows his profile."</p>\n<p>Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for five seconds at the second blonde and asks her, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"</p>\n<p>The second blonde giggles, flips her hair and says, "Ha! He''d be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"</p>\n<p>The policeman angrily responds, "What''s the matter with you two?! Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it''s a picture of his profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?"</p>\n<p>Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third blonde and in a very testy voice asks, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?" He quickly adds, "Think hard before giving me a stupid answer."</p>\n<p>The blonde looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, "Hmm,  the suspect wears contact lenses."</p>\n<p>The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn''t know if the suspect wears contacts or not. "Well, that''s an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file."</p>\n<p>He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspects file in his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face. "Wow! I cant believe it. It''s true! The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?"</p>\n<p>"That''s easy," the blonde replied. "He can''t wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear."</p>\n<p>Submitted by Calamjo<br /> Edited by Curtis

Naturally, the doctor asks him what happened. </p>\n<p>"Well, I was having a quiet round of golf with my wife when she sliced her<br /> ball into a pasture of cows. We went to look for it and while I was rooting<br /> around I noticed one of the cows had something white at its rear end. I walked<br /> over and lifted up the tail and sure enough, there was my wife''s golf ball...<br /> stuck right in the middle of the cow''s butt. "That''s when I made my mistake." </p>\n<p>"What did you do?" asks the doctor. </p>\n<p>"Well, I lifted the tail and yelled to my wife, Hey, this looks like yours!"
A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier.</p>\n<p>He said to the female whale, ''Let''s both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time. It should cause the ship to turn over and sink.''</p>\n<p>They tried it, and sure enough the ship turned over and quickly sank. </p>\n<p>Soon, however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of the shore. </p>\n<p>The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female,<br /> ''Let''s swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore.''</p>\n<p>At this point he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. </p>\n<p>''Look,'' she said. ''I went along with the blowjob, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.''

A lady goes to the doctor to see about getting a facelift. "Well," says the doctor, "I can do the facelift, and then you''ll have to come back in six months for a follow-up."<br /> "Oh, no." the woman replies. "I want it all done in one shot. I don''t wan to have to come back."<br /> The doctor thinks for a second, then offers, "There is a new procedure where we put a screw in the top of your head. Then anytime you see wrinkles appearing, you just give it a little turn, which pulls the skin up, and they disappear."<br /> "That''s what I want!" exclaims the lady. "Let''s do that."<br /> Six months later the lady charges into the doctor''s office. "Well, how''s the procedure holding up?" the doctor asks.<br /> "Terrible!" the lady bellows. "It''s the worst mistake I''ve ever made."<br /> "What''s wrong?" asks the doctor.<br /> "Just look at these bags under my eyes!" she hollers.<br /> "Lady," the doctor retorts, "those aren''t bags, those are your breasts. And if you don''t leave that screw alone, you''re going to have a beard!"

Once the club duffer challenged the local golf pro to a match, with a $100 bet on the side. "But," said the duffer, "since you''re obviously much better than I, to even it a bit you have to spot me two ''gotchas''." </p>\n<p>The golf pro didn''t know what a ''gotcha'' was, but he went along with it. And off they went. Coming back to the 19th hole, the rest of the club members were amazed to see the golf pro paying the duffer $100. </p>\n<p>"What happened?" asked one of the members. </p>\n<p>"Well," said the pro, "I was teeing up for the first hole, and as I brought the club down, the jerk stuck his hand between my legs and grabbed my balls while yelling ''Gotcha!'' Have you ever tried to play 18 holes of golf waiting for the second ''gotcha''?"

3 guys die in a car accident, as they are going into heaven, a saint stops  them and says to the first man,"were you a faithful husband?"he replies "yes, I never strayed from my wife, I barely even looked at other  women"the saint replies, "very good, you can drive this brand new sports car!" he  then turns to the next guy and says,"were you a faithful husband?"the second man replies "well, to be honest, I DID cheat once, but I came  clean and stayed on the right path and my wife forgave me and we lived  happily afterwards."the saint then says, "very good, you can drive this 1993  sports car"  he  then turns to the third and asks,"were you a faithful husband?"the third man says, "no, I slept around, never came clean, when I was  caught, I wouldn''t fess up and my wife hated me"the saint replies "well, that''s not very good, however, you were a good man  besides that, you can drive around this 1983 compact" A few days later, the second and third man were cruising around in the  second mans older sports car and they saw their friends nice new sports car  parked outside a bar so they pull in.  There they see their friend with his  face in his hands crying, surrounded in beer bottles, so they walk up to  him."hey, how ya doin''? why are you crying?""I saw my wife today" he replies"hey, that''s great! did you say hello?" the other two men inquired.the first man replies, "no, that''s the problem, I couldn''t follow her onto  the bicycle path with my car" -- Goodguy
There was this guy who bought an elderly circus elephant. Alas, he couldn''t afford to feed it. He''d never seen an elephant jump with all 4 feet off the ground. So he started a contest: entry was $10, and the first person to get the elephant to jump with all 4 feet off the ground would get $50,<br /> 000.</p>\n<p>All sorts of people tried, but nobody could get the elephant to jump. Finally, this little guy arrives in a limousine. He''s carrying a baseball bat. He walks up to the elephant, swings the bat, and crunches the elephants balls pretty badly. Needless to say, the elephant jumps, and the owner pays out the $50,<br /> 000. Unfortunately, the owner had barely collected enough to cover the prize, so he ran another contest.</p>\n<p>He''d never seen an elephant swing its head back and forth as if to say, "no." Same deal as before: $10 per entry, $50,000 prize. Lots of people try and fail. Then the little guy shows up in his limousine again, pulls out his bat, and walks up to the elephant. He says, "Remember me?" The elephant nods yes.</p>\n<p>The man then holds up his bat and says, "Want me to use this again?" The elephant nods his head rather emphatically no....

There were three guys traveling in Africa, a Frenchman, Japanese, and an<br /> American. They are captured by a tribe of fierce headhunters. The witch doctor<br /> says to them, "we are going to slaughter you, but you might take some comfort in<br /> the fact that we don''t believe in waste here and that therefore every part of<br /> your body will go to some use. We will weave baskets out of your hair, we will<br /> render your bones for glue, and we will tan your skin and stretch it over wooden<br /> frames for canoes. Now we are going to allow you an honorable death, so I will<br /> give you each a knife and allow you to say some last words before killing<br /> yourselves."<br /> The Japanese guy yells "banzai!" and commits hari-kari.<br /> The French guy yells "vive la France!" and slits his throat.<br /> then the American guy takes the knife, pokes holes all over his body, and<br /> yells, "there''s your f****** canoe!"

There are two sperm and they''re swimming and swimming and swimming for what seems like forever. They''re starting to get tired and one sperm says to the other, "Do you think we should pull over and ask for directions?"The other sperm replies, "Naaaahhhhh, we can find it." So, they keep swimming. Finally, they see another sperm, who''s looks almost dead, and decide to stop and ask for directions. They ask, "Do you think you can help us get to where we are going?" The almost dead sperm says, "I''ll try, where ya going?"The two sperms reply, "Well, we''re trying to find the fallopian tubes so that we can try and fertilise the egg."The almost dead sperm just starts laughing. The other two sperms look at one another, somewhat confused, and ask, "What''s so funny?"The almost dead sperm finally regains his composure and replies, "Well, you guys have a long way to go...... you''re still in the oesophagus."

Three guys were at a football game. It just so happens that they<br /> were all diehard football fans. They finally found a seat good<br /> enough for them. But there was just one problem with the so<br /> called "perfect seats." Three nuns were in front of them<br /> blocking their veiw.</p>\n<p>The guys wanted them to move so one said, loud enough for the<br /> nuns to hear, "Hey I think I''ll move to Idaho. There are only<br /> 100 Catholics there."</p>\n<p>The second one said, "No I''m gonna move to Montana. There are<br /> only 50 Catholics living there."</p>\n<p>Then the third guy said, "You two are both wrong. We should move<br /> to Wisconsin. There are only 25 Catholics there."</p>\n<p>Then one of the nuns turns around and said, "Hey why don''t you<br /> go to hell... there aren''t any Catholics there!"

In downtown Roanoke, at a crowded bus stop, a good friend of mine was waiting for her bus. She''s very attractive and was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt  with matching tight leather boots and jacket. As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.</p>\n<p>Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again she tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover she still couldn''t!</p>\n<p>So, a little more embarrassed she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, much to her chagrin she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.</p>\n<p>So, with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.</p>\n<p>About this time a big burly man that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned to the would-be hero screeching at him "How dare you touch me!! I don''t even know who you are!"</p>\n<p>At this, the big guy drawled, "Well ma''am normally I would agree with you but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we were friends!"

"Oh no," says Dave. "He''s on my bowling team."</p>\n<p>When they are seated, a waitress asks Dave if he''d like his usual Budweiser. His wife is becoming uncomfortable and says, "You must come here a lot for that woman to know you drink Budweiser".</p>\n<p>"No, honey, she''s in the Ladies Bowling League. We share lanes with them."</p>\n<p>A stripper comes over to their table and throws her arms around Dave. "Hi Davey," she says, "Want your usual table dance?"</p>\n<p>Dave''s wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club. Dave follows and spots her getting into a cab. </p>\n<p>Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her and she starts screaming at him. The cabby turns his head and says, "Looks like you picked up a real bitch tonight, Dave."

Mike Tyson was terribly overweight, so his doctor put him on a diet. "I want<br /> you to eat regularly for two days, then skip a day, and repeat this procedure<br /> for two weeks. The next time I see you, you will have lost at least five<br /> pounds."<br /> When Mike Tyson returned, he shocked the doctor by losing nearly<br /> twenty pounds. "Why, that''s amazing!" the doctor said. "Did you follow my<br /> instructions?"<br /> Mike Tyson nodded and said, "I''ll tell you though, Doc, I<br /> thought I was going to drop dead that third day."<br /> "From hunger, you mean?" asked the doctor. To which Tyson answered, "No, Doc,<br /> from skipping."

But one more wife and I''ll open a golf course!"

What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>1 - "What are you thinking?"</p>\n<p>The proper answer to this question, of course is, "I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you." Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things:</p>\n<p>a -  Baseball b -  Football c -  How fat you are d -  How much prettier she is than you e -  How he would spend the insurance money if you died</p>\n<p>According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. "If I wanted you to know," Al said, "I''d be talking instead of thinking."</p>\n<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers:</p>\n<p>2 - "Do you love me?"</p>\n<p>The correct answer to this question is, "Yes." For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, "Yes, dear." Wrong answers include:</p>\n<p>a - I suppose so. b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes? c - That depends on what you mean by "love". d - Does it matter? e - Who, me?</p>\n<p>3 - "Do I look fat?"</p>\n<p>The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, "No, of course not" and then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include:</p>\n<p>a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either. b - Compared to what? c - A little extra weight looks good on you. d - I''ve seen fatter. e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she''s prettier than me?"</p>\n<p>The "she" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, "No, you are much prettier." Wrong answers include:</p>\n<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things. c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality. d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner. e - Could you repeat the question?  I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?"</p>\n<p>Correct answer: "Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino''s Pizza truck that came my way." This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid exchange:</p>\n<p>"Dear," said the wife. "What would you do if I died?" "Why, dear, I would be extremely upset," said the husband."Why do you ask such a question?" "Would you remarry?" persevered the wife. "No, of course not, dear" said the husband. "Don''t you like being married?" said the wife. "Of course I do, dear" he said. "Then why wouldn''t you remarry?" "Alright," said the husband, "I''d remarry." "You would?" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. "Yes" said the husband. "Would you sleep with her in our bed?" said the wife after a long pause. "Well yes, I suppose I would." replied the husband. "I see," said the wife indignantly. "And would you let her wear my old clothes? "I suppose, if she wanted to" said the husband. "Really," said the wife icily. "And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?" "Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do." "Is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet.

In a small southern town there was a "Nativity Scene" that showed great<br /> skill and talent had gone into creating it. One small feature bothered me.<br /> The three wise men were wearing fireman''s helmets.</p>\n<p>Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation, I left.</p>\n<p>At a "Quick Stop" on the edge of town, I asked the lady behind the counter<br /> about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling at me. "You Yankees<br /> never do read The Bible!" </p>\n<p>I assured her that I did, but simply couldn''t recall anything about<br /> firemen in The Bible.

Murphy''s Laws Of Law Enforcement</p>\n<p>1. Bullet Proof vests aren''t. </p>\n<p>2. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.  They also punch, kick and<br /> choke harder too. </p>\n<p>3. The speed at which you respond to a fight call is inversely proportional to how long you''ve been a cop. </p>\n<p>4. Tear gas works on cops too, and regardless of wind direction, will always blow back in your face. </p>\n<p>5. High speed chases will always proceed from an area of light traffic to an area of extremely heavy traffic. </p>\n<p>6. If you know someone who tortures animals and wets the bed, he is either a serial killer or he works for Internal Affairs. </p>\n<p>7. Placing a gun back in a shoulder holster with your finger on the trigger will cause you to walk with a limp. </p>\n<p>8. Flash hiders don''t really. </p>\n<p>9. If you have cleared all the rooms and met no resistance, you and your entry team have probably kicked in the door of the wrong house.</p>\n<p>10. If a cop swings a baton in a fight, he will hit other cops more often than he will hit the bad guys he swings at. </p>\n<p>11. Domestic arguments will always migrate from an area of few available weapons (living room), to an area with many available weapons (kitchen). </p>\n<p>12. If you have just punched out a handcuffed prisoner for spitting at you, you are about to become a star on Eyewitness News.</p>\n<p>13. Bullets work on veteran cops too.  They also work on weight lifters, martial arts experts, department marksmen, Vice cops, S.W.A.T. jocks, and others who consider themselves immortal. </p>\n<p>14. When a civilian sees a blue light approaching at a high rate of speed,<br /> he will always pull into the lane the cop needs to use. </p>\n<p>15. If you drive your patrol car to the geometric center of the Gobi Desert, within five minutes a dumb-ass civilian will pull along side you and ask for directions. </p>\n<p>16. You can never drive slow enough to please the citizens who don''t need a cop, and you can never drive fast enough to please the ones who do. </p>\n<p>17. Any suspect with a rifle is a better shot than any cop with a pistol. </p>\n<p>18. From behind you, the bad guys can see your night sights as well as you<br /> can. </p>\n<p>19. On any call, there will always be more bad guys than there are good guys, and the farther away your back-up, the more there will be.</p>\n<p>20. The longer you''ve been a cop, the shorter your flashlight and your temper gets. </p>\n<p>21. Whatever you are about to do, if there is a good chance it will get you killed, you probably shouldn''t do it. </p>\n<p>22. You should never do a shotgun search of a dark warehouse with a cop whose nickname is "Boomer". </p>\n<p>23. The better you do your job, the more likely you are to be shot, injured, complained on, sued, investigated, or subpoenaed on your day off. </p>\n<p>24. If a large group of drunk bikers is "holed-up" in a house, the Department will send one officer in a beat car.  If there is one biker "holed-up" in a house, they will send the entire S.W.A.T. Team.
A Texas business man, while in Japan for some business meetings and a few rounds of golf, arrived in Tokyo a day earlier than expected. Feeling lonely that evening, he employed the services of a beautiful young Japanese girl to be his companion for the evening. Although the Japanese girl spoke very little English and the businessman spoke no Japanese, their passion roared and in the heat of the moment she began yelling "Gama Su!, Gama Su!". Hearing this, the Texan knew he had pleased his female Japanese friend and soon afterwards went to sleep.<br /> The next day while playing golf with his Japanese business colleagues, one of his Japanese partners holed his shot from 170 yards away! Everyone went crazy and began yelling excitedly in Japanese. Wanting to impress his friends, the Texan joined in and began yelling, "Gama Su! Gama Su!" </p>\n<p>Suddenly everyone became quiet. After a moment of silence, one of the Japanese turned to him and asked "Wrong hole? What do you mean wrong hole?"
Sid and Barney head out for a quick round of golf. Since they are short on time, they decide to play only 9 holes. Sid offers Barney, "let''s say we make the time worth the while, at least for one of us, and spot $5 on the lowest score for the day." Barney agrees and they enjoy a great game. After the 8th hole, Barney is ahead by 1 stroke, but cuts his ball into the rough on the 9th. </p>\n<p>"Help me find my ball, you look over there," he says to Sid. After 5 minutes, neither has had any luck, and since a lost ball carries a four-point penalty, Barney pulls a ball from his pocket and tosses it to the ground. "I''ve found my ball!" he announces triumphantly. </p>\n<p>Sid looks at him forlornly, "After all the years we''ve been friends, you''d cheat me on golf for a measly five bucks?!?" </p>\n<p>"What do you mean cheat? I found my ball sitting right here!" </p>\n<p>"And a liar, too!!!" Sid says with amazement.<br /> "I''ll have you know I''ve been standing on your ball for the last five minutes!"
Con una escasa educaci�酶惟n y sin ning�酶惟n entrenamiento, al �酶惟nico puesto que Andr�酶惟s pudo aspirar fue de operador en la l�酶惟nea de producci�酶惟n de una nueva f�酶惟brica japonesa que se instal�酶惟 en la regi�酶惟n.

There was once a famous explorer who would travel around the<br /> world videotaping exotic things from around the world. One day,<br /> he decided that he would make a videotape of all the world''s<br /> dances. So, he and his film crews spent 5 years roaming around<br /> the world taping any exotic dance they could come across. They<br /> ended up in Australia after videotaping the last dance they had<br /> ever heard of. Suddenly, an old lady comes up to them and says<br /> "Have you gotten the Butcher dance?"</p>\n<p>The explorers did not know what the Butcher dance was, so they<br /> asked the old lady.</p>\n<p>"Well, there''s a very secretive tribe of Aborigines in the<br /> outback that only do this dance called the Butcher dance once a<br /> year. No human outside of their tribe has ever seen it."</p>\n<p>This excited the explorers greatly. "Do you know where we can<br /> find this tribe?"</p>\n<p>The lady replied "Yes I do, and if you leave tomorrow, you<br /> should just make it in time. First, you need to travel 2 hours<br /> west into the outback, then 5 hours north. You will come to a<br /> mountain range. You must leave your vehicles at the range. Then,<br /> you climb over the mountain range, which is very treacherous.<br /> Then, you will need to ford a river at the bottom of the<br /> mountains. There should be a tribe of aborigines on the other<br /> side that will guide you to the next tribe for something<br /> valuable in return. They will lead you to a cliff on a plateau.<br /> You must scale down the cliff, and then it is an hour walk<br /> across a desert to a group of small hills, and over those hills<br /> will be the aborigines with the dance you seek."</p>\n<p>Well, the explorer knows that he must get this dance to complete<br /> his taping. So, he and his crew set off. 2 hours west, and then<br /> after 4 hours north, their cars break down, so they''re forced to<br /> walk the remaining distance with all their equipment across the<br /> hot landscape. When they finally come to the mountains, 2 of the<br /> group lose their footing and fall to their deaths. They finally<br /> make it over the mountains, but the river has been engorged with<br /> a flood. 1 crewman drowns while he tries to swim across, so the<br /> remaining people are forced to build makeshift rafts. However,<br /> the rafts start to sink, and half of their camera equipment is<br /> lost. They come to the group of aborigines who will guide them<br /> to the next group, and offer them money. They refuse, and the<br /> explorers offer them some of their cameras. The aborigines<br /> refuse that, as well. So, the famous explorer makes his<br /> sacrifice, and offers the only female member of his crew, which<br /> they accept. They are given a guide who leads them to the cliff.<br /> One of the crewmen gets vertigo, and accidentally falls off the<br /> cliff tom his death. The explorer and his one remaining crewman<br /> set off across the desert, and his crewman drops because of heat<br /> stroke. So, the explorer picks up a small camera, and drags his<br /> ragged self across the desert, up the hills, and he can hear<br /> drums!</p>\n<p>He pulls himself up the top of the hill, and the drums stop. He<br /> stumbles down to the village elder, and once they have found a<br /> translator, proceeds to ask him when the Butcher dance will take<br /> place.</p>\n<p>"I''m very sorry, but we have just finished with our Butcher<br /> dance." "Well, can''t you please do it again, for me? It''s very<br /> important! You don''t know what we''ve been through!" "We cannot<br /> do that. It would anger our gods, and we need them to watch over<br /> our livestock and our crops and our water.</p>\n<p>So, the explorer heads back to where he started from, and<br /> finally makes it back and resolves to try again next year. So he<br /> spends the year renting out a house in Australia and gathering<br /> everything he''ll need. He gets mountain climbing gear, an<br /> inflatable raft, blow-up dolls, and a car repair kit. He takes<br /> all the precautions, and with a new crew, sets off. </p>\n<p>When they arrive at the mountains, one of his crew notices a<br /> path in the mountains that wasn''t apparent, so they drive<br /> through, and make it to the river, which has dried up. They<br /> cross the dried-up riverbed, and the aborigines have moved away<br /> because of a lack of water. So, they carry on from the memory of<br /> their leader. Midway through the desert, however, one car hits a<br /> rock and tips, and the other car couldn''t turn in time, and<br /> there''s a horrible accident. By sheer willpower, the explorer<br /> climbs bloodied and beaten from the wreckage, finds one camera<br /> that still works, and stumbles on into the village. He is<br /> immediately recognized by the elder.</p>\n<p>"Oh, you! You have come just in time to see the Butcher dance!<br /> We will delay it for a little bit so that you can be healed of<br /> your wounds!" "No, I don''t want to waste that time. I''ll be<br /> fine. Just start the Butcher dance!"</p>\n<p>This is the time he''s been waiting for two years. Finally, his 7<br /> year work will be complete. He fires up his camera and watches<br /> the dancers as they come out. They form a circle, and start to<br /> sing:</p>\n<p>"You butcher right hand in, you butcher right hand out..."

By Barbara Florio GrahamFrom McCall''s, June, 1983I read every diet I can get my hands on.  I even follow their suggestions.  But eventually, inevitably, I always get fat again.  Now, at last, I''ve found The Answer.  After living for almost 14 years with a man who never gains an ounce no matter what I serve him, I''ve found out what it is that keeps him thin: He thinks differently.  The real difference between fat and thin people is that thin people:avoid eating popcorn in the movies because it gets their hands greasy;split a large combination pizza with three friends;think Oreo cookies are for kids;nibble cashews one at a time;think that doughnuts are indigestible;read books they have to hold with both hands;become so absorbed in a weekend project they forget to have lunch;fill the candy dish on their desks with paper clips;counteract the midafternoon slump with a nap instead of a cinnamon Danish;exchange the deep-fryer they received for Christmas for a clock-radio;lose their appetites when they''re depressed;think chocolate Easter bunnies are for kids;save leftovers that are too skimpy to use for another meal in order to make interesting soups;throw out stale potato chips;will eat only Swiss or Dutch chocolate, which cannot be found except in a special store;think it''s too much trouble to stop at a special store just to buy chocolate;don''t celebrate with a hot-fudge sundae every time they lose a pound;warm up after skiing with black coffee instead of hot chocolate and whipped cream;try all the salads at the buffet, leaving room for only one dessert;find iced tea more refreshing than an ice-cream soda;get into such interesting conversations at cocktail parties that they never quite work their way over to the hors-d''oeuvre table;have no compulsion to keep the candy dish symmetrical by reducing the jelly beans to an equal number of each color;think that topping brownies with ice cream makes too rich a dessert;bring four cookies into the TV room instead of a box;think banana splits are for kids.</p>\n<p>Joke found on http://www.ahajokes.com
When Apollo Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, he not only said his famous "One Small Step for Man, One Giant Leap for Mankind" statement, but followed it by several remarks - usual  communication traffic between him, the other astronauts and Mission Control. Before  he re-entered the lander, he made the enigmatic remark "Good luck, Mr. Gorsky."</p>\n<p>Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut; however, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian nor American space programs. Over the years, many people have questioned him as to what the  "Good luck, Mr. Gorsky" statement meant.</p>\n<p>On July 5, in Tampa Bay, FL, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26 year old question to Armstrong. He finally responded.</p>\n<p>It seems that Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Armstrong felt he could answer the question: "When I was a kid, I was playing baseball with my brother in the backyard. He had hit a fly ball which landed in front of my neighbors'' bedroom window. The neighbors were Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky.  As I leaned down to pick up the ball, I heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, "Oral sex? Oral sex you want? You''ll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!"</p>\n<p>True fact.
an eldery couple is enjoying an aniversary dinner together in a small tavern, The husband leans over and asks his wife. Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind this tavern where you leaned against the fence and i made love to you."Yes she says : I remember it well"Ok he says " how about taking a stroll a round there again and we can do it for old times sake" Oooooooh Henry, You Devil, that sounds like a good idea she answers.There''s a police officer sitting in the next booth listening to all this and having a chuckle to himself. he thinks,"I''ve got to see this: two old-timers having sex against a fence ,Ill just keep an eye on them so there''s no trouble. He follows them.They walk haltingly along, leaning on each other for support, aided by walking sticks, Finally they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence.The old lady lifts her skirt, takes her knickers down and the old man  drops his trousers, she turns around and as she hangs on to the fence, the old man moves in, Suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the watching policeman has ever seen,They are bucking and jumping like eighteen-year olds.  this goes on for about forty minutes''She''s yelling "Ohhhh,God" he''s hanging on to her hips for dear life. This is the most athletic sex imaginable,Finally, the both collapse panting on the ground.The policeman is amazed, He thinks he has leaned somthing about life that he diden''t know.After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on,The policeman, still watching thinks, " That was truly amazing, he was going like a train.I''ve got to ask him what his secret is."As the couple pass, he says to them, " That was somthing else, you must have been having sex for about forty minutes. How do you manage it? You must have had a fantastic life together, Is there some sort of secret?" No , there''s no secret " the old man says," fifty years ago that damn fence wasn''t electric."

One day Bobby and Joey were having a catch by the river. Bobby threw the ball and it went over Joey''s head and down by the river. Joey said "I''ll go  get it." After five minutes Joey did not return so Bobby went after him. Bobby found him hiding behind a large rock by the river. Bobby said, "What  are you doing down here?" Joey said "Shhh! Look in the river." Bobby looked  to find a young woman skinny-dipping in the river. They sat there watching  for about 15 seconds and Bobby ran away. Joey went after him and, after he  caught him, said "What the hell are you doing! We were just watching a NAKED  woman swimming! Why did you run away?" And Bobby said "Well, my mom said that  if I look at a naked woman I will turn to stone and I felt something get  hard!"

After five minutes Joey did not return so Bobby went after him. Bobby found him hiding behind a large rock by the river. Bobby said, "What  are you doing down here?" Joey said "Shhh! Look in the river." Bobby looked  to find a young woman skinny-dipping in the river. They sat there watching  for about 15 seconds and Bobby ran away. Joey went after him and, after he  caught him, said "What the hell are you doing! We were just watching a NAKED  woman swimming! Why did you run away?" And Bobby said "Well, my mom said that  if I look at a naked woman I will turn to stone and I felt something get  hard!"
A general store owner hires a young female clerk with a penchant for very short skirts. One day a young man enters the store, glances at the clerk, and glances at the loaves of bread behind the counter. ''I`d like some raisin bread, please,'' the man says politely.The clerk nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, located on the very top shelf. The man, standing almost directly beneath her, is provided with an excellent view.As the clerk retrieves the bread, a small group of male customers gather around the young man, looking in the same direction. Pretty soon each person is asking for raisin bread, just to see the clerk climb up and down.After a few trips the clerk is tired and irritated. She stops and fumes at the top of the ladder, glaring at the men standing below. She notices an elderly man standing amongst the throng. ''Is yours raisin too?'' the clerk yells testily.''No,'' croaks the feeble old man....''But it''s startin'' to twitch.''Bonus Joke: If a case of the clap spreads, is it called applause?
One day while on patrol, a police officer pulled over a car for speeding. </p>\n<p>He went up to the car and asked the driver to roll down her window. </p>\n<p>The first thing he noticed, besides the nice red sports car, was how hot the driver was! Blue eyes, blonde, the works. </p>\n<p>"I''ve pulled you over for speeding, Ma''am. Could I see your drivers license?" </p>\n<p>"What''s a license?" replied the blonde, instantly giving away the fact that she was as dumb as a stump. </p>\n<p>"It''s usually in your wallet," replied the officer. </p>\n<p>After fumbling for a few minutes, the driver managed to find it. </p>\n<p>"Now may I see your registration?" asked the cop. </p>\n<p>"Registration..... what''s that....?" asked the blonde. </p>\n<p>"It''s usually in your glove compartment," said the cop impatiently. After some more fumbling, she found the registration. </p>\n<p>"I''ll be back in a minute." said the cop and walked back to his car. </p>\n<p>The officer called in to the dispatch to run a check on the woman''s license and registration. </p>\n<p>After a few moments, the dispatcher came back, "Ummm... is this woman driving a red sports car?" </p>\n<p>"Yes." replied the officer </p>\n<p>"Is she a drop dead gorgeous blonde?" asked the dispatcher.</p>\n<p>"Uh... yes." replied the cop. </p>\n<p>"Here''s what you do," said the dispatcher. "give her the stuff back, and drop your pants." </p>\n<p>"What? I can''t do that. Its... inappropriate." exclaimed the cop. </p>\n<p>"Trust me. Just do it." said the dispatcher. </p>\n<p>So the cop goes back to the car, gives back the license and registration and drops his pants, just as the dispatcher said. </p>\n<p>The blonde looks down and sighs..... "Ohh no... not another breathalyzer......" </p>\n<p>Submitted by calamjo<br /> Edited by Curtis
With the upcoming 2000 elections there has been a lot of confusion over the<br /> players crucial to the next election. So I''ve found a way to simplify this topic<br /> very well. </p>\n<p>This is all the Wizard of Oz. Dan Quayle is the scarecrow who needs a brain.<br /> Al Gore is the tinman. Colin Powell is the cowardly lion who never manages to<br /> run for office. Elizabeth Dole is Dorothy who doesn''t know where she is and not<br /> quite sure where she''s going. </p>\n<p>And of course we have to mention Clinton because he''s a factor while all this<br /> is going on. Clinton is of course Toto, because throughout all this he''s trying<br /> to get up into Dorothy''s skirt.

How was your golf game, dear?" asked Jack''s wife, Edna. </p>\n<p>"Well, I was hitting pretty well, but my eyesight''s gotten so bad I couldn''t<br /> see where the ball went." </p>\n<p>"Well, you''re seventy-five years old, Jack!" admonished his wife. "Why don''t<br /> you take my brother, Ronald, along the next time you play?" </p>\n<p>"But he''s EIGHTY-FIVE and doesn''t even PLAY golf anymore," protested Jack. </p>\n<p>"But he''s got perfect eyesight after his cataract surgery. He could watch your<br /> ball," Edna pointed out. </p>\n<p>So the next day Jack teed off, with Ronald looking on. Jack swung, and the<br /> ball disappeared down the middle of the fairway. "Do you see it?" asked Jack. </p>\n<p>"Yup," answered Ronald. </p>\n<p>"Where did it go?" asked Jack, peering off into the distance. </p>\n<p>"I dunno. I forgot," said Ronald.
A man''s wife asks him to go to the store to buy some cigarettes. He walks down to the store only to find it closed. So he goes into a nearby bar to use the vending machine.

Do you have any talcum powder?"</p>\n<p>She gives him some talcum powder, which he proceeds to rub on his hands and then he goes home.</p>\n<p>His wife is waiting for him in the doorway and she is pretty pissed. "Where the hell have you been?!"</p>\n<p>"Well, honey, its like this. I went to the store like you asked, but they were closed. So I went to the bar to use the vending machine. I saw this great looking chick there and we had a few drinks and one thing led to another and I ended up in bed with her."</p>\n<p>"Oh yeah? Let me see your hands!" She sees his hands are covered with powder. "You liar! You went bowling again!"
The Pope visits Washington and President Bush takes him for a ride down the Potomac on the presidential yacht. They''re enjoying themselves when a gust of wind blows the Pope''s hat (zucchetto) off and out onto the water. The Secret Service begins to launch a boat but Bush waves them off saying, "Wait. I''ll take care of this."</p>\n<p>Bush steps off the yacht onto the surface of the water, walks out a ways and picks up the hat. Back on board, he hands the hat to the Pope amid stunned silence.</p>\n<p>The next morning the Washington Post carries the story complete with photos under the heading: "BUSH CAN''T SWIM".

An escaped convict broke into a house and tied up a young couple who had been sleeping in the bedroom.</p>\n<p>As soon as he had a chance, the husband turned to his voluptuous young wife, bound up on the bed in a skimpy nightgown, and whispered, "Honey, this guy hasn''t seen a woman in years. Just co-operate with anything he wants. If he wants to have sex with you, just go along with it and pretend  you like it. Our lives depend on it."</p>\n<p>"Dear," the wife hissed, spitting out her gag, "I''m so relieved you feel that way, because he just told me he thinks you are really cute!"
Three young college students are on vacation in Washington, DC. One day they are walking together past the White House when they hear the voice of a man crying out, "Help, Help." </p>\n<p>Quickly, they respond to the call by leaping over the White House fence, and by following the cries, they eventually come upon Bill Clinton, drowning in the White House swimming pool. In an heroic rush, they pull him from the pool, then give him artificial respiration, clearly saving his life. </p>\n<p>After a few minutes, Clinton says to them, "Well, boys, today you saved my life! And I am willing to give each of you any wish you desire, as long as it is within my power as President!" </p>\n<p>The first fellow thinks for a few seconds then says, "I have always wanted to go to West Point. Can you get me an appointment?" </p>\n<p>"You bet!" said the President, "I''ll sign the papers this afternoon!" </p>\n<p>Then the second fellow said, "I''ve always wanted to go to Annapolis. Can you get me in?" </p>\n<p>"You bet I can," said the President. "I''ll sign the papers for it this afternoon, too." </p>\n<p>After a few moments more, the third fellow said, "I''d like to know, can you get me buried in Arlington National Cemetery?" </p>\n<p>Clinton, a bit startled, thought for a second or two, then said, "Sure, but tell me, aren''t you awfully young to be thinking about such things?" </p>\n<p>"Nope," replied the remaining fellow. "Because when I get home and tell my old man what I did today, he''s going to kill me!"

A man, while playing on the front nine of a complicated golf course, became confused as to where he was on the course. Looking around, he saw a lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her, explained his confusion and asked her if she knew what hole he was playing. She replied, "I''m on the 7th hole, and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole." </p>\n<p>He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the back nine the same thing happened; and he approached her again with the same request. She said, "I''m on the 14th hole, you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 13th hole." Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. </p>\n<p>He finished his round and went to the clubhouse where he saw the same lady sitting at the end of the bar. He asked the bartender if he knew the lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. </p>\n<p>He approached her and said, "Let me buy you a drink in appreciation for your help. I understand that you are in the sales profession. I''m in sales, also. What do you sell?" </p>\n<p>She replied, "If I tell you, you''ll laugh." "No, I won''t." </p>\n<p>"Well, if you must know," she answered, "I work for Tampax." </p>\n<p>With that, he laughed so hard he almost lost his breath. She said, "See I knew you would laugh." </p>\n<p>"That''s not what I''m laughing at," he replied. "I''m a salesman for Preparation H, so I''m still a hole behind you!"

22. Cleaning up the dining area means getting the fast food bags out of the     back seat of your car21. Your reason for not staying in touch with family is that they do not have     e-mail addresses20. Keeping up with sports entails adding ESPN''s homepage to you bookmarks19.

A Nun and a priest were crossing the desert on a camel. On the<br /> third day out the camel suddenly dropped dead without warning.<br /> After dusting themselves off, the nun and the priest surveyed<br /> their situation. After a long period of silence, the priest<br /> spoke. "Well sister this looks pretty grim." "I know father."<br /> The nun answered, "In fact," said the priest, "I don''t think it<br /> will be likely that we can survive more than a day or two" "I<br /> agree." said the nun. "Sister, since we are unlikely to make it<br /> out of here alive would you do something for me?" "Anything<br /> father." "I''ve never seen a women''s breast before, would you<br /> show me yours?" "Well under the circumstances I don''t see it<br /> being a problem."</p>\n<p>The nun opened her habit and the priest enjoyed the sight of her<br /> shapely breast. "Father, could I ask something of you?" "Yes<br /> sister," "I have never seen a man''s penis, could I see yours?"<br /> "I supposed that would be OK," the priest replied and lifted his<br /> robe. "Oh father may I touch it?" This the priest allowed and<br /> soon sported a huge erection. "Sister, you know if I put this in<br /> the right place it can give life?" "Is that true father?" "Yes<br /> it is sister." "Then stick it up the camels arse, and lets get<br /> the fuck out of here...."

There was once a 16-year-old boy named Deeper in the tenth<br /> grade. He was always acting up in school, so his parents were<br /> asked to come to meet with the principal. While they were in the<br /> meeting, Deeper was asked to keep himself busy, and so he went<br /> to the classroom of his homeroom teacher where she was grading<br /> papers. She was dressed in a tight blouse and a mini skirt, and<br /> just the sight of her made him hard, so he walked over to her<br /> and turned her chair toward him. He told her, "God, you make me<br /> hard. Feel my dick!"</p>\n<p>Shocked, she said no, but he told her that his parents were<br /> meeting with the principal and that if she didn''t, he''d tell on<br /> her, and then the principal would fire her. So fearing for her<br /> job, she reached out and grabbed the bulge at his pants. He<br /> moaned and told her to get naked. Again, she was shocked and<br /> refused, but again he threatened her that the principal would<br /> fire her, and so she agreed and got naked. He smiled and got<br /> naked himself. Kissing her and throwing her onto the desk, he<br /> started pounding away at her, and she was moaning and gasping<br /> with the best orgasm of her life when his parents walked into<br /> the room. They all screamed in unison, "DEEPER!" and he looked<br /> up at them and said, "I''M TRYING!"
This is a compilation of actual student GCSE answers...</p>\n<p>1. Ancient Egypt was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in<br /> hydraulics. They lived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by<br /> Camelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants<br /> have to live elsewhere.</p>\n<p>2. The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first<br /> book of the Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an<br /> apple tree. One of their children, Cain, asked, "Am I my<br /> brother''s son?"</p>\n<p>3. Moses led the Hebrew slaves to the Red Sea, where they made<br /> unleavened bread which is bread made without any ingredients.<br /> Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. He<br /> died before he ever reached Canada.</p>\n<p>4. Solomom had three hundred wives and seven hundred porcupines.</p>\n<p>5. The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them<br /> we wouldn''t have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a<br /> female moth.</p>\n<p>6. Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man<br /> of that name.</p>\n<p>7. Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving<br /> people advice. They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose<br /> of wedlock. After his death, his career suffered a dramatic<br /> decline.</p>\n<p>8. In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the<br /> biscuits, and threw the java.</p>\n<p>9. Eventually, the Romans conquered the Greeks. History calls<br /> people Romans because they never stayed in one place for very<br /> long.</p>\n<p>10. Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of<br /> Gaul. The Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was<br /> going to be made king. Dying, he gasped out: "Tee hee, Brutus."</p>\n<p>11. Nero was a cruel tyranny who would torture his subjects by<br /> playing the fiddle to them.</p>\n<p>12. Joan of Arc was burnt to a steak and was cannonized by<br /> Bernard Shaw. Finally Magna Carta provided that no man should be<br /> hanged twice for the same offense.</p>\n<p>13. In midevil times most people were alliterate. The greatest<br /> writer of the futile ages was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and<br /> verses and also wrote literature.</p>\n<p>14. Another story was William Tell, who shot an arrow through an<br /> apple while standing on his son''s head.</p>\n<p>15. Queen Elizabeth was the "Virgin Queen." As a queen she was a<br /> success. When she exposed herself before her troops they all<br /> shouted "hurrah."</p>\n<p>16. It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Gutenberg<br /> invented removable type and the Bible. Another important<br /> invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Walter Raleigh is a<br /> historical figure because he invented cigarettes and started<br /> smoking. And Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100<br /> foot clipper.</p>\n<p>17. The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William<br /> Shakespeare. He was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his<br /> birthday. He never made much money and is famous only because of<br /> his plays. He wrote tragedies, comedies, and hysterectomies, all<br /> in Islamic pentameter. Romeo and Juliet are an example of a<br /> heroic couplet. Romeo''s last wish was to be laid by Juliet.</p>\n<p>18. Writing at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel<br /> Cervantes. He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John<br /> Milton. Milton wrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he<br /> wrote Paradise Regained.</p>\n<p>19. During the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus<br /> was a great navigator who discovered America while cursing about<br /> the Atlantic. His ships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the<br /> Santa Fe.</p>\n<p>20. Later, the Pilgrims crossed the ocean, and this was called<br /> Pilgrim''s Progress. The winter of 1620 was a hard one for the<br /> settlers. Many people died and many babies were born. Captain<br /> John Smith was responsible for all this.</p>\n<p>21. One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the English<br /> put tacks in their tea. Also, the colonists would send their<br /> parcels through the post without stamps. Finally the colonists<br /> won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis. Delegates from<br /> the original 13 states formed the Contented Congress. Thomas<br /> Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of<br /> the declaration of Independence. Franklin discovered electricity<br /> by rubbing two cats backwards and declared, "A horse divided<br /> against itself cannot stand.". Franklin died in 1790 and is<br /> still dead.</p>\n<p>22. Soon the Constitution of the United States was adopted to<br /> secure domestic hostility. Under the constitution the people<br /> enjoyed the right to keep bare arms.</p>\n<p>23. Abraham Lincoln became America''s greatest Precedent.<br /> Lincoln''s mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin<br /> which he built with his own hands. Abraham Lincoln freed the<br /> slaves by signing the Emasculation Proclamation. On the night of<br /> April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his<br /> seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show. The believed<br /> assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposedly insane actor. This<br /> ruined Booth''s career.</p>\n<p>24. Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable<br /> time. Voltaire invented electricity and also wrote a book called<br /> Candy.</p>\n<p>25. Gravity was invented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly<br /> noticeable in the autumn when the apples are falling off the<br /> trees.</p>\n<p>26. Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had<br /> a large number of children. In between he practiced on an old<br /> spinster which he kept up in his attic. Bach died from 1750 to<br /> the present. Bach was the most famous composer in the world and<br /> so was Handel. Handel was half German half Italian and half<br /> English. He was very large.</p>\n<p>27. Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so<br /> deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even<br /> when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and<br /> later died for this.</p>\n<p>28. The French Revolution was accomplished before it happened<br /> and catapulted into Napoleon. Napoleon wanted an heir to inherit<br /> his power, but since Josephine was a baroness, she couldn''t have<br /> any children.</p>\n<p>29. The sun never set on the British Empire because the British<br /> Empire is in the East and the sun sets in the West.</p>\n<p>30. Queen Victoria was the longest queen.

Jerry is watching the end of an intense baseball game when his wife taps him on the shoulder and asks, ''Honey, could you fix the front steps? They''re ready to collapse.'' </p>\n<p>He sighs and says, ''After the game, Flo.'' </p>\n<p>Flo grinds her teeth. She nearly broke her neck climbing those stupid stairs and all he cares about is his stupid baseball game. ''Well, could you fix the light in the hall? It''s been flickering for weeks.'' </p>\n<p>He sighs and says, ''Darn it, Flo, I''m a sports fan, not an electrician. Call Joe Burkes to fix it.'' </p>\n<p>Flo counters: ''Can you fix the fridge door, then? It won''t shut.'' </p>\n<p>Jerry turns to talk to her and misses the game-winning homer. He turns back to the screen and sees people celebrating and carrying on. He wants to swear. Instead he says, ''You want me to fix the fridge? Who do I look like, the Maytag Repairman?'' </p>\n<p>She opens her mouth and he hushes her silent. ''I need to cool down,'' he says. ''I''m going out.'' </p>\n<p>Jerry goes to his favorite watering hole and drinks for about an hour. After a couple beers, he starts to feel guilty about treating Flo so poorly. He returns home and notices the front steps have been repaired. He walks into the hall and sees the hall light working perfectly. He opens the fridge to grab a beer. The fridge door has been fixed, too. </p>\n<p>He finds his wife and says, ''Honey, how''d you fix all this stuff?'' </p>\n<p>She smiles and says, ''After you left, I sat outside and cried. This nice young man was passing by and asked what was wrong. I told him. He offered to fix everything for me. All I had to do in return was make love to him or bake him a cake. </p>\n<p>Jerry nodded, appreciatively. ''What kind of cake did you bake?'' </p>\n<p>Flo''s smile widened. ''Who do I look like, Betty Crocker?''

A farmer stood leaning on a fence at the edge of his property. He watched as a red sports car came over the top of a hill and followed the road up to the spot where he stood. The driver pulled over to the side of the road and called out to the farmer.</p>\n<p>"Do you know how I can get to Route 91?" the driver asked. </p>\n<p>The farmer thought for a few seconds. Then he said, "Nope."</p>\n<p>"Do you know where the nearest turnpike entrance is?" the driver asked.</p>\n<p>"Nope."</p>\n<p>"How about the town of Hadley.

A man was about to tee off on the golf course when he felt a tap on his<br /> shoulder and a man handed him a card that read, "I am a deaf mute. May I play<br /> through, please?" </p>\n<p>The first man angrily gave the card back, and communicated that "No, he may<br /> NOT play through, and that his handicap did not give him such a right." </p>\n<p>The first man whacked the ball onto the green and left to finish the hole. </p>\n<p>Just as he was about to put the ball into the hole he was hit in the head with<br /> a golf ball, laying him out cold. </p>\n<p>When he came to a few minutes later, he looked around and saw the deaf mute<br /> sternly looking at him, one hand on his hip, the other holding up 4 fingers.

John receives a phone call.</p>\n<p>"Hello," he answers.<br /> The voice on the other end says, "This is Susan.<br /> We met at a party about 3 months ago." </p>\n<p>John: "hmmm... Susan? You say we met 3 months ago?" </p>\n<p>Susan: "Yes, it was at Bill''s house. After the party gave me a ride home. On the way home, we parked and got into the back seat. You told me I was a good sport." </p>\n<p>John: "Oh, yeah! Susan! How are have you been?" </p>\n<p>Susan: "Well, I''m pregnant and I''m going to kill myself." </p>\n<p>John: "Say, you really ARE a good sport!"
I was at the golf course the other day, and I stepped on a rake and hit two of<br /> my best balls.
Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the "in-flight safety<br /> lecture" and their other announcements a bit more entertaining. Here are some<br /> real examples that have been heard or reported:<br /> "There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of<br /> this airplane..."<br /> After landing: "Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you<br /> enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride."<br /> As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone<br /> voice came over the loudspeaker: "Whoa, big fella. WHOA!"<br /> After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight<br /> attendant on a Northwest flight announced:�酶惟 Please take care when opening the<br /> overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as heck<br /> everything has shifted."<br /> From a Southwest Airlines employee...."Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to<br /> YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull<br /> tight. It works just like every other seatbelt, and if you don''t know how to<br /> operate one, you probably shouldn''t be out in public unsupervised.<br /> In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure margarine cups will descend<br /> from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If<br /> you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting<br /> with theirs. If you are traveling with more than one small child...pick your<br /> favorite.<br /> Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but we''ll<br /> try to have them fixed before we arrive.<br /> Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest<br /> Airlines."<br /> "Your seats cushions can be used for flotation, and in the event of an<br /> emergency water landing, please paddle to shore and take them with our<br /> compliments."<br /> Once on a Southwest flight, the pilot said, "We''ve reached our cruising<br /> altitude now, and I''m turning off the seat belt sign. I''m switching to<br /> autopilot, too, so I can come back there and visit with all of you for the rest<br /> of the flight."<br /> "Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead<br /> area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting<br /> children or other adults acting like children."<br /> "As you exit the plane, make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything<br /> left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do<br /> not leave children or spouses."<br /> "Last one off the plane must clean it."<br /> And from the pilot during his welcome message: "We are pleased to have some of<br /> the best flight attendants in the industry...Unfortunately; none of them are on<br /> this flight...!"<br /> Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City:<br /> The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, "That was quite a bump and I<br /> know what y''all are thinking. I''m here to tell you it wasn''t the airline''s<br /> fault, it wasn''t the pilot''s fault, it wasn''t the flight attendants'' fault...it<br /> was the asphalt!"<br /> Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a<br /> particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach the Captain really<br /> had to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on<br /> the PA and announced, "Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain<br /> in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what''s left<br /> of our airplane to the gate!"<br /> Another flight attendant''s comment on a less than perfect landing: "We ask you<br /> to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal."<br /> An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship<br /> into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first<br /> officer to stand at the door while the Passengers exited, smile, and give them a<br /> "Thanks for flying XYZ airline." He said that in light of his bad landing, he<br /> had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would<br /> have a smart comment. Finally everyone had gotten off except for this little old<br /> lady walking with a cane. She said, "Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?" "Why<br /> no Ma''am," said the pilot, "what is it?" The little old lady said, "Did we land<br /> or were we shot down?"<br /> After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant came on<br /> with, "Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Capt. Crash and<br /> the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate. And,<br /> once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we''ll open<br /> the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal."<br /> Part of a flight attendant''s arrival announcement: "We''d like to thank you<br /> folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go<br /> blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you''ll think of<br /> us here at US Airways."
A married man and his secretary were having a torrid affair. </p>\n<p>One afternoon they couldn''t contain their passion, so they rushed over to her place where they spent the afternoon making passionate love. </p>\n<p>When they were finished they fell asleep and didn''t wake up till 8 o''clock.</p>\n<p>They got dressed quickly. Then the man told his secretary to take his shoes outside and rub them on the lawn. </p>\n<p>Bewildered, she does as he asks (thinking he''s pretty weird).</p>\n<p>The man finally gets home and his wife meets him at the door. </p>\n<p>Upset, she asks where he''s been.</p>\n<p>The man replies "I cannot tell a lie. My secretary and I are having an affair. </p>\n<p>Today we left work early, went to her place, spent the afternoon making love then fell asleep.<br /> That''s why I''m late."</p>\n<p>The wife looks at him, takes notice of his shoes and says, "I see those grass stains on your shoes. You''ve been playing golf again, haven''t you!"

Santa Claus Ltd North PoleDecember 1999Dear Mary:I have been watching you very closely to see if you have been good this year, and since you have, I will be telling my elves to make some goodies for me to leave under your tree on Christmas.I was going to bring you all the gifts from the "Twelve Days of Christmas," but we have a little problem up here.  The Twelve Fiddlers fiddling have all come down with STD''s from fiddling with the Ten Ladies Dancing;  the Eleven Lords a Leaping have knocked up the Eight Maids a Milking;  the Nine Pipers Playing have been arrested for doing weird things to the Seven Swans a Swimming ...Even worse!  The Six Geese a Laying, Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens, Two Turtle Doves, and the Partridge In a Pear Tree have me up to my ass in bird crap!On top of all this, Mrs. Claus is going through the menopause;  eight of my reindeer are in heat;  the elves have joined the Gay Liberation Movement, and those dumb-ass Liberals have scheduled Christmas in Sydney for the 5th of January.... Nevertheless, hope YOU have a merry Christmas!Yours faithfully,SantaChief Executive Officer

A doctor at an (insane) asylum decided to take his inmates to a baseball game.  For weeks in advance, he coached his patients to respond to his commands.  When the day of the game arrived, everything seemed to be going well.  As the national anthem started, the doctor yelled, ''''Up nuts!''''  And the inmates complied by standing up. After the anthem he yelled, ''''Down nuts!'''' And they all sat.     After a home run he yelled, ''''Cheer nuts!'''' And they all broke into applause and cheers.  Thinking things were going very well, he decided to go get a beer and a hot dog, leaving his assistant in charge. When he returned there   was a riot in progress.  Finding his assistant, he asked what happened.     The assistant replied, ''''Well...everything was fine until some guy walked by and yelled, ''''PEANUTS!''''

Two blondes were playing golf at a foggy par three, and could see the flag,<br /> but not the green. Each hit their ball anyway. When they walked to the green,<br /> they discovered one about three feet from the cup, while the other somehow had<br /> gone directly in.</p>\n<p>They tried to figure out which ball belonged to who, since they were both<br /> using Titleist number threes. Unable to decide, they returned to the Club House<br /> and asked the golf pro for a ruling.</p>\n<p>After hearing their story and congratulating them both on their superb shots<br /> under such adverse conditions he asked, "OK, so who was playing the yellow<br /> ball?"

You might be a redneck if...You won''t stop at a rest area if you have an empty beer can in the car. Your dog can''t watch you eat without gagging. You have a Hefty bag on the passenger side window of your car. You have a very special baseball cap, just for formal occasions. Red Man sends you a Christmas card. The Salvation Army declines your mattress. You bought a VCR so you could tape wrestling while you are at work. Your dad walks you to school because you are both in the same grade. Your wife has a beer belly and you find it attractive. Your house doesn''t have curtains, but your truck does.

A guy dies and goes to heaven. It''s a slow day for St. Peter, so, upon passing the entrance test, St. Peter says, "I''m not very busy today, why don''t you let me show you around?" The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the offer. </p>\n<p>St. Peter shows him all the sights - the golf course, the reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a HUGE room full of clocks. The guy asks, "What''s up with these clocks?" </p>\n<p>St. Peter explains, "Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged." The guy thinks this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks are going faster than others. He asks why is that? </p>\n<p>St. Peter explains, "Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds his clock." </p>\n<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, "What''s the story with that clock?" </p>\n<p>"Oh, that," St. Peter replies, "That''s President Clinton''s clock. We decided to use it as a fan."
One evening, an Indian walked into the old western town near the out skirts of his village. When he got to main street he headed straight for the whorehouse. When he got to the whorehouse he walked up to a woman there and he held out a small bag of gold and said, "me have money, me want woman." She looked him up and down and said, "Boy, you need to know how to make love to a woman, before getting with one of my girls. Come back when you have some experience." The Indian left and walked out of the town back to his village. The following day he went out to the woods and found a tree with a knothole in it, and had his way with the tree, and proceeded on with other trees late into the evening. The following evening, the Indian walked back into town with his sack of gold in one hand and a 2x4 piece of wood in the other. When he stepped inside the whorehouse, the same older woman greeted him... He then held out his bag of gold and proclaimed, "Me have money, me want woman, me have experience." She then said, "Well then boy, I guess I can send you upstairs with one of my ladies now." Right then a very beautiful woman walked around the corner, took him by the hand and walked him upstairs to a room. Once they were there, they both proceeded to take of each other''s clothes. As soon as the two of them were completely naked, the Indian then told the woman to turn around and bend over. She looked at him puzzled and then bent over as the Indian requestedThen the Indian WHAKED her on the ass with the 2x4.She screamed and jumped up and demanded. "What the hell was that for?"The Indian stated " I was checking for bees!"
This is a collection of actual student bloopers collected by teachers from 8th grade through college.</p>\n<p>Ancient Egypt was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in hydraulics. They lived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of their children, Cain, asked, "Am I my brother''s son?"</p>\n<p>Moses led the Hebrew slaves to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread which is bread made without any ingredients. Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. He died before he ever reached Canada.</p>\n<p>The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we wouldn''t have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a female moth.</p>\n<p>Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice. They  killed  him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock. After  his  death, his career suffered a dramatic decline.</p>\n<p>In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits, and threw the java.</p>\n<p>Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king. Dying, he gasped out: "Tee hee, Brutus."</p>\n<p>Another story was William Tell, who shot an arrow through an apple while standing on his son''s head.</p>\n<p>Queen Elizabeth was the "Virgin  Queen." As a queen she was a success. When she exposed herself before her troops  they all shouted, "hurrah."</p>\n<p>It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Gutenberg invented removable type and the Bible. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes and started smoking. And Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper.

It was a boring Sunday afternoon in the jungle so the Elephants decided to challenge the Ants to a game of soccer.</p>\n<p>The game was going well with the Elephants beating the Ants ten goals to nil, when the Ants gained possession. The Ants'' star player was dribbling the ball towards the Elephants'' goal when the Elephants'' left back came lumbering towards him. The elephant trod on the little ant, killing him instantly. The referee stopped the game.</p>\n<p>"What the hell do you think you''re doing?<br /> Do you call that sportsmanship, killing another player?" </p>\n<p>The elephant replied, "Well, I didn''t mean to kill him -- I was just trying to trip him up."

Three surgeons at a conference were discussing their greatest operations during one of the breaks.</p>\n<p>First surgeon: "I once had an ambulance crew bring in a man''s leg and my team and I built a new body around it and now that he''s recovered fully he does the work of five guys."</p>\n<p>Second surgeon: "That''s really good. My greatest test was a few skin fragments sent to us by the local nuclear plant after a major accident. My team and I work for three days and built an entire new person around those few bits and sent him back to work six months later. He''s so good that he now runs the entire plant by himself!"</p>\n<p>Third surgeon: "Not bad, my friend. I was walking along outside the White House when Clinton went jogging by and farted. I captured that fart in a plastic bag and went to the hospital. My team and I built another ass hole around that fart, added a brain and he''s so good he''s putting this entire country out of work!"

The Minnesota Fish and Game Comission wanted to develop a fish that would offer more for their sportsmen so they crossed a Coho with a Walleye and called it a Kowal.</p>\n<p>It grew to a nice size and reproduced well but it wouldn''t bite. They crossed the Kowal with a Muskie and called it a Kowalski but it was so stupid they had to teach it how to swim.

French-Bashing to Be Olympic Sport</p>\n<p>2/18/2003 - William Grim</p>\n<p>Geneva - At its annual meeting, the International Olympic Committee has decided to add French-Bashing to its roster of medal sports in both the Summer and Winter Games.</p>\n<p>"We thought it was about time," said Jesus de Manuel y Corazon, Chairman of the IOC and the 1968 European French-Bashing Champion. "Everbody hates those little lying, cowardly, collaborating, garlic-eating, never-bathing, nose-picking French bastards. It''s time that French-Bashing was recognized for the truly international sport that it is, one, I might add, that is much more popular than soccer."</p>\n<p>In Summer French-Bashing the Basher runs along a 25 meter path to the Bashee (or the Pierre as it is sometimes called), a typical French sissy picked randomly from the Paris phone book. The first phase of the Bash is called Verbal Bashing in which the Basher has 20 seconds to hurl insults at the Bashee until he starts to cry like a little girl. Then comes the second phase, or Physical Bashing in which the Basher whacks the Bashee over the head with a baseball bat. Play continues until the Bashee surrenders, which in most cases happens immediately because the Bashee is a scairdy-cat Frog after all. Scoring is similar to that in diving in which points are awarded on style, technique and degree of </p>\n<p>difficulty.</p>\n<p>Winter French-Bashing resembles its Summer counterpart with the exception that the Basher approaches the Bashee on skis.</p>\n<p>Sports writers are predicting French-Bashing to be the biggest spectator sport of all time, with the potential of billions of dollars in TV revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in endorsement contracts for world-class bashers.</p>\n<p>The United States and Great Britain are already being touted as gold medal contenders for the 2006 Games, with Canada (the only country to produce both world-class bashers and bashees) a very serious challenger.

A guy walks into a bar with his dog. They both go up to the barstool and sit down.

Here''s some examples:</p>\n<p>''I perform my job with effortless efficiency, effectiveness, efficacy, and expertise.'' (And an eye on the ''e'' section of the dictionary, evidently.)</p>\n<p>''Insufficient writing skills, thought processes have slowed down some. If I am not one of the best, I will look for another opportunity.''(No problem ...)</p>\n<p>''Seek challenges that test my mind and body, since the two are usually inseparable.

What''s the difference between 3 golf balls and a period?</p>\n<p>You can''t gargle 3 golf balls!!!
Good afternoon. I''m Al Gore, and I''d like to tell you about myself.<br /> I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black<br /> child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I was born in a log cabin<br /> that I built with my own hands. I taught myself to read by candlelight and<br /> helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a<br /> Mississippi River steamboat.<br /> My mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles<br /> to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought I<br /> never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration<br /> for "Huckleberry Finn."<br /> Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens. One day, a<br /> traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going<br /> to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans.

After getting my high school diploma, I<br /> took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the treatment of<br /> the workers there that I organized a union. Later, that experience inspired a<br /> movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me<br /> "Norma Rae."<br /> When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called<br /> and offered me a scholarship.

Good afternoon. I''m Al Gore, and I''d like to tell you about myself.<br /> I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black<br /> child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I was born in a log cabin<br /> that I built with my own hands. I taught myself to read by candlelight and<br /> helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a<br /> Mississippi River steamboat.<br /> My mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles<br /> to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought I<br /> never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration<br /> for "Huckleberry Finn."<br /> Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens. One day, a<br /> traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going<br /> to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I<br /> made an impression. You see, the minister''s name was Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /> My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and<br /> said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a<br /> hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school."<br /> But life of privilege was not for me.

A husband and wife are traveling by car from Key West to Boston.<br /> After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they''re too tired to<br /> continue, and they decide to stop for a rest. They stop at a<br /> nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four<br /> hours and then get back on the road. When they check out four<br /> hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350.</p>\n<p>The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so<br /> high. He tells the clerk although it''s a nice hotel, the rooms<br /> certainly aren''t worth $350. When the clerk tells him $350 is<br /> the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the manager.</p>\n<p>The manager appears, listens to the man, and then explains that<br /> the hotel has an Olympic sized pool and a huge conference<br /> center that were available for the husband and wife to use.</p>\n<p>"But we didn''t use them." the man complains. "Well, they are<br /> here, and you could have." explains the manager.</p>\n<p>He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of the shows<br /> for which the hotel is famous. "The best entertainers from New<br /> York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here." the manager says.<br /> "But we didn''t go to any of those shows." complains the man<br /> again.</p>\n<p>"Well, we have them, and you could have." the manager replies.<br /> No matter what facility the manager mentions, the man replies,<br /> "But we didn''t use it!"</p>\n<p>The manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives up and<br /> agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the manager.<br /> The mnager is surprised when he looks at the check. "But sir,"<br /> he says, "this check is only made out for $100." </p>\n<p>"That''s right," says the man. "I charged you $250 for sleeping<br /> with my wife." </p>\n<p>"But I didn''t!" exclaims the mnager.</p>\n<p>"Well," the man replies, "she was here, and you could have."
A man traveling down a country road was forced to stop before a giant puddle<br /> covering the entire road. Looking to the side of the road, the man noticed a<br /> farmer leaning on a fence. "Think it''s safe to cross?" the man asked. </p>\n<p>"I reckon so," replied the farmer. </p>\n<p>The puddle immediately swallowed the car as the man drove in. In fact, it was<br /> so deep that he had to roll his window down to swim out of his car back to the<br /> surface. As his head broke the surface, the man said to the farmer, "I thought<br /> you said I could safely drive through this puddle!" </p>\n<p>"Well, shoot!" said the farmer, scratching his head. "It only come up<br /> chest-high on my ducks!"</p>\n<p>One morning a boy got up and was leaving the house with a hand full of chicken<br /> wire. His father said, ''Son, where are you going?'' The son replied, ''I''m going<br /> to catch me some chickens.'' The father said, ''Son, you can''t catch chickens with<br /> chicken wire.'' But the son insisted that he knew what he was doing. </p>\n<p>Later on that day, the son came home with two chickens in his hand. The father<br /> thought, ''I guess he knows what he''s doing.'' The next morning, the son got up<br /> and was leaving the house with some duck tape. The father said, ''Son, where are<br /> you going?'' The son replied, ''I''m going to catch some ducks.'' The father yelled,<br /> ''You can''t catch ducks with duck tape!'' The son insisted that he knew what he<br /> was doing. </p>\n<p>Awhile later, the son came home with two ducks under each arm. The father<br /> thought, ''Shoot, I guess he does know what he''s doing!'' The next morning the son<br /> got up and was leaving the house with a hand full of puss willows. The father<br /> said, ''Hold up, son, let me put on my shoes!''

After a particularly poor game of golf, a popular club member skipped the clubhouse and started to go home. As he was walking to the parking lot to get his car, a policeman stopped him and asked, "Did you tee off on the sixteenth hole about twenty minutes ago?" "Yes," the golfer responded. "Did you happen to hook your ball so that it went over the trees and off the course?" "Yes, I did. How did you know?" he asked. "Well," said the policeman very seriously, "Your ball flew out onto the highway and crashed through a driver''s windshield. The car went out of control, crashing into five other cars and a fire truck. The fire truck couldn''t make it to the fire, and the building burned down. So, what are you going to do about it?" The golfer thought it over carefully and responded... "I think I''ll close my stance a little bit, tighten my grip and lower my right thumb."
Sam and Becky are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. Sam says to Becky, "Becky, I was wondering - have you ever cheated on me?"Becky replies, "Oh Sam, why would you ask such a question now? You don''t want to ask that question...""Yes, Becky, I really want to know. Please...""Well, all right. Yes, 3 times...""Three? Well, when were they?" he asked. "Well, Sam, remember when you were 35 years old and you really wanted to start the business on your own and no bank would give you a loan? Remember, then one day the bank president himself came over the house and signed the loan papers, no questions asked?""Oh, Becky, you did that for me! I respect you even more than ever, to do such a thing for me. So, when was number 2?""Well, Sam, remember when you had that last heart attack and you were needing that very tricky operation, and no surgeon would touch you? Then remember how our old doctor came all the way up here, to do the surgery himself, and then you were in good shape again?""I can''t believe it! Becky, you should do such a thing for me, to save my life. I couldn''t have a more wonderful wife. To do such a thing, you must really love me darling. I couldn''t be more moved.

This list is a general disclaimer for any wives or girlfriends who happen upon a copy of this:1) The floor is considered an acceptable clothing storage location.2) Never ask me to purchase feminine products. Assume that I will come home with the wrong thing.3) When watching TV hugging is always fine because I can still see the screen. Kissing should only be done during timeouts and commercials. Questions should also be limited to this period as you stand a much better chance of getting an immediate response.4) When we are watching your show and I change the channels during a commercial do not hassle me that they are over to change the channel back. I always know when the timing is right. Also, when we are channel surfing do not ask me to go back, there was a good reason why I skipped it.5) If you need help with the laundry, I am more than willing to carry it from the bedroom to the washer. In my mind this is half the chore and I am now free to return to the couch.6) If I mention that a male friend of mine is allowed to do something it is not necessary for you to call his wife/girlfriend to discuss it.5) If you don''t like the way I am driving close your eyes. And I would appreciate it if you would refrain from making that reverse inhaling alarmed noise. I haven''t hit anything yet and if I do it will be your fault.6) I go clothes shopping to buy, never to look.7) Just tell me what you want me to wear before I get dressed. And remember that this takes me less than ten minutes no matter what the occasion is. After all I am getting dressed, not getting ready.8) Don''t ask me if I prefer one outfit over another or if a certain accessory should be worn or not. I consider this a no win situation and would rather just wait for you to get dressed while watching TV.9) If you want me to put the seat down when I am finished then you should leave the seat up when you are finished.It''s only fair. And stop giving me a hard time about missing the bowl. What do you expect from an organ that has a brain of its own.10) I will cook anything as long as it is on the BBQ.11) Yelling to me across the house sounds exactly like stadium crowd background noise to me. I am not ignoring you.
For years and years they told me, </p>\n<p>Be careful of your breasts. </p>\n<p>Don''t ever squeeze or bruise them. </p>\n<p>And give them monthly tests.</p>\n<p>So I heeded all their warnings, </p>\n<p>And protected them by law. </p>\n<p>Guarded them very carefully, </p>\n<p>And I always wore my bra.</p>\n<p>After 30 years of astute care, </p>\n<p>My gyno, Dr. Pruitt, </p>\n<p>Said I should get a Mammogram. </p>\n<p>"O.K," I said, "let''s do it."</p>\n<p>"Stand up here real close" she said, </p>\n<p>(She got my boob in line) </p>\n<p>"And tell me when it hurts," she said, </p>\n<p>"Ah yes! Right there, that''s fine."</p>\n<p>She stepped upon a pedal, </p>\n<p>I could not believe my eyes! </p>\n<p>A plastic plate came slamming down, </p>\n<p>My hooter''s in a vise!</p>\n<p>My skin was stretched and mangled, </p>\n<p>From underneath my chin. </p>\n<p>My poor boob was being squashed, </p>\n<p>To Swedish Pancake thin.</p>\n<p>Excruciating pain I felt,</p>\n<p>Within it''s vise-like grip.</p>\n<p>A prisoner in this vicious thing,</p>\n<p>My poor defenseless tit!</p>\n<p>"Take a deep breath" she said to me,</p>\n<p>Who does she think she''s kidding?!?</p>\n<p>My chest is mashed in her machine,</p>\n<p>And woozy I am getting.</p>\n<p>"There, that''s good," I heard her say,</p>\n<p>(The room was slowly swaying.)</p>\n<p>"Now, let''s have a go at the other one."</p>\n<p>Have mercy, I was praying.</p>\n<p>It squeezed me from `oth up and down,</p>\n<p>It squeezed me from both sides.</p>\n<p>I''ll bet SHE''S never had this done,</p>\n<p>To HER tender little hide.</p>\n<p>Next time that they make me do this,</p>\n<p>I will request a blindfold.</p>\n<p>I have no wish to see again,</p>\n<p>My knockers getting steamrolled.</p>\n<p>If I had no problem when I came in,</p>\n<p>I surely have one now.</p>\n<p>If there had been a cyst in there,</p>\n<p>It would have gone "ker-pow!"</p>\n<p>This machine was created by a man,</p>\n<p>Of this, I have no doubt.</p>\n<p>I''d like to stick his balls in there,</p>\n<p>And see how THEY come out.

With yet another young man in her life Elizabeth Taylor decided that in her advancing years she needed to tighten up her vaginal area. She put her trust in her plastic surgeon of 30 years standing, the one who had carried out her face-lifts, boob jobs and ass-lifts. Sworn to secrecy, he agreed that no-one but him would ever know. He carried out the delicate operation, carefully slicing away strips of the loose folds of skin. It is a long operation!Liz awakes the next morning to see 3 "get well soon" cards on her bedside table. She is appalled and demands to see the doctor. "No-one but you should know about this! You have let me down",she says."Ah" says the doc,"this card is from my wife and I wishing you a speedy recovery." "How nice ", says Liz."Thank you - what a nice thought." "The second card is from old Madge the cleaner who has cleaned up after all your previous operations - she is to be trusted.""What a beautiful thought , from such a humble person -I''m really touched", says Liz. "But who is the 3rd card from?" asks Liz."Oh", says the doctor, "that''s from Evander Holyfield -- thanking you for his new ears!!!"
The other day I went to the local religious book store where I saw a "HONK IF<br /> YOU LOVE JESUS" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on my back bumper and I''m<br /> glad I did. </p>\n<p>What an uplifting experience followed. That bumper sticker really worked!!</p>\n<p>I found lots of people who loved Jesus. </p>\n<p>I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about<br /> the Lord. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. </p>\n<p>He must REALLY love Jesus because pretty soon he leaned out of his window and<br /> yelled "JESUS CHRIST!" as loud as he could. </p>\n<p>It was like a football game with him shouting, "GO!...JESUS CHRIST!...GO!"<br /> Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out the window and smiled and<br /> waved to all those loving people. </p>\n<p>There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I heard him yell<br /> something about a sunny beach and saw him waving with only his middle finger. </p>\n<p>I asked my kids what he meant by that and they laughed and said it was the<br /> Hawaiian good luck sign. So I leaned out of the window and gave him the good<br /> luck sign back. </p>\n<p>A couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got<br /> out of their cars and started running towards me! </p>\n<p>I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed<br /> so I stepped on the gas. </p>\n<p>It''s a good thing that I did because I was the only driver to get across the<br /> intersection. </p>\n<p>I looked back and everyone was still standing there so I leaned way out the<br /> window and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away. </p>\n<p>Praise the Lord for such wonderful people!
Little Jimmy Keller was 7 now and still sucking his thumb. His<br /> parents wanted him to stop so badly. Jimmy was in the habit and<br /> couldn''t get out. His father would yell at him for it. They<br /> would threaten taking away video games and sports and even TV.<br /> Even this didn''t make Jimmy stop. They got very fed up with<br /> their son.</p>\n<p>Finally Jimmy''s mother explained to Jimmy that if he keeps<br /> sucking his thumb his stomach will explode. Jimmy was a bit<br /> scared then. His mother hoped that would work. The next day<br /> Jimmy, his mom, and sister were walking in the park. Jimmy saw a<br /> pregnant woman sitting on a park bench eating ice cream. Jimmy<br /> quickly ran over there and said, "I know what you''ve been doing!

A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first<br /> of the twosome teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly<br /> toward a foursome of men playing the next hole.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his hands<br /> together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in<br /> evident agony.</p>\n<p>The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize. She<br /> explained that she was a physical therapist: "Please allow me to help. I''m<br /> a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you''d allow<br /> me", she told him earnestly.</p>\n<p>Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I''ll be alright...I''ll be fine in a few minutes, he<br /> replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal position still clasping<br /> his hands together at his crotch.</p>\n<p>But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help him. She gently took<br /> his hands away and laid them to the side, she loosened his pants, and she<br /> put her hands inside and began to massage him. She then asked him: How<br /> does that feel? To which he replied: It feels great, but my thumb still<br /> hurts like hell.

A<br /> reporter who is strolling by sees the incident, and rushes over to interview the<br /> boy. "''Forty Miners'' fan saves friend from vicious animal", he starts writing in<br /> his notebook. "But I''m not a Miners fan�酶惟, the boy replies. "''Oakland Raiders''<br /> fan rescues friend from horrific attack�酶惟, says the reporter as he writes in his<br /> notebook. "I''m not a Raiders fan either," the boy says. "Then what are you?" the<br /> reporter asks. "I''m a Cowboys fan!!!" the boy says proudly. The reporter starts<br /> a new sheet in his notebook and writes, "Redneck bastard kills family pet!"
It''s the Spring of 1957 and Bobby goes to pick up his date. He''s a pretty hip guy with his own car. When he goes to the front door, the girl''s father answers and invites him in. "Carrie''s not ready yet, so why don''t you have a seat?," he says.</p>\n<p>"That''s cool" says Bobby.</p>\n<p>Carrie''s father asks Bobby what they''re planning to do.</p>\n<p>Bobby replies politely that they will probably just go to the soda shop or a movie.</p>\n<p>Carrie''s father responds "why don''t you two go out and screw? I hear all the kids are doing it."</p>\n<p>Naturally, this comes as a quite a surprise to Bobby - so he asks Carrie''s Dad  to repeat it.</p>\n<p>"Yeah," says Carrie''s father, "Carrie really likes to screw; she''ll screw all night if we let her!"</p>\n<p>Well, this just made Bobby''s eyes light up, and his plan for the evening was beginning to look pretty good.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Carrie comes downstairs in her little poodle skirt and announces that she''s ready to go. Almost breathless with anticipation, Bobby escorts his date out the front door.</p>\n<p>About 20 minutes later, Carrie rushes back into the house, slams the door behind her, and screams at her father:<br /> "DAMMIT DADDY! ...IT''S CALLED THE TWIST!!!"
God summons St. Peter and says, "St. Peter, we have a problem. Heaven is full. </p>\n<p>However, we have a number of high-profile candidates waiting at the Gates, and we are suffering from falling popularity. </p>\n<p>So, I''m going to throw out Mother Teresa and let in one of the celebrities at the gate. You''ll have to go and decide who is most suitable."</p>\n<p>St. Peter goes down to the Pearly Gates and finds Freddie Mercury, Gianni Versace, and Princess Diana waiting for him. </p>\n<p>He says, "I''m afraid I can only let one of you in, so each of you must come up with a reason why you should be admitted to Heaven."</p>\n<p>Freddie Mercury says, "I''ve been gifted with one of the most beautiful voices to ever grace the earth. I''ll spend my time in Heaven singing praises to God with the choirs of angels. Heaven will never have sounded better."</p>\n<p>Gianni Versace says, "I was Earth''s greatest designer. I will outfit the cherubs and angels in all the latest fashions -- long silky gowns, satin cloaks and nightwear spun from the very clouds we stand on. Heaven will never have looked better."</p>\n<p>Diana blushes a little, looks around nervously and seems unable to find something suitable to say. Suddenly, she strips off her skirt and panties, whips out a bottle of Perrier, shakes it up and douches with it.</p>\n<p>St. Peter says, "OK, Diana, you may enter. Have a nice day!"</p>\n<p>Freddie and Gianni are mortified. </p>\n<p>"What''s going on here?" Freddie cries. "We could make heaven look and sound better than ever before, and she performs a disgusting, pornographic act, but she gets in and we don''t!"</p>\n<p>St. Peter just shrugs his shoulders and says, "Sorry, guys, but a royal flush beats a pair of queens any day."
RECOUNT DEMANDED BY METS</p>\n<p>NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference earlier today. They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union. "We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers," said the Mets batting coach. "We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."</p>\n<p>One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>"The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit," said the Mets batting coach.</p>\n<p>"The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely. "Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game. "While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series," the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.</p>\n<p>"It''s clear that we were on-base slightly more often than the Yankees," said a Mets spokesman. "The World Series crown is rightly ours. "The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise. He has stated that he believes "we need to let the process run its course without a rush to judgment."
Weird, but allegedly true, celebrity encounters as quoted in the book "Elvis Presley''s Pharmacist Was My Sunday School Teacher" (Alaska Northwest Books, $8.95). "While playing a celebrity basketball game at the Pentagon, I mistakenly put on Al Gore''s jockstrap." "I once heard Brian Keith belch." "I was circumcised by C. Everett Koop." "Kurt Cobain puked on my ex-girlfriend." "I took Captain Kangaroo''s stool sample." "I once built a stage that Glenn Campbell fell through." "I watched Jaclyn Smith pick her nose while driving her Corvette." "I sat on a plane next to the best friend of the nephew of the Japanese guy that President Bush puked on." "I threw a Frisbee to the Emperor of Japan." "My ancestors ate Magellan." "I know a guy whose father''s grandfather was the plumber who pulled President Taft out of the tub when he got stuck." "My father went to high school with Adam West. I met him and then the three of us went to Hooters." "Connie Chung once hawked a loogie on my shoe." "Gomer Pyle hit on my brother." "Stephen Hawking ran over my foot with his wheelchair."
Maurie was not having a good day on the golf course. After he missed a twelve inch putt, his partner asked him what the problem was. "It''s the wife" said Maurie. "As you know, she''s taken up golf, and since she''s been playing, she''s cut my sex down to once a week." "Well you should think yourself lucky," said his partner. "She''s cut some of us out altogether!"
There was a brunnette and a redhead sitting next to each other at a baseball game. The brunette says "Wanna hear a blonde joke?"" Blonde replies ""Sure
A young blonde was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana. She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking. </p>\n<p>After becoming very frustrated with the "no haggle" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, "Maybe I''ll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!" The shopkeeper said, "By all means, be my guest. Maybe you''ll luck out and catch yourself a big one!" </p>\n<p>Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator. Later in the day, the shopkeeper is driving home,when he spots the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. </p>\n<p>Just then, he sees a huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She takes aim, kills the creature, and with a great deal of effort hauls it on to the swamp bank. Laying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watches in amazement. Just then the blonde flips the alligator on it''s back, and frustrated, shouts out, "Rats, this one isn''t wearing any shoes either!"
A Canadian is on vacation and walks into a bar.<br /> He sits on this HUGE stool and says to the bartender'' man, I heard things are big down here in Texas, but this is ridiculas!'' and orders a mug of beer.</p>\n<p>He gets a pitcher of beer and asks the bartender, ''man, I heard that things are big down here in Texasm but this is ridiculas!'' and goes about drinking his beer. He orders another and he gets really pissed drunk.</p>\n<p>Well, not too long later, he has to go to the bathroom really, really bad so he asks the bartender, ''Where is your washroom???'' The bartender says, down the hall, second door on the right.''</p>\n<p>So the man climbs off the stool and stumbles down the hall and enters the second door to the left and falls in this huge swimming pool.</p>\n<p>The man is struggling to stay afloat and screams ''DON''T FLUSH IT!!!

Three blondes are stuck on a desert island and one finds a magic lamp. They rub it and a genie pops out and gives them each a wish. the first blonde says, "I wish I was 10% smarter so I could get off of this island." Then she turns into a redhead and swims off the island. The second sees what happens and says "I wish I was 25% smarter so that I can get off this island!" She then turns into a brunette, makes a raft from trees and sails off. Finally, the third blonde says "I wish I was 50% smarter so I can get off this island." She then suddenly turns into a man and walks across the bridge.

You''re barred, you dirty, filthy, perverted bastard, get out now.''</p>\n<p>Once again the bloke apologizes, and says he will never, ever do it again.</p>\n<p>''Right. I''ll give you one last chance,'' says the barmaid. ''Now, what do you want?''</p>\n<p>''I want to turn you upside down, fill your pussy with Guinness and drink it all out of you.''</p>\n<p>The barmaid starts crying and runs upstairs to her husband, who is sitting down watching the telly. </p>\n<p>''What''s up, love?'' says the husband.</p>\n<p>''There''s this disgusting bloke downstairs.

1. Women love to shop. It is the one area of the world where they feel like they''re actually in control.</p>\n<p>2. Women especially love a bargain. The question of "need" is irrelevant, so don''t bother pointing it out. Anything on sale is fair game.</p>\n<p>3. Women never have anything to wear. Don''t question the racks of clothes in the closet; you "just don''t understand".</p>\n<p>4. Women need to cry. And they won''t do it alone unless they know you can hear them.</p>\n<p>5. Women will always ask questions that have no right answer, in an effort to trap you into feeling guilty. </p>\n<p>6. Women love to talk. Silence intimidates them and they feel a need to fill it, even if they have nothing to say.</p>\n<p>7. Women need to feel like there are people worse off than they are. That''s why soap operas and Oprah Winfrey-type shows are so successful.</p>\n<p>8. Women don''t need sex as often as men do. This is because sex is more physical for men and more emotional for women. Just knowing that the man *wants* to have sex with them fulfills the emotional need.</p>\n<p>9. Women hate bugs. Even the strong-willed ones need a man around when there''s a spider or a wasp involved.</p>\n<p>10. Women can''t keep secrets. They eat away at them from the inside. And they don''t view it as being untrustworthy, providing they only tell two or three people.</p>\n<p>11. Women always go to public restrooms in groups. It gives them a chance to gossip.</p>\n<p>12. Women can''t refuse to answer a ringing phone, no matter what she''s doing. It might be the lottery calling.</p>\n<p>13. Women never understand why men love toys. Men understand that they wouldn''t need toys if women had an "on/off" switch.</p>\n<p>14. Women think all beer is the same.</p>\n<p>15. Women keep three different shampoos and two different conditioners in the shower. After a woman showers, the bathroom will smell like a tropical rain forest.</p>\n<p>16. Women don''t understand the appeal of sports. Men seek entertainment that allows them to escape reality. Women seek entertainment that reminds them of how horrible things *could* be.  </p>\n<p>17. If a man goes on a seven-day trip, he''ll pack five days worth of clothes and will wear some things twice; if a woman goes on a seven-day trip she''ll pack 21 outfits because she doesn''t know what she''ll feel like wearing each day.</p>\n<p>18. Women brush their hair *before* bed.</p>\n<p>19. Watch a woman eat an ice cream cone and you''ll have a pretty good idea about how she''ll be in bed.</p>\n<p>20. Women are paid less than men, except for one field: Modeling.</p>\n<p>21. Women are *never* wrong. Apologizing is the man''s responsibility, "It''s there in the Bible". Hmmm, who was it that gave Adam the apple?</p>\n<p>22. Women do *not* know anything about cars. "Oil-stick, oil doesn''t stick?"</p>\n<p>23. Women have better restrooms. They get the nice chairs and red carpet. Men just get a large bowl to share.</p>\n<p>24. The average number of items in a typical woman''s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.</p>\n<p>25. Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren''t looking, men kick cats.</p>\n<p>26. Women love to talk on the phone. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.</p>\n<p>27. A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, or get the mail.  </p>\n<p>28. Women will drive miles out of their way to avoid the possibility of getting lost using a shortcut.</p>\n<p>29. Women don''t try as hard as men during sex; after all, they don''t fall asleep afterwards.</p>\n<p>30. Women do NOT want an honest answer to the question, ''How do I look?''</p>\n<p>31. PMS stands for: Permissible Man-Slaughter. (Or at least men think it means that. PMS also stands for Preposterous Mood Swings and Punish My Spouse.</p>\n<p>32. The first naked man women see is "Ken".</p>\n<p>33. Women are insecure about their weight, butt, and breast sizes. </p>\n<p>34. Women will make three right-hand turns to avoid making one left-hand turn. </p>\n<p>35. "Oh, nothing," has an entirely different meaning in woman-language than it does in man-language.</p>\n<p>36. Lewis Carroll''s Caterpillar had nothing on women.</p>\n<p>37. Women cannot use a map without turning the map to correspond to the direction that they are heading.</p>\n<p>38. All women are overweight by definition; don''t agree with them about it. Women always have 5 pounds to lose, but don''t bring this up unless they really have 5 pounds to gain.</p>\n<p>39. If it is not Valentines day and you see a man in a flower shop, you can probably start up a conversation by asking, "What did you do?"</p>\n<p>40. Only women understand the reason for "guest towels" and the "good china".</p>\n<p>41. Women want equal rights, but you rarely hear them clamoring to be let into the draft to cover the responsibilities that go with those rights. All women seek equality with men until it comes to sharing the closet, taking out the trash, and picking up the check.</p>\n<p>42. Only women understand the reason for "guest towels" and the "good china".</p>\n<p>43. If a man ticks off a woman she will often respond by getting a fuzzy toilet cover which warms their rear, but makes it impossible for the lid to stay up thus it constantly gets peed on by the guys.  (which gets them in more trouble)</p>\n<p>44. Women never check to see if the lid is up.  They seem to prefer taking a flying butt leap towards the bowl and then chewing men out because they "left the seat up" instead of taking two seconds and lowering it themselves.</p>\n<p>45. Women can get out of speeding tickets by pouting. This will get men arrested.</p>\n<p>46. Women don''t really care about a sense of humor in a guy despite claims to the contrary. You don''t see women trampling over Tom Cruise to get to Gilbert Gottfried, do you?</p>\n<p>47. Women fake orgasm because men fake foreplay.</p>\n<p>48. It''s okay for women to dance with each other and not be gay, You don''t see straight men dancing together.</p>\n<p>49. Women will spend hours dressing up to go out, and then they''ll go out and spend more time checking out other women. Men can never catch women checking out other men; women will always catch men checking out other women.</p>\n<p>50. The most embarrassing thing for women is to find another woman wearing the same dress at a formal party.

For those who already have children past this age, this is hilarious. For<br /> those who have children this age, this is not funny. For those who have children nearing this age, this is a warning. For those who have not yet had children, this is birth control. The following came from an anonymous mother in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>THINGS I''VE LEARNED FROM MY CHILDREN...(HONEST AND NO KIDDING): </p>\n<p>1. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 square foot<br /> house 4 inches deep. </p>\n<p>2. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller<br /> blades, they can ignite. </p>\n<p>3. A 3 year olds voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded<br /> restaurant. </p>\n<p>4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong<br /> enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman<br /> cape.  It is strong enough, however, if tied to a paint can, to spread<br /> paint on all four walls of a 20 by 20 foot room.</p>\n<p>5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When<br /> using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times<br /> before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. </p>\n<p>6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn''t stop a baseball hit by<br /> a ceiling fan. </p>\n<p>7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words "Uh-oh," it''s already too<br /> late. </p>\n<p>8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. </p>\n<p>9. A six year old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36<br /> year old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying glass<br /> can start a fire even on an overcast day.</p>\n<p>10. Certain LEGOs will pass through the digestive tract of a four year<br /> old. </p>\n<p>11. Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence. </p>\n<p>12. Super glue is forever. </p>\n<p>13. No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can''t<br /> walk on water. </p>\n<p>14. Pool filters do not like Jell-O. </p>\n<p>15. VCR''s do not eject PB&amp;J sandwiches even though TV commercials show<br /> they do. </p>\n<p>16. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes. </p>\n<p>17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving. </p>\n<p>18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is. </p>\n<p>19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do not<br /> like ovens. </p>\n<p>20. The fire department in Austin, TX has a 5 minute response time. </p>\n<p>21. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms dizzy.</p>\n<p>22. It will however make cats dizzy.</p>\n<p>23. Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy

I.<br /> Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern<br /> for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage<br /> by selecting the battlefield. Don''t try to bathe him in an open area where he<br /> can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more<br /> than four feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and<br /> close the sliding -glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A simple<br /> shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower<br /> curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.)<br /> II.<br /> Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from<br /> your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to<br /> protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top construction<br /> boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey face-mask, and a<br /> long-sleeved flak jacket. </p>\n<p>III.<br /> Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply<br /> carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire.<br /> They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule.) </p>\n<p>IV.<br /> . Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a<br /> single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure, slide<br /> the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo. You<br /> have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. </p>\n<p>V.<br /> Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem<br /> is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more than two or<br /> three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember to give<br /> him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He''ll then spring free and<br /> fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national record for<br /> cats is three latherings, so don''t expect too much.) </p>\n<p>IV.<br /> Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this part will<br /> be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point and the<br /> cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple compared<br /> with what you have just been through. That''s because by now the cat is<br /> semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop the drain plug with<br /> your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will<br /> end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing<br /> you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After<br /> all the water is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down<br /> and dry the cat. In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your<br /> leg. He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend a<br /> lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic and<br /> develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine. You will be tempted to assume he<br /> is angry. This isn''t usually the case. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to<br /> get through your defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to<br /> give him a bath. But at least now he smells a lot better

A blonde is overweight, so her doctor puts her on a diet."I want you to eat regularly for two days, then skip a day, and repeat the procedure for two weeks. The next time I see you, you''ll have lost at least five pounds." When the blonde returns, she''s lost nearly 20 pounds. "Why, that''s amazing!" the doctor says. "Did you follow my instructions?" The blonde nods. "I''ll tell you, though, I thought I was going to drop dead that third day." "From hunger, you mean?" said the doctor. "No, from skipping," replied the blonde.

Let''s say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else. </p>\n<p>And then, one evening when they''re driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: ''''Do you realize that, as of tonight, we''ve been seeing each other for exactly six months?'''' </p>\n<p>And then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Gee, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he''s been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I''m trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn''t want, or isn''t sure of. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I''m not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I''d have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward . . . I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person? </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: . . . so that means it was . . . let''s see. .. February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer''s, which means . . . lemme check the odometer . . . Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I''m reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that''s it. That''s why he''s so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He''s afraid of being rejected. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: And I''m gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don''t care what those morons say, it''s still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It''s 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s angry. And I don''t blame him. I''d be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can''t help the way I feel. I''m just not sure. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: They''ll probably say it''s only a 90-day warranty. That''s exactly what they''re gonna say, the rats. </p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: maybe I''m just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I''m sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy. </p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I''ll give them a warranty. I''ll take their warranty and stick it right up their ... </p>\n<p>''''Roger,'''' Elaine says aloud. </p>\n<p>''''What?'''' says Roger, startled. </p>\n<p>''''Please don''t torture yourself like this,'''' she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. ''''Maybe I should never have . . . I feel so . . ." (She breaks down, sobbing.) </p>\n<p>''''What? '' says Roger. </p>\n<p>''''I''m such a fool,'''' Elaine sobs.

There''s no knight, and there''s no horse.'''' </p>\n<p>''''There''s no horse?'''' says Roger. </p>\n<p>''''You think I''m a fool, don''t you?'''' Elaine says. </p>\n<p>''''No!'''' says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer. </p>\n<p>''''It''s just that . . . It''s that I . . . I need some time,'''' Elaine says. (There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.) </p>\n<p>''''Yes,'''' he says. (Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.) </p>\n<p>''''Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?'''' she says. </p>\n<p>''''What way?'''' says Roger. </p>\n<p>''''That way about time,'''' says Elaine. </p>\n<p>''''Oh,'''' says Roger. </p>\n<p>''''Yes.'''' (Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.) </p>\n<p>''''Thank you, Roger,'''' she says. </p>\n<p>''''Thank you,'''' says Roger. </p>\n<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechs he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it''s better if he doesn''t think about it.

They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine''s, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: ''''Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?''''

There was a Blonde, a Brunette, and a Redhead standing on the beach. </p>\n<p>They had decided the previous evening whilst in the pub to try and swim the English channel. </p>\n<p>After some discussion, they decided the quickest way would be to do the breast stroke, so off they set.</p>\n<p>One day later the redhead reached the French coast. </p>\n<p>Having lost sight of the other two swimmers just off the English coast she decided that they couldn''t be far behind so sat on the beach looking out to sea waiting for the other two.</p>\n<p>After a cold night of waiting, the brunette finally came into sight. </p>\n<p>"What took you so long?" inquired the redhead.</p>\n<p>"There were some strong currents out there! But I''m here now! Am I the last?" replied the brunette.</p>\n<p>"No. Blondie is still out there somewhere." They decided to wait.</p>\n<p>Day after day the two swimmers sat on the beach until on the 5th day Blondie came into view. </p>\n<p>Once on dry land the brunette asked the blonde, "What took you so long?"</p>\n<p>"What do you expect? You guy''s cheated," replied the indignant blonde, "You used your hands!"</p>\n<p>Submitted by Curtis<br /> Edited by Calamjo
Because I''m a Guy...</p>\n<p>...I must hold the television remote control in my hand while I watch TV. If the thing has been misplaced, I''ll miss a whole show looking for it, though one time I was able to survive by holding a calculator.</p>\n<p>...when I lock my keys in the car I will fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we call a road service until long after hypothermia has set in. Oh, and when the car isn''t running very well, I will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if I know what I''m looking at. If another guy shows up, one of us will say to the other, "I used to be able to fix these things, but now with all these computers and everything, I wouldn''t know where to start." We will then drink beer.</p>\n<p>...when I catch a cold I need someone to bring me soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan. You never get as sick as I do, so for you this isn''t an issue.</p>\n<p>...I can be relied upon to purchase basic groceries at the store, like milk, or bread. I cannot be expected to find exotic items like "Cumin" or "Tofu." For all I know these are the same thing.  And never, under any circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which "feminine hygiene product" is a euphemism.</p>\n<p>...when one of our appliances stops working I will insist on taking it apart, despite evidence that this will just cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and has to put it back together.</p>\n<p>...I don''t think we''re all that lost, and no, I don''t think we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen to a complete stranger-how the heck could HE know where we''re going?</p>\n<p>...there is no need to ask me what I''m thinking about. The answer is always either sex or football, though I have to make up something else when you ask, so don''t.</p>\n<p>...I do not want to visit your mother, or have your mother come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or think about her any more than I have to. Whatever you got her for mother''s day is ok, I don''t need to see it. Did you remember to pick up something for my mom, too?</p>\n<p>...I am capable of announcing, "one more beer and I really have to go," and mean it every single time I say it, even when it gets to the point that the one bar closes and my buddies and I have to go hunt down another. I will find it increasingly hilarious to have my pals call you to tell you I''ll be home soon, and no, I don''t understand why you threw all my clothes into the front yard. What''s the connection?</p>\n<p>...you don''t have to ask me if I liked the movie. Chances are, if you''re crying at the end of it, I didn''t.</p>\n<p>...I have to turn up the radio when Bruce Springsteen or The Doors comes on, and then, yes, I have to tell you  every single time about how Bruce had his picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek the same day, or how Jim Morrison is buried in Paris and everyone visits his grave. Please do not behave as if you do not find this fascinating.</p>\n<p>...I think what you''re wearing is fine. I thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too. Either pair of shoes is fine. With the belt or without it looks fine. Your hair is fine. You look fine. Can we just go now?</p>\n<p>...and this is, after all, the 90''s, I will share equally in the housework. You do the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning, and the dishes. I''ll do the rest.

EDITOR''S NOTE:  I have no idea why Ridgefield is supposed to be filled with stupid people, feel free to insert your rival town wherever it says Ridgefield.Did you hear the story about the two half-wit brothers (local boys) that strolled into the Ridgefield Sportsman''s Bar one night? The bartender asked them, ''''Do you know what has four arms, four legs and two heads and is really stupid?'''' The brothers shook their heads ''no''. The bartender pointed at them and said, ''''It''s you and your brother.''''   The brothers then decided to pull the same joke on someone else.

"The problem with the designated driver program is it''s not a<br /> desirable job. But if you ever get sucked into doing it, have<br /> fun with it.

A married woman is having an affair. Whenever her lover comes over, she puts her nine-year-old son in the closet. One day, the woman hears a car in the driveway and puts her lover in the closet as well.</p>\n<p>Inside the closet, the little boy says, "It''s dark in here, isn''t it?"<br /> "Yes it is." the man replies.<br /> "You wanna buy a baseball?" the little boy asks.<br /> "No thanks." the man replies.<br /> "I think you do want to buy a baseball" the little extortionist continues.<br /> "Okay. How much?" the man replies, after considering the position he is in. "Twenty-five dollars." the little boy replies.<br /> "Twenty-five dollars!" the man repeats incredulously, but complies to protect his hidden position.</p>\n<p>The following week, the lover is visiting the woman again, when she hears a car in the driveway and again places her lover in the closet with her little boy.<br /> "It''s dark in here, isn''t it?" the boy starts off.<br /> "Yes it is." replies the man.<br /> "Wanna buy a baseball glove?" the little boy asks.<br /> "Okay.

The<br /> husband also notices that her panties have a little wet spot,<br /> meaning she is ready for him</p>\n<p>He tip toes over to her and she is completely unaware of his<br /> presence. He pulls down her panties and begins to lick up her<br /> juices. She is groaning and moaning and shaking her rear at him. </p>\n<p>He gets a hard on and decides to fuck her right then and there.<br /> he whips out his cock and proceeds to fuck her like he never has<br /> before. It went on for hours. When he was finished, he clipped<br /> her over the ear.</p>\n<p>She looked stunned, turned to him and said "What was that for?"</p>\n<p>He replied, "That was for not turning around to see who it was!"
16&gt; The President lets you ride on "Air Force One", if you know what I mean. </p>\n<p>15&gt; Boss not only implements "Casual Fridays" but also "Topless Tuesdays." </p>\n<p>14&gt; You''ve just leapfrogged Al Gore in the line of succession. </p>\n<p>13&gt; "Oooh, yeah, baby -- I''ll make you a White House Secretary...

A priest and a taxi driver both died and went to heaven. St. Peter was at the Pearly gates waiting for them. ''Come with me'', said St. Peter to the taxi driver. The taxi driver did as he was told and followed St. Peter to a mansion. It had anything you could imagine from a bowling alley to an olympic size pool. ''Wow, thank you'', said the taxi driver. Next, St. Peter led the priest to a rugged old shack with a bunk bed and a little old television set. ''Wait, I think you are a little mixed up'', said the priest. ''Shouldn''t I be the one who gets the mansion? After all I was a priest, went to church every day, and preached God''s word.'' ''Yes, that''s true. But during your sermons people slept. When the taxi driver drove, everyone prayed.''

It is hard being black.  </p>\n<p>We get the bad end of the deal with every sport. </p>\n<p>Hockey, you''re slappin a black puck around.  </p>\n<p>Pool, you have a white ball trying to knock you in a hole.  </p>\n<p>The only thing we have is bowling, where you have a black ball trying to knock down ten rednecks. </p>\n<p>Submitted by Curtis<br /> Edited by calamjo
What''s the difference between a blonde and a bowling ball?</p>\n<p>Nothing. They both get fingered, rolled in the gutter and come back for<br /> more.

An American, wearing Bermuda shorts, T-shirt, and a baseball cap, walks into a<br /> caf�酶惟, chewing on gum. He sits next to this French guy who is trying to enjoy his<br /> breakfast and is not in the mood for small talk.<br /> The American, aware of the Frenchman''s mood, tries to be smart. He sees the<br /> man eating a roll with jelly and decides to remark on that.<br /> "You French people eat the entire roll of bread?!" he says in an astonished<br /> tone.<br /> "Yes," replies the Frenchman and resumes eating.<br /> "Not us," says the American. "We only eat the inside and then throw the crust<br /> in a container, process it and sell it to the French as croissants."<br /> The Frenchman calmly ignores him and continues to eat.<br /> "Eww..." says the American, "You eat your bread with that jelly?"<br /> "Yes," says the Frenchman.<br /> "Not us," says the American, "We only eat fresh fruits. Then we throw the peal<br /> in a container, process it and sell it to the French as jelly."<br /> "Really?" says the Frenchman, "And what do you do with your used condoms?"<br /> Taken aback, the American says, "Uhh... we just throw them away."<br /> "Not us," said the Frenchman, "We throw them in a container, process them, and<br /> sell it as gum to the Americans."

"How was your golf game, dear?" asked Jack''s wife Tracy.</p>\n<p>"Well, I was hitting pretty well, but my eyesight''s gotten so bad, I<br /> couldn''t see where the ball went."</p>\n<p>"You''re seventy-five years old, Jack!" admonished his wife. "Why don''t you<br /> take my brother Scott along?"</p>\n<p>"But he''s eighty-five and doesn''t even play golf anymore," protested Jack.</p>\n<p>"Yes, but he''s got perfect eyesight and can watch your ball for you,"<br /> Tracy pointed out.</p>\n<p>The next day Jack teed off with Scott looking on. Jack swung and the ball<br /> disappeared down the middle of the fairway. "Did you see where it went?"<br /> asked Jack.</p>\n<p>"Yup," Scott answered.</p>\n<p>"Well, where is it?" yelled Jack, peering off into the distance.</p>\n<p>"I forgot."
For years and years they told me, Be careful of your breasts. Don''t ever squeeze or bruise them. And give them monthly tests.So I heeded all their warnings, And protected them by law. Guarded them very carefully, And I always wore my bra.After 30 years of astute care, My gyno, Dr. Pruitt, Said I should get a Mammogram."O.K," I said, "let''s do it.""Stand up here real close" she said, (She got my boob in line,) "And tell me when it hurts," she said, "Ah yes! Right there, that''s fine."She stepped upon a pedal, I could not believe my eyes! A plastic plate came slamming down, My hooter''s in a vice!My skin was stretched and mangled, From underneath my chin. My poor boob was being squashed, To Swedish Pancake thin.Excruciating pain I felt, Within it''s vice-like grip. A prisoner in this vicious thing, My poor defenseless tit!"Take a deep breath" she said to me, Who does she think she''s kidding?!? My chest is mashed in her machine, And woozy I am getting."There, that''s good," I heard her say, (The room was slowly swaying.) "Now, let''s have a go at the other one." Have mercy, I was praying.It squeezed me from both up and down, It squeezed me from both sides. I''ll bet SHE''S never had this done, To HER tender little hide.Next time that they make me do this, I will request a blindfold. I have no wish to see again, My knockers getting steamrolled.If I had no problem when I came in, I surely have one now. If there had been a cyst in there, It would have gone "ker-pow!"This machine was created by a man, Of this, I have no doubt. I''d like to stick his balls in there, And see how THEY come out.
A redneck is walking along the beach in France. There are many beautiful women<br /> lying in the sun, and he really wants to meet one. But try as he might, the<br /> women don''t seem to be at all interested. Finally, as a last resort, he walks up<br /> to a French guy lying on the beach who is surrounded by adoring women.<br /> "Excuse me," he says, taking the guy aside, "but I''ve been trying to meet one<br /> of those women for about an hour now, and I just can''t seem to get anywhere with<br /> them. You''re French. You know these women. What do they want?"<br /> "Maybe I can help a little beet," says the Frenchman. "What you do eyes you go<br /> to zee store.

A redneck is walking along the beach in France. There are many beautiful women<br /> lying in the sun, and he really wants to meet one. But try as he might, the<br /> women don''t seem to be at all interested. Finally, as a last resort, he walks up<br /> to a French guy lying on the beach who is surrounded by adoring women.<br /> "Excuse me," he says, taking the guy aside, "but I''ve been trying to meet one<br /> of those women for about an hour now, and I just can''t seem to get anywhere with<br /> them. You''re French. You know these women. What do they want?"<br /> "Maybe I can help a little beet," says the Frenchman. "What you do eyes you go<br /> to zee store. You buy a little bikini seeming suit. You walk up and down zee<br /> beach. You meet girl very weekly zees way."<br /> "Wow! Thanks!" says the redneck, and off he goes to the store.

I, THE UNDERSIGNED, AGREE THAT... 1. In the unlikely event of my not having an orgasm after you''ve drunkenly rolled on top of me and pumped away for five minutes, wheezing like an old man with emphysema, I shall politely fake one. And it''ll be a really good act too, with me saying stuff like "So THIS is screwing!" and howling like a cat that''s being repeatedly jabbed with a needle. 2. I fully understand that a woman''s main role in any relationship is to take the blame. So when you stub your toe in the bathroom or your football teams lose, I agree that - by some complex scientific equation incomprehensible to woman - it will be my fault. Even if I wasn''t there. 3. Whenever my friends and I get together for a girlie chat, I will tell them that you are better hung than a large-balled Himalayan yak. 4. And I will also mention this to YOUR friends. A lot. 5. After sex (which I will NEVER refer to as "making love"), I will not expect you to cuddle me for hours till your arm goes dead. Nor will I let my hair annoyingly get in your face. 6. I will never, ever give your penis a "cute" nickname. 7. In bed, I will be happy as can be to try any novel sexual position you fancy. Especially ones where I do all the work and you just lie there, grinning. 8. I will ruthlessly interrogate my attractive female friends and inform you if any of them have the slightest bisexual tendencies. Then I''ll invite them around for dinner. And hide their car keys so they have to stay. 9. After we split up, I will never sleep with any of your friends or colleagues. Or anyone else you have ever met. Or may one day meet. And if men attempt to chat me up, I will solemnly inform them that you have "ruined me for other men." 10. I understand that mechanical objects like cars, computers, and remote control devices are beyond the comprehension of women. I will only make a fool of myself if I attempt to operate them, so you''re in charge of the lot. Except for the oven, iron and the washing machine, of course.

One day in the future, Bill Clinton has a heart attack, dies prematurely --<br /> and goes straight to Hell. The Devil greets him, but says "I don''t know<br /> exactly what to do with you. Of course you are on my list, so you will have<br /> to stay -- but you got here a little earlier than I expected and I don''t have<br /> your room ready yet."</p>\n<p>The Devil thinks for a moment and says, "Tell you what I can do. There are a<br /> couple folks here who weren''t quite as bad as you were. I can let one of them<br /> go so long as you take their place. I''ll even let you decide who gets to<br /> leave."</p>\n<p>Clinton thought that sounded pretty good, so the Devil opened the first room.<br /> In it was Ted Kennedy and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and<br /> surfacing empty handed. Over and over and over. Such was his fate in hell.</p>\n<p>"No," Bill said. "I don''t think so. I''m not a good swimmer and I don''t think<br /> I could be doing that all day long."</p>\n<p>The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Newt Gingrich with a<br /> sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, over<br /> and over again.</p>\n<p>"No, I''ve got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if<br /> all I could do was break rocks all day," said Bill.</p>\n<p>The devil opened a third door. In it, Clinton�酶惟saw Jesse Jackson, lying on the<br /> floor with his arms staked over his head, and his legs staked in a spread<br /> eagle position. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.</p>\n<p>His eyes widening in disbelief, Clinton grinned as he took in the whole<br /> picture and said, "Oh yea, I know can handle this."</p>\n<p>The Devil nodded and smiled. "OK, Monica, you''re free to go!"

Dear Bill: As a fellow Southern Baptist, I can sympathize with your predicament. Although when I was president I merely lusted in my heart, I have to admit that had I served another term, my lust might have broken free and moved down my body. God bless you in this time of trial. </p>\n<p>Jimmy Carter </p>\n<p>--------------------- </p>\n<p>Dear Bill: OK, so I''ll never be president, but at least Donna Rice was a babe! </p>\n<p>Gary Hart </p>\n<p>---------------------- </p>\n<p>My Dear Chap: This is a bit of a sticky wicket, but if I were you, I should ask that charming Jay Leno fellow to see you through. Pop onto his show, admit that you made an ass of yourself and all will be forgiven. </p>\n<p>Hugh Grant </p>\n<p>---------------------- </p>\n<p>Bill: They entrapped me, they framed me, they caught me in a motel with drugs and a prostitute, but I bounced back and so can you! Bitch done set us up! </p>\n<p>Mayor Marion Berry </p>\n<p>---------------------- </p>\n<p>Dear Bill: Look at the bright side. At least you weren''t caught wearing Monica''s thong underwear. By the way, did you catch my sports show? I''m back on TV for the fall.</p>\n<p>Marv Albert </p>\n<p>---------------------- </p>\n<p>Dear Mr. President: You may have noticed that I''m not jumping on the impeachment bandwagon (note: this was written a week ago). Let me assure you, you''re not the only one in Congress who thinks oral sex isn''t really sex. </p>\n<p>Warm personal regards, </p>\n<p>Newt </p>\n<p>---------------------------- </p>\n<p>Dear Bill: Hang in there, pal! By the way, Kathie Lee sends Hillary her regards and invites her to come on her show anytime. </p>\n<p>Frank Gifford </p>\n<p>--------------------------- </p>\n<p>Dear Mr. President: Now I''m on the Supreme Court.

What is Monica Lewinsky''s favorite instrument?<br /> Well, she''s pretty good on the skin flute, but she really sucks on the organ.
A friend just got back from a holiday ski trip to Colorado.One of the women in<br /> the group complained to her husband that she was in dire need of a restroom. He<br /> told her not to worry, that he was sure there was relief waiting at the top of<br /> the lift in the form of a powder room for female skiers in distress. He was<br /> wrong, of course, and the pain did not go away.</p>\n<p>Her husband, picking up on the intensity of the pain, suggested that since she<br /> was wearing an all-white ski outfit, she should go off in the woods. No one<br /> would even notice, he assured her. The white will provide more than adequate<br /> camouflage. So she headed for the tree line, began disrobing and proceeded to do<br /> her thing. If you''ve ever parked on the side of a slope, then you know there is<br /> a right way and wrong way to set up your skis so you don''t move. Yup, you got<br /> it. She had them positioned the wrong way.</p>\n<p>Without warning, the woman found herself skiing backward, out-of-control,<br /> racing through the trees, somehow missing all of them, and into another slope.<br /> Her derriere and the reverse side were still bare, her pants down around her<br /> knees, and she was picking up speed all the while.</p>\n<p>She continued on backwards, totally out-of-control, creating an unusual vista<br /> for the other skiers. The woman skied, if you define that verb loosely, back<br /> under the lift and finally collided violently with a pylon. The bad news was<br /> that she broke her arm and was unable to pull up her ski pants. At long last her<br /> husband arrived, put an end to her nudie show, then went to the base of the<br /> mountain and summoned the ski patrol, who transported her to a hospital.</p>\n<p>In the emergency room she was regrouping when a man with an obviously broken<br /> leg was put in the bed next to hers. "So. How did you break your leg?" she<br /> asked, making small talk.</p>\n<p>"It was the darndest thing you ever saw," he said. "I was riding up this ski<br /> lift, and suddenly I couldn''t believe my eyes. There was this crazy woman skiing<br /> backward out-of-control down the mountain with her bare bottom hanging out of<br /> her clothes, and pants down around her knees. I leaned over to get a better look<br /> and I guess I didn''t realize how far I''d moved. I fell out of the lift ... "</p>\n<p>" ... So, how did you break your arm?"

A 60-year-old man went to the doctor for a check-up. The doctor told him, "You''re in terrific shape. There''s nothing wrong with you. Why, you might live forever. You have the body of a 35 year old. By the way, how old was your father when he died?" </p>\n<p>The 60 year old responded, "Who said he was dead?"</p>\n<p>The doctor was surprised and asked, "How old is he and is he very active?"</p>\n<p>The 60 year old responded, "Well, he is 82 years old and he still goes skiing three times a season and surfing three times a week during the summer."</p>\n<p>The doctor couldn''t believe it. "Well, how old was your grandfather when he died?"<br /> The 60 year old responded again, "Who said he was dead?"</p>\n<p>The doctor was astonished. He said, "You mean to tell me you are 60 years old and both your father and your grandfather are alive? Is your grandfather very active?"</p>\n<p>The 60 year old said, "He goes skiing at least once a season and surfing once a week during the summer. Not only that," said the patient, "my grandfather is 106 years old, and next week he is getting married again."</p>\n<p>The doctor said, "At 106 years old, why on earth would your grandfather want to get married?"</p>\n<p>His patient looked up at the doctor and said, "Who said he wanted to?"

SEATTLE''S TURKEY DAY ETIQUETTE It''s been 145 years since the first white settlers landed at Alki Beach at Thanksgiving time, took one look at the overcast skies and the sodden, rain-soaked West Seattle terrain, and burst into tears.(History, alas, doesn''t record the response of the Native Americans when they spotted those tear-drenched settlers. But they probably were too polite to laugh out loud.)In the intervening years, the first residents and the settlers have worked out the rules for Thanksgiving, Puget Sound style. Here they are, recently updated by an ad hoc Turkey Day committee:DRESS CODE. Thanksgiving Day guests will arrive wearing Seattle tuxes: clean jeans, turtleneck sweaters and down jackets with weathered ski-lift tags. Hiking boots are optional.CONVERSATION''S GAMBIT. Topics will include: 1) the election; 2) previous elections; and, 3) the next election. Several arguments will ensue before the host or hostess declares politics ''off-limits.''CLEANERS'' COROLLARY. Spills will happen in direct proportion to the staining capacity of the dish (cranberry sauce rates high) and the expense of dry cleaning the garment.CHRISTMAS CONVENTION. If you are attending a family gathering, expect this reminder: ''Don''t forget to bring your Christmas list to Thanksgiving dinner.''MEOW''S MOMENT. The family cat will appear long enough to 1) shed hair on anyone wearing a black or navy-blue sweater; 2) perch on the lap of whoever most dislikes cats; and, 3) insist on sharing the smoked-salmon hors d''oeuvres.OLD-TIMERS'' LAMENT. Some oldster in the group will remark that it''s a rotten shame there''s no longer a Turkey Day football game between Puget Sound and Seattle high-school champs.ELBOW''S LAW. Local custom calls for every left-handed diner to be seated to the right of a right-handed diner, maximizing chances for spills.PORCELAIN''S PROGRESS. At least two different patterns of dinnerware must be visible on Puget Sound tables during every course.SALAD LAW. Tossed salads supplied by guests will arrive with an excess of moisture, supplied by ambient rainfall.  If the day is merely overcast, the host or hostess should add water before serving.MOLDED SALAD LAW. Guaranteed to do one of three things: contain miniature marshmallows, fail to unmold properly, or slide off the serving plate onto the lap of one of the diners.GRAVY''S CONSTANT. The silver gravy boat -- a wedding present from Great Aunt Emma and Uncle Ed -- will vanish before the meal. It will show up next summer when you''re searching for beach towels.TURKEY''S GRIPE. One vegetarian guest will complain about the fare, saying, ''Why can''t we ever have tofu au gratin?''PIE''S PARADOX. Provide two kinds of pie and diners will either decline or ask for ''a sliver of both.''POLLYANNA''S PRINCIPLE. Guests will include one orphan, someone from out of town who can''t make it home. If no orphan is available, the family oddball can substitute.REFRIGERATOR''S RULE. After all guests depart, at least one never-served dish will turn up in the refrigerator.DEPARTURE''S RULE. Some guests will arrive very early; some will show up late. But they''ll all leave at the same time.

Little Johnny was 12 years old and, like other boys his age, was rather<br /> curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about "courting" from older boys and he<br /> wondered what it was like and how it was done. One day he took his question to<br /> his mother who became rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny,<br /> his mother told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older<br /> sister and her boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described<br /> everything to his mom. "Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile then he<br /> turned off most of the lights. He then started hugging and kissing her. I<br /> figured Sis must be getting sick because her face started to look funny. He must<br /> have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart<br /> just like the doctor would do. He was not as smart as a doctor because he seemed<br /> to be having trouble finding it. "I guess he was getting sick too because pretty<br /> soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand<br /> must have been cold because he put it in her skirt. About this time Sis got<br /> worse and began to moan and groan and squirm around and slide down towards the<br /> end of the couch. This is when the fever started. "I knew it was the fever<br /> because Sis said she felt real hot. Finally I found out what was making them so<br /> sick. A big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his<br /> pants and stood there, about 10 inches long, honest. Anyway, he grabbed it in<br /> one hand to keep it from getting away. "When Sis saw it, she got real scared,<br /> her eyes got big and her mouth fell open and started calling to God and stuff.<br /> She said it was the biggest one she ever saw...... I should have told her about<br /> the one down at the lake. "Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its<br /> head off. All of a sudden she made a noise and let the eel go. I guess it bit<br /> her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while her<br /> boyfriend took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel`s head to<br /> keep it from biting again. "Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a<br /> scissor lock on it and he helped by laying on top of the eel. The eel put up a<br /> hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost<br /> upset the couch. I guess he wanted to kill it by squeezing it between them.<br /> "After a while they both quit moving and a great sigh came forth. Her boyfriend<br /> got up, and sure enough, the eel was dead. I knew it was dead because it just<br /> hung there limp with some of its insides hanging out. "Sis and her boyfriend<br /> were a little tired from the battle but they went on courting anyways. He<br /> started hugging and kissing her again. By golly the eel wasn`t dead after all.<br /> It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats<br /> with 9-lives. "This time Sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on<br /> it. After 35 minutes of struggling, they finally killed it. I knew it was dead<br /> because I saw Sis`s boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the<br /> toilet....."

A recent Scottish immigrant attends his first baseball game in his new country<br /> and after a base hit he hears the fans roaring "Run....run!"<br /> The next batter connects heavily with the ball and the Scotsman stands up and<br /> roars with the crowd in his thick accent: "R-r-run ya bastard, r-run will ya!"<br /> A third batter slams a hit and again the Scotsman, obviously pleased with his<br /> knowledge of the game, screams: "R-r-run ya bastard, r-r-run will ya!"<br /> The next batter held his swing at three and two and as the ump calls a walk.<br /> The Scotsman stands up yelling: "R-r-run ya Bastard, r-r-run!"

Two dyslexics were on the ski slope unsure of which way to ski down the<br /> hill.  They spot another man and go over to ask him.  "When we go down<br /> the slope do we zig zog or do we zog zag??" asked one of them.  "Don''t<br /> ask me", said the man, "I''m a tobogannist".</p>\n<p>  "In that case then, I''ll have 20 Cuban cigars and a box of matches please".
Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like? </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse and a miniskirt and high heels. My measurements are 36-24-36. I work out every day. I''m toned and perfect. What do you look like? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m 6''3" and about 250 pounds. I wear glasses and I have on a pair of blue sweatpants I just bought at Walmart. I am also wearing a T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from dinner - it smells a little funny. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: OK. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: We''re in my bedroom. There''s soft music playing on the stereo and candles on my dresser and night table. I''m looking up into your eyes, smiling. My hand works its down to your crotch and begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m gulping. I''m beginning to sweat. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: Now I''m unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m moaning softly. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk slides off my warm skin. I''m rubbing your bulge faster, pulling and rubbing. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and I accidently rip a hole in your blouse. I''m sorry. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: That''s OK, it wasn''t really too expensive. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ll pay for it. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Don''t worry about it. I''m wearing a lacy black bra. My soft breasts are rising and falling, rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m fumbling with the clasp on your bra. I think it''s stuck. Do you have any scissors? </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly. I''m reaching back and undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my breasts. My nipples are erect for you. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: How did you do that? I''m picking up the bra and inspecting the clasp. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your tongue all over me. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m dropping the bra. Now I''m licking your, you know, breasts. They''re neat! </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m running my fingers through your hair. Now I''m nibbling your ear. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breasts are covered with spit. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: What? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m so sorry. Really. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m wiping your spit off my breasts with the remains of my blouse. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with a ''plop''</p>\n<p>Sweetheart: OK. I''m pulling your sweatpants down and rubbing your hard tool. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee! </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over, in and out, nibbling on your ... umm ... wait a minute. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: What''s the matter? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ve got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I''m choking. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Are you OK? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m having a coughing fit. I''m turning all red. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Can I help?</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I''m fumbling through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups? </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m drinking a cup of water. There, that''s better. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m washing the cup now. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m on the bed, aching for you. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m drying the cup. Now I''m putting it back in the cabinet. And now I''m walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it''s dark. I''m lost. Where''s the bedroom? </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I found it. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m tugging off your pants. I''m moaning. I want you so badly. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: Me too. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately - our naked bodies pressing against each other. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Why don''t you take off you glasses? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: OK, but I can''t see very well without them. I place the glasses on the night table. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby! </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I have to pee. I''m fumbling my way blindly across the room and toward the bathroom. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I find the bathroom. It''s dark. I''m feeling around for the toilet. I lift the lid. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m waiting eagerly for your return. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m done going. I''m feeling around for the flush handle, but I can''t find it. Uh-oh! </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: What''s the matter now? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ve realized that I''ve peed into your laundry hamper. Sorry again. I''m walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my way. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: OK, now I''m going to put my ... you know ... thing ... in your ... you know ... woman''s thing. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it! </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss your neck. Umm, I''m having a little trouble here. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can''t stand it another second! Slide it in! Screw me now! </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m flaccid. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: What? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m limp. I can''t sustain an erection. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m standing up and turning around, an incredulous look on my face. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m shrugging with a sad look on my face, my weiner all floppy. I''m going to get my glasses and see what''s wrong. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: No, never mind. I''m getting dressed. I''m putting on my underwear. Now I''m putting on my wet, nasty blouse. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: No wait! Now I''m squinting, trying to find the night table. I''m feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray, picture frames and your candles. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m buttoning my blouse. Now I''m putting on my shoes. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ve found my glasses. I''m putting them on. My God! One of your candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I''m pointing at it, a shocked look on my face. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Go to hell. I''m logging off, you loser! </p>\n<p>Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!

The teacher asked</p>\n<p>We responded,"You told us to rip the flag off anyone who had balls."</p>\n<p>Submitted by Lol_Girl_72<br /> Edited by Calamjo
A man recently bought a bull elephant for 50 grand. He decided to make big bucks out of the elephant. He trained the elephant not to jump no matter what then he set up a challenge to make the elephant jump. The prize money was 10 grand. To play this game, the challenger must pay 1 grand to the guy before playing. Lots of people came and tried all sorts of tricks to make the elephant jump but without success. Until the a guy show up and decided to take up this challenge. He paid the elephant owner 1 grand and went to his car and took out a golf club. He held the club behind him and walked around the elephant. After walking around the elephant a few times, he stopped right behind the elephant. He raised his club and swung as hard as he could right smack between the elephant''s hind legs. Being a bull elephant, it leaped twenty feet into the air and landed with a crash. The elephant owner, disgusted with the elephant''s performance, paid the guy with the golf club his 10 k. After that, the elephant owner decided to create another challenge. The prize money was now double but so was fee required to pay. This time, the challenge was to make the elephant shake it''s head. Again, lots of people came to make the elephant shake it''s head and they all failed until the same guy with the golf club came again. He paid the elephant owner 2 grand and once again took out his golf club. Once again, the guy with the golf club walked aroung the elephant. This time, he stopped in front of the elephant. "Hello." The guy said. "Remember me?" The elephant nodded. "Remember this golf club?" The guy asked, showing the elephant his glof club. The elephant nodded. "Remember what I did to you the last time?" The elephant nodded nervously. Then the guy said "DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT AGAIN?!"
A man and wife were playing in their golf club''s annual "Guys and Dolls" tournament. The man was not happy about having to play, but his wife had insisted. On the 12th tee, his patience had reached its limit. While his wife wasted time on the ladies tee, he decided to go ahead and hit his drive from the men''s. Unfortunately, he misjudged his shot and his ball hit his wife in the back of the head, killing her instantly. At the hospital the doctor came to talk to the husband."Mr. Davies, we found a golf ball lodged 3 inches into your wife''s brain, which was the cause of death. But, we have found something else that really puzzles us." "What is it?" asked Mr. Davies. "Well," said the doctor, "We also found a golf ball lodged 6 inches into her anal cavity." The husband dismissed the doctor with a wave of his hand "Oh, that was just my Mulligan!"
An old man of 87 went to the hospital to get a radical new surgical procedure done where they stretch the skin and pull all the wrinkles up onto the top of the scalp making you appear years younger.</p>\n<p>On his way out of the hospital, he met an old friend who didn''t recognize him at first. "Rob, is that really you?" said the friend. "You look years younger. I didn''t know you had a dimple in your chin."</p>\n<p>"It''s not a dimple, it''s my belly button" said the old man and his friend laughed.</p>\n<p>"If you think that''s funny, take a look at what I''m wearing for a tie!"
Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event. It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler''s trainer came to him and said, ''Now don''t forget all the research we''ve done on this Russian. He''s never  lost a match because of this pretzel hold he has. Whatever  you do, don''t let him get you in this hold! If he does, you''re finished!'' The wrestler nodded in agreement. The American and the Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn''t watch the ending. Suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian''s back hit the mat with a  thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him,  getting the pin and winning the match. The trainer was  astounded! When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asks, ''How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!'' The wrestler answered, ''Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. ''I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could; and you would be amazed how strong  you get when you bite your own balls!''

A young man joined the Army and signed up with the paratroopers. He went<br /> though the standard training, completed the practice jumps from higher and<br /> higher structures, and finally went to take his first jump from an<br /> airplane. The next day, he called home to his father to tell him the news.</p>\n<p>"So, did you jump?" The father asked. </p>\n<p>"Well, let me tell you what happened. We got up in the plane, and the<br /> sergeant opened up the door and asked for volunteers. About a dozen men<br /> got up and just walked out of the plane!" </p>\n<p>"Is that when you jumped?" Asked the father.</p>\n<p>"Um, not yet. Then the sergeant started to grab the other men one at a<br /> time and throw them out the door."</p>\n<p>"Did you jump then?" Asked the father. </p>\n<p>"I''m getting to that. Every one else had jumped, and I was the last man<br /> left on the plane. I told the sergeant that I was too scared to jump. He<br /> told me to get off the plane or he''d kick my butt." </p>\n<p>"So, did you jump?"</p>\n<p>"Not then. He tried to push me out of the plane, but I grabbed onto the<br /> door and refused to go. Finally he called over the Jump Master. The Jump<br /> Master is this great big guy, about six-foot five, and 275 pounds. He said<br /> to me, ''Boy, are you gonna jump or not?'' I said, ''No, sir. I''m too<br /> scared.'' So the Jump Master pulled down his zipper and took his penis out.<br /> I swear, it was about ten inches long and as big around as a baseball bat!<br /> He said, `''Boy, either you jump out that door, or I''m sticking this little<br /> baby up your ass.''"</p>\n<p>"So, did you jump?" Asked the father. </p>\n<p>"Well, a little, at first, but then I got used to it."
A young woman in a REALLY skimpy skirt is at the bus stop. When the bus arrives and the doors open she tries to climb the steps. However, her skirt is too tight and her legs can''t move. So she reaches behind her and undoes her zipper.</p>\n<p>She tries to step up again, and still can''t, so she reaches behind again and plays with the zipper. </p>\n<p>She tries to climb the steps again...still no luck. </p>\n<p>So as she''s reaching behind again, a pair of strong hands pick her up and place her on the top step. </p>\n<p>"What do you think you''re doing?", she asks the guy behind her. </p>\n<p>"Well, I figured the second time you undid my fly we were at least good friends!"

Subject: a day at the gym</p>\n<p>Dear Diary,</p>\n<p>For my forty fifth birthday this year, my wife (the dear) purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me. </p>\n<p>Although I am still in great shape since playing on my college football team 20 yrs ago, I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try.</p>\n<p>I called the club and made my reservation with a personal trainer named Belinda, who identified herself as a 26 yr old aerobics instructor and model for athletic clothing and swimwear. </p>\n<p>My wife seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started! The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress.</p>\n<p>MONDAY:</p>\n<p>Started my day at 6:00am.</p>\n<p>Tough to get out of bed, but it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Belinda waiting for me. She was something of a Greek goddess - with blonde hair, dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile. Woo Hoo!!!!!</p>\n<p>Belinda gave me a tour and showed me the machines. She took my pulse after 5 minutes on the treadmill. She was alarmed that my pulse was so fast, but I attributed it to standing next to her in her Lycra aerobics outfit. </p>\n<p>I enjoyed watching the skillful way in which she conducted her aerobics class after my workout today. Very inspiring, Belinda was encouraging as I did my sit-ups, l though my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time she was around. </p>\n<p>This is going to be a FANTASTIC week!!</p>\n<p>TUESDAY:</p>\n<p>I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out the door. Belinda made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air, and then she put weights on it! My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made the full mile. Belinda''s rewarding smile made it all worthwhile. </p>\n<p>I feel GREAT!! It ''s a whole new life for me.</p>\n<p>WEDNESDAY:</p>\n<p>The only way I can brush my teeth is by lying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I believe I have a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was OK as long as I didn�酶惟t try to steer or stop. I parked on top of a GEO in the club parking lot. </p>\n<p>Belinda was impatient with me, insisting that my screams bothered other club members.  Her voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when she scolds, she gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying.</p>\n<p>My chest hurts when I got on the treadmill, so Belinda put me on the stair monster. Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators? </p>\n<p>Belinda told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life. She said some other shit too.</p>\n<p>THURSDAY:</p>\n<p>Belinda was waiting for me with her vampire-like teeth exposed as her thin, cruel lips were pulled back in a full snarl. I couldn''t help being a half an hour late; it took me that long to tie my shoes. </p>\n<p>Belinda took me to work out with dumbbells. When she was not looking, I ran and hid in the men''s room. She sent Lars to find me, then, as punishment, put me on the rowing machine - which I sank.</p>\n<p>FRIDAY:</p>\n<p>I hate that bitch Belinda more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. Stupid, skinny, anemic little cheerleader. </p>\n<p>If there were a part of my body I could move without unbearable pain, I would beat her with it. Belinda wanted me to work on my triceps. I<br /> don''t have any triceps! And if you don''t want dents in the floor, don''t hand me the *&amp;%#(#&amp;**!!@*@. Barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich. (Which I am sure you learned in the sadistic school you attended<br /> and graduated magna cumlaude from.)</p>\n<p>The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and nutrition teacher. Why couldn�酶惟t it have been someone softer, like the drama coach or the choir director?</p>\n<p>SATURDAY:</p>\n<p>Belinda left a message on my answering machine in her grating, shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today. Just hearing her made me want to smash the machine with my planner. However, I lacked the strength to even<br /> use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the Weather Channel.</p>\n<p>SUNDAY:</p>\n<p>I''m having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can go and thank GOD that this week is over. I will also pray that next year, my wife (the bitch), will choose a gift for me that is fun - like a root canal or a vasectomy. </p>\n<p>Submitted by NJGin<br /> Edited by BreeBrown

Subject: a day at the gym</p>\n<p>Dear Diary,</p>\n<p>For my forty fifth birthday this year, my wife (the dear) purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me. </p>\n<p>Although I am still in great shape since playing on my college football team 20 yrs ago, I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try.</p>\n<p>I called the club and made my reservation with a personal trainer named Belinda, who identified herself as a 26 yr old aerobics instructor and model for athletic clothing and swimwear. </p>\n<p>My wife seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started! The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress.</p>\n<p>MONDAY:</p>\n<p>Started my day at 6:00am.</p>\n<p>Tough to get out of bed, but it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Belinda waiting for me. She was something of a Greek goddess - with blonde hair, dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile. Woo Hoo!!!!!</p>\n<p>Belinda gave me a tour and showed me the machines. She took my pulse after 5 minutes on the treadmill. She was alarmed that my pulse was so fast, but I attributed it to standing next to her in her Lycra aerobics outfit. </p>\n<p>I enjoyed watching the skillful way in which she conducted her aerobics class after my workout today. Very inspiring, Belinda was encouraging as I did my sit-ups, l though my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time she was around. </p>\n<p>This is going to be a FANTASTIC week!!</p>\n<p>TUESDAY:</p>\n<p>I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out the door. Belinda made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air, and then she put weights on it! My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made the full mile. Belinda''s rewarding smile made it all worthwhile. </p>\n<p>I feel GREAT!! It ''s a whole new life for me.</p>\n<p>WEDNESDAY:</p>\n<p>The only way I can brush my teeth is by lying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I believe I have a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was OK as long as I didn�酶惟t try to steer or stop. I parked on top of a GEO in the club parking lot. </p>\n<p>Belinda was impatient with me, insisting that my screams bothered other club members.  Her voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when she scolds, she gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying.</p>\n<p>My chest hurts when I got on the treadmill, so Belinda put me on the stair monster.

This 85 year old couple, having been married almost 60 years, had died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years mainly due to her interest in health food, and exercise. When they reached the pearly gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and master bath suite and Jacuzzi. </p>\n<p>As they "oohed and aahed" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost. </p>\n<p>"It''s free," Peter replied, "this is Heaven." </p>\n<p>Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. </p>\n<p>The old man asked, "what are the green fees?". </p>\n<p>Peter''s reply, "This is heaven, you play for free." </p>\n<p>Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine''s of the world laid out. "How much to eat?" asked the old man. </p>\n<p>"Don''t you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!" Peter replied with some exasperation. </p>\n<p>"Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?" the old man asked timidly. </p>\n<p>Peter lectured, "That''s the best part...you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven." </p>\n<p>With that the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and shrieking wildly. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong. </p>\n<p>The old man looked at his wife and said, "This is all your fault. If it weren''t for your bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!"
The 5 questions most feared by men are:<br /> 1...What are you thinking about?<br /> 2...Do you love me?<br /> 3...Do I look fat?<br /> 4...Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5...What would you do if I died?</p>\n<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly(i.e., tells the truth).</p>\n<p>As a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible Responses.</p>\n<p>Question # 1:  What are you thinking about?</p>\n<p>The proper answer to this, of course, is: "I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you."<br /> This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer,which most likely is one of the following:<br /> a...Baseball.<br /> b...Football.<br /> c...How fat you are.<br /> d...How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e...How I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, "If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!"</p>\n<p>Question # 2:  Do you love me?</p>\n<p>The proper response is: "YES!" or, if you feel a more detailed  answer is in order, "Yes, dear." Inappropriate responses include:<br /> a...Oh Yeah, crap loads.<br /> b...Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> c...That depends on what you mean by love.<br /> d...Does it matter?<br /> e...Who, me?</p>\n<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat?</p>\n<p>The correct answer is an emphatic: "Of course not!"<br /> Among the incorrect answers are:<br /> a...Compared to what?<br /> b...I wouldn''t call you fat, but you''re not exactly thin.<br /> c...A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d...I''ve seen fatter.<br /> e...Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question # 4: Do you think she''s prettier than me?</p>\n<p>Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: "Of course not!"<br /> Incorrect responses include:</p>\n<p>a...Yes, but you have a better personality.<br /> b...Not prettier, but definitely thinner.<br /> c...Not as pretty as you when you were her age.<br /> d...Define pretty.<br /> e...Could you repeat the question?  I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question # 5: What would you do if I died?</p>\n<p>A definite no-win question.(The real answer, of course, is "Buy a Corvette and a Boat").<br /> WARNING: No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:</p>\n<p>WOMAN: Would you get married again?<br /> MAN: Definitely not!<br /> WOMAN: Why not-don''t you like being married?<br /> MAN: Of course I do.<br /> WOMAN: Then why wouldn''t you remarry?<br /> MAN: Okay, I''d get married again.<br /> WOMAN: You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)<br /> WOMAN: Would you sleep with her in our bed?<br /> MAN: Where else would we sleep?<br /> WOMAN: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?<br /> MAN: That would seem like the proper thing to do.<br /> WOMAN: And would you let her use my golf clubs?<br /> MAN: She can''t use them; she''s left-handed<br /> WOMAN: - - - silence - - -<br /> MAN: Oh  ( expletive deleted).

A women desperately looking for work goes into a toy factory.</p>\n<p>The Personnel Manager goes over her resume and explains to her that he regrets<br /> he has nothing worthy of her. The woman answers that she really needs work and<br /> will take almost anything. The Personnel Manager hems and haws and finally says<br /> he does have a low skill job on the Tickle-Me-Elmo line and nothing else. The<br /> woman happily accepts. He takes her down to the line and explains her duties and<br /> that she should come in at 8am the next day.</p>\n<p>The next day at 8:45 there''s a knock at the Personnel Manager''s door. The<br /> Tickle-Me-Elmo line manager comes in and starts ranting about the woman just<br /> hired. After screaming for 15 minutes about how badly backed up the assembly<br /> line is, the Personnel Manager suggested he be shown the problem. </p>\n<p>Together they head down to the line and sure enough Elmos are backed up from<br /> here to kingdom come. Right at the end of the line is the woman just hired. She<br /> has pulled over a roll of the material used for the Elmos and has a big bag of<br /> marbles. They both watch as she cuts a little piece of fabric and take 2 marbles<br /> and starts sewing them between Elmo''s legs.</p>\n<p>The Personnel Manager starts to kill himself laughing and finally after 20<br /> minutes of rolling around, he pulls himself together and walks over to the new<br /> employee and says, "I''m sorry, I guess you misunderstood me yesterday. What I<br /> wanted you to do was give Elmo two test tickles."
A young man, who worked at a driving range, picked up a couple of dozen old balls one day and took them home with him, stuffing them into his pants pockets.<br /> On the bus on his way home, an elderly old lady sat down next to him, so he had to scrunch them up to make room for her. He noticed after a while the lady was glancing sideways toward his pockets. A bit embarrassed, he said to the lady, "It`s all right ma`am, they`re just golf balls."</p>\n<p>She nodded and smiled sympathetically and a few moments later said, "Tell me - is that something like tennis elbow?"

An Army Ranger was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana and he wanted a pair<br /> of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the<br /> high prices the local vendors were asking.<br /> After becoming very frustrated with the "no haggle" attitude of one of the<br /> shopkeepers, the Ranger shouted, "maybe I''ll just go out and get my own<br /> alligator so I can get a pair of shoes made at a reasonable price!"<br /> The vendor said, "By all means, be my guest. Maybe you will run into a couple<br /> of Marines who were in here earlier saying the same thing."<br /> So the Ranger headed into the bayou that same day and a few hours later came<br /> upon two men standing waist deep in the water. He thought, "those must be the<br /> two Marines the guy in town was talking about." Just then, the Ranger saw a<br /> tremendously long gator swimming rapidly underwater towards one of the Marines.<br /> Just as the gator was about to attack, the Marine grabbed its neck with both<br /> hands and strangled it to death with very little effort. Then both Marines<br /> dragged it on shore and flipped it on its back. Laying nearby were several more<br /> of the creatures.<br /> One of the Marines then exclaimed, "Damn, this one doesn''t have any shoes<br /> either!"
1) How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?    You open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe and close the door.  2) How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?    You open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant and close the door.    3) The Lion King is hosting an animal conference, all the animals attend, except one.  Which animal does not attend?    The elephant.  The elephant is in the refrigerator.    4) There is a river you must cross.  But it is filled with crocodiles.  How do you manage it?    You swim across -- all the crocodiles are attending the animal conference.
Susie came skipping up the walk. She opened the door and said,<br /> "Mommy! I got a 100 today!" The mother replied, "That''s great,<br /> dear! What did you get it in?" "Two things," Susie said. "I got<br /> a 46 in science, and a 54 in mathematics."
When you are done with a Christmas tree you can throw it on the curb and have it hauled away.A Christmas tree doesn''t get jealous around other Christmas trees.A Christmas tree doesn''t care if you watch football all day.A Christmas tree doesn''t get mad if you tie it up and throw it in the back of your pickup truck.
Two blondes were playing golf at a foggy par three, and could see the flag,<br /> but not the green. Each hit their ball anyway. When they walked to the green,<br /> they discovered one about three feet from the cup, while the other somehow had<br /> gone directly in. </p>\n<p>They tried to figure out which ball belonged to who, since they were both<br /> using Titleist number threes. Unable to decide, they returned to the Club House<br /> and asked the golf pro for a ruling. After hearing their story and<br /> congratulating them both on their superb shots under such adverse conditions he<br /> asked, "OK, so who was playing the yellow ball ?"
Things could be worse; suppose your errors were counted and published every day, like those of a baseball player.
1. Breaking up would be a lot easier. A smack on the arse and a ''cheers for the sex  would pretty much do it.2. Birth control would come in ale or lager.3. Valentine''s Day would be moved to 29th February so it would only occur in leap years.4. On Mothers Day, you''d get the day off to go drinking.5. The only show opposite ''Monday Night Football'' would be ''Monday Night Football from a Different Camera Angle.''6. Instead of ''beer-belly,'' you''d get ''beer-biceps.''7. Tanks would be far easier to rent.8. Every woman that worked would have to do so topless.9. When the Police pull you over, every smart-aleck answer you responded with would actually reduce your fine. Example - Cop: ''You know how fast you were going?'' You: ''All I know is, I was spilling my beer all over the place.'' Cop: Nice one, that''s $20 off.''10. Daisy Duke shorts would never go out of style again.11. Every man would get four, real ''Get Out of Jail Free'' cards per year.12. Telephones would cut off after 30 seconds of conversation.13. When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during the game, she''d appear in a little box in the corner of the screen when the ball goes out of play.14. Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed as an acceptable response to ''I love you.''15. The funniest guy in the office would get to be the CEO.16. ''Sorry, but I got wasted last night,'' would be an acceptable excuse for absence and/or poor time keeping.17. Lifeguards could remove people from beaches for violating the public ugliness ordinance.18. Hallmark would make ''Sorry, what was your name again?'' cards.19. Lager would have the same effect as Viagra.20. ''Fancy a shag'' would be the only chat up line in existence and it would work every time.21. Everyone would drive at least 70mph and anyone driving under that would be fined.22. Dinner break would happen every hour and the boss would hire in strippers and $2000 a night hookers for the duration of those breaks.23. Saying ''Let''s have a threesome. You, me and your sister'' to your wife/girlfriend would get the response, ''What a great idea!''24. Harrier jump jets would take you to and from work.25. Everyone would have real a Light Sabre and any disagreements would be settled by a fight to the death.26. Vomiting after 20 pints would actually make you more attractive to the opposite sex.27. Along with your milk in the morning, the milkman would deliver two Swedish milk maids.28. When it was time to leave work, a whistle would sound and you''d get to slide down the back of a Brontosaurus just like Fred Flintstone29. "Yes" would be an acceptable answer to a woman''s question of "Does my bum look big in this?"
"Don''t worry. I''ve had a vasectomy/hysterectomy." "I won''t come in your mouth, I promise." "I''m not really married." "It''s only a cold sore." "Looks aren''t important to me. I like you for your personality." "Size isn''t important." "This won''t hurt, I promise." "We don''t have to go all the way, we''ll just lie here and hold each other." "We''ll always be together." A man can be happy with any woman as long as he doesn''t love her. A man in the house is worth two in the street. A man is only a man, but a good bicycle is a ride. A woman never forgets the men she could have had; a man, the women he couldn''t. Abstain from wine, women, and song; mostly song. All the good ones are taken. Beauty is skin deep; ugly goes right to the bone. Before you find your handsome prince, you''ve got to kiss a lot of frogs. Brains x Beauty x Availability = Constant Do it only with the best. Don''t do it if you can''t keep it up. Every kind action has a not-so-kind reaction. Fornication: Term used by people who don''t have anybody to screw with. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. If the effort that went in research on the female bosom had gone into our space program, we would now be running hot-dog stands on the moon. If the person isn''t taken, there''s a reason (corollary to the above law). If you can''t stand his mother and he can''t stand yours, then you''re bound to get  married. If you get them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow. If you meet somebody who tells you that he loves you more than anybody in the  whole wide world, don''t trust him; it means he experiments. It is always the wrong time of month. It is better to be looked over than overlooked. It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. It was not the apple on the tree but the pair on the ground that caused the  trouble in the garden. Love comes in spurts. Love is a hole in the heart. Love is a matter of chemistry, sex is a matter of physics. Love is the delusion that one man or woman differs from another. Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. Love thy neighbor, but don''t get caught. Money can''t buy love, but it sure gets you a great bargaining position. Never argue with a women when she''s tired, or rested. Never go to bed mad, stay up and fight. Never lie down with a woman who''s got more troubles than you. Never say no. Never sleep with anyone crazier than yourself. Nice guys finish last. No matter how many times you''ve had it, if it''s offered take it, because it''ll never be quite the same again. No sex with anyone in the same office. Nobody is ugly after 2 A.M. Nothing improves with age. One good turn gets most of the blankets. People to whom you are attracted invariably think you remind them of someone else. Sex appeal is 50% what you''ve got and 50% what people think you''ve got. Sex discriminates against the shy and the ugly. Sex has no calories. Sex is a three-letter word which needs some old-fashioned four-letter words to convey its full meaning. Sex is dirty only if it''s done right. Sex is hereditary. If your parents never had it, chances are you won''t either. Sex is like snow; you never know how many inches you are going to get or how  long it is going to last. Sex is one of the nine reasons for reincarnation; the other eight are  unimportant. Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble. Sow your wild oats on Saturday night; then on Sunday, pray for crop failure. The amount of love someone feels for you is inversely proportional to how much  you love them. The best things in the world are free, and worth every penny of it. The best way to hold a man is in your arms. The game of love is never called off on account of darkness. The love letter you finally got the courage to send will be delayed in the mail long enough for you to make a fool of yourself in person. The more beautiful the woman is who loves you, the easier it is to leave her  with no hard feelings. The nicer someone is, the farther away (s)he is from you. The qualities that most attract a woman to a man are usually the same ones she can''t stand years later. The younger the better. There is no difference between a wise man and a fool when they fall in love. There is no remedy for sex but more sex. There may be some things better than sex, and some things worse than sex. But there is nothing exactly like it. Thou shalt not commit adultery, unless in the mood. Virginity can be cured. What matters is not the length of the wand, but the magic in the stick. When a man''s wife learns to understand him, she usually stops listening to him, and vice versa... When the lights are out, all women are beautiful. You cannot produce a baby in one month by impregnating nine women. You will always fall in love and marry someone with the opposite body temperature. and Murphy''s number one law on love and sex: Don''t fuck with Mrs. Murphy!!!!

Well, Mr. and Mrs. Potato had eyes for each other, and finally<br /> they</p>\n<p>got</p>\n<p> married, and had a little sweet potato, whom they called ''Yam''.<br /> Of</p>\n<p>course,</p>\n<p> they wanted the best for Yam. When it was time, they told her<br /> about</p>\n<p>the</p>\n<p> facts</p>\n<p> of life.</p>\n<p> They warned her about going out and getting half-baked, so she</p>\n<p>wouldn''t</p>\n<p> get</p>\n<p> accidentally mashed, and get a bad name for herself like ''Hot<br /> Potato'',</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p> end up with a bunch of Tater Tots.</p>\n<p> Yam said not to worry, no Spud would get her into the sack and<br /> make a</p>\n<p> rotten</p>\n<p> potato out of her! But on the other hand she wouldn''t stay home<br /> and</p>\n<p>become</p>\n<p> a</p>\n<p> Couch Potato, either. She would get plenty of exercise so as<br /> not to be</p>\n<p> skinny</p>\n<p> like her Shoestring cousins.</p>\n<p> When she went off to Europe, Mr. and Mrs. Potato told Yam to<br /> watch out</p>\n<p>for</p>\n<p> the Hard Boiled guys from Ireland. And the greasy guys from<br /> France</p>\n<p>called</p>\n<p> the</p>\n<p> French Fries. And when she went out west, to watch out for the<br /> Indians</p>\n<p>so</p>\n<p> she</p>\n<p> wouldn''t get scalloped.</p>\n<p> Yam said she would stay on the straight and narrow and wouldn''t</p>\n<p>associate</p>\n<p> with those high class Yukon Golds. Mr. and Mrs. Potato sent Yam<br /> to</p>\n<p>Idaho</p>\n<p> P.U.</p>\n<p> (that''s Potato University) so that when she graduated she''d<br /> really be</p>\n<p>in</p>\n<p> the</p>\n<p> Chips.</p>\n<p> But in spite of all they did for her, one-day Yam came home and</p>\n<p>announced</p>\n<p> she</p>\n<p> was going to marry Tom Brokaw. Tom Brokaw! Mr. and Mrs. Potato<br /> were</p>\n<p>very</p>\n<p> upset. They told Yam she couldn''t possibly marry Tom Brokaw<br /> because</p>\n<p>he''s</p>\n<p> just</p>\n<p> a...</p>\n<p> Are you ready for this?</p>\n<p> Are you sure?</p>\n<p> OK!

Visit your proctologist. </p>\n<p>-Your contributions to your child should go above and beyond that y chromosome you unselfishly sacrificed. </p>\n<p>-Eye contact is best established above our shoulder-level. </p>\n<p>-Your balding is a good thing--it subsidizes our hair care expenses.

CAT MIRACLE DIET: Most diets fail because we are still thinking and eating like people. For those us who have never had any success dieting. Well now there is the new Miracle Cat Diet!</p>\n<p>Except for cats that eat like people -- such as getting lots of table scraps -- most cats are long and lean (or tiny and petite). the Cat Miracle Diet will help you achieve the same lean, svelte figure. Just follow this diet for one week and you''ll find that you not only look and feel better, but you will have a whole new outlook on what con- stitutes food. Good Luck!</p>\n<p>DAY ONE Breakfast:  Open can of expensive gourmet cat food. Any flavor as long as it cost more than .75 per can -- and place 1/4 cup on your plate. Eat 1 bite of food; look around room disdainfully. Knock the rest on the floor. Stare at the wall for awhile before stalking off into the other room.</p>\n<p>Lunch:  Four blades of grass and one lizard tail. Throw it back up on the cleanest carpet in your house.</p>\n<p>Dinner:  Catch a moth and play with it until it is almost dead. Eat one wing. Leave the rest to die.</p>\n<p>Bedtime snack:  Steal one green bean from your spouse''s or partner''s plate. Bat it around the floor until it goes under the refrigerator. Steal one small piece of chicken and eat half of it. Leave the other half on the sofa. Throw out the remaining gourmet cat food from the can you opened this morning.</p>\n<p>DAY TWO Breakfast:  Picking up the remaining chicken bite from the sofa. Knock it onto the carpet and bat it under the television set. Chew on the corner of the newspaper as your spouse/partner tries to read it.</p>\n<p>Lunch:  Break into the fresh French bread that you bought as your part of the dinner party on Saturday. Lick the top of it all over. Take one bite out of the middle of the loaf.</p>\n<p>Afternoon snack:  Catch a large beetle and bring it into the house. Play toss and catch with it until it is mushy and half dead. Allow it to escape under the bed.</p>\n<p>Dinner:  Open a fresh can of dark-colored gourmet cat food -- tuna or beef works well. Eat it voraciously. Walk from your kitchen to the edge of the living room rug. Promptly throw up on the rug. Step into it as you leave. Track footprints across the entire room.</p>\n<p>DAY THREE Breakfast:  Drink part of the milk from your spouse''s or partner''s cereal bowl when no one is looking. Splatter part of it on the closest polished aluminum appliance you can find.</p>\n<p>Lunch:  Catch a small bird and bring it into the house. Play with on top of your down filled comforter. Make sure the bird is seriously injured but not dead before you abandon it for someone else to have to deal with.</p>\n<p>Dinner:  Beg and cry until you are given some ice cream or milk in a bowl of your own. Take three licks/laps and then turn the bowl over on the floor.</p>\n<p>FINAL DAY Breakfast:  Eat 6 bugs, any type, being sure to leave a collection of legs, wings, antennae on the bathroom floor. Drink lots of water. Throw the bugs and all of the water up on your spouse''s or partner''s pillow.</p>\n<p>Lunch:  Remove the chicken skin from last night''s chicken-to-go leftovers your spouse or partner placed in the trash can. Drag the skin across the floor several times. Chew it in a corner and then abandon.</p>\n<p>Dinner:  Open another can of expensive gourmet cat food. Select a flavor that is especially runny, like Chicken and Giblets in Gravy. Lick off all the gravy and leave the actual meat to dry and get hard.

This lady that was wearing a tight skirt was waiting at the bus stop to get<br /> onto the bus. A bus pulled up and the driver opened the doors. She tried to step<br /> up onto the step but her skirt was too tight. So she reached back to unzip and<br /> loosen it a little. She tried to step up onto the steps again. But it was still<br /> too tight. She reached back and unzipped some more. Tried to step up again and<br /> the skirt was still too tight. She tried one more time. She reached back and<br /> unzipped some more. And she still couldn�酶惟t get up onto the bus. So this man<br /> behind her reaches and grabs her by the butt. He gives her a boost onto the bus.<br /> She turns around and slaps him and saying "What do you think you are doing."<br /> Well the man says "Well lady after you unzipped my pants for the third time I<br /> thought we were acquainted."
NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCETo the citizens of the United States of America,In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of yourindependence, effective today.Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections.Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will becirculated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.Then look up "aluminum". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed".2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.It really isn''t that hard.4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.6. You should stop playing American "football". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays "American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American "football", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. "Merde" is French for "sh!t".8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a newnational holiday, but only in England. It will be called "Indecisive Day".9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It''s been driving us crazy.Thank you for your cooperation.

You might be a redneck if...You refer to the time you won a free case of oil as the "day my ship came in."Your hairdo has ever been ruined by a ceiling fan. Your mother has been involved in a fist fight at a high school sports event.You''ve ever barbecued Spam on the grill. You own all the components of soap on a rope except the soap. The best way to keep things cold is to leave''em in the shade. You''ve ever raked leaves in your kitchen. The neighbors started a petition over your Christmas lights. Your brother-in-law is your uncle.You entire family has ever sat around waiting for a call from the governor to spare a loved one.
A lawyer died. At the same moment, the Pope also died. They<br /> arrived at the gates of heaven at the same moment. They spend<br /> the day in orientation, and as they''re getting their heavenly<br /> vestments, the Pope gets a plain white toga and wings, like<br /> everyone else, and the lawyer gets much finer apparel, made of<br /> gold thread, and Gucci shoes. </p>\n<p>Then, they get to see where they''re going to live. The Pope gets<br /> what everyone else gets, a replica of a Holiday Inn room, and<br /> the lawyer gets an 18 room mansion with servants and a swimming<br /> pool.</p>\n<p>At dinnertime, the Pope receives the standard meal, a<br /> Manischewitz kosher TV dinner, and the lawyer receives a fine<br /> and tasty meal, served on silver platters.</p>\n<p>By this time, the lawyer is beginning to suspect that an error<br /> has been made, so he asks one of the angels in charge, "Has<br /> there been some kind of mistake? This guy was the Pope, and he<br /> gets what everyone else gets, and I''m just a lawyer and I''m<br /> getting the finest of everything?"</p>\n<p>The angel replied, "No mistake, sir. We''ve had lots of popes<br /> here, but you''re the first lawyer we''ve ever had."

It was a glorious day for the tribe. Three of their women had gone into<br /> labor at the same time, and so the entire tribe decided to gather and<br /> watch the birth.</p>\n<p>They spread some animal skins on the ground and laid the three women upon<br /> them. The first woman, who was laying on a deer skin, moaned and groaned<br /> and gave birth to a beautiful 5 pound baby boy. The entire tribe oohed and<br /> ahhed appeciatively.</p>\n<p>The second woman, who was lying on a buffalo skin, then moaned and groaned<br /> and gave birth to a beautiful 6 pound baby boy. Again there was a chorus<br /> of ooohs and ahhs from the tribe.</p>\n<p>Then the third woman, who was lying on a hippopotamus skin the tribe had<br /> traded for, moaned and groaned and began to yell in pain. Finally with a<br /> last giant push, the woman gave birth to an astonishing 11 pound baby boy.</p>\n<p>The entire tribe was stunned and amazed at the size of this baby.<br /> Everyone, that is, except the village elder. When pressed for a reason as<br /> to why he was not impressed with an 11 pound baby, he simply answered,<br /> "Everyone knows that the son of the squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to<br /> the sons of the squaws on the other two hides."</p>\n<p>(If you don''t get it, ask a math major!)
A young man was showing off his new sports car to his girlfriend. She was thrilled at the speed. </p>\n<p>''If I do 250 kph, will you take off your clothes?'' he smirked. ''Yes,'' said his adventurous girlfriend. And as he gets up to 250, she peeled off all her clothes.</p>\n<p>Unable to keep his eyes on the road, the car skidded onto some gravel and flipped over. </p>\n<p>The naked girl was thrown clear, but he was jammed beneath the steering wheel.</p>\n<p>''Go and get help!'' he cried.</p>\n<p>''But I can''t! I''m naked and my clothes are gone!''</p>\n<p>''Take my shoe'' he said ''and cover yourself.''</p>\n<p>Holding the shoe over her privates, the girl ran down the road and found a service station. Still holding the shoe between her legs, she pleaded to the service station proprietor, </p>\n<p>''Please help me! My boyfriend''s stuck!''</p>\n<p>The proprietor looked at the shoe and said, ''There''s nothing I can do. He''s in too far.''

President Clinton was looking for a call girl and he found three such ladies<br /> in a local bar: a blonde, a redhead, and a brunette.<br /> To the blonde he said "I am the President of the United States of America. How<br /> much will it cost me to spend some time with you?"<br /> The blonde replied, "For you, Mr. President, it will cost $500."<br /> To the Redhead he asked the same question. She replied "I will spend all the<br /> time you want for $1,000."<br /> When he approached the brunette he asked the same question and she said, "If<br /> you can raise my skirt as high as you''ve raised my taxes, and can get your pants<br /> as low as my wages, and get that thing of yours as hard as times are now, and<br /> screw me as well as you do the public, believe me, it won''t cost you a damn<br /> thing!"

When he goes to the front door, the girl''s father answers and invites him in. </p>\n<p>"Carrie''s not ready yet. Why don''t you have a seat?" Carrie''s father asks Bobby what they''re planning to do. Bobby replies politely that they will probably just go to the soda shop or a movie. </p>\n<p>"Why don''t you two go out and screw? I hear all the kids are doing it!" </p>\n<p>Naturally, this comes as a quite a surprise to Bobby so he asks Carrie''s dad to please repeat himself. </p>\n<p>"Yeah," says Carrie''s father, "Carrie really likes to screw; she''ll screw all night if we let her!" </p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Carrie comes downstairs in her little poodle skirt and matching cardigan sweater and announces that she''s ready to go. Breathless with anticipation, Bobby escorts his date out the front door. </p>\n<p>About 20 minutes later, Carrie rushes back into the house, slams the door behind her, and screams at her father: �酶惟Dad, it''s called the Twist!"
A blonde woman competed with a brunette and a redhead in the Breast Stroke<br /> division of an English Channel swim competition.  The brunette came in<br /> first and the redhead was a close second.  Much later, the blonde finally<br /> reached shore, completely exhausted.  After being revived with blankets and<br /> coffee, she muttered "I don''t want to sound like a sore loser, but I think<br /> those other two girls used their arms."
This man goes to confession and says, "Forgive me father for I have sinned."<br /> The priest asks if he would like to confess his sins and the man replies that he<br /> used the "F-word" over the weekend. The priest says, "Oh okay, just say three<br /> Hail Marys and try to watch your language. </p>\n<p>The man replies that he would like to confess as to why he said the "F-word".<br /> The priest sighs and tells him to continue. Well father I played golf on Sunday<br /> with my buddies instead of going to church. The priest says, "And you got upset<br /> over that and swore?" The man replied, "No, that wasn''t why I swore. On the<br /> first tee I duck-hooked my drive well left into the trees." The priest said,<br /> "And that''s when you swore." </p>\n<p>The man replied, a little testily because of the constant interruptions, "No,<br /> it wasn''t. When I walked up the fairway, I noticed my ball got a lucky bounce<br /> and I had a clear shot to the green. However, before I could hit the ball, a<br /> squirrel ran by and grabbed my ball and scurried up a tree." The priest asked,<br /> "Is that when you said the ''F-word''?" </p>\n<p>The man replied, "No, because an eagle then flew by and caught the squirrel in<br /> its sharp talons and flew away." </p>\n<p>The priest let out a breath and queried, "Is that when you swore?" </p>\n<p>The man replied, "No, because the eagle flew over the green and the dying<br /> squirrel let go of my golf ball and it landed within 5 inches of the hole." </p>\n<p>The priest screamed, "Don''t tell me you missed the f***ing putt!!!"

She is<br /> agreeable but warns him that it will have dire consequences on his<br /> sex life.</p>\n<p>After a short period of soul searching he decides to try the potion.<br /> He goes back to the golf course and completes an excellent game of<br /> golf.

When I was in high school I used to be terrified of my girlfriend''s father, who I believe suspected me of wanting to lay hands on his daughter. He would open the door and immediately affect a good-naturedly murderous expression, holding out a handshake that, when gripped, felt like it could squeeze carbon into diamonds.<br /> Now, years later, it is my turn to be the dad. Remembering how unfairly persecuted I felt when I would pick up my dates, I do my best to make my daughter''s suitors feel even worse. My motto: wilt them in the living room and they''ll stay wilted all night.<br /> "So," I''ll call out jovially. "I see you have your nose pierced. Is that because you''re stupid, or did you merely want to APPEAR stupid?"<br /> As a dad, I have some basic rules, which I have carved into two stone tablets that I have on display in my living room.<br /> Rule One: If you pull into my driveway and honk you''d better be delivering a package, because you''re certainly not picking anything up.<br /> Rule Two: You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter, I will remove them.<br /> Rule Three: I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don''t take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, In order to assure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric staple gun and fasten your trousers securely in place around your waist.<br /> Rule Four: I''m sure you''ve been told that in today''s world, sex without utilizing a "barrier method" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I WILL kill you.<br /> Rule Five: In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do This. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is "early."<br /> Rule Six: I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make YOU cry.<br /> Rule Seven: As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process which can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don''t you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?<br /> Rule Eight: The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka zipped up to her chin. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay.<br /> My daughter claims it embarrasses her to come downstairs and find me attempting to get her date to recite these eight simple rules from memory. I''d be embarrassed too--there are only eight of them, for crying out loud! And, for the record, I did NOT suggest to one of these cretins that I''d have these rules tattooed on his arm if he couldn''t remember them. (I checked into it, and the cost is prohibitive.) I merely told him that I thought writing the rules on his arm with a ball point might be inadequate--ink washes off--and that my wood burning set was probably a better alternative.<br /> One time, when my wife caught me having one of my daughter''s would-be suitors practice pulling into the driveway, get out of the car, and go up to knock on the front door (he had violated rule number one, so I figured he needed to run through the drill a few dozen times) she asked me why I was being so hard on the boy. "Don''t you remember being that age?" she challenged.<br /> Of course I remember. Why do you think I came up with the eight simple rules?<br /> From The 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Daughter<br /> Copyright 1998 W. Bruce Cameron http://www.wbrucecameron.com

This one woman who was in her late 40''s went to the plastic surgen. She wanted<br /> an entire face lift and so the doctor said he had this new technique. The woman<br /> asked how it was done so the doctor explained it. He said that he would cut two<br /> slits on top of her head and tie them into a knot. The woman asked why he would<br /> put a knot, and the doctor said that it was so if her face felt a little droopy,<br /> when she twisted it to the right, it would tighten the skin on her face. The<br /> woman decided to get the surgery done.The doctor told her to come back in four<br /> months so he could check up on how she was doing. During the four months the<br /> woman had tightened the knot quite a bit. When the woman had finally gone back<br /> to see the doctor, she had been complaining about her bags under her eyes being<br /> heavy.The doctor examined her for one minute and said, lady, those aren''t bags<br /> under your eyes, they''re your tits! And then the lady said, that would explain<br /> the gotee on my chin!

There are five things that women should never, ever ask a guy, according to an article in an issue of Sassy magazine. The five questions are:<br /> 1 - "What are you thinking?"<br /> 2 - "Do you love me?"<br /> 3 - "Do I look fat?"<br /> 4 - "Do you think she is prettier than me?"<br /> 5 - "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example: </p>\n<p>1 - "What are you thinking?" The proper answer to this question, of course is, "I''m sorry if I''ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you." Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things: </p>\n<p>a - Football<br /> b - Baseball<br /> c - How fat you are.<br /> d - How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died. </p>\n<p>According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. "If I wanted you to know," Al said, "I''d be talking instead of thinking." </p>\n<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers: </p>\n<p>2 - "Do you love me?" The correct answer to this question is, "Yes." For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, "Yes, dear." </p>\n<p>Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - I suppose so.<br /> b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes.<br /> c - That depends on what you mean by "love".<br /> d - Does it matter?<br /> e - Who, me? </p>\n<p>3 - "Do I look fat?" The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, "No, of course not" and then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - I wouldn''t call you fat, but I wouldn''t call you thin either.<br /> b - Compared to what?<br /> c - A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d - I''ve seen fatter.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>4 - "Do you think she''s prettier than me?" The "she" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, "No, you are much prettier." Wrong answers include: </p>\n<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.<br /> b - I don''t know how one goes about rating such things.<br /> c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.<br /> d - Only in the sense that she''s younger and thinner.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>\n<p>5 - "What would you do if I died?" Correct answer: "Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino''s Pizza truck that came my way." This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke: </p>\n<p>"Dear," said the wife. "What would you do if I died?" </p>\n<p>"Why, dear, I would be extremely upset," said the husband. "Why do you ask such a question?" </p>\n<p>"Would you remarry?" persevered the wife. </p>\n<p>"No, of course not, dear" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Don''t you like being married?" said the wife. </p>\n<p>"Of course I do, dear" he said. </p>\n<p>"Then why wouldn''t you remarry?" </p>\n<p>"Alright," said the husband, "I''d remarry." </p>\n<p>"You would?" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>\n<p>"Yes" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Would you sleep with her in our bed?" said the wife after a long pause. </p>\n<p>"Well yes, I suppose I would." replied the husband. </p>\n<p>"I see," said the wife indignantly. "And would you let her wear my old clothes?" </p>\n<p>"I suppose, if she wanted to" said the husband. </p>\n<p>"Really," said the wife icily. "And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?" </p>\n<p>"Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do." </p>\n<p>"Is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet. "And I suppose you''d let her play with my golf clubs, too." </p>\n<p>"Of course not, dear," said the husband. "She''s left-handed."

I think that would be the correct thing to do." </p>\n<p>"Is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet. "And I suppose you''d let her play with my golf clubs, too." </p>\n<p>"Of course not, dear," said the husband. "She''s left-handed."
Shit is a powerful word. Just think of all the concepts and ideas you can communicate with it. Shit may just be the most powerful word in the English language. </p>\n<p>CONSIDER THIS: You can be shit faced, be shit out of luck, or have shit for brains. With a little effort you can get your shit together, find a place for your shit or decide to shit or get off the pot. You can smoke shit,buy shit, sell shit, lose shit, find shit, forget shit, and tell others to eat shit and die. You can shit or go blind, have a shit fit or just shit your life away. People can be shit headed, shit brained, shit blinded, and shit over. </p>\n<p>Some people know their shit while others can''t tell the difference between shit and shineola. There are lucky shits, dumb shits, crazy shits, and sweet shits. There is bull shit, and horse shit and chicken shit. You can throw shit,sling shit, catch shit, or duck when the shit hits the fan. You can take a shit, give a shit, or serve shit on a shingle. You can find yourself in deep shit, or be happier than a pig in shit. Some days are colder than shit, some days are hotter than shit, and some days are just plain shitty. Some music sounds like shit, things can look like shit, and there are times when you feel like shit. </p>\n<p>You can have too much shit, not enough shit, the right shit, the wrong shit or a lot of weird shit. You can carry shit, have a mountain of shit, or find yourself up shit creek without a paddle. Sometimes you really need this shit and sometimes you don''t want any shit at all. Sometimes everything you touch turns to shit and other times you swim in a lake of shit and come out smelling like a rose. </p>\n<p>Shit! When you stop to consider all the facts, it''s the basic building block of creation. And remember, once you know your shit, you don''t need to know anything else.
The other day I went to the local religious book store, where I saw a<br /> HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back<br /> bumper of my car, and I''m really glad I did. What an uplifting experience<br /> followed.<br /> I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought<br /> about the Lord, and didn''t notice that the light had changed. That bumper<br /> sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy<br /> behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love the lord because<br /> pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, "Jesus Christ!" as loud as<br /> he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, "GO JESUS CHRIST,<br /> GO!!!"<br /> Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved<br /> and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from<br /> Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny<br /> beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck<br /> up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed,<br /> looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck<br /> sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.<br /> Several cars behind, a very nice black man stepped out of his car and<br /> yelled something. I couldn''t hear him very well, but it sounded like,<br /> "Mother trucker," or "Mother''s from there." Maybe he was from Florida, too.<br /> He must really love the lord. A couple of the people were so caught up in<br /> the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking<br /> toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the<br /> light had changed, and stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because<br /> I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them<br /> standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held<br /> up the Hawaiian good luck sign, as I drove away.<br /> Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks.
Do you remember middle school/junior high/high school? If so, do<br /> you remember talking about ''the bases'' with your friends? </p>\n<p>"Yeah man, at the dance, X and Y went behind the gym and they<br /> got to second base!" </p>\n<p>Well that was cool and all, but what the hell was second base?<br /> Tongue kissing? Up the shirt? No one was really sure. Also, the<br /> bases tended to get progressively more intense as you got older.<br /> What''s a person to do? Here, we mourn the passing of using<br /> baseball analogies to describe sexual activity. But let''s face<br /> it, there are more than four stages in today''s day and age of<br /> sex play. So, in the interests of both bringing baseball sex<br /> metaphors in line with the complications of modern romance and<br /> with standardizing the bases, we present the Standardized Guide<br /> to the Bases. </p>\n<p>First, let''s examine what the bases could have meant in the old<br /> days. </p>\n<p>First Base: This was almost always kissing, although one guy I<br /> knew thought it meant holding hands. Sometimes it was tongue<br /> kissing and sometimes not. </p>\n<p>Second Base: Variously this meant tongue kissing, breast<br /> feeling, or outside the clothes genital contact. </p>\n<p>Third Base: Usually this was a hand down the pants of you or<br /> your partner. </p>\n<p>Home Run: This was ALWAYS sex, although it was rarely reached in<br /> the times when you had to refer to it in terms of bases. </p>\n<p>That system is ok, if you are a young teenager with a repressed<br /> sex drive. But what happens when you reach maturity and new<br /> factors enter the equation, such as oral sex? And what about the<br /> exact definitions? We have attempted to answer such puzzling<br /> questions and present without further ado... The Standardized<br /> Guide to the Bases! </p>\n<p>On Deck: Having plans for a date.</p>\n<p>Strike-Out: Duh!!</p>\n<p>Walk: Kissing.</p>\n<p>Bunt: Masturbation.</p>\n<p>Single: Tongue kissing.</p>\n<p>Double: Breasts/chest touched, some clothes off, lots of<br /> grabbing and feels.</p>\n<p>Triple: Most of the clothes off, genital contact, mutual<br /> masturbation.</p>\n<p>Inside the park home run: Oral Sex.</p>\n<p>Home Run: SEX!</p>\n<p>Ground Rule Double: would have sex, but no condom.</p>\n<p>Error: Condom breaks during sex.</p>\n<p>Banned for life for gambling: sex without a condom.</p>\n<p>Hall of Fame: Marriage.</p>\n<p>Now that we''ve got the basics, let''s introduce some terms to<br /> better explain all the things that can happen now a days. </p>\n<p>Balk: Premature ejaculation.</p>\n<p>Pine Tar: KY jelly.</p>\n<p>Relief pitcher: Vibrator.</p>\n<p>Rain Delay: parents/roommate return home unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>Box Seats: Waterbed.</p>\n<p>Seventh Inning Stretch: Unusual positions.</p>\n<p>Rookie: Virgin.</p>\n<p>Minor Leagues: Under 18.</p>\n<p>Loaded Bases: manage a trois.</p>\n<p>Grand Slam: Sex three times in twelve hours.</p>\n<p>Foul tip: VD.</p>\n<p>Three up and three down: impotency.</p>\n<p>Now that we have the definitions, lets quickly contrast the old<br /> confusion with current clarity. </p>\n<p>OLD WAY: we um got to third base I guess and then we um got like<br /> past third base, but not to home plate. I really like her. </p>\n<p>NEW WAY: first, there was a triple, then we got and inside the<br /> park home run, and started thinking, it''s hall of fame time. NEW<br /> WAY- So there I was with the bases loaded and nobody out, when I<br /> balked during the seventh inning stretch and I had to call in a<br /> relief pitcher. </p>\n<p>Well, there you have it, I hope it has cleared up a lot of the<br /> confusion and helps you out.

Back in 1947 the government was experimenting with a Marine''s ability to<br /> complete his mission after suffering a serious head injury.<br /> They took a well trained, physically-fit, hard-charging Cpl. and told him to<br /> row a canoe up a river.  The Cpl. jumped in the canoe, started rowing up stream<br /> with ease and began singing, "From the Halls of Montezuma, To the Shores of<br /> Tripoli."<br /> The next day a team of surgeons performed a frontal lobotomy on the<br /> Marine.   Again, they took him to the river and said'' "row."<br /> Again the Cpl. jumped in, took a second to find his seat, started rowing with<br /> a little difficulty and began singing.  It took a little more effort this time,<br /> "From     Da   Hallls   of    Montayuma,     Two   Da   Stores    in<br /> Tripoli."  But he made it up river and completed the task.<br /> The next day the surgeons removed the majority of the Marines brain and took<br /> him to the river.<br /> The Cpl. jumped in, fell out, and began swimming up stream, singing "For    Da<br />   Hails  of  Monte puma,  to  ''e  hall inn  monopoly."  But again, he made it up<br /> river and completed his task.<br /> The next day the surgeons removed the remainder of the Marines brain.  He had<br /> no brain what-so-ever and no way to think logically.  They took him to the<br /> river.   He fell out of the car and began singing, "Hear we go, Into the wild<br /> blue yonder...."
While out one morning in the park, a jogger found a brand new tennis ball, and seeing none around it might belong to, he slipped it into the pocket of his shorts. Later, on his way home, he stopped at the pedestrian crossing, waiting for the lights to change. </p>\n<p>A girl standing next to him eyed the large bulge in his shorts. "What''s that ?" she asked, her eyes gleaming with lust. </p>\n<p>"Tennis ball," came the breathless reply. </p>\n<p>"Oh," said the girl sympathetically, "that must be painful.... I had tennis elbow once."

A Polak wanted to join an amateur baseball team. The coach looked him over and decided to give him a chance.</p>\n<p>"I will give you three questions," said the coach. "If you come back in a week and answer them all correctly, you''re on the team."</p>\n<p>"Fair enough!" said the Polak eagerly.</p>\n<p>The coach proceeded, "Here are your questions. First, how many days are there in a week that start with the letter ''T''? Second, how many seconds are there in a year? And third, how many d''s are there in ''Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer?''"</p>\n<p>Next week, the Polak came back, feeling all confident that he knew the right answers. So again the coach said, "So how many days in the week that start with ''T''?"</p>\n<p>The Polak said, "Two!"<br /> "Very good!" said the coach. And what are they?"<br /> "Today and Tomorrow!"<br /> "Hmm... OK," said the coach.</p>\n<p>"How many seconds are there in a year?"<br /> "Twelve!"<br /> "Twelve? How did you come up with twelve?" The coach was perplexed.<br /> "Well," said the Polak, "there''s the second of January, the second of February, the second of..."<br /> "Um.. OK," broke in the coach.</p>\n<p>"How many d''s in ''Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer?''"<br /> "Oh, that is easy!" laughed the Polak. "Three hundred and sixty-five!"<br /> "WHAT?" cried the coach. "How did you get that figure?"<br /> To which the Polak sang, "dee dee dee-dee-dee dee-dee...."

A man is at Grand Central Station waiting for his train which leaves at 6:00 PM but he has forgotten his watch. So he looks for someone to ask the time. He spots this guy walking past carrying 2 suitcases and sporting this fabulous hi-tech watch, so he asks him for the time.The guy replies "Sure, which country?"The fella asks "How many countries have you got?", to which the reply is "All the countries in the world!""Wow! That''s a pretty cool watch you''ve got there.""That''s nothing. This watch also has a GPS facility, fax, e-mail and can even receive NTSC television channels and display them on its miniature active color pixel LCD screen!""Boy, that''s incredible. I wish I had a watch like that one . . . You wouldn''t consider selling it by any chance?""Well, actually the novelty has worn off for me, so for $900, if you want it, it''s yours."The watchless traveller can hardly whip out his check book fast enough, and hands over a check for $900.The seller takes off the watch and gives it to him."Congratulations, here is you new hi-tech watch" and then,  handing the 2 suitcases over as well he says, "and here are  the batteries."
There was this man with a really bad studder and he was very ugly. He was rich though. He and his friend were at the beach one day and he said man I really want some sex. How do I get some. His friend told him to buy a boat chicks dig boats.<br /> Well a couple of weeks later the two friends ran into each other. His friend asked him how did the boat thing work out. The friend replied " Well it went good I was getting chicks left and right until I met this one girl. I asked her if she wanted to go out on my boat and of course she did cause chicks dig boats. Well I did what I do with all the other girls I took her way out in the ocean away from everything. I told her put out or swim. Well she pulled down her bathing suit and it was the most god-awful smell the fish were dying in the ocean from it. I told her no nevermind. Well she told me eat or swim."</p>\n<p>The friend looked shocked he asked "well what did you do?"</p>\n<p>The other guy replied "well you didnt hear about no mother fu**er drowning did you!"

This morning, National Public Radio reported that Monica Lewinsky had been in<br /> an accident with her Sport Utility Vehicle. Immediately, four things came to my<br /> mind: </p>\n<p>1. She must have blown a rod.<br /> 2. Obviously, her driving sucks too.<br /> 3. It''s not the first time she flipped over something with a spare tire.<br /> 4. I wonder how badly THIS accident stained her dress?

There once was a successful rancher who died and left everything to his devoted wife.  She was determined to keep the ranch and make a go of it, but she knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for ranch hands.</p>\n<p>Two men applied for the job... One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied, she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.</p>\n<p>He turned out to be a fantastic worker, worked long hard hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.</p>\n<p>For weeks the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing really well. </p>\n<p>Then one day the rancher''s wife said to the hired hand, "You have done a really good job and we''ve both done nothing but work for weeks.  The ranch looks great, and I''m taking Saturday night off and going into town to kick up my heels and paint the town red, and I think you should do the same."</p>\n<p>The hired hand agreed readily, and Saturday night each went to town.  The rancher''s wife had dinner and drinks with friends, and talked and joked and danced, and had a great time, getting home about midnight.  The hired hand wasn''t home yet, so she decided to wait up for him.</p>\n<p>One o''clock and no hired hand yet.  Two o''clock and no hired hand and she began to worry. At two-thirty in came the hired hand.  The rancher''s wife was sitting by the fireplace and called him over by her. "Now I''m the boss", she said, "and you have to do what I tell you, right?"</p>\n<p>"Well... yes", he answered.</p>\n<p>"Then unbutton my blouse and take it off", she said. He did as she asked.</p>\n<p>"Now take off my boots."  He did.</p>\n<p>"Now take off my socks."  He did.</p>\n<p>"Now take off my skirt."   He did.</p>\n<p>"Now take off my bra."  Again he did as she asked.</p>\n<p>"Now take off my panties." And again he did what she told him.</p>\n<p>Then she looked at him and said, "Don''t you ever wear my clothes to town again!"
To celebrate their 50th anniversary a couple booked a weekend at Pebble Beach golf resort. On the third tee, the husband said:</p>\n<p>''Honey, I have to confess something. Twenty years ago I had a brief affair. It meant nothing. I hope that you can forgive me. </p>\n<p>The wife was hurt but said, ''My dearest, those days are long gone. What we have is far more valuable. I forgive you.'' They embraced and kissed. </p>\n<p>On the seventeenth tee the wife said to her husband: ''Honey, since we''re being honest I have something to tell you. Fifty-two years ago I had a sex change. I was a man before we met. </p>\n<p>The husband went into a fit! He cursed, threw his driver into the water, broke his clubs one by one and tore at his clothes as he screamed and ranted. ''You liar, you despicable liar! How could you? I trusted you! And to think that you''ve been hitting off the red tees all this time!''
A guy rents an apartment in New York, and goes to the lobby to put his name on the group mailbox. While there, an attractive young lady comes out of the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing a robe.</p>\n<p>He smiles at the young girl and she strikes up a conversation with him. As they talk, her robe slips open, and it quite obvious that she has nothing on under the robe. Poor guy breaks out into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, she places her hand on his arm and says, "Let''s go in my apartment, I hear someone coming..." He precedes her into the apartment, and after she closes the door, she leans against it allowing her robe to fall completely open. She purrs at him, "What would you say is my best feature?"</p>\n<p>The flustered, embarrassed guy stammers, clears his throat several times, and finally squeaks out "Oh, it''s got to be your ears!"</p>\n<p>She''s astounded! Why my ears? Looks at these boobs! They are full, don''t sag, and they''re all mine! My butt - it''s firm, doesn''t sag, and has no cellulite! Look at this skin, no blemishes, or scars! Why in heaven''s name would you say my ears are the best part of my body?!"</p>\n<p>Clearing his throat once again, he stammers - "Outside when you said you heard someone coming - THAT WAS ME!"
13&gt; "Hi there.  I know eventual-King William."</p>\n<p>12&gt; "If I said you had a beautiful body -- for a commoner, of course -- would you hold it against me?"</p>\n<p>11&gt; "How''d you like to be hounded by paparazzi for the next six months?"</p>\n<p>10&gt; "Wanna inbreed?"</p>\n<p>9&gt; "Actually, that''s my *inheritance* in my pocket AND I''m happy to see you."</p>\n<p>8&gt; "See ''Jar Jar'' over there?  That''s my dad."</p>\n<p>7&gt; "Technically, you''ll be knighted if I touch you with my ''royal sceptre.''"</p>\n<p>6&gt; "Care to come to my castle for some Bangers and Mash?"</p>\n<p>5&gt; "It''s not a proper curtsy unless your skirt''s over your head."</p>\n<p>4&gt; "As a member in good standing of the Royal Hunt Club, it''s been my lifelong ambition to chivvy a little fox like you."</p>\n<p>3&gt; "Before this evening''s over, I''d like to pronounce you ''Duchess of Fellatia''."</p>\n<p>2&gt; "Guards!  Off with her blouse!"</p>\n<p>1&gt; "Waste my time with a pick-up line?  Balderdash!

One day, a man complained to his friend, "My elbow really hurts, guess I should see a doctor."</p>\n<p>His friend said, "Don''t do that. There''s a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. And it only costs $10.00."</p>\n<p>The guy figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise andvarious lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read:<br /> You have tennis elbow.<br /> Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor.<br /> It will be better in two weeks.</p>\n<p>That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this computer could be fooled.</p>\n<p>He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in thisample and deposited the $10.00. The machine again made the usual noises,flashedlights, and printed out the following analysis:<br /> Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.<br /> Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.<br /> Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> Your wife is pregnant....twin girls. They aren''t yours. Get a lawyer.</p>\n<p>And.... if you don''t stop jerking off, your elbow will never get better!

A man takes the day off of work and decides to go out golfing. He is on the second hole when he notices a frog sitting next to the green. He thinks nothing of it and is about to shoot when he hears, "Ribbit. 9 Iron"<br /> The man looks round and doesn''t see anyone so he tries again. "Ribbit. 9 Iron." He looks at the frog and decides to prove the frog wrong, puts his other club away, and grabs a 9 iron. Boom! he hits a birdie. He is shocked. </p>\n<p>He says to the frog, "Wow that''s amazing. You must be a lucky frog eh?" The frog reply''s "Ribbit, Lucky frog. Lucky frog." The man decided to take the frog with him to the next hole. "What do you think frog?", the man asks. "Ribbit 3 wood." was the reply. </p>\n<p>The guy takes out a 3 wood and Boom! Hole in one. The man is befuddled and doesn''t know what to say. By the end of the day, the man golfed the best game of golf in his life and asks the frog, "Ok where to next?" The frog reply, "Ribbit Las Vegas". </p>\n<p>They go to Las Vegas and the guy says, "Ok frog, now what?" The frog says, "Ribbit Roulette". Upon approaching the roulette table the man asks," what do you think I should bet?" The frog replies, "Ribbit $3000 black 6." Now, this is a million to one shot that this would win but after the golf game, the man figures what the heck. Boom! Tons of cash comes sliding back across the table. </p>\n<p>The man takes his winnings and buys the best room in the hotel. He sits the frog down and says, "Frog, I don''t know how to repay you. You won me all this money and I am forever grateful." The frog replies, "Ribbit, Kiss Me". </p>\n<p>He figures why not, since after all the frog did for him he deserves it. </p>\n<p>All of a sudden the frog turns into the most gorgeous 16 year old girl in the world. </p>\n<p>And that, your honor, is how the girl ended up in my room".
A traveler knocked on the door of the house where a cabdriver<br /> had told him he could be sexually accommodated. An eye-level<br /> panel slid open and a female voice asked what he wanted. </p>\n<p>"I want to get screwed," said the man. </p>\n<p>"OK, mister, but this is a private club, so slip twenty bucks as<br /> an initiation fee through the mail slot," answered the voice. </p>\n<p>The man slid his $20 bucks in, the panel was closed.<br /> Minutes passed and nothing happened. </p>\n<p>He began to pound on the door insistently, and the panel slid<br /> open again. </p>\n<p>"Hey," exclaimed the sport, "I want to get screwed!" </p>\n<p>"What?" said the voice, "Again?"
A woman playing golf was stung by a bee. Afraid she''d have an allergic reaction, she ran back to the clubhouse to find the pro. </p>\n<p>Finding him, she says breathlessly, "I''ve been stung by a bee! What shall I do?" </p>\n<p>"Where were you stung?" the pro asks. </p>\n<p>"Between the first and second hole!" </p>\n<p>"Lady, we gotta work on your stance."
1. Women love to shop. It is the one area of the world where they feel like they''re actually in control.</p>\n<p>2. Women especially love a bargain. The question of "need" is irrelevant, so don''t bother pointing it out. Anything on sale is fair game.</p>\n<p>3. Women never have anything to wear. Don''t question the racks of clothes in the closet; you "just don''t understand".</p>\n<p>4. Women need to cry. And they won''t do it alone unless they know you can hear them.</p>\n<p>5. Women will always ask questions that have no right answer, in an effort to trap you into feeling guilty.</p>\n<p>6. Women love to talk. Silence intimidates them and they feel a need to fill it, even if they have nothing to say.</p>\n<p>7. Women need to feel like there are people worse off than they are. That''s why soap operas and Oprah Winfrey-type shows are so successful.</p>\n<p>9. Women hate bugs. Even the strong-willed ones need a man around when<br /> there''s a spider or a wasp involved.</p>\n<p>10. Women can''t keep secrets. They eat away at them from the inside. And they don''t view it as being untrustworthy, providing they only tell two or three people.</p>\n<p>11. Women always go to public restrooms in groups. It gives them a chance to gossip.</p>\n<p>12. Women can''t refuse to answer a ringing phone, no matter what she''s doing. It might be the lottery calling.</p>\n<p>13. Women never understand why men love toys. Men understand that they wouldn''t need toys if women had an "on/off" switch.</p>\n<p>14. Women think all beer is the same.</p>\n<p>15. Women keep three different shampoos and two different conditioners in the shower.</p>\n<p>16. After a woman showers, the bathroom will smell like a tropical rain forest.</p>\n<p>17. Women don''t understand the appeal of sports. Men seek entertainment that allows them to escape reality. Women seek entertainment that reminds them of how horrible things *could* be.</p>\n<p>18. If a man goes on a seven-day trip, he''ll pack five days worth of clothes and will wear some things twice; if a woman goes on a seven-day trip she''ll pack 21 outfits because she doesn''t know what she''ll feel like wearing each day.</p>\n<p>19. Women brush their hair *before* bed.</p>\n<p>21. Women are paid less than men, except for Modeling.</p>\n<p>22. Women are *never* wrong. Apologizing is the mans responsibility, "It''s there in the bible". hmmm who was it that gave Adam the apple?</p>\n<p>23. Women do *not* know anything about cars. "Oil-stick, oil doesn''t stick?"</p>\n<p>24. Women have better rest rooms. They get the nice chairs and red carpet.</p>\n<p>25. The average number of items in a typical woman''s bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.</p>\n<p>26. Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren''t looking, men kick cats.</p>\n<p>27. Women love to talk on the phone. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will callthe same friend and they will talk for three hours.</p>\n<p>28. A woman will dress up to go shopping, to water the plants, to empty the garbage, to answer the phone, to read a book, or to get the mail.</p>\n<p>30. Women will drive miles out of their way to avoid the possibility of getting lost using a shortcut.</p>\n<p>31. Women do NOT want an honest answer to the question, ''How do I look?''</p>\n<p>32. PMS stands for: Permissible Man-Slaughter. (Or at least men think it means that. PMS also stands for Punish My Spouse.)</p>\n<p>33. The first naked man that woman see is "Ken".</p>\n<p>36. Women will make three right-hand turns to avoid making one left-hand turn.</p>\n<p>37. "Oh, nothing," has an entirely different meaning in woman-language than it does in man-language.</p>\n<p>38. Lewis Carroll''s Caterpillar had nothing on women.</p>\n<p>39. Women cannot use a map without turning the map to correspond to the direction that they are heading.</p>\n<p>40a All women are overweight by definition, don''t argue with them about it.</p>\n<p>40b All women are overweight by definition, don''t agree with them about it.</p>\n<p>41. If it is not Valentines day, and you see a man in a flower shop, you can probably start up a conversation by asking, "What did you do?"</p>\n<p>42. Women want equal rights, but you rarely hear them clamoring to be let into the draft to cover the responsibilities that go with those rights.</p>\n<p>43. Only women understand the reason for "guest towels" and the "good china".</p>\n<p>46. Women can get out of speeding tickets by pouting. This will get men arrested.</p>\n<p>47. Women don''t really care about a sense of humor in a guy despite claims to the contrary. You don''t see women trampling over Tom Cruise to get to Gilbert Gottfried do you?
The room was full of pregnant women and their partners. </p>\n<p>The Lamaze class was in full swing. </p>\n<p>The instructor was teaching the women how to breathe properly, and informing the men how to give the necessary assurances at this stage of the plan. </p>\n<p>"Ladies, exercise is good for you," announced the teacher. </p>\n<p>"Walking is especially beneficial. And, gentlemen, it wouldn''t hurt you to take the time to go walking with your partner!" </p>\n<p>The room was very quiet. Finally, a man in the middle of the group raised his hand. </p>\n<p>"Yes?" asked the instructor. </p>\n<p>"Is it all right if she carries a golf bag while we walk?" </p>\n<p>Submitted by Calamjo<br /> Edited by Curtis

I''ve been to Nascar races at Charlotte, Rockingham, and the track at North Wilkesboro.  This is what I learned.</p>\n<p>How To Turn Your House Into The Nascar Experience A Humorous Look at Race Fans and the Sport They Love</p>\n<p>If you''re like me, you''d like to attend more Nascar races, but you don''t have the time or money to go.  So I put together a list of things you can do to your home so you and your friends can enjoy the race as if you were there.</p>\n<p>1. Invite 15 to 20 of your closest friends to your house for the race.  Make everyone dress in shirts and hats with their favorite driver on them.  But don''t invite them to show up the day of the race, invite them to come over on Friday for qualifying and camp out for the weekend.</p>\n<p>2. Some of your friends will show up in cars, and some will rent a U-haul truck.  A few of them will pool their money together and get an RV.  Stand outside with two flashlights and direct traffic to the grassy areas in your front yard.  Charge everybody 8 bucks to park except the RV.  Charge them 15 bucks for the weekend cause they''re twice as big.</p>\n<p>3. Since they''re not allowed to use your kitchen, make your buddies do all their cooking on the beat-up barbeque grill they brought in the U-Haul.  The friends that didn''t bring a grill can build a campfire.  They''ll cut down several of the limbs on the Oak tree in your yard for firewood.</p>\n<p>4. When the guys need more ice for their beer coolers, charge them 3 dollars for a one-dollar bag of ice.</p>\n<p>5. Tell your friends they can''t use the bathroom in the house.  They have to use the port-a-john you rented for the weekend and placed off the driveway.</p>\n<p>6. If any of females in the neighborhood drive or walk by your house and stare at the congregation of people in the yard, hold up a crudely made cardboard sign that says "SHOW ME YOUR TITS!"</p>\n<p>7. On Saturday, have everyone climb on top of the RV to sunbathe and drink while listening to coverage of the Busch race.</p>\n<p>8. When the booze runs out, send someone on a beer run with the four-wheeler one of your friends brought in his truck.</p>\n<p>9. After the party winds down, let''em crash in the back of the U-haul on some old mattresses and sleeping bags.  Or they can sleep in their car.</p>\n<p>10. On Sunday morning have the friend with the loudest car stereo system crank up some Lynard Skynard so loud that it wakes all up all your friends.  It will also annoy the neighbors down the street.</p>\n<p>11. Nutrition is important, so start your race day with Pop-tarts and beer for breakfast.</p>\n<p>12. Finally it''s time for the big race.  Take all the comfortable furniture out of your living room.  Then put in twenty metal folding chairs in rows of five with a narrow aisle down the middle.</p>\n<p>13. Before letting them in, inspect all your friends'' coolers to make sure they don''t have more than a 12 pack.  Make them store the coolers under their seats.</p>\n<p>14. Space the chairs tightly together so no one has any leg room.  That way when someone wants to go to the bathroom everyone has to get up to let''em by.</p>\n<p>15. When driver introductions are on television, stand up and give the finger to the driver you hate.  If it''s Jeff Gordon, put down your beer and use both hands.</p>\n<p>16. Run the television signal through your stereo system and turn the volume up so loud it sounds like the cars are in the room.  Have everyone wear AM radio headphones tuned to the race.  When you want to talk to the guy sitting next to you, scream at the top of your lungs so they can hear you.</p>\n<p>17. To recreate the Men''s room at a typical Nascar track, let your friends pee in the bathtub to simulate the urine trough.  Then throw an entire roll of toilet paper into the toilet so if anybody tries to flush it will overflow.  To avoid the long line in the bathroom, some of your friends will pee in the sink.</p>\n<p>18. Walk up and the down the aisle in the living room with a food tray.  When one of your friends wants something to eat, offer them a 32-ounce Pepsi for 4 dollars and a small serving of nacho chips with melted cheese for another 5 bucks.</p>\n<p>19. When there''s a wreck, immediately stand up to see the tv better, forcing the people behind you to stand also.  If it''s a driver you hate, cheer for the accident.  If the driver''s in a close up, start chanting "YOU SUCK!  YOU SUCK!" as if he can actually hear you.</p>\n<p>20. Turn up the thermostat in your house until it''s unbearably hot.  Your friends will take off their shirts because they''re sweating profusely.  Use this as an opportunity to sell them some more 4-dollar sodas and five-buck Miller Lite tallboys.</p>\n<p>21. At the end of the race, have the Dale Jr. fan pick on the Jeff Gordon fan by accusing Gordon of intentionally knocking Junior into the wall to win the race.  After the alcohol-fueled fistfight breaks out, call the cops and have the two drunks hauled away without their shirts.</p>\n<p>22. Once the race coverage is over, leave all your trash on the floor next to your chair.  Since the seats are so close together, your friends will ruin your carpet stepping on leftover nachos, peanut shells, half filled cups of Pepsi and empty beer cans.</p>\n<p>23. Run out to the parking lot in your front yard.  Then move your car to a spot that blocks all the other vehicles from exiting.  Make your friends wait an hour or two before letting them leave. A number of them will relieve themselves in the yard during the wait due to all the beer they consumed during the race.</p>\n<p>24. Before your friends go, they''ll throw the leftover trash in their cars on the ground where they parked.</p>\n<p>25. The next day hire some Mexicans to clean up the yard and all the trash left in your living room.  Then discover that someone puked on your azaleas.</p>\n<p>If you follow the steps listed above, you''ll enjoy the race just as much as the people at the track.  By the way, tickets are still available for the last fall race at Rockingham.</p>\n<p>But don''t look for me there.  I''ll be at home.
There once was a man who had three girlfriends, and he couldn�酶惟t decide which one to marry. </p>\n<p>He decided to give five thousand dollars to each woman to see what she would do with it.</p>\n<p>The first woman bought new clothes for herself.

Two Rednecks went bear hunting. </p>\n<p>While one stayed in the cabin, the other went out looking for a bear. </p>\n<p>He soon found a huge bear, shot at it but only wounded it. </p>\n<p>The enraged bear charged toward him, he dropped his rifle and started running for the cabin as fast as he could. </p>\n<p>He ran pretty fast but the bear was just a little faster and gained on him with every step. </p>\n<p>Just as he reached the open cabin door, he tripped and fell flat. Too close behind to stop, the bear tripped over him and went rolling into the cabin. </p>\n<p>The man jumped up, closed the cabin door and yelled to his friend inside, "You skin this one while I go and get another!"
Two queers were enjoying a pleasant round of golf when a foursome of Hell''s Angels began hitting into them from behind. One queer finally becomes angry and turns to his partner,"If those big bad boys hit into us one more time, Seymour, you fall down and act like the ball hit you very very hard in the head. We''ll just sue those naughty boys." </p>\n<p>Sure enough, next hole they drove the ball directly into the gay twosome. "Now, Seymour, now! Fall down. Well show them..." </p>\n<p>The Angels walk up to the standing and lying queer and say, "What the hell''s going on here?" </p>\n<p>"You just hurt my friend Seymour really bad, and we''re going to get a lawyer and sue you....how do you like that?" </p>\n<p>The Angel replys, "Oh Blow Me!" </p>\n<p>The queer exclaims, "Seymour,Seymour, get up! They want to settle out of court!"
I can please only one person per day. Today is not your day.    And tomorrow isn''t looking good either.   I don''t have an attitude problem. You have a perception problem.   Everyone has a right to be stupid. Some just abuse the privilege.   Young at Heart. Slightly Older in Other Places.   Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky and I    thought to myself, ''Where the hell is the ceiling?!''   Show me a man with both feet firmly on the ground, and I will show   you a  man who can''t get his pants off!   We have a strange and wonderful relationship. You''re strange and I''m    wonderful, or should that be I''m strange and you''re wonderful?   Never put off until tomorrow what you can avoid doing altogether.   If swimming is so good for your figure, how do you explain whales?   It''s gonna be like threading a needle with a haystack.    The trouble with being in the rat race is that even if you win,    you''re still a rat.   Am I getting smart with you? ....How would you know?   Not one shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea that life is    serious.   The more you run over a dead cat, the flatter it gets.   I put the ''fun'' in dysfunctional.   Life is like a box of chocolates. It''s full of nuts.   All I ask is that you treat me no differently than you would the    Queen.   Does ''anal retentive'' have a hyphen?    I get plenty of exercise -- jumping to conclusions, pushing my    luck, and dodging deadlines.   Please, Lord, let me prove that winning the lottery won''t spoil me.   Does vacuuming count as Aerobic Exercise?   I have not yet begun to procrastinate.   You''re slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut    butter.   I don''t suffer from stress. I''m a carrier.   I''d give my right arm to be ambidextrous.   Just remember, no matter where you go, there you are. --   It is much easier to apologize than to ask permission.   There are two rules for ultimate success in life. 1. Never tell    everything you know.   Just because you''re paranoid, it doesn''t mean they''re NOT out to    get you................   I''d explain it to you, but your brain would explode.   When I get to where I''m going, will somebody please tell me where I   am?   Tell me what you need, and I''ll tell you how to get along without it.   Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and    taste good with ketchup.   Eagles may soar, but weasels don''t get sucked into jet engines.   The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.   Do not meddle in the affairs of cats, for they are subtle and will    Whiz on your computer.   Someday we''ll look back on all this and plow into a parked car.
Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean, two prawns were swimming around in the sea. One was called Justin and the other was called Christian. Life was good, except that the prawns were constantly being chased and threatened by sharks. Finally one day, Justin said to Christian, "I''m tired of being a prawn. I wish I was a shark, then I wouldn''t have to worry about being eaten."<br /> Just then a mysterious cod appeared and said, "Your wish is granted," and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark. Horrified, Christian swam off, afraid of being eaten up by his old friend.</p>\n<p>Time went by and Justin found himself bored and lonely as a shark. All his old pals were afraid of him and swam away whenever he came near. Then one day he was out swimming and saw the mysterious cod. </p>\n<p>"I want to be a prawn again," said Justin. "Please change me back!" And lo and behold, the cod changed him back to a prawn. With tears of joy in his little eyes, Justin swam to Christian''s house and knocked on the door. "It''s me, Justin, your old friend! Come out and see me!" he shouted. </p>\n<p>"No," said Christian. "I''ll not be tricked. You''re a shark and you will eat me!"</p>\n<p>Justin cried back, "No, I''m not! That was the old me. I''ve changed. I''ve found Cod, I''m a prawn again, Christian!"

Recently, I was at a professional football game supporting<br /> my favorite team. My seat wasn''t the greatest, so when I<br /> noticed a vacant seat on the fifty yard line 10 rows up, I<br /> headed towards it. I asked the man sitting next to it if<br /> the seat was taken. He replied, "No".<br /> I started talking to the man and I learned he owned the<br /> seat I was in. He said, "My wife use to love to come to<br /> these games until she died." </p>\n<p>"Why didn''t you give this seat away to a friend?" I asked. </p>\n<p>He replied, "Because they are all at her funeral."

Dear Santa: </p>\n<p>Listen you fat little troll, I''ve been helping you out every year, playing at being the perfect Christmas present, wearing skimpy bathing suits in frigid weather, and drowning in fake tea from one too many tea parties, and I hate to break it to ya Santa, but IT''S DEFINITELY PAYBACK TIME! There had better be some changes around here by next Christmas, or I''m gonna call for a nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you won''t wanna be around to smell it). So, here''s my holiday wish list for 1997: </p>\n<p>1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized sweatshirt. I''m sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these bathing suits gonna get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have nylon and Velcro crawling up your butt? </p>\n<p>2. Real underwear that can be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What bonehead at Mattel decided to cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my skin?!? It looks like cellulite! </p>\n<p>3. A REAL man...maybe G.I. Joe. Hell, I''d take Tickle-Me Elmo over that wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend Ken. And what''s with that earring anyway? If I''m gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him (and me) anatomically correct. </p>\n<p>4. Arms that actually bend so I can push the aforementioned Ken-wimp away once he is anatomically correct. </p>\n<p>5. Breast reduction surgery. I don''t care whose arm you have to twist, just get it done. </p>\n<p>6. A jogging bra. To wear until I get the surgery. </p>\n<p>7. A new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don''t cut it. How about a systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account exec! </p>\n<p>8. A new, more 90''s persona. Maybe "PMS Barbie", complete with a miniature container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips; "Animal Rights Barbie", with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake fur coat and handcuffs; or "Stop Smoking Barbie", sporting a removable Nicotrol patch and equipped with several packs of gum. </p>\n<p>9. No more McDonald''s endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl. </p>\n<p>10. Mattel stock options. It''s been 37 years - I think I deserve it. </p>\n<p>Ok, Santa, that''s it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I don''t think these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can find yourself a new bimbo doll for next Christmas. It''s that simple. </p>\n<p>Yours truly -- Barbie

A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first of the twosome teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole.As luck would have it, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in evident agony.The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize. ''Please allow me to help. I''m a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you''d allow.''''Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I''ll be all right...I''ll be fine in a few minutes,'' he replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal position still clasping his hands together at his crotch.But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help him. She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, she loosened his pants, and she put her hands inside. She began to massage his private parts. She then asked him, ''How does that feel?''''It feels great,'' he replied, ''but my thumb still hurts like hell.''
What do women and rocks have in common?</p>\n<p>You skip the flat ones
To the citizens of the United States of America: </p>\n<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. </p>\n<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. </p>\n<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: </p>\n<p>1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary. </p>\n<p>Then look up "aluminium" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. </p>\n<p>Look up "vocabulary". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up "interspersed". </p>\n<p>2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. </p>\n<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn''t that hard. </p>\n<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. </p>\n<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through. </p>\n<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. </p>\n<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. </p>\n<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for "shit" </p>\n<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day. </p>\n<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. </p>\n<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It''s been driving us crazy. </p>\n<p>Thank you for your cooperation.
An escaped convict broke into a house and tied up a young couple, who had been sleeping in the bedroom.</p>\n<p>As soon as he had a chance, the husband turned to his voluptuous young wife, bound up on the bed in a skimpy nightgown, and whispered,  ''Honey, this guy hasn''t seen a woman in years. Just cooperate with anything he wants. If he wants to have sex with you, just go along with it and pretend you like it. Our lives depend on it.''</p>\n<p>''Dear,'' the wife hissed, spitting out her gag, ''I''m so relieved you feel that way, because he just told me he thinks you have a really nice arse.''
Let''s say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named<br /> Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a<br /> pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner,<br /> and again they enjoy themselves.</p>\n<p>They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while<br /> neither one of them is seeing anybody else.</p>\n<p>And then, one evening when they''re driving home, a thought<br /> occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it<br /> aloud: "Do you realize that, as of tonight, we''ve been seeing<br /> each other for exactly six months?"</p>\n<p>And then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a<br /> very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it<br /> bothers him that I said that. Maybe he''s been feeling confined<br /> by our relationship; maybe he thinks I''m trying to push him into<br /> some kind of obligation that he doesn''t want, or isn''t sure of.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I''m not so sure I want this<br /> kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little<br /> more space, so I''d have time to think about whether I really<br /> want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward . .<br /> . I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing<br /> each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward<br /> marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I<br /> ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this<br /> person?</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: . . . so that means it was . . . let''s<br /> see ...February when we started going out, which was right after<br /> I had the car at the dealer''s, which means . . . lemme check the<br /> odometer . . . Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s upset. I can see it on his face.<br /> Maybe I''m reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more<br /> from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he<br /> has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some<br /> reservations. Yes, I bet that''s it. That''s why he''s so reluctant<br /> to say anything about his own feelings. He''s afraid of being<br /> rejected.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: And I''m gonna have them look at the<br /> transmission again. I don''t care what those morons say, it''s<br /> still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on<br /> the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It''s 87 degrees<br /> out, and this thing is shifting like a goddamn garbage truck,<br /> and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: He''s angry. And I don''t blame him. I''d<br /> be angry, too. God, I feel so guilty, putting him through this,<br /> but I can''t help the way I feel. I''m just not sure.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: They''ll probably say it''s only a 90- day<br /> warranty. That''s exactly what they''re gonna say, the scumballs.</p>\n<p>And Elaine is thinking: maybe I''m just too idealistic, waiting<br /> for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I''m<br /> sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy<br /> being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems<br /> to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my<br /> self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.</p>\n<p>And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I''ll give<br /> them a goddamn warranty. I''ll take their warranty and stick it<br /> right up their....</p>\n<p>"Roger," Elaine says aloud.</p>\n<p>"What?" says Roger, startled.</p>\n<p>"Please don''t torture yourself like this," she says, her eyes<br /> beginning to brim with tears. "Maybe I should never have . .Oh<br /> God, I feel so....."</p>\n<p>(She breaks down, sobbing.)</p>\n<p>"What?" says Roger.</p>\n<p>"I''m such a fool," Elaine sobs. "I mean, I know there''s no<br /> knight. I really know that. It''s silly. There''s no knight, and<br /> there''s no horse."</p>\n<p>"There''s no horse?" says Roger.</p>\n<p>"You think I''m a fool, don''t you?" Elaine says.</p>\n<p>"No!" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer.</p>\n<p>"It''s just that . . . It''s that I . . . I need some time,"<br /> Elaine says.</p>\n<p>(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he<br /> can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up<br /> with one that he thinks might work.)</p>\n<p>"Yes," he says.</p>\n<p>(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.)</p>\n<p>"Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?" she says.</p>\n<p>"What way?" says Roger.</p>\n<p>"That way about time," says Elaine.</p>\n<p>"Oh," says Roger. "Yes."</p>\n<p>(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes,<br /> causing him to become very nervous about what she might say<br /> next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)</p>\n<p>"Thank you, Roger," she says.</p>\n<p>"Thank you," says Roger.</p>\n<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted,<br /> tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets<br /> back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV,<br /> and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis<br /> match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny<br /> voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something<br /> major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure<br /> there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he<br /> figures. it''s better if he doesn''t think about it. (This is also<br /> Roger''s policy regarding world hunger.)</p>\n<p>The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two<br /> of them, and they will talk about this situation for six<br /> straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze<br /> everything she said and everything he said, going over it time<br /> and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture<br /> for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification.<br /> They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for<br /> weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions,<br /> but never getting bored with it, either.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a<br /> mutual friend of his and Elaine''s, will pause just before<br /> serving, frown, and say: "Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?''

Women are under the illusion they don''t have to ask men for anything - that if the man really loved her, he would automatically and instinctively know what she needed. Right! As if the dysfunctional drone even knew you were in the room, let alone knew what you were feeling. A woman has a better chance of finding a bathing suit off the rack that fits than finding a man who knows what she is going through. Ironically, however, men like to feel needed - like they''re her knight in shining armor. Unfortunately, most turn out to be needy, like her nightmare from The Shining. Therefore, it is important that a woman ask a man directly for what she wants, not indirectly. He is not a mind reader. He doesn''t even read a map, how''s he going to read a mind?How To Ask A Man To Do Something*--------------------------------------*Always remember these five important rules when asking a man to do something:1. Make sure the man is conscious.2. Crash the hard drive on his computer and line the bird cage with the sports section.3. Be brief! Limit your nagging harangue to two, three hours, max.4. Reward him for cooperative behavior. Offer to cook him something that doesn''t have a peel-back cover.5. Punish him when he refuses to cooperate. Microwave his remote on high power for 55 minutes. Rotate 1/4 turn, and microwave again for another 35 minutes.6. Use "would you" or "will you" instead of "you''d better" or "do as I say and no one will get hurt". OK, Here are the six rules.************************The Right And Wrong Way to Ask A Man*--------------------------------------*How you ask a man to do something makes all the difference. Women think that a subtle nuance or slight turn of phrase will have no effect whatsoever on the resolve of their mucho-macho muscular moron. It does! Which is why you should always use "would you" and "will you" instead of "could you" and "can you". For example:Do say: would you please take out the garbage?Do not say: could you get off your big butt and do something around here? What am I, the maid?Do say: would you like to go out to a nice dinner Saturday night?Do not say: could you please take me to any restaurant that doesn''t have the words "burger", "king", or "happy meal" in their advertising??Do say: would you mind watching the kids while I take a night off with my girlfriends?Do not say: could you, just for one night, watch the kids you helped spawn-that I never get a break from-ever! I haven''t seen my friends in so long we wear name tags to identify ourselves.Do say: would you take me to a movie this week?Do not say: could you prove to me you''re not Velcroed to the couch and actually have the motor skills to take me to a motion picture? Something without Pamela Anderson in it.Do say: would you like me to listen to you talk about your day some more?Do not say: could you step up the filibuster, Sparky? Jeopardy is on in ten minutes.Do say: would you consider getting a vasectomy?Do not say: could you even imagine what it feels like taking birth control pills that make you feel like Attila the Hun one minute and Attila the Hun''s evil twin the next minute? Do it or I''ll do it FOR you!!Do say: would you like to take a vacation?Do not say: could you move out?Do say: would you get out of my life?Do not say: could you get out of my life?Notice how different these two statements are. A man is much more likely to get out of your life if you say "would".

One day while jogging, a man noticed two tennis balls lying by the side of the road. He picked the balls up, put them in his pocket and proceeded on his way. Waiting at the cross street for the light to change, he noticed a beautiful blonde standing next to him and smiling. "What are those big bulges in your running shorts?" she asked. "Tennis balls," answered the man, smiling back. "Wow," said the blonde, looking upset."That must hurt. I once had tennis elbow and the pain was unbearable."

Osama bin Laden has a heart attack and dies. </p>\n<p>He immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him. </p>\n<p>"I don''t know what to do here," the devil says. "You''re on my list, but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to stay here, so I''ll tell you what I''m going to do...</p>\n<p>I''ve got a couple of people here who weren''t quite as bad as you. I''ll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I''ll even let YOU decide who leaves."</p>\n<p>Osama thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil led him into the first room.</p>\n<p>In it was Manuel Noriega and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty-handed. Over and over and over. Such was his fate in hell.</p>\n<p>"No," bin Laden said, "I don''t think so. I''m not a good swimmer and I don''t think I could do that all day long."</p>\n<p>So the devil led him to the next room. In it was the Ayatollah Khomeini with a sledgehammer and a huge pile of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.</p>\n<p>"No, I''ve got this problem with my shoulder. I''d be in constant agony if all I did was break rocks all day," bin Laden commented.</p>\n<p>So the devil opened a third door. In it, bin Laden saw Bill Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was his girl Monica, doing what she does best.

It was dried and then shipped in order to reduce cargo weight, but once seawater soaked in, it not only became heavier, it began to decompose, producing methane gas. </p>\n<p>Because it was stored below decks in bundles you can see what could (and did) happen. Methane began to build up below decks and the first time someone unsuspectingly came below with a lantern was the last time in many cases.</p>\n<p>Several ships were destroyed in this manner before they realized what was happening. After that, the bundles of manure were always stamped with  the term "Ship High In Transit" on them.  Meaning that the sailors were to stow it high enough off the lower decks, so that any water that flowed into the  hold would not drench the manure.</p>\n<p>Thus, evolved the term "S.H.I.T " (Ship High In Transport), which we all know very well, explains why many things happen today.  Many mistakingly thought it originated on a golf course in Scotland. </p>\n<p>~~<br /> Editor''s Note: According to Urban Legends at about.com, shit is derived from the Indo-European root skei-, meaning "to cut" or "to split."  For most of its history "shit" was spelled "shite" (and sometimes still is, euphemistically).</p>\n<p>Doesn''t mean the ships weren''t blown to shit, though...

A must-read for all men.<br /> Keywords and their meanings: </p>\n<p>FINE:<br /> This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel<br /> we are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to<br /> describe how a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of<br /> those arguments. </p>\n<p>FIVE MINUTES:<br /> This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that<br /> your football game is going to last before you take out the<br /> trash, so it''s an even trade. </p>\n<p>NOTHING:<br /> This means something and you should be on your toes. "Nothing"<br /> is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting<br /> to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. "Nothing"<br /> usually signifies an argument that will last "Five Minutes" and<br /> end with a huffy "Fine." </p>\n<p>GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows):<br /> This is a dare, one that will result in my getting upset over<br /> "Nothing" and will end with the word "Fine." </p>\n<p>GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows):<br /> This means "I give up" or "do what you want because I don''t<br /> care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a few<br /> minutes, followed by "Nothing" and "Fine" and she will talk to<br /> you in about "Five Minutes" when she cools off. </p>\n<p>(LOUD SIGH):<br /> This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal<br /> statement very misunderstood by men.<br /> A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment<br /> and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and<br /> arguing with you over "Nothing." </p>\n<p>(SOFT SIGH):<br /> Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one<br /> of the few things that some men actually understand. She is<br /> content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will<br /> stay content. </p>\n<p>OH!:<br /> This exclamation, followed by any statement, is trouble.<br /> Example:<br /> "Oh, let me get that." Or, "Oh, I talked to him about what you<br /> were doing last night."<br /> If she says "Oh" before a statement, RUN, do not walk, to the<br /> nearest exit. She will tell you that she is "Fine" when she is<br /> done tossing your clothes out the window, but do not expect her<br /> to talk to you for at least 2 days. "Oh" as the lead to a<br /> sentence usually signifies that you are<br /> caught in a lie. Do not try to lie more to get out of it, or you<br /> will get raised eyebrows and "Go ahead" followed by acts so<br /> unspeakable that we can''t bring ourselves to write about them. </p>\n<p>THAT''S OK:<br /> This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can<br /> say to a man. "That''s OK" means that she wants to think long and<br /> hard before paying you retributions for what ever it is that you<br /> have done.<br /> "That''s OK" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in<br /> conjunction with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in<br /> the near future when she has plotted and planned, you are going<br /> to be in some mighty big trouble. </p>\n<p>PLEASE DO:<br /> This is not a statement; it is an offer. A woman is giving you<br /> the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have<br /> for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair<br /> chance to tell the truth, so be careful and you shouldn''t get a<br /> "That''s OK." </p>\n<p>THANKS:<br /> A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say, "You''re<br /> welcome." </p>\n<p>THANKS A LOT:<br /> This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say, "Thanks<br /> A LOT," when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that<br /> you have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by<br /> the "Loud Sigh." Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the<br /> "Loud Sigh," as she will only<br /> say "Nothing." </p>\n<p>I hope this clears up any misunderstandings...

Sam was telling his friend Alan that he gave up fishing to take up golf and that he liked golf much better."How come?" inquired Alan."Because when you lie about golf, you don''t have to show anybody anything," said Sam.
Three blokes enter a disabled swimming contest. The first has no<br /> arms the second no legs and the third has no body, just a head.</p>\n<p>They all line up, the whistle blows and "splash" they''re all in<br /> the pool. The guy with no arms takes the lead instantly but the<br /> guy with no legs is closing fast. The head sank straight to the<br /> bottom.</p>\n<p>Ten lengths later and the guy with no legs finishes first. He<br /> can still see bubbles coming from the bottom of the pool, so he<br /> decides he had better dive down to rescue him. He picks up the<br /> head, swims back up to the surface and places the head at the<br /> side of the pool, where-upon the head starts coughing and<br /> spluttering. </p>\n<p>Eventually the head catches his breath and shouts, "Three<br /> facking years I''ve spent learning to swim with my Facking ears,<br /> then two minutes before the whistle, some idiot puts a swimming<br /> cap on me."

A man went to the mall this last week to buy Valentines'' cards for his daughter and mother. The 50 feet of displays for hundreds of cards astounded him. He muttered out loud, "I wonder if they have anything for ex-wives."    The clerk behind the counter said, "Oh, yes sir, they most certainly do have an ''ex'' category, but they''re in Sporting Goods."    "Really?"    "Yes sir. They''re called Darts."
A young blonde was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana. She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking.After becoming very frustrated with the "no haggle" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, "Maybe I''ll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!" The shopkeeper said, "By all means, be my guest. Maybe you''ll luck out and catch yourself a big one!" Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.Later in the day, the shopkeeper is driving home, when he spots the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he sees a huge 9 foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She takes aim, kills the creature and with a great deal of effort hauls it on to the swamp bank. Lying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watches in amazement. Just then the blonde flips the alligator on its back, and frustrated, shouts out, "Damn it, this one isn''t wearing any shoes either!"
There was this little guy sitting in a bar, drinking, minding his  own business when all of a sudden this great big dude comes  in and --WHACK!!-- knocks him off the bar stool and onto the  floor. The idiot says, ''That was a karate chop from Korea.''The little guy thinks ''GEEZ,'' but he gets back up on the stool  and starts drinking again when all of a sudden --WHACK-- the  big dude knocks him down AGAIN and says, ''That was a judo  chop from Japan.'' So the little guy has had enough of this. He gets up, brushes himself off and quietly leaves. The little guy is gone for an hour or so when he returned.  Without saying a word, he walks up behind the big idiot and  *WHACK*  bangs the big dude off his stool, knocking him out  cold!!!The little guy looks at the bartender and says, ''When he  comes to, tell him that is a crowbar from Sears.''
Two whales, a male and female, are swimming off the coast of Japan when the<br /> male whale looks up and sees the whaling ship that killed his father 5 years<br /> ago. Excited at the opportunity to avenge his father''s death, the male whale<br /> says to the female "Let''s go underneath the ship and blow air through our blow<br /> holes. That ought to knock their boat over, and make them think twice about<br /> killing innocent whales." The female whale agrees, and the plan<br /> works perfectly. Once the whaling ship has completely sunk, the male whale<br /> notices that most of the sailors are making their way back to the shore by<br /> either swimming or in lifeboats. Not willing to let them get away so easily,<br /> the male whale yells "They''re going to shore - Let''s go gobble them up!" Just<br /> then, the female whale becomes less cooperative: "HEY!", she says, "I agreed<br /> to the blow job, but there is NO WAY I''m swallowing seamen!"
An Englishman, Irishman and a Scotsman all went to the Olympics,<br /> but they had forgot to order any tickets in advance. When they<br /> got to the ticket office, the lady behind the desk told them<br /> that there were no tickets left.</p>\n<p>All three were devastated until the Englishman had an idea. He<br /> walked over to a car and ripped out the hubcap. He then walked<br /> over to the gate and said, "Hi, I''m here for the Discus." "Ok,<br /> go along there. The locker rooms are on your right," replied the<br /> official.</p>\n<p>The Scotsman then walked over to a pole stuck in the ground. He<br /> took it out and walked over to the same official and said, "Hi,<br /> I''m here for the javelin." "Ok, go along there. The locker rooms<br /> are on your right."</p>\n<p>Not to be out done the Irishman walked over to a load of barbed<br /> wire, and rapped himself up in it. He then walked over and said<br /> to the official, "Hi, I''m Paddy and I''m here for the fencing."
There are two sperm and they''re swimming and swimming and<br /> swimming for what seems like forever. They''re starting to get<br /> tired and one sperm says to the other, "Do you think we should<br /> pull over and ask for directions?" The other sperm replies,<br /> "Naaaahhhhh, we can find it."</p>\n<p>So, they keep swimming. Finally, they see another sperm, who''s<br /> almost dead and decide to stop and ask for directions. They ask,<br /> "Do you think you can help us get to where we are going?" The<br /> almost dead sperm says, "I''ll try, where ya going?" The two<br /> sperms reply, "Well, we''re trying to find the fallopian tubes so<br /> that we can try and fertilize the egg."</p>\n<p>The almost dead sperm just starts laughing. The other two sperms<br /> look at one another, somewhat confused, and ask, "What''s so<br /> funny?" The almost dead sperm finally regains his composure and<br /> replies, "Well, you guys have a long way to go...you''re still in<br /> the esophagus."
A frustrated housewife decided her sex life needed spicing up after 20 years of marriage. After her husband went to work she slipped out and went into a lingerie shop and picked up a pair of crotchless knickers. She went home, tarted herself up and donned the new garment and selected a short skirt to go with it. She greeted her husband when he came home from work and sat across from him after she prepares him a drink. She slowly spread her legs, and in a husky voice say''s "Honey, would you like some of this?"The husband looks between his ageing wife''s legs and lets out his breath, looking up at his doting wife replies, "HELL, NO! Look what its done to your underwear."
A minister, a priest and a rabbi went for a hike one very hot day. They were sweating profusely by the time they came upon a small lake with a sandy beach. Since it was a secluded spot, they left all their clothes on a big log, ran down the beach to the lake and jumped in the water for a long, refreshing swim. Refreshed, they were halfway back up the beach to the spot they''d left their clothes, when a group of ladies from town came along. Unable to get to their clothes in time, the minister and the priest covered their privates and the rabbi covered his face while they ran for cover in the bushes. After the ladies wandered on and the men got dressed again, the minister and the priest asked the rabbi why he covered his face rather than his privates. The rabbi replied, ''''I don''t know about you, but in MY congregation, it''s my face they would recognize.''''

The brash young gynecologist, fresh out of medical school, took one look at his voluptuous new patient and abandoned his professional ethics entirely.  As he stroked the supple skin of her naked body, he asked, "Do you understand what I am doing?"</p>\n<p>"Yes," the patient answered.<br /> "You''re checking for dermatological abrasions.<br /> "Correct," the doctor lied.</p>\n<p>Next, he fondled her breasts long and lovingly.<br /> Again, he inquired, "Do you understand what I am doing?"<br /> "You''re feeling for cancerous lumps," she ventured.</p>\n<p>"Very astute," the doctor complimented, getting more excited. He placed the woman''s feet in stirrups, dropped his pants, and slipped his member inside her. </p>\n<p>"And do you understand what I am doing now?"<br /> "All too well," the patient shot back. "You''re contracting herpes!"
A lady bought a new Lexus. Cost a bundle. Two days later, she brought it back,<br /> complaining that the radio was not working.<br /> "Madam," said the sales manager, "the audio system in this car is completely<br /> automatic. All you need to do is tell it what you want to listen to, and you<br /> will hear exactly that!"<br /> She drove out, somewhat amazed and a little confused. She looked at the radio<br /> and said, "Nelson." The radio responded, "Ricky or Willie?" She was astounded.<br /> If she wanted Beethoven, that''s what she got. If she wanted Nat King Cole, she<br /> got it.<br /> She was stopped at a traffic light enjoying "On The Road Again" when the light<br /> turned green and she pulled out. Suddenly an enormous sports utility vehicle<br /> coming from the street she was crossing sped toward her, obviously not paying<br /> attention to the light. She swerved and narrowly missed a collision.<br /> "Idiot!" she yelled and, from the radio, "Ladies and gentlemen, the President<br /> of the United States."
The 5 toughest questions that women ask men, and the answers...</p>\n<p>The questions are:<br /> 1.     What are you thinking about?<br /> 2.     Do you love me?<br /> 3.     Do I look fat?<br /> 4.     Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5.     What would you do if I died?</p>\n<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e., tells the truth).  Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible responses.</p>\n<p>Question # 1: What are you thinking about?<br /> The proper answer to this, of course, is: "I''m sorry if I''ve been<br /> pensive, dear.  I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful,<br /> thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to<br /> have met you." This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which most likely is one of the following:<br /> a.     Baseball.<br /> b.     Football.<br /> c.     How fat you are.<br /> d.     How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e.     How I would spend the insurance money if you died.<br /> (Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, "If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!")</p>\n<p>Question # 2: Do you love me?<br /> The proper response is: "YES!" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in order, "Yes, dear." Inappropriate responses include:<br /> A.     I suppose so.<br /> B.     Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> C.     That depends on what you mean by love.<br /> D.     Does it matter?<br /> E.     Who, me?</p>\n<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat?<br /> The correct answer is an emphatic: "Of course not!" Among the incorrect answers are:<br /> A.     Compared to what?<br /> B.     I wouldn''t call you fat, but you''re not exactly thin.<br /> C.     A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> D.     I''ve seen fatter.<br /> E.     Could you repeat the question?  I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question # 4: Do you think she''s prettier than me?<br /> Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: "Of course not!"<br /> Incorrect responses include:<br /> A.  Yes, but you have a better personality<br /> b.  Not prettier, but definitely thinner<br /> c.  Not as pretty as you when you were her age<br /> d.  Define pretty<br /> e.  Could you repeat the question?  I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>\n<p>Question# 5: What would you do if I died?<br /> A definite no-win question. (The real answer, or course, is "Buy a<br /> Corvette.") No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an<br /> hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:</p>\n<p>Woman:  Would you get married again?<br /> Man:    Definitely not!<br /> W:      Why not, don''t you like being married?<br /> M:      Of course I do.<br /> W:      Then why wouldn''t you remarry?<br /> M:      Okay, I''d get married again.<br /> W:      You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)<br /> M:      Yes, I would.<br /> W:      Would you sleep with her in our bed?<br /> M:      Where else would we sleep?<br /> W:      Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?<br /> M:      That would seem like the proper thing to do.<br /> W:      And would you let her use my golf clubs?<br /> M:      Of course not, Dear. She''s left-handed.

Dr. Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality who dispenses advice to people who call in to her radio show. Recently, she said that, as an observant orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any circumstance.</p>\n<p>The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a US resident, Jim, which was posted on the Internet. It''s funny, as<br /> well as informative:</p>\n<p>Dear Dr. Laura:</p>\n<p>Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God''s Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend<br /> the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.</p>\n<p>I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other<br /> specific laws and how to follow them.</p>\n<p>1. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord-Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?</p>\n<p>2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?</p>\n<p>3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual cleanliness-Lev.15:19-24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.</p>\n<p>4. Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and<br /> female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can''t I own Canadians?</p>\n<p>5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?</p>\n<p>6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an<br /> abomination-Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don''t agree. Can you settle this?</p>\n<p>7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?</p>\n<p>8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?</p>\n<p>9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?</p>\n<p>10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16. Couldn''t we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)</p>\n<p>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God''s word is eternal and unchanging.</p>\n<p>Your devoted fan,<br /> Jim.

A small village was troubled by a man-eating lion. So its leaders sent a message to the great hunter, Jonesie, to come and kill the beast.For several nights the hunter lay in wait for the lion, but it never appeared. Finally, he told the village chief to kill a cow and give him its hide. Draping the skin over his shoulders, he went to the pasture to wait for the lion.In the middle of the night, the villagers woke to the sound of blood-curdling shrieks coming from the pasture. As they carefully approached, they saw the hunter on the ground, groaning in pain. There was no sign of the lion."What happened, Jonesie? Where is the lion?" asked the chief."Forget the damn lion!" he howled. "Which one of you idiots let the bull loose?"

Bob Hill and his new wife Betty were vacationing in Europe, as it happens, near Transylvania. They were driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It was late, and raining very hard. Bob could barely see 20 feet in front of the car.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the car skids out of control! Bob attempts to control the car, but to no avail! The car swerves and smashes into a tree. Moments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees his wife unconscious, with her head bleeding! Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to carry her to the nearest phone.</p>\n<p>Bob carefully picks his wife up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light. He heads towards the light, which is coming from an old, large house. He approaches the door and knocks. A minute passes. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob immediately blurts, "Hello, my name is Bob Hill, and this is my wife Betty. We''ve been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone?"</p>\n<p>"I''m sorry," replied the hunchback, "but we don''t have a phone. My master is a doctor; come in and I will get him!"</p>\n<p>Bob brings his wife in. An elegant man comes down the stairs. "I''m afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had a basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory."</p>\n<p>With that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. After a brief examination, Igor''s master looks worried.</p>\n<p>"Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion." Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more.</p>\n<p>The Hills'' deaths upset Igor''s master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. For it is here that he has always found solace. He begins to play, and a stirring, almost haunting, melody fills the house.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty''s hand twitch, keeping time to the haunting piano music. Stunned, he watches as Bob''s arm begins to rise, marking the beat! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! Unable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: "Master, Master! The Hills are alive with the sound of music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

That''s just fine.She stepped upon a pedal...I could not believe my eyesA plastic plate was pressing down...My boob was in a vice!!!My skin was stretched ''n stretched from way up by my chinAnd my poor tit was being squashed to swedish pancake thin!!!Excruciating pain I felt within it''s vice-like gripA prisoner in this vicious thing, my poor defenseless tit!!!Take a deep breath she said.Who does she think she''s kidding?My chest is smashed in her machine and woozy I am getting.There, that was good I heard her say as the room was slowly swayingNow let''s get the other one.Lord, have mercy, I was praying.It squeezed me from the up and down, it squeezed me from both sidesI''ll bet she''s never had this done to her tender little hide!!!If I had no problem when I came in, I surely have one nowIf there had been a cyst in there, it would have popped--ker pow!!This machine was made by man, of this I have no doubtI''d like to get his balls in there, for months he''d go without.

I read this and I just want to set this creep straight. I will<br /> add my comment after his. </p>\n<p>Rules chicks don''t understand:</p>\n<p>1. Nothing says ''I love you'' like a blowjob in the morning.<br /> Response: Do it yourself. If your dick won''t reach, you''re not<br /> my boyfriend.</p>\n<p>2. Learn to work the toilet seat: if it''s up put it down.<br /> R: That might work. But first you must learn to aim. No lady is<br /> willing to put down a urine covered toilet seat.</p>\n<p>3. Don''t cut your hair. Ever.<br /> R: Tell ya what, YOU can take care of this hair for a day and<br /> maybe you''ll change you mind about that.</p>\n<p>4. He''s never thinking about "The Relationship."<br /> R: If that were true, women would be lesbians.</p>\n<p>5. Sunday = Sports. It''s like the full moon or the changing of<br /> the tides. Let it be.<br /> R: Sunday = one of the two days of the week I''m not working<br /> because you sit your ass in front of the T.V. set all day long. </p>\n<p>6. Anything you wear is fine. Really.<br /> R: Then why do you always tell me my ass looks big in everything<br /> I wear.</p>\n<p>7. You have enough clothes.<br /> R: We may, but with all the breast implants you make us get it<br /> calls for new bras, dresses, shirts, bathing suits....</p>\n<p>8. You have too many shoes.<br /> R: Well in order to "look fine" in everything we wear we have to<br /> have a matching pair with every outfit.</p>\n<p>9. Crying is blackmail. Use it if you must, but don''t expect us<br /> to like it.<br /> R: Get a bigger dick and we''ll stop crying.</p>\n<p>10. Your brother is an idiot, your ex-boyfriend is an idiot and<br /> your Dad probably is too.<br /> R: Our brothers are related, they must have some intelligence.<br /> Yes our ex-boyfriends are idiots, why else would we have dumped<br /> them? My father IS an idiot, he gave YOU permission to marry me.</p>\n<p>11. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers.<br /> R: That depends on the question.</p>\n<p>12. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a<br /> doctor.<br /> R: It''s a waste of $$. He''ll only tell me to make you turn down<br /> the damn T.V.</p>\n<p>13. Nothing says ''I love you'' like a blowjob in the morning.<br /> R: Again, do it yourself. If your dick isn''t big enough your not<br /> my boyfriend.</p>\n<p>14. Don''t give us 50 rules when 25 will do.<br /> R: Don''t do 50 things wrong and there won''t be 50 rules.</p>\n<p>15. Don''t fake it. We''d rather be ineffective than deceived.<br /> R: if we stopped faking, you''d tell us you''d rather be deceived<br /> than ineffective.</p>\n<p>16. It is neither your interest nor ours to take the quiz<br /> together.<br /> R: If I brought it up its in my interest.</p>\n<p>17. Anything we said 6 or 8 months ago is inadmissible in an<br /> argument. All comments become null and void after 7 days.<br /> R: If we followed that rule then we would lose all the fights<br /> like you.</p>\n<p>18. If you don''t dress like the Victoria''s Secret girls, don''t<br /> expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br /> R: If we dressed like Victoria''s Secret then it would no longer<br /> be a secret.</p>\n<p>19. Let us ogle. If we don''t look at other women, how can we<br /> know how pretty you are?<br /> R: Here is how. You stop looking at other women and we''ll SHOW<br /> you and let you EXPERIENCE our true beauty.</p>\n<p>20. Don''t rub the lamp if you don''t want the genie to come out.<br /> R: Who said we didn''t want the genie to come out?</p>\n<p>21. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say<br /> during commercials.<br /> R: How about turning off the damn T.V. and making eye contact<br /> with us for 10 minutes?</p>\n<p>22. Christopher Columbus didn''t need directions, and neither do<br /> we.<br /> R: Christopher Columbus reached America, not his destination.</p>\n<p>23. Women wearing Wonderbras and low-cut blouses lose their<br /> right to complain about having their boobs stared at.<br /> R: Do you know how much we sweat down there?!?! If we didn''t air<br /> it out you wouldn''t enjoy them as much.</p>\n<p>24. When we''re turning the wheel and the car is nosing onto the<br /> off-ramp, you saying, "This is our exit," is not strictly<br /> necessary.<br /> R: Your right its not. Only a blonde would say that. Because we<br /> all know that it isn''t the exit you really want.</p>\n<p>25. Nothing says ''I love you'' quite like a blowjob in the<br /> morning.<br /> R: Again, do it yourself, if you dick isn''t long enough your not<br /> my boyfriend.
There was a blonde driving down the road listening to the radio. The announcer was telling blonde joke after blonde joke until the blonde was so mad that she turned her radio off. A mile down the road, she saw another blonde out in a corn field in a boat rowing. The blonde stopped her car jumped out and yelled, "It''s blondes like you that give us all a bad name.

Our [softball] team usually puts the other woman at second base, where the<br /> maximum possible number of males can get there on short notice to help out in<br /> case of emergency.  As far as I can tell, our second basewoman is a pretty<br /> good baseball player, better than I am, anyway, but there''s no way to know for<br /> sure<br /> because if the ball gets anywhere near her, a male comes barging over<br /> from, say, right field, to deal with it.  She''s been on the team for three<br /> seasons now, but the males still don''t trust her.  They know, deep in their<br /> souls, that if she had to choose between catching a fly ball and saving an<br /> infant''s life, she<br /> probably would elect to save the infant''s life, without ever considering<br /> whether there were men on base.  - Dave Barry, "Sports Is A Drag"

A young man, who worked at a driving range, picked up a couple of dozen<br /> old balls one day and took them home with him, stuffing them into his<br /> pants pockets.</p>\n<p>On the bus on his way home, an elderly old lady sat down next to him,<br /> so  he had to scrunch them up to make room for her.

A Infantry General was visiting troops in Europe. Since he was a General officer, and thus very important, he was given a chopper with a warrant officer to fly it to ferry him from unit to unit. They had been visiting units most of the day and the General came back to the chopper only to see the engine torn apart and the warrant deep in the inner workings of the chopper. The general asked the warrant what was wrong and the warrant, as warrants do, launched into an extremely complex and detailed technical explanation of exactly what was wrong with the engine. The general listened to him for a couple of minutes and then said "Stop! Now Chief, you''re paid for your technical expertise and skill, and its obvious you have that, but the other thing you need to do is to be able to communicate to others what''s wrong in terms they can understand. Now what I want you to do is to tell me what''s wrong with that chopper in words I can understand". The warrant thought for a moment and then got a big grin on his face."OK General", he said, "I think I can do that." Then the warrant officer turned around, pointed at the helicopter, and grunted "UGH, BROKE!"
Olaf and Lena were on a baseball bus trip from Fargo, North Dakota to<br /> Minneapolis, Minnesota, to see the Twins baseball game. Thirty miles out of<br /> Fargo, the bus broke down and all passengers had to disembark.</p>\n<p>Olaf says to Lena, "Hey, Lena, let''s go over dere in da bushes and have some<br /> fun." "Oh, no," says Lena. " Ve couldn''t do dat."</p>\n<p>They get back on the repaired bus, but the bus breaks down again 50 miles<br /> farther down the road. Again Olaf asks Lena to join him for some fun in the<br /> bushes, but she again refuses.</p>\n<p>The bus repaired, they get back on, drive 29 miles more, and again the bus<br /> breaks down, and Olaf asks Lena, "Can we go over dare in da bushes and have some<br /> fun? Lena says, "Ya, ve can do dat."</p>\n<p>So they go over and have their fun. Back on the bus, Olaf asks Lena why she<br /> refused the first two times, but accepted the third time.</p>\n<p>Lena replies, "Vell, I heard somebody on the bus say that if dis bus doesn''t<br /> get to Minneapolis pretty soon, the f***ing season will soon be over."
A man rented an apartment and went to the lobby to put his name on the mailbox. While there, an attractive young lady came out of an apartment next to the mailboxes wearing a robe. He smiled at her and she struck up a conversation. As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was quite obvious that she has nothing on under the robe. He broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact. </p>\n<p>After a few minutes, she placed her hand on his arm and said, "Let''s go in my apartment, I hear someone coming..." </p>\n<p>He proceeded her into the apartment, and after she closed the door, she leaned against it allowing her robe to fall completely open. She purrred at him, "I saw you looking. What would you say is my best feature?" </p>\n<p>He cleared his throat several times, looked her up and down and finally managed to squeak out, "Oh, it''s got to be your ears!" </p>\n<p>She was astounded! "Why my ears? Looks at these boobs! They are full, don''t sag, and they''re all mine! My butt -- it''s firm doesn''t sag, and has no cellulite! Look at this skin, no blemishes, or scars! Why in heaven''s name would you say my ears are the best part of my body?!" </p>\n<p>Clearing his throat once again, he stammered, "Outside when you said you heard someone coming -- THAT WAS ME!
It is the start of spring and baby bear emerges from his cave<br /> looking a wreck. He''s skin and bones; his body is shaking; his<br /> legs can barely support him and his eyes have huge bags<br /> underneath them.</p>\n<p>Seeing him, mother bear asks: "What happened, baby bear? Didn''t<br /> you hibernate like I told you to?"</p>\n<p>To which baby bear replies: "Hibernate?! Shit! I thought you<br /> said masturbate!"

It seems when Apollo Mission Astronaut, Neil Armstrong first<br /> walked on the moon, he not only gave his famous "One small Step<br /> for Man, One Giant Leap for Mankind" statement, but followed it<br /> by several remarks -- usual communication traffic between him,<br /> the other astronauts and mission control. Before he reentered<br /> the lander, he made the enigmatic remark "Good luck, Mr. Gorsky."</p>\n<p>Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning<br /> some rival Soviet Cosmounaut. However, upon checking, there was<br /> no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs.</p>\n<p>Over the years many people have questioned as to what the "Good<br /> luck, Mr. Gorsky" statement meant. A few months ago, (Jul 05<br /> Tampa Bay, Fl), while anwering questions following a speech, a<br /> reporter brought up the 26 year old question. He finally<br /> responded.</p>\n<p>It seems that Mr. Gorsky had finally died so Niel Armstrong felt<br /> he could answer the question.</p>\n<p>When he was a kid, he was playing baseball with his brother in<br /> the backyard. His brother hit a fly ball which landed in front<br /> of his neighbors bedroom window. His neighbors were Mr. and Mrs.<br /> Gorksy. As Neil leaned down to pick it up, he heard Mrs. Gorsky<br /> shouting at Mr. Gorsky.</p>\n<p>"Oral sex! It''s oral sex you want? You''ll get oral sex when the<br /> kid next door walks on the moon!"
A guy dies and goes to heaven. It''s a slow day for St. Peter,<br /> so, upon passing the entrance test, St. Peter says, "I''m not<br /> very busy today, why don''t you let me show you around?"</p>\n<p>The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the<br /> offer. St.Peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the<br /> reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria<br /> and finally, they come to a HUGE room full of clocks.</p>\n<p>The guy asks, "What''s up with these clocks?"</p>\n<p>St. Peter explains, "Everyone on earth has a clock that shows<br /> how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of<br /> time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged." The<br /> guy thinks this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks<br /> are going faster than others. He asks why is that?</p>\n<p>St. Peter explains, "Every time a living person tells a lie, it<br /> speeds his clock."</p>\n<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the<br /> room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the<br /> ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an<br /> unbelievable rate. So he asks, "What''s the story with that<br /> clock?"</p>\n<p>"Oh, that," St. Peter replies, "That''s Bill Clinton''s clock. We<br /> decided to use it as a fan."
Three men died and they went to the pearly gates.  Saint Peter told them<br /> that the kind of vehicle they would drive in heaven depended on how they<br /> lived their life.</p>\n<p>He told the first man he would have a Cadillac because<br /> he lived a good life and never cheated on his wife.</p>\n<p>He told the second he would have a motorcycle because he only cheated on<br /> his wife once and he regretted it.</p>\n<p>Then he told the third guy he would have a bicycle because<br /> he cheated on his wife alot.</p>\n<p>Well, two years later, the man on the bicycle<br /> spotted the man in the Cadillac crying.</p>\n<p>He asked why he is crying since he<br /> had such a nice car and the man replied, "I just saw my wife go by on a<br /> skateboard!"
Think YOU''RE having a bad day? It seems like some people are<br /> just plain doomed.</p>\n<p>Surprised while burgling a house in Antwerp, Belgium, a thief<br /> fled out the back door, clambered over a nine-foot wall, dropped<br /> down and found himself in the city prison. </p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>In 1976 a twenty-two-year-old Irishman, Bob Finnegan, was<br /> crossing the busy Falls Road in Belfast, when he was struck by a<br /> taxi and flung over its roof. The taxi drove away and, as<br /> Finnegan lay stunned in the road, another car ran into him,<br /> rolling him into the gutter. It too drove on. As a knot of<br /> gawkers gathered to examine the magnetic Irishman, a delivery<br /> van plowed through the crowd, leaving in its wake three injured<br /> bystanders and an even more battered Bob Finnegan. When a fourth<br /> vehicle came along, the crowd wisely scattered and only one<br /> person was hit-Bob Finnegan. In the space of two minutes<br /> Finnegan suffered a fractured skull, broken pelvis, broken leg,<br /> and other assorted injuries. Hospital officials said he would<br /> recover. </p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>While motorcycling through the Hungarian countryside, Cristo<br /> Falatti came up to a railway line just as the crossing gates<br /> were coming down. While he sat idling, he was joined by a farmer<br /> with a goat, which the farmer tethered to the crossing gate. A<br /> few moments later a horse and cart drew up behind Falatti,<br /> followed in short order by a man in a sports car. When the train<br /> roared through the crossing, the horse startled and bit Falatti<br /> on the arm. Not a man to be trifled with, Falatti responded by<br /> punching the horse in the head. In consequence the horse''s owner<br /> jumped down from his cart and began scuffling with the<br /> motorcyclist. The horse, which was not up to this sort of<br /> excitement, backed away briskly, smashing the cart into the<br /> sports- car. At this, the sports-car driver leaped out of his<br /> car and joined the fray. The farmer came forward to try to<br /> pacify the three flailing men. As he did so, the crossing gates<br /> rose and his goat was strangled. At last report, the insurance<br /> companies were still trying to sort out the claims. </p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Two West German motorists had an all-too-literal head-on<br /> collision in heavy fog near the small town of Guetersloh. Each<br /> was guiding his car at a snail''s pace near the center of the<br /> road. At the moment of impact their heads were both out of the<br /> windows when they smacked together. Both men were hospitalized<br /> with severe head injuries. Their cars weren''t scratched. </p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>In a classic case of one thing leading to another, seven men<br /> aged eighteen to twenty-nine received jail sentences of three to<br /> four years in Kingston-on-Thames, England, in 1979 after a fight<br /> that started when one of the men threw a french fry at another<br /> while they stood waiting for a train. </p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Hitting on the novel idea that he could end his wife''s incessant<br /> nagging by giving her a good scare, Hungarian Jake Fen built an<br /> elaborate harness to make it look as if he had hanged himself.<br /> When his wife came home and saw him she fainted. Hearing a<br /> disturbance a neighbor came over and, finding what she thought<br /> were two corpses, seized the opportunity to loot the place. As<br /> she was leaving the room, her arms laden, the outraged and<br /> suspended Mr. Fen kicked her stoutly in the backside. This so<br /> surprised the lady that she dropped dead of a heart attack.<br /> Happily, Mr. Fen was acquitted of manslaughter and he and his<br /> wife were reconciled. </p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>An unidentified English woman, according to the London Sunday<br /> Express was climbing into the bathtub one afternoon when she<br /> remembered she had left some muffins in the oven. Naked, she<br /> dashed downstairs and was removing the muffins when she heard a<br /> noise at the door. Thinking it was the baker, and knowing he<br /> would come in and leave a loaf of bread on the kitchen table if<br /> she didn''t answer his knock, the woman darted into the broom<br /> cupboard. A few moments later she heard the back door open and,<br /> to her eternal mortification, the sound of footsteps coming<br /> toward the cupboard. It was the man from the gas company, come<br /> to read the meter. "Oh," stammered the woman, "I was expecting<br /> the baker." The gas man blinked, excused himself and departed.

There were three guys stuck on an island, the first guy was a African, the second was a German, and the third one was a redneck.</p>\n<p>    While swimming at the beach the African found a magical lamp and rubbed it. A jenie came out and told them three that he would grant them all one wish.</p>\n<p>    The African went first and wished to go back to Africa with his family. Then the German went second and wished to go back to germany with his family. Finally it was the rednecks turn so the jenie asked him ," What is your wish."" The redneck paused and started looking around and said 
Dear Mr. Johnson:Ann Landers wouldn''t print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain.It''s about my son, Billy. He''s always been a good, normal 10 year old boy. Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy.We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire -- you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying.I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It''s where he went last year. Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago.I DON''T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED. He''s changed. I can''t explain it. See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy''s letters:----------------------------------- Letter # 1---------- The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only good part. We''re learning how to program. Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up. Love, Billy. Letter # 2------------- Dear Mom, Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We all get to choose what we want to drink. By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I''m getting used to it now. Gotta go, it''s time for the flowchart class. Love, Billy.P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It''s spell checked too. Letter # 3------------- Dear Mom, Don''t worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I don''t have much of a tan cause we don''t go outside very often. You can''t see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I''m okay, really.Love, Billy. Letter # 4------------- Dear Mom, I''m fine. I''m sleeping enough. I''m eating enough. This is the best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Can you send more money? I''ve got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad.Love, Billy. Letter # 5------------- Dear Mother, Forget the money for the telephone. We''ve got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven''t written. I''ve been learning a lot. I''m real good at getting onto any computer in the country. It''s really easy! I got into the university''s in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five, he''s going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He''s really smart. He says that I shouldn''t call myself Billy anymore. So, I''m not.Signed, William. Letter # 6------------- Dear Mother, How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why''d you get so upset? I haven''t gained that much weight. The glasses aren''t real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you''d be proud of my program. After all, I''ve made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I''ve paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won''t be home until late August.Regards, William. Letter # 7------------- Mother, Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.? I won''t write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me.Sincerely, William.-------------What can I do, Mr. Johnson?See what I mean? It''s been two weeks since I''ve heard from my little boy. I know that it''s probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so. Thank you very much.Sally Gates, Concerned Parent

DEMERIT POINT SYSTEM USED BY WOMEN</p>\n<p>(The code is finally broken - the demerit system is no longer a mystery!) For all you guys out there who just can''t figure it out, here it is: In the world of romance and relationship responsibilities, one single rule applies: Make the woman happy.

(e.g. tweeters, hooters, sub-woofers, super-sub-woofers, seismic noise generators, etc.)6.  The system should resemble the cockpit of an F16 or 757 aircraft; the more knobs and dials you can turn, the better.7.  The system should have full remote control capability, including over the mobile auto cellular phone so that the stereo can be playing as you get home.8.  Should have the capability of playing different music in every room of the house.9.  Components should have a cool names; this means no department store brands.10.

You should be a year or two ahead of everyone else.  Equipment over the warranty period is obsolete and should be disposed of promptly.12. The most important factor--out of everyone you know who owns stereo equipment, yours should be better.

They treat you like a customer, not a patient. </p>\n<p>$5 worth of tips a day will have the entire staff scrambling to help you. </p>\n<p>There is a city bus stop out front, and seniors ride free. The handicap bus will also pick you up (if you fake a decent limp). </p>\n<p>For a change of scenery, take the airport shuttle bus and eat at one of the nice restaurants there. </p>\n<p>It takes months to get into decent nursing homes. Holiday Inn will take your reservation today. And you are not stuck in one place forever, you can move from Inn to Inn, or even from city to city. Want to see Hawaii? They have a Holiday Inn too. </p>\n<p>TV broken? Light bulbs need changing? Need a mattress replaced? No problem. They fix everything. </p>\n<p>The Inn has a night security person and daily room service. The maid checks to see if you are ok. If not, they will call the undertaker or an ambulance. </p>\n<p>If you fall and break a hip, Medicare will pay for the hip, and Holiday Inn will upgrade you to a suite for the rest of your life. </p>\n<p>And no worries about visits from family. They will always be glad to find you, and probably check in for a few days mini-vacation. The grandkids can use the pool. What more can you ask for? </p>\n<p>So, when I reach the golden age I''ll face it with a grin. Just forward all my email to: me@Holiday.Inn</p>\n<p>Submitted by Sherri<br /> Edited by Tantilazing
A man staggers into an emergency room with two black eyes and a five iron<br /> wrapped tightly around his throat. Naturally the doctor asks him what<br /> happened. </p>\n<p>Well, it was like this, said the man. I was having a quiet round of golf<br /> with my wife, when she sliced her ball into a pasture of cows. </p>\n<p>We went to look for it, and while I was rooting around I noticed one of<br /> the cows had something white at its rear end. I walked over and lifted up<br /> the tail, and sure enough, there was my wife''s golf ball........stuck<br /> right in the middle of the cow''s butt. That''s when I made my mistake. </p>\n<p>"What did you do?" asks the doctor. </p>\n<p>Well, I lifted the tail and yelled to my wife, "Hey, this looks like<br /> yours!"

Standing at the edge of the lake, a fisherman saw a woman flailing about in<br /> the deep water. Another man was standing on the shore screaming for help.<br /> The fisherman ran over to the man. "Help!" the other man started, "I can''t<br /> swim! My wife''s drowning! I''ll give you $1000 if you save her!"<br /> The fisherman jumps in the water, swims powerfully out to the drowning woman,<br /> puts his arm around her, and swims back to shore. Depositing her at the feet of<br /> the man, the fisherman coughs up water, then says, "[cough] ok, bud, where''s my<br /> ''grand''?"<br /> "But, this is my *mother-in-law*!"<br /> The fisherman reaches into his pocket with a frown and says, "Just my luck.<br /> Ok, how much do I owe you?"

Jack and his friends were playing golf one Saturday. As they are getting ready<br /> to tee off, a guy walks up and asks if he can join them. The friends look at<br /> each other, look at the guy and say, ''Sure.'' About two holes into the game, the<br /> friends get curious about what the guy does for a living. So they ask him. The<br /> stranger tells them he''s a hitman. They all laugh. The guy says, ''No really, I<br /> am a hitman. My gun is in my golf bag. I carry it everywhere. You can take a<br /> look at it if you like.'' So Jack decides to check it out. He opens the bag and,<br /> sure enough, there is a rifle with a huge scope attached. Jack gets all excited<br /> and says, ''WOW! I bet I can see my house through here! May I look?'' The hit man<br /> replies, ''Sure.'' So Jack looks and says, ''YEAH! You can see my house! I can even<br /> see through the windows into my bedroom. There''s my wife. Wait, there''s my next<br /> door neighbor! And he''s naked too!'' This really upsets Jack so he asks how much<br /> it would be for a hit. The hitman replies, ''I get $1000 every time I pull the<br /> trigger.'' Jack responds, ''$1000? Well, OK, I want two hits. I want you to shoot<br /> my wife right in the mouth. She''s always nagging at me and I can''t stand it.<br /> Second, I want you to shoot my neighbor in the penis, just for screwing around<br /> with my wife.'' The hit man agrees, gears up and looks through the scope. He''s<br /> looking for about five minutes until finally Jack starts to get really impatient<br /> and asks, ''What are you waiting for? The hitman replies, ''Relax..... I''m about<br /> to save you a thousand bucks!''

A married couple was in a terrible accident where the woman''s face was severely burned. The doctor told the husband that they couldn''t graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny. So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin. However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks. The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter.After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman''s new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty.One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, "Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you.""My darling," he replied, "think nothing of it. I get all the thanks I need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek.

George and Harriet decided to celebrate their 25th Wedding Anniversary with a trip to Las Vegas. When they entered the hotel/casino and registered, a sweet young woman dressed in a very short skirt became very friendly. George brushed her off.Harriet objected, "George, that young woman was nice, and you were so rude.""Harriet, she''s a prostitute.""I don''t believe you. That sweet young thing?""Let''s go up to our room and I''ll prove it."In their room, George called down to the desk and asked for ''Bambi'' to come to room 1217."Now," he said, "you hide in the bathroom with the door open just enough to hear us, OK?"Soon, there was a knock on the door. George opened it and Bambi walked in, swirling her hips provocatively.George asked, "How much do you charge?""$125 basic rate, $100 tips for special services."Even George was taken aback."$125! I was thinking more in the range of $25."Bambi laughed derisively."You must really be a hick if you think you can buy sex for that price.""Well," said George, "I guess we can''t do business. Goodbye."After she left, Harriet came out of the bathroom. She said, "I just can''t believe it!"George said, "Let''s forget it. We''ll go have a drink, then eat dinner."At the bar, as they sipped their cocktails, Bambi came up behind George, pointed slyly at Harriet, and said, "See what you get for $25?"
A young blonde was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana.<br /> She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very<br /> reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking. </p>\n<p>After becoming very frustrated with the "no haggle" attitude of one of the<br /> shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, "Maybe I''ll just go out and catch my own<br /> alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!" </p>\n<p>The shopkeeper said, "By all means, is my guest. Maybe<br /> You�酶惟ll luck out and catch yourself a big one!" </p>\n<p>Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching<br /> herself an alligator. </p>\n<p>Later in the day, the shopkeeper is driving home, when he spots the young<br /> woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he sees a<br /> huge 9 foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She takes aim, kills the<br /> creature and with a great deal of effort hauls it on to the swamp bank. Laying<br /> nearby were several more of the dead creatures. </p>\n<p>The shopkeeper watches in amazement. Just then the blonde flips the alligator<br /> on it''s back, and frustrated, shouts out, "Damn it, this<br /> One isn''t wearing any shoes either!"
The following appeared in a computer magazine in Mr. Dvorak''s column (according with the original sender) </p>\n<p><em>Dear Mr. Dvorak: </em></p>\n<p><em>Ann Landers wouldn''t print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain. It''s about my son, Billy. He''s always been a good, normal ten year old boy. Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy. We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying. I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It''s where he went last year. (He made an adorable picture out of painted pinto beans and macaroni). Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP. We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago. I don''t know what''s happened. He''s changed. I can''t explain it. See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy''s letters.</em></p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only good part. We''re learning how to program. Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We all get to choose what we want to drink. I drink Classic Coke. By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I''m getting used to it now. Gotta go, it''s time for the flowchart class. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It''s spell checked too. </p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>Don''t worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I don''t have much of a tan ''cause we don''t go outside very often. You can''t see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I''m okay, really. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>I''m fine. I''m sleeping enough. I''m eating enough. This is the best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Frederick says it''s okay. Can you send more money? I spent mine on a pocket protector and a box of blank diskettes. I''ve got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>Dear Mother, </p>\n<p>Forget the money for the telephone. We''ve got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven''t written. I''ve been learning a lot. I''m real good at getting onto any computer in the country. It''s really easy! I got into the university''s in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five, he''s going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He''s really smart. He says that I shouldn''t call myself Billy anymore. So, I''m not.</p>\n<p>Signed, </p>\n<p>William. </p>\n<p>Dear Mother, </p>\n<p>How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why''d you get so upset? I haven''t gained that much weight. The glasses aren''t real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you''d be proud of my program. After all, I''ve made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I''ve paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won''t be home until late August. </p>\n<p>Regards, </p>\n<p>William. </p>\n<p>Mother, </p>\n<p>Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.? I won''t write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me. </p>\n<p>Sincerely, </p>\n<p>William. </p>\n<p>See what I mean? It''s been two weeks since I''ve heard from my little boy. What can I do, Mr. Dvorak? I know that it''s probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE ...CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so. </p>\n<p>Thank you very much. </p>\n<p>Sally Gates, </p>\n<p>Concerned Parent
The following appeared in a computer magazine in Mr. Dvorak''s column (according with the original sender) </p>\n<p><em>Dear Mr. Dvorak: </em></p>\n<p><em>Ann Landers wouldn''t print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain. It''s about my son, Billy. He''s always been a good, normal ten year old boy. Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy. We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying. I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It''s where he went last year. (He made an adorable picture out of painted pinto beans and macaroni). Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP. We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago. I don''t know what''s happened. He''s changed. I can''t explain it. See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy''s letters.</em></p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only good part. We''re learning how to program. Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We all get to choose what we want to drink. I drink Classic Coke. By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I''m getting used to it now. Gotta go, it''s time for the flowchart class. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It''s spell checked too. </p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>Don''t worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I don''t have much of a tan ''cause we don''t go outside very often. You can''t see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I''m okay, really. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>Dear Mom, </p>\n<p>I''m fine. I''m sleeping enough. I''m eating enough. This is the best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Frederick says it''s okay. Can you send more money? I spent mine on a pocket protector and a box of blank diskettes. I''ve got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad. </p>\n<p>Love, </p>\n<p>Billy. </p>\n<p>Dear Mother, </p>\n<p>Forget the money for the telephone. We''ve got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven''t written. I''ve been learning a lot. I''m real good at getting onto any computer in the country. It''s really easy! I got into the university''s in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five, he''s going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He''s really smart. He says that I shouldn''t call myself Billy anymore. So, I''m not.</p>\n<p>Signed, </p>\n<p>William. </p>\n<p>Dear Mother, </p>\n<p>How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why''d you get so upset? I haven''t gained that much weight. The glasses aren''t real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you''d be proud of my program. After all, I''ve made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I''ve paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won''t be home until late August. </p>\n<p>Regards, </p>\n<p>William. </p>\n<p>Mother, </p>\n<p>Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.? I won''t write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me. </p>\n<p>Sincerely, </p>\n<p>William. </p>\n<p>See what I mean? It''s been two weeks since I''ve heard from my little boy. What can I do, Mr. Dvorak? I know that it''s probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE ...CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so. </p>\n<p>Thank you very much. </p>\n<p>Sally Gates, </p>\n<p>Concerned Parent
Q: Why didn''t the monster make the football team?<br /> A: Because he threw like a ghoul!
THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMASOn the first day of Christmas, my kitten ruined for me........    A batch of my special hand-print cookies. I had turned my back to grab the cookie sheet sitting on the stove. In that micro-second, Sara climbed onto the table, poked her paw into the delightfully kneady mixture and, suddenly off-balance, fell into the cookie dough. Net loss? Six cups of flour, four cups of sugar, three sticks of butter.... Of course, it would have been cheaper to remove the feline ingredient, pick out the hairs, and just rename the recipe Paw Print Cookies. On the second day of Christmas, my kitten accompanied me........    On a trip to the vet clinic. Who knew that skinny curling ribbon has feline taste appeal? I didn''t. Damages: $28 for the office visit, $36 for anesthesia so the veterinarian could take $55 X-rays in case Sara had taste-tested any other Christmas decorations, and a heck of a lot of embarrassment when the vet removed the 3'' curly tail in slightly less than two seconds by tugging at it with a pair of tweezers. On the third day of Christmas, my kitten wrecked for me........    13 ornaments on my Christmas tree. My mistake was forgetting to chain the decorations to the branches. My other error was leaving the room to go to the bathroom while Sara feigned sleeping under the tree. How was I to know the was actually measuring its climbing potential? Value of broken bulbs? 7.50 plus tax.    On the fourth day of Christmas, my kitten broke for me........    A statue in my Lenox Nativity. Would you believe two Wise men plus a head? Lenox nativity figurines: $55.99    On the fifth day of Christmas, my kitten scratched for me........    The kid across the street who collects for charity. It was an accident. She merely wanted to reach out and touch someone. Unfortunately, she used a unsheathed claw to do so. I settled out-of-court for the cost of a jacket to replace the boy''s blood stained one and a hefty donation to the charity of their choice. Although the amount must remain secret according to our settlement, let me put it this way. You haven''t seen many soldiers for the Salvation Army this year, have you? Think: Major Windfall!    On the sixth day of Christmas, my kitten opened for me........    The presents beneath my Christmas tree. It was only two, really. While doing some early shopping at a discount store, I purchased a catnip mouse for Sara''s stocking. Apparently, anything in the same bag as catnip takes on its potent aroma for a very long time. Replacement costs: $3.99 for another roll of Christmas wrapping paper, $4.50 for two empty boxes, $1 each for the kind of bows Sara can''t unravel.    On the seventh day of Christmas, my kitten lost for me........    The earrings I bought for my sister Mary. Actually, it was one earring but since Mary doesn''t have a hole in her nose or navel, a pair of matching earrings does make a more appealing gift. Sale price: $29.95 plus tax.    On the eighth day of Christmas, my kitten helped me........    Replace my E and G guitar strings. Would you believe a kitten could fit into the itty-bitty hole in the middle of my Yamaha guitar? Neither could I, but Sara thought so. And she succeeded once she got those rascally strings out of the way. Unfortunately, her little rear end couldn''t get out the way I came in. After paying through the whiskers for her previous escapades, I would have been willing to leave her in the guitar for the duration of the holiday season, except that she chose to get stuck two hours before I was due at the nursing home for our annual Christmas carol sing-a-long. Set of steel guitar strings: $12.95; jar of petroleum jelly: 79 cents.    On the ninth day of Christmas, my kitten destroyed for me........    My Christmas card list when she walked across my computer''s delete key. Cost for call to Computer Country''s 900/help line: $17.50. And I still don''t know what happened to the listings of B through H.    On the tenth day of Christmas, my kitten hid from me........    The remote control from my 13-inch TV. This wouldn''t be such a disaster if she hadn''t previously stolen the power knob. I missed a week''s worth of Christmas specials, including my all-time favorite, ''It''s a Wonderful Life.'' Rental of ''It''s a Wonderful Life'': $2; purchase of book, ''Good owners, great cats'': $24.95. Unfortunately, it never mentions the psychological profile of kittens with kleptomania.    On the eleventh day of Christmas, my kitten ate for me........    The drumsticks off my 19-pound turkey. OK,OK, So this one time it was my fault. I knew I never should have uttered those now infamous words: ''Your first turkey, Sara. Want to try just a little piece?'' Cost: Christmas Dinner.       On the 12th day of Christmas........    Sara rested. And so, thank goodness, did my VISA card.

As the young couple prepare to go to bed on their wedding night, the groom says to his bride, "Honey, I have a confession to make. I''m a golf addict. I play whenever I have a minute. I can''t get enough of it. You''ll probably never see me on the weekends."</p>\n<p>His bride looked a little uneasy and then said, "Honey I have a confession also...I''m a hooker."</p>\n<p>"No problem." Replied the groom, "Just keep your left arm straight and keep that head down. You''ll be hitting them straight in no time."</p>\n<p>Submitted by Calamjo<br /> Edited by Curtis
Three Texas plastic surgeons were playing golf together and discussing surgeries they had performed. </p>\n<p>One of them said, "I''m the best plastic surgeon in Texas. A concert pianist lost 7 fingers in an accident, I reattached them, and 8 months later he performed a private concert for the Queen of England."</p>\n<p>One of the others said. "That''s nothing. A young man lost both arms and legs in an accident, I reattached them, and 2 years later he won a gold medal in 5 field events in the Olympics."</p>\n<p>The third surgeon said, "You guys are amateurs. Several years ago a cowboy who was high on cocaine and alcohol rode a horse head-on into a train traveling 80 miles an hour. All I had left to work with was the horse''s ass and a cowboy hat. Now he''s president of the United States."

After Christmas break, the teacher asked her small pupils how they spent their holidays. </p>\n<p>One small boy''s reply went like this: </p>\n<p>We always spent Christmas with Grandpa and Grandma. They used to live here in a big brick house, but Grandpa got retarted and they moved to Arizona. </p>\n<p>They go to a big building they call a wrecked hall. But if it was wrecked, it is fixed now. They play games there and do exercises, but they don''t do them very well. </p>\n<p>There is a swimming pool and they go to it and just stand in the water with their hats on. I guess they don''t know how to swim. My Grandma used to bake cookies and stuff, but I guess she forgot how. Nobody cooks there. They all go to fastfood restaurants. </p>\n<p>As you come into the park, there is a doll house with a man sitting in it. He watches all day so they can''t get out without him seeing them. They wear badges with their names on them. I guess they don''t know who they are. </p>\n<p>My Grandma said Grandpa worked hard all his life and earned his retardment. I wish they would move back home, but I guess the man in the doll house won''t let them out.

If everyone in a team dies, it''s the last man''s job to win the fight against his enemy.
Three guys, a father, son, and grandfather go out to play a round of golf. As<br /> they are on the way out to the first tee they are joking, bulls*******, and<br /> cussing, very much the men''s day out. Just before the son is ready to tee off,<br /> this fine looking woman walks up carrying her clubs. She says that her partner<br /> didn''t show and asks if she can join them. </p>\n<p>The guys say sure, since she is a really beautiful woman. </p>\n<p>The kid kind of grumbles that now they can''t cuss and bulls*** around. </p>\n<p>The lady turns to the three of them and says, "I don''t care what the three of<br /> you do, and cuss, smoke, chew, spit or whatever, just don''t try to coach me on<br /> my game." </p>\n<p>The guys say o.k. And ask if she would like to tee off first. </p>\n<p>All eyes are on her ass as her skirt rides up as she bends over to place the<br /> ball. </p>\n<p>She then proceeds to knock the s*** out of the ball right up the middle. </p>\n<p>She just starts pounding these guys, par every hole. They get to the 18th and<br /> she has a 12-foot putt for par. </p>\n<p>She turns around and says, "you guys have done a great job at not trying to<br /> coach me on my game, I have never shot par before and I am going to ask all of<br /> your opinions in this putt. Now if any of those opinions help me make the par I<br /> will give each of you a blow job that you will never forget." </p>\n<p>The guys think what a deal. The kid walks over eyes up the putt for a couple<br /> of minutes and finally says, "lady, aim that putt six inches to the right of the<br /> hole, the ball will break left 12 inches from the hole and will go in the cup." </p>\n<p>The father walks up and says, "don''t listen to the youngster, aim 12 inches<br /> to the right and the ball will break left 2 feet from the hole and fall in the<br /> cup." </p>\n<p>The grandfather looks at the both of them in disgust, walks over picks up the<br /> ball and says, "f*** the putt, that''s a gimme."

Little Harley kept disrupting his third grade class by regularly letting loud farts. His teacher kept him after school. When she insisted on knowing why he exhibited such offensive behaviour, Little Harley said, "I do it because I can do it better than anybody, and I''m very proud of that fact."The teacher says, "If I show you I can do it better than you, will you stop?"Little Harley agreed and the teacher placed two pieces of paper on the floor with identical piles of chalk dust on each one. Harley dropped his pants, squatted down, farted and blew all but a tiny little speck of dust off the paper. The teacher dropped her panties, lifted her skirt, squatted down and farted but when she was done, and there was not a trace of chalk dust left on the paper.Harley was astonished and asked if he could see her do it again. She was willing and as she repeated the process, Harley peeked up underneath her skirt."No wonder you won!" he exclaimed indignantly, "you''ve got a Double-Barrel!"

A man and his wife were driving through country on their way from New York to California.<br /> Looking at his fuel gauge, he decided to stop at the next gasoline station and fill up. About 15 minutes later, he spots a Mobil station and pulls over to the high octane pump. </p>\n<p>"What can I do for ya''ll?" asks the attendant. </p>\n<p>"Fill `er up with high test," replies the driver. </p>\n<p>While the attendant is filling up the tank, he''s looking the car up and down. </p>\n<p>"What kinda car is this?" he asks. "I never seen one like it before." </p>\n<p>"Well," responds the driver, his chest swelling up with pride, "This, my boy. It is a 1998 Cadillac DeVille." </p>\n<p>"What all''s it got in it?" asks the attendant. </p>\n<p>"Well," says the driver, "It has everything. It''s loaded with power steering, power seats, power sun roof, power mirrors, AM/FM radio with a 10 deck CD player in the trunk with 100 watts per channel, 8 speaker stereo, rack and pinion steering, disk brakes all around, leather interior, digital instrument package, and best of all, a 8.8 liter V12 engine." </p>\n<p>"Wow," says the attendant, "that''s really something!" </p>\n<p>"How much do I owe you for the gasoline?" asks the driver. </p>\n<p>"That''ll be $30.17," says the attendant. </p>\n<p>The driver pulls out his money clip and peels off a $20 and a $10. He goes into his other pocket and pulls out a handful of change. Mixed up with the change are a few golf tees. </p>\n<p>"What are those little wooden things?" asks the attendant. </p>\n<p>"That''s what I put my balls on when I drive," says the driver. </p>\n<p>"Wow," says the attendant, "Those Cadillac people think of everything!"

There was a boy who worked in the produce section of a market. A man came in and asked to buy half a head of lettuce. The boy told him that they only sold whole heads of lettuce, but the man replied that he did not need a whole head, only a half. </p>\n<p>The boy explained that he would have to ask the manager and so he walked into the back room and said, "There is some jerk out there who wants to buy only a half a head of lettuce." </p>\n<p>As he finished saying this, he turned around to find the man standing right behind him, so he quickly added, "and this gentleman wants to buy the other half". </p>\n<p>The manager okayed the request and the man went on his way. </p>\n<p>Later on the manager said to the boy, "You almost got yourself in a lot of trouble earlier, but I must say I was impressed with the way you got out of it. You think on your feet and we like that around here. Where are you from son?" </p>\n<p>The boy replied, "Minnesota sir". </p>\n<p>"Oh, really? Why did you leave Minnesota" asked the manager. </p>\n<p>The boy replied, "They''re all just whores and hockey players up there." </p>\n<p>"My wife is from Minnesota!" </p>\n<p>The boy replied, "Really! What team did she play for?"
A policeman was patrolling near midnight at a local parking spot<br /> overlooking a golf course. He drove by a car and saw a couple inside with<br /> the dome light on. Inside there was a young man in the driver''s seat<br /> reading a computer magazine and a young lady in the back seat calmly<br /> knitting.</p>\n<p>He stopped to investigate</p>\n<p>He walked up to the driver''s window and knocked.

"I''m reading this<br /> magazine."</p>\n<p>Pointing towards the young lady in the back seat, the officer then asked,<br /> "And what is she doing?"</p>\n<p>The young man looked over his shoulder and replied, "I think she''s<br /> knitting a sweater."</p>\n<p>Confused, the officer asked, "How old are you, young man?"

A lady was a huge Paul MCCartney fan and wanted a tattoo of him on the inside of her thigh. She went to the parlour and told the guy what she wanted. He said "OK, take your skirt and underwear off and sit in the chair with your legs apart", She did that and he started on the tattoo (the joke goes great if you do all the tattoo-type noises etc.). </p>\n<p>Pretty soon he''s done, blows off the dust and admired his work. "Who the fuck''s that?" she says. </p>\n<p>"It''s Paul McCartney he says". </p>\n<p>"Doesn''t look like hime at all" says she. </p>\n<p>"Now get it right or I''ll report you". </p>\n<p>So the tattooist starts on the othert thigh. Really trying hard to do a better job. (Noises again go great when telling the joke). Finally he''s done, blows off the dust and feels pretty good. The woman is pissed off "No fucking way that''s Paul Mccartney" she says. </p>\n<p>"It bloody well is" says the man. </p>\n<p>"Listen I''ll get a second opinion" He goes out of his store and grabs the first person he sees. </p>\n<p>The guy is a drunk who''s been stumbling along the sidewalk. The tattoist drags the drunk into his store. There''s the woman, sitting legs apart with nothing on below her waist. The tattoist says to the drunk (pointing at the womans legs) "Tell me who the hell you think that is" </p>\n<p>The drunk says (in a drunken slur voice) "I''ve no idea who the people are on her thighs but the guy in the middle is a dead ringer for Willie Nelson".
A friend just got back from a holiday ski trip to Utah with the kind of story that warms the cockles of anybody''s heart. Conditions were perfect, 12 below, no feeling in the toes, basic numbness all over. The "Tell me when we''re having fun" kind of day. </p>\n<p>One of the women in the group complained to her husband that she was in dire need of a restroom. He told her not to worry, that he was sure there was relief at the top of the lift in the form of a powder room for female skiers in distress. He was wrong, of course, and the pain did not go away. </p>\n<p>If you''ve ever had nature hit its panic button in you, then you know That a temperature of 12 below zero doesn''t help matters. So with time running out, she weighed her options. </p>\n<p>Her husband, picking up on the intensity of the pain, suggested that since she was wearing an all white ski outfit, she should go off in the woods. No one would ever notice, he assured her. The white will provide more than adequate camouflage. So she headed for the tree line, began disrobing and proceeded to do her thing. If you''ve ever parked on the side of a slope, then you know there is a right way and a wrong way to set your skies so you don''t move. Yup, you got it. She had the skies positioned the wrong way. </p>\n<p>Steep slopes are not forgiving, even during embarrassing moments. Without any warning, the woman found herself skiing backward, out of control racing through the trees, somehow missing all of them, and on to the slope. Her derriere and the reverse side were still bare, her pants down around her knees, and she was picking up speed all the while she continued on backwards, totally out-of-control, creating an unusual sight for the other skiers. </p>\n<p>The woman skied, if you define that verb loosely, back under the lift, and finally collided violently with a pylon. The bad news was she broke her arm and was unable to pull up the ski pants. At long last her husband arrived, put an end to her nude show, then went to the base of the mountain and summoned the ski patrol, who transported her to a hospital. </p>\n<p>In the emergency room she was regrouping when a man with a broken leg was put in a bed next to hers. </p>\n<p>"So, how''d you break your leg?" She asked, making small talk. </p>\n<p>"It was the darndest thing you ever saw," he said "I was riding up this ski lift and suddenly I couldn''t believe my eyes. There was this crazy woman skiing backwards out of control down the mountain with her bare bottom hanging out. I leaned over to get a better look and I guess I didn''t realize how far I''d moved. I fell out of the lift." </p>\n<p>"So how''d you break your arm?"
After a very successful career, a former Human Relations guru found herself at<br /> the pearly gates. </p>\n<p>"Welcome to Heaven," said St.Peter. "Before you get settled in though, it<br /> seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we''ve never once had a Human<br /> Resources Director make it this far, and we''re not really sure what to do with<br /> you, so what we''re going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven<br /> and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in." </p>\n<p>With that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and went down to hell.<br /> The doors opened, and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a<br /> beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and standing in front<br /> of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with - and<br /> they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up, kissed<br /> her and talked about old times. </p>\n<p>They played an excellent round of golf, and at night went to the country club,<br /> where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil, who<br /> was </p>\n<p>actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes<br /> and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was<br /> time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and </p>\n<p>waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. </p>\n<p>The elevator went up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates, and she found St.<br /> Peter waiting for her. "Now it''s time to spend a day in heaven," he said. So she<br /> spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and<br /> singing. She had a great time, and before she knew it, her 24 hours were up and<br /> St. Peter came and got her and asked her to choose. </p>\n<p>The woman paused for a second and then replied, "Well, I never thought I''d say<br /> this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better<br /> time in Hell." So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went<br /> down-down-down back to Hell. </p>\n<p>When the doors of the elevator opened, she found herself standing in a<br /> desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends were<br /> dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The<br /> Devil came up to her and put his arm around her. </p>\n<p>"I don''t understand," stammered the woman, "yesterday I was here and there was<br /> a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a<br /> great time. Now, all there is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look<br /> miserable." </p>\n<p>The Devil looked at her and smiled. "Yesterday, we were recruiting you, today<br /> you''re staff."
A foursome is waiting at the men''s tee when another foursome of ladies are<br /> hitting from the ladies tee. The ladies are taking their time and when<br /> finally the last one is ready to hit the ball she hacks it about 10 feet,<br /> goes over to it, hacks it another ten feet and looks up at the men waiting<br /> and says apologetically, "I guess all those fucking lessons I took this<br /> winter didn''t help" </p>\n<p>One of the men immediately replies: "No, you see that''s your problem. You<br /> should have been taking golf lessons instead."
A golfer, playing a round by himself, is about to tee off, and a greasy little salesman runs up to him, and yells, "Wait! Before you tee off, I have something really amazing to show you!" The golfer, annoyed, says, "What is it?" "It''s a special golf ball," says the salesman. "You can never lose it!" "Whattaya mean," scoffs the golfer, "you can never lose it? What if you hit it into the water?" "No problem," says the salesman. "It floats, and it detects where the shore is, and spins towards it." "Well, what if you hit it into the woods?" "Easy," says the salesman. "It emits a beeping sound, and you can find it with your eyes closed." "Okay," says the golfer, impressed. "But what if your round goes late and it gets dark?" "No problem, sir, this golf ball glows in the dark! I''m telling you, you can never lose this golf ball!" The golfer buys it at once. "Just one question," he says to the salesman. "Where did you get it?" "I found it."
With yet another young man in her life Elizabeth Taylor decided that in her advancing years she needed to tighten up her vaginal area. She put her trust in her plastic surgeon of 30 years standing, the one who had carried out her face-lifts, boob jobs and ass-lifts. Sworn to secrecy, he agreed that no-one but him would ever know. He carried out the delicate operation, carefully slicing away strips of the loose folds of skin. It is a long operation!Liz awakes the next morning to see 3 "get well soon" cards on her bedside table. She is appalled and demands to see the doctor. "No-one but you should know about this! You have let me down", she says."Ah" says the doc," this card is from my wife and I wishing you a speedy recovery." "How nice ", says Liz." Thank you - what a nice thought." "The second card is from old Madge the cleaner who has cleaned up after all your previous operations - she is to be trusted.""What a beautiful thought , from such a humble person -I''m really touched", says Liz. "�酶惟But who is the 3rd card from?" asks Liz."Oh", says the doctor, "that''s from Evander Holyfield -- thanking you for his new ears!!!"
A guy took his girlfriend to her first football game. Afterward he asked her how she liked the game."I liked it, but I couldn''t understand why they were killing each other for 25 cents," she said."What do you mean?" he asked."Well, everyone kept yelling, ''Get the quarter back!''"

Sharp-tongued comedian Dennis Miller has been chosen as part of the new broadcast team for ABC Monday Night Football this coming year.

A guy is stranded on a desert island, all alone for ten years. One day, he<br /> sees a speck on the horizon. He thinks to himself, "It''s not a ship." The<br /> speck gets a little closer and he thinks, "It''s not a boat." The speck gets<br /> even closer and he thinks, "It''s not a raft." Then, out of the surf comes a<br /> gorgeous blonde woman, wearing a wet suit and scuba gear.</p>\n<p>She comes up to the guy and says, "How long has it been since you''ve had a<br /> cigarette?"</p>\n<p>"Ten years!", he says.</p>\n<p>She reaches over and unzips a waterproof pocket on her left sleeve and pulls<br /> out a pack of fresh cigarettes.</p>\n<p>He takes one, lights it, takes a long drag and says, "Man, oh man! Is that<br /> good!"</p>\n<p>Then she asks, "How long has it been since you''ve had a drink of whiskey?"</p>\n<p>He replies, "Ten years!"</p>\n<p>She reaches over, unzips her waterproof pocket on her right sleeve, pulls out<br /> a flask and gives it to him.</p>\n<p>He takes a long swig and says, "Wow, that''s fantastic!"</p>\n<p>Then she starts unzipping this long zipper that runs down the front of her<br /> wet suit and she says to him, "And how long has it been since you''ve had some<br /> real fun?"</p>\n<p>And the man replies, "My God! Don''t tell me that you''ve got golf clubs in<br /> there!"
Forget about Dog Bites Man. Relegate Man Bites Dog to the back pages. Today we are dealing with Fish swallows dog, an item which reaches us by way of Moscow. </p>\n<p>The dog was swimming across the Pechora River to join its master when it vanished, leaving only a ripple. The dog''s master, who was fishing at the time, hauled in his net and found it contained a giant pike. He looked closely at its mouth and said to himself (probably) "Thereby hangs a tail." </p>\n<p>Yes, it was Fido (or the Russian equivalent). The dog struggled out after the fish was cut open, and, according to Radio Moscow, hurled itself at the pike, "barking excitedly." </p>\n<p>It is often difficult for fishermen to tell stories about the one that got away. In this case, Radio Moscow notwithstanding, will it be any easier to tell about the one that didn''t?
I was playing golf with my doctor friend one day.<br /> He ALWAYS hit his drives right down the middle of the fairway.<br /> My problem was that I ALWAYS hooked my ball completely off the fairway. </p>\n<p>I asked him for help, and he offered to give me a physical to see if he could determine the problem. </p>\n<p>Sure enough, he said that I had three times the "normal length" of the average male, which caused an anomaly in my swing that caused me to hook. </p>\n<p>I asked him to help me, and he agreed to do surgery -- provided that I didn''t play golf for four weeks. I agreed. Golf is just that important to me. </p>\n<p>Four weeks later, new body and all, I teed off on the first hole and drove the ball 270 yards right down the middle. Feeling elated, I thanked the doctor. </p>\n<p>Then I asked him what had become of the "rest" of me. </p>\n<p>He just smiled, teed his ball, then hit it...<br /> and watched it duck hook two fairways away...

The Cameron children are the sort of kids who really light up a room, and then<br /> are content to leave it lit until all the electricity in the country has flowed<br /> through our circuits and out into the night. I''m developing carpal tunnel<br /> syndrome from the repetitive motion of turning off the lights after them, and<br /> can''t understand how they could possibly fail to notice a blazing light bulb,<br /> for crying out loud. When I walk into the house in the evenings, every single<br /> room is as brilliantly lit as a hospital operating theater. The little wheel<br /> that measures the electricity sluicing through my home spins inside its glass<br /> case like a CD player, and no one can walk within 100 feet of my yard without<br /> casting a shadow. It looks like the grand opening of a sporting goods store.<br /> My teenagers are the worst. Not only do they require every bulb to be lit, but<br /> they can often be found in front of the television, the phone to their ears, the<br /> stereo blaring in the background. "I''m doing homework," they''ll protest when I<br /> ask them to choose between one of the appliances. They use this as their<br /> universal alibi for everything. If I were to catch them in the middle of an<br /> armed robbery, I''m sure they would claim it was for a school assignment.<br /> I''ve tried to explain to my family that as responsible Americans, we all need<br /> to preserve precious natural resources like the W. Bruce Cameron bank account.<br /> "I have no desire to have the nation''s next nuclear reactor named after me," I<br /> advise them, but they don''t seem to get it. It makes me wonder whether the power<br /> company isn''t paying them off after school.<br /> Let''s be reasonable. The furniture hasn''t moved. There are no falling objects<br /> in the living room. We don''t need to turn on the lights unless there is<br /> something special we want to look at.<br /> "But we have to do our homework!" my children protest.<br /> "Remember Abe Lincoln?" I challenge them.<br /> "No," they respond, "We don''t remember Abe Lincoln because you won''t let us<br /> turn on the lights so we can study."<br /> "Very funny. Abe Lincoln never had electric lights. He studied in front of a<br /> fireplace, doing math by writing numbers on a shovel."<br /> "You mean his teachers let him turn in homework written on a SHOVEL?" My son<br /> laughs, delighted.<br /> "Also," I recall from some book I read once, "he held his brother up to the<br /> ceiling to make footprints or something."<br /> "What was that, gym class?"<br /> "The point is, we have to reduce our use of electricity."<br /> "Which is why your father is giving up watching sports on the television," my<br /> wife chimes in.<br /> I give her a stern look. "Let''s stay focused on what we''re interested in,<br /> which is what I''m saying," I admonish her. It is a primary tenet of good<br /> parenting that parents should be unified when it comes to matters of my policy.<br /> "Also, whenever the thermostat is set above hypothermia, we have to turn it<br /> down," she cautions. "And children, you will all need to learn Braille so you''ll<br /> be able to read in the dark. Showers will be limited to seven seconds--if you<br /> can''t wash your hair in that time, there''s always the hose." She smiles sweetly<br /> at me. "Oh, and I''m going to the store tomorrow--tell me how much homework you<br /> have so I''ll know how many garden tools to pick up."<br /> "Instead of listening to music on the stereo, we should all just sing!" my son<br /> suggests.<br /> "There''s no sense in using the telephone when you can shout," my<br /> daughter affirms.<br /> "Flushing toilets more than once a month is an extravagance!" they hoot.<br /> "Never open the refrigerator! Doing laundry is communist!"<br /> Well, there''s no point trying to reason with them--they''re laughing too hard<br /> to pay attention. "As soon as you''re finished I''ll begin passing out<br /> punishments," I state menacingly.<br /> "What are you going to do, make us sit in the dark?" my daughter shrieks,<br /> holding her sides.<br /> Half an hour later, when I stroll in to check on the thermostat and turn off a<br /> few of the lights, they''re still laughing.

In a crowded city at a crowded bus stop, a beautiful blonde was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt with matching tight leather boots and jacket. As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.<br /> Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again she tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover she still couldn''t! So, a little more embarrassed she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, much to her chagrin she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. So, with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step. </p>\n<p>About this time the big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him "How dare you touch my body!! I don''t even know who you are!" </p>\n<p>At this the Texan drawled "Well ma''am normally I would agree with you but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends."
1. Walk up to an employee and tell him in an official tone, "I think we''ve got a Code 3 (or Code Brown) in Swimwear," and see what happens, </p>\n<p>2. Turn all the radios to a polka station; then turn all of them off and crank the volume to "10". </p>\n<p>3. Walk up to complete strangers and say, "Hi!

One day the big animals and the little animals decided to have a football game. As the first half went along, the big animals were scoring at will. Every time they got the ball they would run it in for a touchdown.</p>\n<p>Then came the second half...</p>\n<p>First play: The elephant runs the ball up the middle. WAP!! Tackled for a five yard loss.</p>\n<p>The little animals go back to the huddle cheering and congratulating each other.</p>\n<p>"Who made that tackle?" asked the ant.</p>\n<p>"I did," said the centipede.</p>\n<p>Second play: The rhinoceros runs the ball up the middle. WHOMP!! Tackled for another five yard loss.</p>\n<p>Back in the huddle the flea asked, "Who made that great stop?" "I did," said the centipede.</p>\n<p>Third play: The gorilla tries an end sweep, led by the hippo throwing the lead blocks. SMACK!! Centipede tackles him for a ten yard loss.</p>\n<p>Back in the huddle, the gnat asked the centipede, "Where were you in the first half?"</p>\n<p>The centipede replied, "Puttin'' on my shoes!"
As a young man, Norton was an exceptional golfer. At the age of<br /> 26, however, he decided to become a priest, and joined a rather<br /> peculiar Order. He took the usual vows of poverty, chastity, but<br /> his Order also required that he quit golf and never play again.<br /> This was particularly difficult for Norton, but he agreed and<br /> was finally ordained a priest.</p>\n<p>One Sunday morning, the Reverend Father Norton woke up and<br /> realizing it was an exceptionally beautiful and sunny early<br /> spring day, decided he just had to play golf.</p>\n<p>So... he told the Associate Pastor that he was feeling sick and<br /> convinced him to say Mass for him that day. As soon as the<br /> Associate Pastor left the room, Father Norton headed out of town<br /> to a golf course about forty miles away. This way he knew he<br /> wouldn''t accidentally meet anyone he knew from his parish.</p>\n<p>Setting up on the first tee, he was alone. After all, it was<br /> Sunday morning and everyone else was in church! At about this<br /> time, Saint Peter leaned over to the Lord while looking down<br /> from the heavens and exclaimed, "You''re not going to let him get<br /> away with this, are you?"</p>\n<p>The Lord sighed, and said, "No, I guess not." Just then Father<br /> Norton hit the ball and it shot straight towards the pin,<br /> dropping just short of it, rolled up and fell into the hole. It<br /> WAS A 420 YARD HOLE IN ONE! St. Peter was astonished. He looked<br /> at the Lord and asked, "Why did you let him do that?" The Lord<br /> smiled and replied, "Who is he going to tell?"

A husband and wife are traveling by car from Atlanta to New York. After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they''re too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a rest. They stop at a nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four hours and then get back on the road.</p>\n<p>When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350. The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk although it''s a nice hotel, the rooms certainly aren''t worth $350. When the clerk tells him $350 is the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the manager.</p>\n<p>The manager listens to the man and then explains the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that were available for the husband and wife to use. He also explains they could have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous.</p>\n<p>"The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here," explains the manager.</p>\n<p>No matter what facility the manager mentions, the man replies, "But we didn''t use it!"</p>\n<p>The manager is unmoved and eventually the man gives up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the manager. The manager is surprised when he looks at the check.</p>\n<p>"But sir," he says, "this check is only made out for $100."</p>\n<p>"That''s right," says the man. "I charged you $250 for kissing my wife."</p>\n<p>"But I didn''t!" exclaims the manager.</p>\n<p>"Well," the man replies, "she was here, and you could have."
1. No matter what my problem is, it''s the fault of someone other than myself, and the appropriate response is to find that person and kill him with my bare hands. </p>\n<p>2. To be truly attractive, a woman must wear high heels and an outfit so tight you can tell whether she''s cold or not from across the room. </p>\n<p>3. There are two kinds of women in the world: One type want to go to bed with you, and the other type want to kill you. Both types are physically attractive and under 25 years old. </p>\n<p>4. If I rudely argue with my boss in front of my coworkers, not only won''t he fire me, but he will gain a profound respect for me. </p>\n<p>5. If I can find an important enough mission, it will supersede my obligations to perform household chores, bathe, and call the next day. </p>\n<p>6. If I go without bathing, swear a lot, and treat women badly, they will adore me. </p>\n<p>7. If a woman tries to clean a bullet wound and I curse in pain, she will fall in love with me. </p>\n<p>9. If I have a prolonged fist-fight with another guy and neither of us dies, we will become best friends. </p>\n<p>10. My archenemy will bear an uncanny resemblance in age and bearing to my father, and he will make it clear that he has gained a deep respect for me before I kill him with my bare hands. </p>\n<p>11. When I shoot people, they will die quickly and cleanly, and I will never be arrested or troubled by their widowed wife and children. When people shoot me, however, I will at most receive a ''flesh wound,'' which will be tended to by a beautiful woman (see #7, above). </p>\n<p>12. I will befriend at least one black guy, if white, or one white guy, if black. If I am Latino the monster/villain will kill me halfway through the film, urging the hero to even greater levels of violence.</p>\n<p>13. If an aged scientist is involved in any way, he will have a beautiful daughter who will gaze at me adoringly. </p>\n<p>14. If royalty is involved, it will include a beautiful princess who will gaze at me adoringly. </p>\n<p>15. If I have a kid partner, he will be tightly-muscled, clean-cut, and gaze at me adoringly. </p>\n<p>16. If I am asked to compete against a world champion at any sport or game of any type, I will win. This will infuriate my opponent, who will then try to kill me. </p>\n<p>17. If my opponent has a sidekick or henchman, he will never have a sensible name like ''Rick,'' or ''Steve.'' </p>\n<p>18. Beautiful women will frequently furrow their brows with concern and ask, "When''s the last time you got any sleep?" They will never ask when I last bathed or used the toilet, although I apparently never do those things either.
An old couple in Santo Domingo was puzzled when the coffin<br /> of their dead relative arrived from the USA. The corpse was<br /> so tightly squeezed inside the coffin that her face was<br /> practically touching the glass cover. When they opened the<br /> coffin, they found a letter pinned to her chest, which<br /> read:</p>\n<p>Dearest Papi &amp; Mami:</p>\n<p>I am sending you Tia Juana''s remains for the funeral in the<br /> Santo Domingo Cemetery.</p>\n<p>Sorry I couldn''t come along as the expenses were too high.<br /> You will find inside the coffin, under Tia''s body, 12 cans<br /> of Bumble Bee Tuna, 12 bottles of Paul Mitchell Shampoo and<br /> 12 bottles Paul Mitchell Conditioner, 12 Vaseline Intensive<br /> Care Skin Lotion, 12 Colgate Toothpaste and 12 cans of<br /> Spam. Just divide it among the family.</p>\n<p>On Tia''s feet is a brand-new pair of Reeboks (size 8) for<br /> Joseito. There are four pairs of Reeboks under her head for<br /> Antonio''s sons. Tia is wearing six Ralph Lauren T-shirts -<br /> one is for Roberto and the rest are for his sons.</p>\n<p>Tia is also wearing one dozen Wonder Bras (my favorite),<br /> just divide it among the ladies. The 2 dozen Victoria''s<br /> Secret panties that she is wearing should be distributed<br /> among my nieces and cousins. Tia is also wearing eight<br /> Docker pants, please keep one for yourself and the rest are<br /> for the boys.</p>\n<p>The Swiss watch you asked for is on Tia Juana''s left wrist<br /> and she is also wearing what you asked for Mami (earrings,<br /> ring and necklace) just please get them before anyone<br /> arrives to view the body. Also, the six pairs of Chanel<br /> stockings that she is wearing must be divided among the<br /> teen-age girls there. I hope the colors are to their<br /> liking.</p>\n<p>Your loving daughter,<br /> Josefinita</p>\n<p>P.S. Please find Tia a dress for her funeral.
Dear Technical Support:</p>\n<p>I''m currently running the latest version of GirlFriend and I''ve<br /> been having some problems lately. I''ve been running the same<br /> version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 forever as my primary<br /> application, and all the GirlFriend releases I''ve tried have<br /> always conflicted with it. I hear that DrinkingBuddies won''t<br /> crash if GirlFriend is run in background mode and the sound is<br /> turned off. But I''m embarrassed to say I can''t find the switch<br /> to turn the sound off. I just run them separately, and it works<br /> okay.</p>\n<p>Girlfriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf<br /> program, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing<br /> incompatibility.</p>\n<p>I probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought<br /> I might see better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months<br /> of conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has<br /> had experience with GirlFriend 2.0. He said I probably didn''t<br /> have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0, and eventually it would<br /> require a Token Ring to run properly. He was right - as soon as<br /> I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself.</p>\n<p>Shortly after that, I installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the<br /> bugs were supposed to be gone, but the first time I used it, it<br /> gave me a virus anyway. I had to clean out my whole system and<br /> shut down for a while. I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend<br /> 4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a<br /> virus protection program. It worked okay for a while until I<br /> discovered that GirlFriend 1.0 was still in my system. I tried<br /> running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still<br /> installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I didn''t know about<br /> that automatically senses the presence of any other version of<br /> GirlFriend and communicates with it in some way, which results<br /> in the immediate removal of both versions.</p>\n<p>The version I have now works pretty well, but there are still<br /> some problems. Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in<br /> some obscure language I can''t understand, much less reprogram.<br /> Frankly I think there is too much attention paid to the look and<br /> feel rather than the desired functionality. Also, to get the<br /> best connections with your hardware, you usually have to use<br /> gold-plated contacts. And I''ve never liked how GirlFriend is<br /> totally "object-oriented." A year ago, a friend of mine upgraded<br /> his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a<br /> Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. He discovered<br /> that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don''t<br /> upgrade to Fiancee 1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had<br /> to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a huge resource<br /> hog. It has taken up all his space, so he can''t load anything<br /> else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go with Wife 1.0<br /> was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out<br /> the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits<br /> access to FreeSexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted<br /> to try. On top of that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well<br /> warmed-up system before he can do anything. Although he did not<br /> ask for it, Wife 1.0 came with MotherInLaw which has an<br /> automatic pop-up feature he can''t turn off.</p>\n<p>I told him to try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he heard<br /> if you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife<br /> 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself.<br /> Then Mistress 1.0 won''t install anyway because of insufficient<br /> resources. Any Ideas???

Q.  What do you call that useless piece of skin around a pussy?<br />  A.  A woman.
There is a war going on and the Americans control one side of a<br /> river and the Japanese control the other side. There is an<br /> American soldier patrolling one side of the river and a Japanese<br /> on the other. Every day at the same time the American and the<br /> Japanese meet at the same spot, and the two are always trying to<br /> talk but they can''t understand what each other are saying. </p>\n<p>So one day the Japanese soldier makes a motion that resembled<br /> the sun rising over a mountain. So the American says, "Ya the<br /> sun rising over the mountain, but I don''t understand what you<br /> are talking about." So the two keep walking. The next day the<br /> Japanese makes a swimming motion to the American, so the<br /> American says, "Ya swimming but I still don''t understand what<br /> you are talking about." So they keep on walking. </p>\n<p>The next day they meet and the Japanese makes motions like a<br /> river, and the American says, "Ya the river but I still don''t<br /> know what you are talking about." So the two keep walking. The<br /> next day the Japanese puts two of his fingers in a circle made<br /> from his fingers. So the American says, "Ya dig a hole but I<br /> still have no clue what you are talking about." So they keep<br /> walking. </p>\n<p>The next day they meet and the Japanese makes a motion like his<br /> eyes are popping out. So the American goes, "Oh shit!" and takes<br /> off running to his General. Once he gets there he says to his<br /> General. "General, General, the Japanese on the other side of<br /> the river says that tomorrow when the sun rises over the<br /> mountain he is going to swim across the river, and fuck me up<br /> the ass till my eyes pop out."
BECAUSE I''M A GUY   Because I''m a guy, I must hold the television remote control in my hand while I watch TV. If the thing has been misplaced, I''ll miss a whole show looking for it, though one time I was able to survive by holding a calculator.<br /> Because I''m a guy, when I lock my keys in the car I will fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we call a road service until long after hypothermia has set in. Oh, and when the car isn''t running very well, I will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if I know what I''m looking at. If another guy shows up, one of us will say to the other, "I used to be able to fix these things, but now with all these computers and everything, I wouldn''t know where to start." We will then drink beer. </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, when I catch a cold I need someone to bring me soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan. You never get as sick as I do, so for you this isn''t an issue. </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, I can be relied upon to purchase basic groceries at the store, like milk or bread. I cannot be expected to find exotic items like "cumin" or "tofu." For all I know these are the same thing. And never, under any circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which "feminine hygiene product" is a euphemism. </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, when one of our appliances stops working I will insist on taking it apart -- despite evidence that this will just cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and has to put it back together. </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, I don''t think we''re all that lost, and no, I don''t think we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen to a complete stranger -- how the heck could HE know where we''re going? </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, there is no need to ask me what I''m thinking about. The answer is always either sex or football, though I have to make up something else when you ask, so don''t. </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, I do not want to visit your mother, or have your mother come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or think about her any more than I have to. Whatever you got her for Mother''s Day is okay, I don''t need to see it. Did you remember to pick up something for my mom, too?</p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, I am capable of announcing, "one more beer and I really have to go," and mean it every single time I say it, even when it gets to the point that the one bar closes and my buddies and I have to go hunt down another. I will find it increasingly hilarious to have my pals call you to tell you I''ll be home soon, and no, I don''t understand why you threw all my clothes into the front yard. What''s the connection? </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, you don''t have to ask me if I liked the movie. Chances are, if you''re crying at the end of it, I didn''t. </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, yes, I have to turn up the radio when Bruce Springsteen or The Doors comes on, and then, yes, I have to tell you every single time about how Bruce had his picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek the same day, or how Jim Morrison is buried in Paris and everyone visits his grave. Please do not behave as if you do not find this fascinating. </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy, I think what you''re wearing is fine. I thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too. Either pair of shoes is fine. With the belt or without it looks fine. Your hair is fine. You look fine. Can we just go now? </p>\n<p>Because I''m a guy and this is, after all, the ''90s, I will share equally in the housework. You do the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning and the dishes. I''ll do the rest.
Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event. It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler''s trainer came to him and said, "Now don''t forget all the research we''ve done on this Russian. He''s never lost a match because of this "pretzel" hold he has. Whatever you do, don''t let him get you in this hold! If he does, you''re finished!" </p>\n<p>The wrestler nodded in agreement. </p>\n<p>Now, to the match: The American and the Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn''t watch the ending. Suddenly there was a scream, a cheep from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian''s back hit the mat with a thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him, getting the pin and winning the match. The trainer was astounded! </p>\n<p>When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asks, "How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!" </p>\n<p>The wrestler answered, "Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could. "You''d be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls!"

"How was your golf game, dear?" asked Jack''s wife Tracy. </p>\n<p>"Well, I was hitting pretty well, but my eyesight''s gotten so bad I couldn''t<br /> see where the ball went." </p>\n<p>"But you''re seventy-five years old, Jack!" admonished his wife, "Why don''t you<br /> take my brother Scott along?" </p>\n<p>"But he''s eighty-five and doesn''t even play golf anymore," protested Jack. </p>\n<p>"But he''s got perfect eyesight. He could watch your ball," Tracy pointed out. </p>\n<p>The next day Jack teed off with Scott looking on. Jack swung, and the ball<br /> disappeared down the middle of the fairway. "Do you see it?" asked Jack. </p>\n<p>"Yup," Scott answered. </p>\n<p>"Well, where is it?" yelled Jack, peering off into the distance. </p>\n<p>"I forgot."
The basketball coach stormed into the university president''s office and demanded a raise right then and there.</p>\n<p>"Please," protested the college President, "you already make more than the entire History department."</p>\n<p>"Yeah, maybe so, but you don''t know what I have to put up with," the coach blustered. "Look."</p>\n<p>He went out into the hall and grabbed a jock who was jogging down the hallway. "Run over to my office and see if I''m there," he ordered.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later the jock returned, sweaty and out of breath.</p>\n<p>"You''re not there, sir," he reported.</p>\n<p>"Oh, I see what you mean," conceded the President, scratching his head. "I would have phoned."
While visiting England recently, George W. Bush was invited to have tea with the Queen.</p>\n<p>Given his recent political problems, he decides to take advantage of her years of leadership experience and asks her for her advice. She responds that she surrounds herself with the most intelligent people she can find and lets them do their jobs.</p>\n<p>Intrigued with this novel theory, Bush asks her how she is able to tell if the people are intelligent.</p>\n<p>"I do so by asking them a test question" responds the Queen. "Allow me to demonstrate."</p>\n<p>The Queen then dials 10 Downing Street and asks to speak to Tony Blair. "Mr. Prime Minister, please answer a hypothetical question for me."</p>\n<p>"I''ll do my best, Your Majesty" responds Blair.</p>\n<p>"Your mother has a child and your father has a child" says the Queen. "The child is not your brother or your sister. Who is the child?"</p>\n<p>Tony Blair hesitates momentarily and then confidently replies, "Well, Your Majesty, I guess it would have to be me."</p>\n<p>"Correct" says the Queen. "Thank you and good day to you Sir."</p>\n<p>The Queen hangs up and says "Did you hear that Mr. Bush? See how clever he is."</p>\n<p>Impressed, Bush replies "I certainly did. I''ll definitely be using that one when I conduct my next Cabinet shuffle back in the US."</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Washington, Bush decides he''d better put some of his senior Cabinet Members to the test. He summons Dick Cheney to his office and says, "Dick, I wonder if you could answer a question for me?"</p>\n<p>"Why of course Sir" Cheney responds unenthusiastically, annoyed that the President was again seeking his input on something.</p>\n<p>"Well, uh, let''s say your mother has a child and your father too has a child. This child is not your brother and also is not your sister. Who is it?"</p>\n<p>Somewhat surprised at this odd question, Cheney hems and haws and finally asks if he can have some time to think about it.</p>\n<p>"Certainly" responds Bush.</p>\n<p>Cheney immediately calls a meeting of other senior Republicans and they puzzle over the question for several hours. Totally baffled, they decide to conduct some research and contact a loyal Washington consulting firm. A budget of $10 million is provided and intensive research is carried out over the next two weeks. Unfortunately, the consultants are unable to come up with an answer.</p>\n<p>Desperate to prove that he is smarter than George, Cheney decides to take a chance and calls Al Gore.</p>\n<p>"I realize you are just an Tennessee redneck and are not all that wise in the ways of the world, but maybe you can help me out with a problem I have.</p>\n<p>Gore is naturally skeptical about Republican promises, but in the spirit of political co-operation he agrees to do what he can to help out.</p>\n<p>"O.K., here goes" says Cheney. "Your mother has a child and your father has a child. The child is not your brother or your sister. Who is the child?"</p>\n<p>Without hesitating, Gore responds "It would be me, of course."</p>\n<p>Impressed at the his quick response, Cheney quickly brushes off Gore and rushes to the President''s office (where he is watching football and eating snack foods under the careful observation of the Secret Service on the lookout for choking).</p>\n<p>" I know the answer to your question, you Idiot!! I know who the child is!!"</p>\n<p>Bush, who was privately becoming a bit concerned at the delay in hearing back from Cheney, is delighted (when he finally remembers what it was that he asked). "Who is it Dick?" he asks.</p>\n<p>With obvious pride, Cheney replies "It''s Al Gore, George - its Al Gore!!"</p>\n<p>Stunned, Bush shouts in disgust, "Wrong you idiot - it''s Tony Blair!!"

Julia! Where on earth have you been.

In Texas, coach Barry Switzer is upset on how the Cowboys played after the<br /> season. They were not a good football team. He did not know what the secret was<br /> to have a good team, so he goes to California where he finds coach Steve<br /> Mariucci.</p>\n<p>He asks Mariucci "What is the secret to having a good football<br /> team?" Steve calls quarterback Steve Young over.</p>\n<p>He asks Young "What is your father''s brother''s nephew?" Steve answers "That is<br /> me, of course." Mariucci says "Barry, that is the secret to having a good<br /> football team. You got to have a smart quarterback." Barry thanks Mariucci and<br /> goes back to Texas.</p>\n<p>Before football practice, Barry calls Troy Aikman over. He asks "What is your<br /> father''s brother''s nephew?"

"What does this golf ball do?" Frank asked the manager of the<br /> golf shop. "This golf ball magnetically attracts to all sorts of<br /> holes. It depends on what direction you hit the ball in. If it<br /> goes straight towards the hole, it will go into the hole" the<br /> manager replied. "I''ll buy it." Frank bought this rather strange<br /> golf ball and walked out to the golf course, where his friend<br /> Bill, was waiting for him.</p>\n<p>The first hole was a Par 3, so Frank had a good chance of<br /> getting a hole-in-one on this hole. After Bill had played his<br /> first shot, Frank stuck the tee into the ground and placed his<br /> magnetic golf ball on top of it. When he was set, Frank hit the<br /> ball straight towards the hole and got a hole-in-one. "You can''t<br /> ask for a better start than that Frank", said Bill. Frank smiled.</p>\n<p>For the next sixteen holes, Frank''s weird golf ball found holes<br /> to go into after every shot. However, most of these holes that<br /> the ball went into were either a bunker or the hole itself.<br /> There was one occasion though, when the ball went into one of<br /> the pockets in Bill''s pants, but this doesn''t compare with what<br /> happened on the eighteenth hole.</p>\n<p>Bill had already played his first shot on the eighteenth, and<br /> Frank was about to play his. The eighteenth hole had a large<br /> hill in which the ball had to be hit over. The hole and pin<br /> could not be seen from where Frank and Bill were.</p>\n<p>Since this hole is a Par 3, Frank could get another hole-in-one.<br /> When Frank was set he hit the ball, and to his disappointment he<br /> hooked it to the left. A few seconds later, a loud noise could<br /> be heard "Aaaaaaaargh!!!!" Frank and Bill had no idea where the<br /> noise came from, so they both walked over the hill to look for<br /> their balls.</p>\n<p>Bill found his ball straight away, but Frank was having great<br /> difficulty in finding his ball. Frank had spent about twenty<br /> minutes trying to find his ball, when he decided to give up and<br /> use another ball. "I''ll use another ball for my second shot<br /> Bill, but first I need to go to the toilet". Frank walked over<br /> to the public toilets, which was about twenty meters to the left<br /> of the eighteenth green.</p>\n<p>When Frank walked into the public toilets he heard a voice, "Is<br /> there anyone there?" "Yes there is," replied Frank, as he walked<br /> towards the cubicle at the far end. When he got to the cubicle<br /> door, which was open, Frank asked the man, "What do you want?"<br /> "I need a doctor," came the reply. "Why do you need a doctor?"<br /> Frank asked curiously. After Frank asked this question, the man<br /> in the cubicle did something strange. He stood up, turned around<br /> and flashed his naked backside at Frank, who suddenly became<br /> worried, "Holy shit!!!!"</p>\n<p>"What is it?" said the man in the cubicle. "You wouldn''t believe<br /> what''s stuck up there!!" Frank said. "What is?" "My fucking golf<br /> ball, that''s what!!!!"
A male and female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they<br /> noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had<br /> harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, "Let''s<br /> both swim under the ship and blowout of our air holes at the same time and it<br /> should cause the ship to turn over and sink". They tried it and sure enough the<br /> ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors<br /> had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore.</p>\n<p>The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female,<br /> "Let''s swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this<br /> point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.</p>\n<p>"Look", she said, "I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to<br /> swallow the seamen". </p>\n<p>NOTE: The average blue whale produces over 400 gallons of sperm when it<br /> ejaculates, but only 10% of that actually makes it into his mate. So.... 360<br /> gallons are spilled into the ocean every time one unloads, and you wonder why<br /> the ocean is so salty......

They play games there and do exercises, but they don''t do them very well.</p>\n<p>There is a swimming pool and they go to it and just stand in the water with their hats on. I guess they don''t know how to swim. My Grandma used to bake cookies and stuff, but I guess she forgot how. Nobody cooks there. They all go to fastfood restaurants.</p>\n<p>As you come into the park, there is a doll house with a man sitting in it. He watches all day so they can''t get out without him seeing them. They wear badges with their names on them. I guess they don''t know who they are.</p>\n<p>My Grandma said Grandpa worked hard all his life and earned his retardment. I wish they would move back home, but I guess the man in the doll house won''t let them out.

Last year, my friend upgraded his GirlFriend 3.1 to GirlFriend Plus 1.0 (marketing name: Fiance 1.0). Recently he upgraded Fiance 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and it''s a memory hogger: has taken up all his space.</p>\n<p>Wife 1.0 must be running  before he can do anything and seems to conflict/interfere with other tasks running such as hockey 2.1, squash 3.01 and boys out 1.2. Although he didn''t ask for them, Wife 1.0 came with auto-installed Plug-Ins such as Mother In Law and Brother In Law.</p>\n<p>Some features I''d like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend 4.0...<br /> - A "Don''t remind me again" button<br /> - Minimize button<br /> - Shutdown feature<br /> - An install shield feature so that Girlfriend 4.0 can be completely uninstalled if so desired (so you don''t lose cache and other objects)<br /> - "Abort" button (O.K. that one''s pretty bad - but had to say it)</p>\n<p>I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still installed, they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted. Then I tried to uninstall  Girlfriend 1.0 but it didn''t have an uninstall program. I tried to uninstall it by hand, but it put files in my system directory. Another thing  that sucks--in all versions of Girlfriend that I''ve used is that it is totally "object orientated" and only supports hardware with gold plated contacts.</p>\n<p> *****  BUG WARNING  ********</p>\n<p>Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to install, claiming insufficient resources. Wife 1.0 will then spawn off the virus Lawyer 6.66  which, when activated, consumes all available resources and brings your system to it''s knees. The funny thing is,  if you try to hide Mistress 1.1 in high memory, Wife 1.0 will eventually detect it and begin the process described above.
Two Texans were seated at the end of a bar when a gorgeous young<br /> lady sits down at the other end and orders a martini. Stunned by<br /> her beauty,the two guys stare at her for awhile, debating<br /> whether to approach her, when all of a sudden, she begins to<br /> cough, clutching her throat, and begin to turn blue. (obviously<br /> in serious respiratory distress)</p>\n<p>One said to the other, "That gal is having a bad time!" The<br /> other agreed and said, "Do you think we should go help?" "You<br /> bet!" said the first, and with that he ran over and said, "Can<br /> you speak?" She shook her head no. He then asked, "Can you<br /> breath?" She again shook her head no. With that, he pulled up<br /> her skirt, pulled down her panties and licked her on the butt.<br /> She was so shocked by the act, she coughed up the obstruction<br /> and began to breathe, with embarrassed relief. At which point,<br /> the first Texan looked at his friend and exclaimed, I guess that<br /> hind lick maneuver really does work!"

Three guys died; when they got to the pearly gates, St. Peter<br /> met them and said, "I know that you guys are forgiven because<br /> you''re here.

Peter asked.</p>\n<p>The guy said, "Yeah, 7 times, but you said I was forgiven."</p>\n<p>Peter said, "Yeah, but that''s not too good. Here''s a Pinto to<br /> drive."</p>\n<p>The second guy walks up and gets the same question from Peter<br /> and says, "I was married for 41 years and cheated on her once,<br /> but that was our first year, so we really worked it out."</p>\n<p>Peter said, "I''m pleased to hear that; here''s your Lincoln."</p>\n<p>The third guy walked up and said, "Peter, I know what you''re<br /> going to ask.

Police officers George and Mary, had been assigned to walk the beat.</p>\n<p>They had only been out a short while when Mary said, "Damn, I was running late this morning after my workout and after I showered, I forgot to put on my panties! We have to go back to the station to get them."</p>\n<p>George replied, "We don''t have to go back, just give the K-9 unit, Fido, one sniff, and he will go fetch them for you."</p>\n<p>It was a hot day and Mary didn''t fell like heading back to the station, so she lifted her skirt for the dog. Fido''s nose shoots between her legs, sniffing and snorting.</p>\n<p>After 10 seconds of sniffing, Fido''s ears pick up, he sniffs the wind, and he is off in a flash towards the station house.</p>\n<p>Five minutes go by and no sign of Fido.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes pass, and the dog is nowhere to be seen.</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes pass, and they are starting to worry.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes pass, and they hear sirens in the distance. The sirens get louder and louder. Suddenly, followed by a dozen police cars, Fido rounds the corner with the Desk Sergeant''s balls in his mouth.
Rule One</p>\n<p>If you pull into my driveway and honk you''d better be delivering a<br /> package, because you''re sure not picking anything up.</p>\n<p>Rule Two</p>\n<p>You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so<br /> long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep<br /> your eyes or hands off of my daughter''s body, I will remove them.</p>\n<p>Rule Three</p>\n<p>I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to<br /> wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their<br /> hips. Please don''t take this as an insult, but you and all of your<br /> friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded<br /> about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the<br /> door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and<br /> I will not object. However, In order to ensure that your clothes do<br /> not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter,<br /> I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in<br /> place to your waist.</p>\n<p>Rule Four</p>\n<p>I''m sure you''ve been told that in today''s world, sex without utilizing<br /> a "barrier method" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it<br /> comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.</p>\n<p>Rule Five</p>\n<p>In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports,<br /> politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only<br /> information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to<br /> have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from<br /> you on this subject is "early."</p>\n<p>Rule Six</p>\n<p>I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to<br /> date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my<br /> daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you<br /> will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If<br /> you make her cry, I will make you cry.</p>\n<p>Rule Seven</p>\n<p>As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear,<br /> and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to<br /> be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is<br /> putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the<br /> Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don''t you do<br /> something useful, like changing the oil in my car?</p>\n<p>Rule Eight</p>\n<p>The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter:<br /> Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden<br /> stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within<br /> eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is<br /> dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient<br /> temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank<br /> tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and<br /> a goose down parka zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong<br /> romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature<br /> chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.</p>\n<p>Rule Nine</p>\n<p>Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a pot-bellied, balding,<br /> middle-aged, dim-witted has-been. But on issues relating to my<br /> daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I<br /> ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell<br /> me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a<br /> shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with<br /> me.</p>\n<p>Rule Ten</p>\n<p>Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the<br /> sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice<br /> paddy outside of Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the<br /> voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for<br /> you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway<br /> you should exit your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the<br /> perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my<br /> daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no<br /> need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.
Rule One</p>\n<p>If you pull into my driveway and honk you''d better be delivering a<br /> package, because you''re sure not picking anything up.</p>\n<p>Rule Two</p>\n<p>You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so<br /> long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep<br /> your eyes or hands off of my daughter''s body, I will remove them.</p>\n<p>Rule Three</p>\n<p>I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to<br /> wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their<br /> hips. Please don''t take this as an insult, but you and all of your<br /> friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded<br /> about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the<br /> door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and<br /> I will not object. However, In order to ensure that your clothes do<br /> not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter,<br /> I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in<br /> place to your waist.</p>\n<p>Rule Four</p>\n<p>I''m sure you''ve been told that in today''s world, sex without utilizing<br /> a "barrier method" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it<br /> comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.</p>\n<p>Rule Five</p>\n<p>In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports,<br /> politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only<br /> information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to<br /> have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from<br /> you on this subject is "early."</p>\n<p>Rule Six</p>\n<p>I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to<br /> date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my<br /> daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you<br /> will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you.

A man walks into a chemist and says to the bloke behind the counter, ''Listen, I have three girls coming over tonight. I''ve never had three girls at once and I need something to keep me horny... keep me potent.''The chemist reaches under the counter, unlocks the bottom drawer and takes out a small cardboard box marked with the label Viagra Extra Strength and says, ''If you take this, you''ll go mental for 12 hours.''Very happy and excited, the man says, ''Gimme three boxes.''The next day the man walks into the same chemist''s shop, right up to the same chemist and pulls down his pants. The chemist looks in horror as he notices the man''s cock is swollen, black and blue, and the skin is hanging off in some places.The man says, ''Gimme a tube of Deep Heat.''The chemist replies, ''Deep Heat? You''re not going to put Deep Heat on that are you?''The man says, ''No, it''s for my arms. The girls didn''t show up.''
A rugby player was hurt very badly during a scrum and he had both of his ears<br /> ripped off. Since he was permanently disfigured, he decided to give up playing<br /> Rugby for good. His club and insurance company ensured that a large sum of money<br /> went his way.</p>\n<p>One day, he decided to invest his money in a small but growing sportswear<br /> business. He bought the company outright but after signing on the dotted line,<br /> realised that he knew nothing about business. He decided to employ someone to<br /> run the shop.</p>\n<p>The next day he set up three interviews. The first guy was great. He knew<br /> everything he needed to and was very enthusiastic. At the end of the interview,<br /> the former rugby player asked him, "Do you notice anything different about me?"</p>\n<p>And the man replied, "Why, yes, I couldn''t help noticing you have no ears."<br /> The rugby player got angry and threw him out.</p>\n<p>The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first<br /> guy. He asked her the same question, "Do you notice anythingdifferent about<br /> me?"</p>\n<p>She replied: "Well, you have no ears." He got upset again and showed her<br /> the door.</p>\n<p>The third and last interview was with the best of the three. He was a very<br /> young man fresh out of college. He was smart and handsome and seemed to know all<br /> about the sportswear business.</p>\n<p>The Rugby player was anxious, but went ahead and asked him the same question:<br /> "Do you notice anything different about me?"</p>\n<p>To his surprise the young man answered: "Yes, you wear contact lenses."</p>\n<p>The former rugby player was shocked, and said, "What an incredibly observant<br /> young man you are. </p>\n<p>How in the world did you know that?"</p>\n<p>The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, "Well,<br /> it''s pretty hard to wear glasses with no flipping ears."
What is the difference between a tick and a lawyer?<br /> A tick falls off of you when you die.</p>\n<p>Why does the law society prohibit sex between lawyers and their<br /> clients?<br /> To prevent clients from being billed twice for essentially the<br /> same service.</p>\n<p>What do you have when 100 lawyers are buried up to their neck in<br /> sand?<br /> Not enough sand.</p>\n<p>What''s the difference between a dead dog in the road and a dead<br /> lawyer in the road?<br /> There are skid marks in front of the dog.</p>\n<p>What is black and brown and looks good on a lawyer?<br /> A Doberman.</p>\n<p>Why are lawyers like nuclear weapons?<br /> If one side has one, the other side has to get one.<br /> Once launched, they cannot be recalled.<br /> When they land, they screw up everything forever.</p>\n<p>What do lawyers and sperm have in common?<br /> One in 3,000,000 has a chance of becoming a human being.</p>\n<p>Did you hear that the Post Office just recalled their latest<br /> stamps?<br /> They had pictures of lawyers on them ... and people couldn''t<br /> figure out which side to spit on.</p>\n<p>Lawyer''s creed: A man is innocent until proven broke.</p>\n<p>What''s the difference between a female lawyer and a pit bull?<br /> Lipstick.</p>\n<p>What do you call 20 lawyers skydiving from an airplane?<br /> Skeet.</p>\n<p>What do you get when you cross a bad politician with a crooked<br /> lawyer?<br /> Chelsea.</p>\n<p>If you see a lawyer on a bicycle, why should you never swerve to<br /> hit him?<br /> It might be your bicycle.</p>\n<p>Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, an honest lawyer and an old drunk<br /> are walking down the street together when they simultaneously<br /> spot a hundred dollar bill. Who gets it?<br /> The old drunk, of course; the other three are mythical creatures.</p>\n<p>It was so cold last winter ... (How cold was it?)<br /> .... I was so cold that I saw a lawyer with his hands in his own<br /> pockets.</p>\n<p>A man walked into a lawyer''s office and inquired about the<br /> lawyer''s rates.<br /> "$50 for three questions", replied the lawyer.<br /> "Isn''t that awfully steep" asked the man?<br /> "Yes," the lawyer replied, "and what was your third question?"</p>\n<p>For years, the young attorney had been taking vacations at a<br /> country inn. The last time he''d finally managed an affair with<br /> the innkeeper''s daughter. Looking forward to an exciting few<br /> days, he dragged his suitcase up the stairs of the inn, then<br /> stopped short. There sat his lover with an infant on her lap!<br /> "Helen, why didn''t you write when you learned you were<br /> pregnant?" he cried.<br /> "I would have rushed up here,we could have gotten married, and<br /> the baby would have my name!"<br /> "Well," she said, "when my folks found out about my condition,<br /> we sat up all night talking and talking, and decided it would be<br /> better to have a bastard in the family than a lawyer."</p>\n<p>You''re trapped in a room with a tiger, a rattlesnake and a<br /> lawyer. You have a gun with two bullets. What should you do?<br /> Shoot the lawyer. Twice.
I never have quite figured out why the sexual urges of men &amp; women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Mars &amp; Venus thing. And, I never have figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart. And, I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene gets thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words "I do".</p>\n<p>One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, "I don''t feel like it, I just want you to hold me."</p>\n<p>I said, "WHAT??" So she says the words that I and every husband on the planet dreads. She explains that I must not be in tune with her emotional needs as a Woman. I''m thinking, "What was her first clue?"</p>\n<p>I finally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to bed. The very next day we went shopping at a big unnamed department store... I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. She couldn''t decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them.</p>\n<p>She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say OK. And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond earrings. Let me tell you ...she was so excited. She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don''t think she cared. I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she doesn''t even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK.</p>\n<p>She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have seen her face when she said, "I''m ready to go, let''s go to the cash register."</p>\n<p>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, "No, honey. I don''t feel like buying all this stuff now." You should have seen her face ... it went completely blank. I then said, "Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while."</p>\n<p>And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, "You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a Man."</p>\n<p>I figure that I should be having sex again sometime during the Spring thaw.

We yanks just love to pass the blame. What other country can boast of 3 lawyers for every citizen. We come up with the best reasons to blame others for our own problems. Here''s a small list...</p>\n<p>If a woman burns her thighs on the hot coffee she''s holding in her lap while driving,<br /> she blames the restaurant.</p>\n<p>If your teen-age son kills himself or then next door neighbors,<br /> you blame the rock ''n'' roll music or musician he liked.</p>\n<p>If you smoke three packs a day for 40 years and die of lung cancer,<br /> your family blames the tobacco company.</p>\n<p>If your daughter gets pregnant by the football captain you blame the school for poor sex education.</p>\n<p>If your neighbor crashes into a tree while driving home drunk, you blame the bartender.</p>\n<p>If your cousin gets AIDS because the needle he used to shoot up with heroin was dirty,<br /> you blame the government for not providing clean ones.</p>\n<p>If your grandchildren are brats without manners, you blame television.<br /> If your friend is shot by a deranged madman, you blame the gun manufacturer.</p>\n<p>And if a crazed person breaks into the cockpit and tries to kill the pilots at 35,000 feet, and the passengers kill him instead, the mother of the deceased blames the airline.</p>\n<p>I guess I''ll just never understand the world as it is anymore...<br /> So if I die while my old, wrinkled ass is parked in front of this computer while sending you this joke - I want you to blame Bill Gates, OK?
Online computer users often engage in cyber sex. However, one of the two cyber-surfers in the following transcript doesn''t seem to quite get the point of cyber sex.<br /> Then again, maybe he does...</p>\n<p>Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like?</p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse, a miniskirt and high heels. I work out every day, I''m toned and perfect. My measurements are 36-24-36. What do you look like?</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m 6''3" and about 250 pounds. I wear glasses and I have on a pair of blue sweat pants I just bought from Walmart. I''m also wearing a T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from dinner...it smells funny.</p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me?<br /> Wellhung: OK</p>\n<p>Sweetheart: We''re in my bedroom. There''s soft music playing on the stereo and candles on my dresser and night table. I''m looking up into your eyes, smiling. My hand works its way down to your crotch and begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m gulping, I''m beginning to sweat.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: Now I''m unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m moaning softly.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk slides off my warm skin. I''m rubbing you bulge faster, pulling and rubbing.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and accidentally rips a hole in your blouse. I''m sorry.<br /> Sweetheart: That''s OK, it wasn''t really too expensive.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ll pay for it.<br /> Sweetheart: Don''t worry about it. I''m wearing a lacy black bra. My soft breasts are rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m fumbling with the clasp on your bra. I think it''s stuck. Do you have any scissors?<br /> Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly. I''m reaching back undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my breast. My nipples are erect for you.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: How did you do that? I''m picking up the bra and inspecting the clasp.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your tongue all over me.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m dropping the bra. Now I''m licking your, you know, breasts. They''re neat!<br /> Sweetheart: I''m running my fingers through your hair. Now I''m nibbling your ear.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breast are covered with spit and phlegm.<br /> Sweetheart: What?</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m so sorry; Really.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m wiping your phlegm off my breasts with the remains of my blouse.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with a plop.<br /> Sweetheart: OK. I''m pulling your sweat pants down and rubbing your hard tool.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee!<br /> Sweetheart: I''m pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over, in and out nibbling on you...umm... wait a minute.<br /> Sweetheart: What''s the matter?</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ve got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I''m choking.<br /> Sweetheart: Are you OK?</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m having a coughing fit. I''m turning all red.<br /> Sweetheart: Can I help?</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I''m fumbling through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups?<br /> Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m drinking a cup of water. There, that''s better.<br /> Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m washing the cup now.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m on the bed arching for you.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m drying the cup. Now I''m putting it back in the cabinet. And now I''m walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it''s dark, I''m lost. Where''s the bedroom?</p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall.<br /> Wellhung: I found it.</p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m tuggin'' off your pants. I''m moaning. I want you so badly.<br /> Wellhung: Me too.</p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately-our naked bodies pressing each other.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts.<br /> Sweetheart Why don''t you take off your glasses?</p>\n<p>Wellhung: OK, but I can''t see very well without them. I place the glasses on the night table.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby!</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I have to pee. I''m fumbling my way blindly across the room and toward the bathroom.<br /> Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I find the bathroom and it''s dark. I''m feeling around for the toilet. I lift the lid.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m waiting eagerly for your return.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m done going. I''m feeling around for the flush handle, but I can''t find it. Uh-oh!<br /> Sweetheart: What''s the matter now?</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ve realized that I''ve peed into your laundry hamper. Sorry again. I''m walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my way.<br /> Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: OK, now I''m going to put my...you know ...thing...in your...you know...woman''s thing.<br /> Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it!</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss your neck. Umm, I''m having a little trouble here.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can''t stand it another second! Slide in! Screw me now!</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m flaccid.<br /> Sweetheart: What?</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m limp. I can''t sustain an erection.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m standing up and turning around; an incredulous look on my face.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m shrugging with a sad look on my face, my wiener all floppy. I''m going to get my glasses and see what''s wrong.<br /> Sweetheart: No, never mind. I''m getting dressed. I''m putting on my underwear. Now I''m putting on my wet nasty blouse.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: No wait! Now I''m squinting, trying to find the night table. I''m feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray, picture frames and your candles.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m buttoning my blouse. Now I''m putting on my shoes.</p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ve found my glasses. I''m putting them on. My God! One of your candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I''m pointing at it, a shocked look on my face.<br /> Sweetheart: Go to hell. I''m logging off, you loser!</p>\n<p>Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!<br /> Sweetheart:{logged off}
You walk into a room and notice that a picture is hanging crooked. You...<br /> Straighten it. Ignore it. Buy a CAD system and spend the next six months designing a solar- powered, self-adjusting picture frame while often stating aloud your belief that the inventor of the nail was a total moron. </p>\n<p>The correct answer is "3" but partial credit can be given to anybody who writes "It depends" in the margin of the test or simply blames the whole stupid thing on "Marketing." </p>\n<p>SOCIAL SKILLS </p>\n<p>Engineers have different objectives when it comes to social interaction. "Normal" people expect to accomplish several unrealistic things from social interaction: Stimulating and thought-provoking conversation Important social contacts A feeling of connectedness with other humans In contrast to "normal" people, engineers have rational objectives for social interactions: Get it over with as soon as possible Avoid getting invited to something unpleasant Demonstrate mental superiority and mastery of all subjects. </p>\n<p>FASCINATION WITH GADGETS </p>\n<p>To the engineer, all matter in the universe can be placed into one of two categories: (1) things that need to be fixed, and (2) things that will need to be fixed after you''ve had a few minutes to play with them. Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems. Normal people don''t understand this concept; they believe that if it ain''t broke, don''t fix it. Engineers believe that if it ain''t broke, it doesn''t have enough features yet. No engineer looks at a television remote control without wondering what it would take to turn it into a stun gun. No engineer can take a shower without wondering if some sort of Teflon coating would make showering unnecessary. To the engineer, the world is a toy box full of sub-optimized and feature-poor toys. </p>\n<p>FASHION AND APPEARANCE </p>\n<p>Clothes are the lowest priority for an engineer, assuming the basic thresholds for temperature and decency have been satisfied. If no appendages are freezing or sticking together, and if no genitalia or mammary glands are swinging around in plain view, then the objective of clothing has been met. Anything else is a waste. </p>\n<p>DATING AND SOCIAL LIFE </p>\n<p>Dating is never easy for engineers. A normal person will employ various indirect and duplicitous methods to create a false impression of attractiveness. Engineers are incapable of placing appearance above function. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, engineers have an ace in the hole. They are widely recognized as superior marriage material: intelligent, dependable, employed, honest, and handy around the house. While it''s true that many normal people would prefer not to date an engineer, most normal people harbor an intense desire to mate with them, thus producing engineer like children who will have high-paying jobs long before losing their virginity. </p>\n<p>Male engineers reach their peak of sexual attractiveness later than normal men, becoming irresistible erotic dynamos in their mid thirties to late forties. Just look at these examples of sexually irresistible men in technical professions: </p>\n<p>Bill Gates MacGyver Etcetera </p>\n<p>Female engineers become irresistible at the age of consent and remain that way until about thirty minutes after their clinical death. Longer if it''s a warm day. </p>\n<p>HONESTY </p>\n<p>Engineers are always honest in matters of technology and human relationships. That''s why it''s a good idea to keep engineers away from customers, romantic interests, and other people who can''t handle the truth. </p>\n<p>Engineers sometimes bend the truth to avoid work. They say things that sound like lies but technically are not because nobody could be expected to believe them. The </p>\n<p>complete list of engineer lies is listed below. </p>\n<p>"I won''t change anything without asking you first." "I''ll return your hard-to-find cable tomorrow." "I have to have new equipment to do my job." "I''m not jealous of your new computer." </p>\n<p>FRUGALITY </p>\n<p>Engineers are notoriously frugal. This is not because of cheapness or mean spirit; it is simply because every spending situation is simply a problem in optimization, that is, "How can I escape this situation while retaining the greatest amount of cash?" </p>\n<p>POWERS OF CONCENTRATION </p>\n<p>If there is one trait that best defines an engineer it is the ability to concentrate on one subject to the complete exclusion of everything else in the environment. This sometimes causes engineers to be pronounced dead prematurely. Some funeral homes in high-tech areas have started checking resumes before processing the bodies. Anybody with a degree in electrical engineering or experience in computer programming is propped up in the lounge for a few days just to see if he or she snaps out of it. </p>\n<p>RISK </p>\n<p>Engineers hate risk. They try to eliminate it whenever they can. This is understandable, given that when an engineer makes one little mistake the media will treat it like it''s a big deal or something. </p>\n<p>EXAMPLES OF BAD PRESS FOR ENGINEERS Hindenberg Space Shuttle Challenger SPANet(tm) Hubble space telescope Apollo 13 Titanic Ford Pinto Corvair </p>\n<p>The risk/reward calculation for engineers looks something like this: </p>\n<p>RISK: Public humiliation and the death of thousands of innocent people. REWARD: A certificate of appreciation in a handsome plastic frame. </p>\n<p>Being practical people, engineers evaluate this balance of risks and rewards and decide that risk is not a good thing. The best way to avoid risk is by advising that any activity is technically impossible for reasons that are far too complicated to explain. </p>\n<p>If that approach is not sufficient to halt project, then the engineer will fall back to a second line of defense: "It''s technically possible but it will cost too much." </p>\n<p>EGO </p>\n<p>Ego-wise, two things are important to engineers: How smart they are. How many cool devices they own. The fastest way to get an engineer to solve a problem is to declare that the problem is unsolvable. No engineer can walk away from an unsolvable problem until it''s solved. No illness or distraction is sufficient to get the engineer off the case. These types of challenges quickly become personal --a battle between the engineer and the laws of nature. </p>\n<p>Engineers will go without food and hygiene for days to solve a problem. (Other times just because they forgot.) And when they succeed in solving the problem they will experience an ego rush that is better than sex -- and I''m including the kind of sex where other people are involved. </p>\n<p>Nothing is more threatening to the engineer than the suggestion that somebody has more technical skill. Normal people sometimes use that knowledge as a lever to extract more work from the engineer. When an engineer says that something can''t be done (a code phrase that means it''s not fun to do), some clever normal people have learned to glance at the engineer with a look of compassion and pity and say something along these lines: "I''ll ask Bob to figure it out. He knows how to solve difficult technical problems." </p>\n<p>At that point it is a good idea for the normal person to not stand between the engineer and the problem. The engineer will set upon the problem like a starved Chihuahua on a pork chop.
A man had to go to a strange town to be the guest speaker at a business meeting. </p>\n<p>When he arrived at the Motel in town, he found that he had a lot of time before the meeting. </p>\n<p>He asked the clerk where the nearest golf course was and was given directions on how to get there.</p>\n<p>While playing on the front nine, he was going over the speech in his mind and became confused as to where he was on the course. </p>\n<p>Looking around, he saw a Lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her and told her about his big meeting and the speech he was to make and his confusion about where he was on the course, asked her if she knew what hole he was playing.</p>\n<p>She replied "I''m on the 7th hole and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole."</p>\n<p>He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the back nine the same thing happened. and he approached her again with the same request.</p>\n<p>She said "I''m on the 14th, you are a hole behind me, So you must be on the 13th."</p>\n<p>Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. He finished his round and went into the club house where he saw the Lady sitting at the end of the bar. </p>\n<p>He asked the bartender if he knew the Lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. </p>\n<p>He approached her and said, "let me buy you a drink to show my appreciation for your help. I understand that you are a sales lady, well I am in sales also. What do you sell"?</p>\n<p>She replied, "if I told you, you would only laugh." "No I wouldn''t", he said and persisted that she tell him what she sold.</p>\n<p>"Well if you must know", she answered, "I sell Tampax."</p>\n<p>With that, he fell on the floor and laughed so hard he almost lost his breath. She said "see I knew you would laugh."</p>\n<p>"That''s not what I''m laughing at" he replied, "I''m a toilet paper salesman, so I''m still a hole behind you!"
THREE WOMEN -- ONE GERMAN, ONE JAPANESE AND A HILLBILLY WERE SITTING NAKED IN A SAUNA.  </p>\n<p>SUDDENLY THERE WAS A BEEPING SOUND. </p>\n<p>THE GERMAN PRESSED HER FOREARM AND THE BEEP STOPPED.</p>\n<p>THE OTHERS LOOKED AT HER QUESTIONINGLY. </p>\n<p>"THAT WAS MY PAGER," SHE SAID. "I HAVE A MICROCHIP UNDER THE SKIN OF MY ARM." </p>\n<p>A FEW MINUTES LATER, A PHONE RANG. </p>\n<p>THE JAPANESE WOMAN LIFTED HER PALM TO HER EAR. WHEN SHE FINISHED, SHE EXPLAINED, "THAT WAS MY MOBILE PHONE. I HAVE A MICROCHIP IN MY HAND." </p>\n<p>THE HILLBILLY WOMAN FELT DECIDEDLY LOW TECH. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, SHE DECIDED SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING JUST AS IMPRESSIVE. </p>\n<p>SHE STEPPED OUT OF THE SAUNA AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM. SHE RETURNED WITH A PIECE OF TOILET PAPER HANGING FROM HER BEHIND. </p>\n<p>THE OTHERS RAISED THEIR EYEBROWS AND STARED AT HER. </p>\n<p>THE HILLBILLY WOMAN FINALLY SAID, "WELL, WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT, I''M GETTIN'' A FAX! </p>\n<p>Submitted by NCrespi<br /> Edited by Curtis and Yisman
"You''re going out to play golf again?" his wife complained."I''m only doing under doctors orders.""Do I look stupid to you?!" "But its true," he said, while walking out the door."He told me specifically that I should get some iron everyday."
A boy in the sixth grade comes home after school one day. His mother notices that he''s got a big smile on his face. She asks, "Did anything special happen at school today?""Yes, Mom. I had sex with my English teacher!" The mother is stunned."You''re going to talk about this with your father when he gets home."Well, when dad comes home and hears the news he is pleased as punch. Beaming with pride, he walks over to his son and says, "Son, I hear you had sex with your English teacher.""That''s right, Dad.""Well, you became a man today - this is cause for celebration. Let''s head out for some ice cream, and then I''ll buy that new bike you''ve been asking for.""That sounds great, Dad, but I can I have a football instead? My ass is killing me."
Do blind eskimoes heave seeing-eye sled dogs? Do they have reserved parking for non-handicap people at the Special Olympics? Why do they call it a TV set when you only get one? How come wrong numbers are never busy? Do radioactve cats have 18 half-lives?

A textbook nerd is at the beach one day, baring his chest and showing off his pale, shrunken chest, and of course all the girls are laughing at him and drooling over the weight-lifting hunks. So in desperation the kid goes to the lifeguard and asks, "How can I do something to get these girls interested in me? What can I do to show off?"</p>\n<p>The lifeguard takes pity on this poor guy, with his puny muscles and baggy trunks and lanky hair, and finally he says, "Tell you what - why don�酶惟t you take a potato and stick it down your swim trunks. That way the girls will think you�酶惟ve got something really big and hard down there, and they�酶惟ll want you."</p>\n<p>So the nerd decides to give it a try. He struts around the beach with a potato in his shorts, and all the girls give him weird, disgusting looks and tell him to get the hell out of there. The nerd can�酶惟t understand what�酶惟s going on, so he goes back to the lifeguard and asks, "What am I doing wrong? You said they�酶惟d like me if I put a potato in my shorts!"</p>\n<p>Without even batting an eye, the lifeguard says, "You gotta put the potato in the FRONT, kid!"
It had promised to be a sensational divorce case, with the wife accused of incredible escapades. Testifying before her own attorney, she projected an image of sweet innocence, told a tale of wifely fidelity and sacrifice, and was quite believable. </p>\n<p>When it was time for cross-examination though, the husband''s lawyer arose and said, "Isn''t it true that on the night of June 12, in a driving rainstorm, you had sexual intercourse with a certain circus midget on the handle bars of a careening motorcycle as it raced across a private golf course reaching speeds in excess of seventy-five miles per hour?" </p>\n<p>She turned pale but retained her remarkable self-control and composure. </p>\n<p>Her voice was almost serene in its innocence as she asked, "What was that date again ?"
Researchers released a list of foods and activities to help  combat osteoporosis, the dread disorder that leaches calcium  from the bones as people age.The distinguished lead scientist mounts the podium to make  his announcement and gives the highlights of the list. To no  one''s surprise, broccoli and cauliflower are there, and the  researchers also encourage regular exercise, such as walking,  running, cycling or swimming to prevent calcium loss from the  bones.But, one reporter, reading ahead, shouts from the front row, "You''ve got kissing on the list as a way to prevent  osteoporosis! There isn''t any calcium in a kiss!"The scientist replied calmly, "In a good kiss, there''s enough calcium to make a bone about 6 inches long."

Sent by  a  friend:  I''m  currently  running  the  latest  version  of<br /> GirlFriend and I''ve been having some problems lately.I''ve been running the  same<br />  version  of   DrinkingBuddies1.0   forever  as  my  primary application, and<br /> all the  GirlFriend  releases  I''ve tried have always conflicted with  it.  I<br /> hear  that  DrinkingBuddies  won''t  crash  if GirlFriend is run in  background<br /> mode  and  its  sound is turned off. However, for the life of  me  I  can''tfind<br /> the  switch that turns the sound off. So, I just run them separately, and they<br /> work just fine.<br /> GirlFriend also seems  to  have  a  problem  co-existing  with my Golf<br /> program,  often  trying  to  abort  Golf  with  some  sort  of  timing<br /> incompatibility. I probably should  have  stayed  with GirlFriend 1.0, but I<br /> thought I  might  see  better  performance  from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of<br /> conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with<br /> GirlFriend 2.0. He said I probably didn''t have enough cache to run GirlFriend<br /> 2.0,  and eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly.  He  was<br /> right.  As  soon  as I purged my cache,  it  uninstalled  itself.  Shortly<br /> after  that,  I  installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta.All the bugs  were  supposed  to<br /> be gone, but the first time I used it, it gave me a virus anyway.<br /> I had to clean out my  whole  system  and  shut down for while. I very<br /> cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend 4.0. This  time  I used a SCSI probe first and<br /> also installed a  virus  protection  program. It worked okay for a while until I<br />  discovered  that  GirlFriend  1.0 was still in my system. I tried running<br /> GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has<br /> a  feature  I didn''t know about that automatically senses the presence of  any<br /> other version of GirlFriend and communicates with it in some  way,  which<br /> results in the immediate removal of both versions.<br /> The version I have now  works  pretty  well,  but there are still some<br /> problems. Like all  versions  of  GirlFriend,  it  is  written in some obscure<br /> language I can''t  understand,  much  less reprogram. Frankly I think there is<br /> too much  attention  paid  to  the look and feel rather than the  desired<br /> functionality.  Also,  I''ve  never  liked  how  the GirlFriend Series is totally<br /> object-oriented. A  year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of<br /> GirlFriend  to GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident<br /> version of GirlFriend. He discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a<br /> year if you don''t upgrade to Fiancee 1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had<br /> to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a  huge  resource  hog. It has<br /> taken up all his space, so he can''t load anything  else. One of the primary<br /> reasons he decided to go  with  Wife  1.0  was  because  it  came bundled with<br /> FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 often<br /> prohibits access to FreeSexPlus,  even with new Plug-Ins. On top of that, Wife<br /> 1.0 came  with  MotherInLaw 1.0, although he did not<br /> ask for it. This has an automatic pop-up feature he can''t control, and it''s<br /> impossible to modulate its  sound.  I  suggested that he consider installing<br /> Mistress 1.0, but he said  he  heard  if  you try to run it without first<br /> uninstalling any of  the  Wife  series, Wife will delete all MSMoney files and<br /> crash  the  system  before uninstalling itself. With a purged cache, Mistress<br /> 1.0  will  never  install. The moral of this story is:  Know  your  system''s<br /> hardware  requirements, software peculiarities and limited range of<br /> compatibilities  and do be careful with those alluring upgrades.
Astrology tells us about you and your future simply by your birthday. The Chinese Zodiac uses the year of your birth. Demographics tell us what you like, dislike, whom you vote for, what you buy and what you watch on television.<br /> Well, the Corporate Zodiac goes a step further: simply by your job title, people will have you all figured out... </p>\n<p>MARKETING: You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and socializing - which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least compatible with Sales. </p>\n<p>SALES: Laziest of all signs, often referred to as "marketing without a degree", you are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with "customers" so you can "concentrate on the big picture". You seek admiration for your golf game throughout your life. </p>\n<p>TECHNOLOGY: Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace. Often even YOU don''t understand what you are saying, but who the hell can tell?! It is written that the Geeks shall inherit the Earth. </p>\n<p>ENGINEERING: One of only two signs that actually studied in school, it is said that ninety percent of all Personal Ads are placed by engineers. You can be happy with yourself: your office is typically full of all the latest "ergodynamic" gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your "carpal tunnel"... </p>\n<p>ACCOUNTING: The only other sign that studied in school, you are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the organization; combined with your extreme organizational traits, the majority of rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane. </p>\n<p>HUMAN RESOURCES: Ironically, given your access to confidential information, you tend to be the biggest gossip within the organization. Possibly the only other person that does less work than marketing, you are unable to return any calls today because you have to get a haircut, have lunch, AND mail a letter! </p>\n<p>MIDDLE MANAGEMENT/ DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT/ "TEAM LEADS": Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other "Middle Managers", as everyone in your social circle is a "Middle Manager". </p>\n<p>SENIOR MANAGEMENT: Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other "Senior Managers", as everyone in your social circle is a "Senior Manager". </p>\n<p>CUSTOMER SERVICE: Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride from taking your own life. As a child very few of you asked your parents for a little cubicle for your room and a headset so you could pretend to play "Customer Service". Continually passed over for promotions, your best bet is to sleep with your manager. </p>\n<p>CONSULTANT: 666.
A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier.</p>\n<p>He said to the female whale, "Let''s both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink." They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.</p>\n<p>Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female "lets swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."</p>\n<p>At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. "Look," she said, "I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen!"
What happened to the blonde ice hockey team? They drowned in Spring training.
If space is a vacuum, who changes the bags?If swimming is good for your shape, then why do the whales look the way they do?If tin whistles are made out of tin, what do they make fog horns out of?If white wine goes with fish, do white grapes go with sushi?If you jog backwards, will you gain weight?

Online computer users often engage in cyber sex. However, one of the two cyber-surfers in the following transcript doesn''t seem to quite get the point of cyber sex.<br /> Then again, maybe he does... </p>\n<p>Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like? </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse, a miniskirt and high heels. I work out every day, I''m toned and perfect. My measurements are 36-24-36. What do you look like? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m 6''3" and about 250 pounds. I wear glasses and I have on a pair of blue sweat pants I just bought from Walmart. I''m also wearing a T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from dinner...it smells funny. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me?<br /> Wellhung: OK </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: We''re in my bedroom. There''s soft music playing on the stereo and candles on my dresser and night table. I''m looking up into your eyes, smiling. My hand works its way down to your crotch and begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m gulping, I''m beginning to sweat.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: Now I''m unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m moaning softly. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk slides off my warm skin. I''m rubbing you bulge faster, pulling and rubbing. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and accidentally rips a hole in your blouse. I''m sorry.<br /> Sweetheart: That''s OK, it wasn''t really too expensive. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ll pay for it.<br /> Sweetheart: Don''t worry about it. I''m wearing a lacy black bra. My soft breasts are rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m fumbling with the clasp on your bra. I think it''s stuck. Do you have any scissors?<br /> Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly. I''m reaching back undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my breast. My nipples are erect for you. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: How did you do that? I''m picking up the bra and inspecting the clasp.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your tongue all over me. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m dropping the bra. Now I''m licking your, you know, breasts. They''re neat!<br /> Sweetheart: I''m running my fingers through your hair. Now I''m nibbling your ear. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breast are covered with spit and phlegm.<br /> Sweetheart: What? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m so sorry; Really.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m wiping your phlegm off my breasts with the remains of my blouse. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with a plop.<br /> Sweetheart: OK. I''m pulling your sweat pants down and rubbing your hard tool. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee!<br /> Sweetheart: I''m pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over, in and out nibbling on you...umm... wait a minute.<br /> Sweetheart: What''s the matter? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ve got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I''m choking.<br /> Sweetheart: Are you OK? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m having a coughing fit. I''m turning all red.<br /> Sweetheart: Can I help? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I''m fumbling through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups?<br /> Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m drinking a cup of water. There, that''s better.<br /> Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m washing the cup now.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m on the bed arching for you. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m drying the cup. Now I''m putting it back in the cabinet. And now I''m walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it''s dark, I''m lost. Where''s the bedroom? </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall.<br /> Wellhung: I found it. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: I''m tuggin'' off your pants. I''m moaning. I want you so badly.<br /> Wellhung: Me too. </p>\n<p>Sweetheart: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately-our naked bodies pressing each other. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts.<br /> Sweetheart Why don''t you take off your glasses? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: OK, but I can''t see very well without them. I place the glasses on the night table.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby! </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I have to pee. I''m fumbling my way blindly across the room and toward the bathroom.<br /> Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I find the bathroom and it''s dark. I''m feeling around for the toilet. I lift the lid.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m waiting eagerly for your return. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m done going. I''m feeling around for the flush handle, but I can''t find it. Uh-oh!<br /> Sweetheart: What''s the matter now? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ve realized that I''ve peed into your laundry hamper. Sorry again. I''m walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my way.<br /> Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: OK, now I''m going to put my...you know ...thing...in your...you know...woman''s thing.<br /> Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it! </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss your neck. Umm, I''m having a little trouble here.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can''t stand it another second! Slide in! Screw me now! </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m flaccid.<br /> Sweetheart: What? </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m limp. I can''t sustain an erection.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m standing up and turning around; an incredulous look on my face. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''m shrugging with a sad look on my face, my wiener all floppy. I''m going to get my glasses and see what''s wrong.<br /> Sweetheart: No, never mind. I''m getting dressed. I''m putting on my underwear. Now I''m putting on my wet nasty blouse. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: No wait! Now I''m squinting, trying to find the night table. I''m feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray, picture frames and your candles.<br /> Sweetheart: I''m buttoning my blouse. Now I''m putting on my shoes. </p>\n<p>Wellhung: I''ve found my glasses. I''m putting them on. My God! One of your candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I''m pointing at it, a shocked look on my face.<br /> Sweetheart: Go to hell. I''m logging off, you loser! </p>\n<p>Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!<br /> Sweetheart:{logged off}
THE FEMALE STRESS DIET<br /> This is a specially formulated diet designed to help you cope with the stress that builds up during the day:</p>\n<p>Breakfast - I grapefruit, I slice whole-wheat toast, I cup of skim milk.</p>\n<p>Lunch - Small portion of lean, steamed chicken with a cup of spinach, 1 cup of herbal tea, I Tim Tam.</p>\n<p>Afternoon Tea - The rest of the packet of Tim Tams, I tub of Tip Top ice cream with chocolate topping, I jar of Nutella.</p>\n<p>Dinner - 4 bottles of red wine, 2 loaves of garlic bread, I family size supreme pizza, 3 Snickers bars.</p>\n<p>Late Night Snack - Whole frozen Sarah Lee cheesecake eaten directly from the freezer.</p>\n<p>Diet Rules<br /> 1. If no one sees you eat something, it has no calories.</p>\n<p>2. When drinking a diet Coke with a chocolate bar, the fat in the  chocolate is cancelled out by the diet Coke.</p>\n<p>3. When you eat with someone else, calories don''t count if you  do not eat more than they do.</p>\n<p>4. Food used for medicinal purposes does NOT count. (For  example: hot chocolate, toast, cheesecake, vodka...)</p>\n<p>5. If you fatten up the people around you, you will look thinner.</p>\n<p>6. Cinema-related foods have a zero calorie count as they are part of the entertainment package and not counted as food intake. This includes popcorn, Minties, Maltesers, Jaffas and frozen Cokes.</p>\n<p>7. Biscuit pieces have no calories because breaking the biscuits up causes calorie leakage.</p>\n<p>8. Food licked from knives and spoons has no fat if you are in the process of cooking something.</p>\n<p>9. Foods that are the same color have the same amount of fat. Examples are: spinach and peppermint ice cream, apples and red jelly snakes.</p>\n<p>10. Chocolate is like a food-color wildcard and may be  substituted for any other color.</p>\n<p>11. Anything eaten while standing has no calories due to gravity and the density of the calorie mass.</p>\n<p>12. Food consumed from someone else''s plate has no fat as it rightfully belongs to the other person and will cling to his/her plate. (Oh, how fat likes to cling!)</p>\n<p>And remember: ''STRESSED'' SPELT BACKWARDS IS ''DESSERTS''!
One Day Albert wanted to go golfing. Albert got out of bed early<br /> trying not to wake his wife. He got dressed and sneaked out of<br /> the house. He got to the golf course and wanted a cup of coffee<br /> before hitting the course. So he went into the club house for a<br /> cup of coffee.</p>\n<p>Once finished he started out the door and he noticed it was too<br /> foggy to golf. So he got back into his truck, real upset, but<br /> headed back home.</p>\n<p>Albert was real slow on sneaking back in, took off his clothes<br /> and went back in bed snuggling back to his wife carefully and<br /> saying it''s terrible weather out there. The wife said, "Ya, and<br /> to think my stupid husband went golfing in it!"
The room was full of pregnant women and their partners, and the Lamaze class was in full swing. The instructor was teaching the women how to breathe properly, along with informing the men how to give the necessary assurances at this stage of the plan. The teacher then announced, ''Ladies, exercise is good for you. Walking is especially beneficial. And, gentlemen, it wouldn''t hurt you to take the time to go walking with your partner!'' The room really got quiet. Finally, a man in the middle of the group raised his hand. ''Yes?'' replied the teacher. ''Is it alright if she carries a golf bag while we walk?''
It was a hot and humid July afternoon, when I decided to visit my girl friend, Susie. Susie may be blonde and beautiful, but sometimes she is, shall we say, lacking in other areas. </p>\n<p>Well Susie had decided her kitchen needed repainting, and instead of hiring a professional, decided to do it herself. I thought she might appreciate a break and brought over some cold beer and some sandwitches. </p>\n<p>When I arrived, I found Susie working hard painting the kitchen walls. But instead of wearing old clothes, she was wearing her fur coat and her ski parka. </p>\n<p>I asked her why she was dressed that way on such a hot day. She brought me the paint bucket and told me to read the instructions. I did. </p>\n<p>It said, . . . "For best results, put on two coats."

A woman is just about to give birth in the hospital when she says to the doctor, ''Doc, do me a favor. Tell me what color the baby is as it''s being born.''The doctor is understandably a little puzzled at this. ''Why don''t you know what color the child is going to be?''''Well,'' says the woman, ''the problem is that I''m a porno actress and the child was conceived during the making of a film. I have no idea who the father is.''''OK'', says the doctor, ''I''ll do it for you, but it''s most unusual.''The baby begins to be born and the doctor says, ''Here comes the head, it seems to have yellow skin and the eyes are slanted. Was one of the actors Chinese?''''Yes, doctor, he was,'' says the woman.''Wait,'' says the doctor, ''the chest and arms are out and they seem to be very dark. Was one of the actors black?''''Yes doctor, he was.''''Wait, now the legs are out and they''re light brown. Was one of the actors of mixed race?''''Yes doctor, he was.''So the doctor pulls the baby free and gives it the traditional slap on the back. The baby lets out a healthy ''waaaaahh'' and starts crying.''Oh, thank God for that!'' says the woman, ''for a moment there I thought it might bark.
A lady goes to the doctor to see about getting a facelift.</p>\n<p>"Well," says the doctor, "I can do the facelift, and then you''ll have to come back in six months for a follow-up."</p>\n<p>"Oh, no." the woman replies. "I want it all done in one shot. I don''t want to have to come back."</p>\n<p>The doctor thinks for a second, then offers, "There is a new procedure where we put a screw in the top of your head. Then anytime you see wrinkles appearing, you just give it a little turn, which pulls the skin up and they disappear."</p>\n<p>"That''s what I want!" exclaims the lady. "Let''s do that."<br /> Six months later the lady charges into the doctor''s office.</p>\n<p>"Well, how''s the procedure holding up?" the doctor asks.<br /> "Terrible!" the lady bellows. "It''s the worst mistake I''ve ever made."</p>\n<p>"What''s wrong?" asks the doctor.<br /> "Just look at these bags under my eyes!" she hollers.</p>\n<p>"Lady," the doctor reports, "those aren''t bags, those are your boobs, and if you don''t leave that screw alone, you''re going to have a beard!"

A Canadian snowboarder got his gold medal back despite testing positive for marijuana. Olympic officials should have know better. Snowboarding was invented because a stoned snowboarder couldn''t remember where he put his other ski.

A friend and I were golfing one day when at the 18th hole this guy comes out of nowhere and asks if he could join us. I tell him, "Well, we''re just about done but if you want to join us tomorrow you can. We start at 8 o''clock."He said, "Great! I''ll be here at 8 o''clock, maybe 8:35..."So next day he shows up at 8 o''clock and plays scratch golf; he was good. We were going to play again the next day and we invited him to join us. He said, "Great! I''ll be here at 8 o''clock, maybe 8:35..."So the next day he shows up at 8 o''clock, plays with his opposite hand, and shoots under par! I''m a bit amazed with this guy so I ask him, "You''re a pretty good golfer, beating us with scratch golf and then showing-off by playing just as good with your opposite hand. Just what is you secret?"He said, "Well...when I wake up in the morning and my wife is lying on her left side, I play left-handed. Or when I wake up in the morning and my wife is laying on her right side, I play right-handed."So I ask, "what if she is laying on her back?""That''s when I get here at 8:35."
A guy is golfing with his pretty wife, who is a very poor golfer. On the first hole she sends the ball smashing through the window of a nearby house.</p>\n<p>The couple goes to the house to investigate the damage and finds the door open. They go inside and found a man sitting on a couch next to the broken window. There is also a broken oil-lamp.</p>\n<p>The husband asks: "Did we break that too?"<br /> "Yes", replies the man.</p>\n<p>"Sorry. Do you live here?" the husband asks.</p>\n<p>"No, actually, I''m a genie." The man states. "I was sleeping in that lamp when your golf ball smashed it. Now, I''m supposed to give you three wishes, but I''m keeping one for myself since you smashed my lamp. OK, what''ll they be?"</p>\n<p>The husband thinks a moment: "First, make my wife a better golfer."<br /> "Poof! She''s a better golfer", the genie announces.</p>\n<p>"Second, I want a million bucks a week for life."<br /> "Poof! you get a million bucks a week", the genie announces.</p>\n<p>"Good. OK, what do you want?" asks the husband.<br /> "For my wish. I want to have my way with your pretty wife," grins the genie.</p>\n<p>"Hmmm", the husband hesitated, "I guess that''s all right. After all, she broke your lamp, you''ve made us rich, and our golf games will be much more interesting. Go ahead."</p>\n<p>So the genie and the wife retire the bedroom. After several steamy hours the "genie" says to the wife: "How long have you known your husband?"<br /> "Ten years," she replies.<br /> "How long has he believed in this genie stuff?"
