[Two nude statues (one male and one female) had been standing in a beautiful park for 99 years. </p>\n<p>On their 100th anniversary in the park an angel came down from heaven to talk to the statues.</p>\n<p>He said to them, ''God has been watching you for the past 100 years and has been very pleased with the two of you. So pleased in fact that he has decided to make you human for a short time.''</p>\n<p>The angel then went on to say that they would be human for 15 minutes and would finally be able to pleasure themselves in a manner in which they have only fantasized about for the last 100 years.</p>\n<p>The statues were so excited they could hardly believe it. The second they became human they ran off together behind the bushes. The angel heard the rustling of the bushes and shouts of joy and laughter.</p>\n<p>After 10 minutes the statues returned from behind the bushes sweating and laughing. The angel told the statues that they still had five more minutes.</p>\n<p>The male statue quickly turned to the female statue and said:<br /> `Cool, this time, you hold down the pigeon and I''ll shit on its head.'']

[Fresh off of the news wire.....</p>\n<p>AP - Monica Lewinsky, in a statement released today, countered President Clinton''s firm denial:</p>\n<p>I have had enough.  This whole experience has left a bitter   taste in my mouth, and I can''t stomach any more. I feel as if I''m getting the shaft, that this ugly matter has come to a head and blown up in my face.</p>\n<p>This may be a load to handle, but when things are hard, that''s when I am at my best. I have faced hard things in the past and I know what is coming. I will meet this challenge the only way I know how:  head on.</p>\n<p>I have licked bigger things than this before and I will again. No one will ever be able to say that Monica Lewinsky isn''t a finisher, that she quit before the job was done. I   will work non-stop and fight this, blow by blow, until I am wiped clean of this dirty affair. I will not be stained by it.</p>\n<p>Thank you<br /> Monica Lewinsky]

When the postal authorities received the letter addressed to God, USA, they decided to send it to President Bush.

President Bush thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy.The little boy was delighted with the $5.00 and sat down to write a thank you note to God, which read:Dear God,Thank you very much for sending the money, however, I noticed that for some reason you had to send it through Washington D.C. and, as usual, those crooks deducted $95.00.]

[The Washington Post  february 4, 1988 I BelieveThis is more commentary than humor, but what the heck...------------------------------------I believe the president. I have always believed him. I believed him when he said he had never been drafted in the Vietnam War and I believed him when he said he had forgotten to mention that he had been drafted in the Vietnam War. I believed him when he said he hadn''t had sex with Gennifer Flowers and I believe him now, when he reportedly says he did.I believe the president did not rent out the Lincoln Bedroom, did not sell access to himself and the vice president to hundreds of well-heeled special pleaders and did not supervise the largest, most systematic money-laundering operation in campaign finance history, collecting more than $ 3 million in illegal and improper donations. I believe that Charlie Trie and James Riady were motivated by nothing but patriotism for their adopted country.I believed Vice President Gore when he said that he had made dunning calls to political contributors ''on a few occasions'' from his White House office, and I believed when he said that, actually, ''a few'' meant 46. I believe in no controlling legal authority.I believe Bruce Babbitt when he says that the $ 286,000 contributed the DNC by Indian tribes opposed to granting a casino license to rival tribes had nothing to do with his denial of the license. I believed the secretary when he said that he had not been instructed this matter by then-White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. I believed him when he said that he had told lobbyist and friend Paul Eckstein that Ickes had told him to move on the casino decision, but that he had been lying to Eckstein. I agree with the secretary that it is an outrage that anyone would question his integrity. I believe in the Clinton Standard of adherence to the campaign finance and bribery laws, enunciated by the president on March 7, 1997: ''I don''t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.'' I note with approval the use of the word ''evidence'' and also the use of the word ''solely.'' I believe that it is proper to change government policy to address the concerns of people who have given the president money, as long as nobody can find evidence of this being the sole reason. I believe the president has lived up to his promise to preside over the most ethical administration in American history. I believe that indicted former agriculture secretary Mike Espy did not accept $35,000 in illegal favors from Tyson Foods and other regulated businesses. I believe that indicted former housing secretary Henry Cisneros did not lie to the FBI and tell others to lie to cover up $ 250,000 in blackmail payments to his former mistress.  I believe that convicted former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell was not involved in the obstruction of justice when the president''s minions arranged for Hubbell to receive $ 400,000 in sweetheart consulting deals at a time when he was reneging on his promise to cooperate with Kenneth Starr''s Whitewater investigation. I believe Paula Jones is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Kathleen Willey is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Monica Lewinsky is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Lewinsky was fantasizing in her 20 hours of conversation in which she reportedly detailed her sexual relationship with the president and begged Linda Tripp to join her in lying about the relationship. I believe that any gifts, correspondence, telephone calls and the 37 post-employment White House visits that may have passed between Lewinsky and the president are evidence only of a platonic relationship; such innocent intimate friendships are quite common between middle-aged married men and young single women, and also between presidents of the United States and White House interns. I see nothing suspicious in the report that the president''s intimate, Vernon Jordan, arranged a $ 40,000-per-year job for Lewinsky shortly after she signed but before she filed an affidavit saying she had not had sex with the president. Nor do I read anything into the fact that the ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, visited Lewinsky at the Watergate to offer her a job. I believe the instructions Lewinsky gave Tripp informing her on how to properly perjure herself in the Willey matter simply wrote themselves.I believe that The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News &amp; World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR are all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. Especially NPR.]

This is the<br /> greatest country in the world and we will get through this<br /> trying time.

Americans are so hungry to kill,<br /> that we shoot at each other every day. We will relish that<br /> opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you<br /> forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started<br /> fucking around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over<br /> in Japan? We slapped them all over the Pacific and roasted about<br /> 2 million of them in their own back yard. That''s what we in<br /> America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen Texas on a map? Ever<br /> wonder why it''s so big? Because we wanted it that way, Mexico<br /> started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our<br /> lawns. England? We sent them packing.</p>\n<p>Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good ''ole USA. The<br /> only reason he got away the first time is because it''s too hard<br /> to shoot someone when you''re doubled over laughing at them. Our<br /> soldiers aren''t trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now<br /> he couldn''t stop a pack of cub scouts from taking over his<br /> shitty little country.</p>\n<p>Trust us, Afghanistan will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go<br /> ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden. There''s not a hole deep enough<br /> or a mountain high enough that''s going to keep your camel riding<br /> asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that harbors<br /> him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he<br /> was there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that<br /> have pissed us off in the past. This is America. We kick ass.<br /> This is what we do. Go ahead and laugh now, but the Tomahawks<br /> are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.</p>\n<p>God bless America!]

He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together. </p>\n<p>We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill). </p>\n<p>If anybody asks if you''re OK, you say, "I''m just catching my breath!" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you''re going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you''re planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw. </p>\n<p>At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance. </p>\n<p>So I thought I''d take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing. </p>\n<p>In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range. </p>\n<p>Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can''t stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you. </p>\n<p>Skiers hate snowboarders. It''s a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc. </p>\n<p>Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd. </p>\n<p>I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope. </p>\n<p>Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who''s going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete. </p>\n<p>You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.) </p>\n<p>We learned snowboarding via a two step method: </p>\n<p>STEP ONE: Watching Brad do something. </p>\n<p>STEP TWO: Trying to do it ourselves. </p>\n<p>I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics. </p>\n<p>I''d struggle to my feet, and I''d be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot. </p>\n<p>"Keep your knees bent!" Brad would yell, helpfully. </p>\n<p>Have you noticed that whatever sport you''re trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if THAT would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, "FORGET MY KNEES! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE GRAVITY CHUNKS!" </p>\n<p>Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me. </p>\n<p>If I hadn''t gotten out of there, they''d have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding. </p>\n<p>So I think, when my body heals, I''ll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you''ll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.]

[Good afternoon all. I''m Al Gore, and I''d like to tell you a<br /> little about myself. </p>\n<p>I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a<br /> poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I<br /> was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands. I taught<br /> myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers<br /> and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi<br /> River steamboat. Frequently we would stop the ship and I would<br /> cut and split five cords of wood for fuel overnight for the<br /> steam engines. </p>\n<p>My mother taught me the value of education, so every day, I<br /> would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a<br /> mischievous, fun loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one<br /> day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for<br /> "Huckleberry Finn." </p>\n<p>Back then, we Jewish black folks in the south were second-class<br /> citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I<br /> asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee<br /> civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an<br /> impression. You see, the minister''s name was Martin Luther King,<br /> Jr. </p>\n<p>My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his<br /> knee and said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama,<br /> someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to<br /> an exclusive prep school." As a young Hindu boy, these were very<br /> valuable lessons. But life of privilege was not for me. </p>\n<p>Being Chinese, after getting my high school diploma, I took a<br /> job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the<br /> treatment of the workers there that I organized a union. Later,<br /> that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my<br /> close friends at the AFL-CIO call me "Norma Rae." </p>\n<p>When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done,<br /> Harvard University called and offered me a scholarship. I<br /> captained the hockey team to four consecutive national<br /> championships, but I also played football and was good enough to<br /> win the Heisman Trophy. </p>\n<p>During my college years, I lived in a housing project and<br /> moonlighted writing songs and playing lead guitar for a little<br /> rock band. You may have heard of us - The Rolling Stones. I''m<br /> the one with the lips. </p>\n<p>But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my<br /> country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I<br /> was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier<br /> and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de<br /> Guerre. My battlefield expertise is current requisite reading<br /> material for Officers Candidates to this very day. My being a<br /> wounded female officer serving in disguise as a journalist was a<br /> full time project, but my military knowledge helped save tens of<br /> thousands of lives. Many cities in Southeast Asia are named<br /> after me to this very day. Statues of me are still commonplace<br /> in many official Government buildings in Viet Nam. </p>\n<p>When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of<br /> ours. I''ve crossed the deserts bare, man, I''ve breathed the<br /> mountain air, man, I''ve traveled, I''ve done my share, man, I''ve<br /> been everywhere. I''ve hunted all the dangerous species of big<br /> game in five continents using only a handmade spear or my<br /> handmade laser sighted compound bow. </p>\n<p>And the people I met at truck stops and campgrounds and homeless<br /> shelters on that journey all said the same thing: "Al, we need<br /> you in Washington." </p>\n<p>I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some<br /> other business---building the World Trade Center, finding a low<br /> cost, more reliable nuclear weapon trigger design, founding the<br /> Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking<br /> caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field''s<br /> chocolate chip cookies. I was, in fact, the third (still silent)<br /> partner of Ben &amp; Jerry with over half of the flavors personally<br /> developed by Tipper and me in our own kitchen.</p>\n<p>My extensive knowledge of Arctic Sea life keeps me busy in the<br /> research laboratory, but those endangered species need love too!<br /> Translating the dead sea scrolls is one of my favorite hobbies,<br /> and my current volume is in print in over 73 languages and is<br /> being studied in Seminaries worldwide. Being Indian, both Native<br /> American and the Mid East kind, this is valuable experience for<br /> me. Have towel and Tee Pee, will travel.</p>\n<p>Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee<br /> and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and<br /> the Senate. And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for<br /> no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once<br /> again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the<br /> United States. </p>\n<p>I also invented the Internet. Since then, I''ve been part of the<br /> most successful administration in American history. My friend,<br /> Bill Gates has asked me many times why I gave him the ideas of<br /> software development and asked for no money. Gosh, it just<br /> wouldn''t be right! </p>\n<p>Many times President Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave<br /> decision and has asked me what to do. And when I would give him<br /> my thoughts, he would invariable say, "Of course. That''s<br /> brilliant. Why didn''t I think of that?" During the darkest days<br /> of the impeachment battles, the President told me he only wished<br /> he had listened when I told him to stay away form that<br /> dark-haired intern with the big hooters. </p>\n<p>So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and<br /> asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my<br /> campaign. And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of<br /> advice-words I''ll never forget. He looked me in the eye and he<br /> said, "Al, just tell the truth, it''s always worked well for me." </p>\n<p>Thanks, I''m Al Gore and I want to be your next President. You<br /> can trust and believe me.]

A girl named Lucy has not gone along with<br /> the crowd. The teacher asks her why she has decided to be different. "Because<br /> I''m not a liberal Democrat."<br /> Then, asks the teacher, what are you?  "Why I''m a proud conservative<br /> Republican.", boasts the little girl.<br /> The teacher is a little perturbed now, her face slightly red. She asks Lucy<br /> why she is a conservative Republican.<br /> "Well, I was brought up to trust in myself instead of relying on an intrusive<br /> government to care for me and do all of my thinking. My Dad and Mom are<br /> conservative Republicans, and I am a conservative Republican too."<br /> The teacher is now angry. "That''s no reason," she says loudly.

[Every once in a while each of us experiences a perfect crap. It''s rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects. You sit down expecting the worst, but what you get is the smooth-sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. </p>\n<p>But that''s not the end of it. You use some toilet paper only to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it. </p>\n<p>On the other hand (so to speak) there is:</p>\n<p>The Beer Crap<br /> Talk about nasty craps. Depending on the crapper''s tolerance, the beer crap is the result of too many beers. It could have been two or 22, it doesn''t matter.<br /> What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy crap accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.</p>\n<p>The Chilli Crap<br /> Hot when it goes in and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chilli crap stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a heat shield.</p>\n<p>The Cable Crap<br /> Long, curly and perfectly formed like two feet of telephone coaxial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. You wonder admiringly, ''Did I do that? Where did it come from?'' You leave the toilet pleased with yourself.</p>\n<p>The Latrine Crap<br /> In case you didn''t know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it - where soldiers, boy scouts and flies go to crap. Tip: don''t ever look down the hole.</p>\n<p>The Mona Lisa Crap<br /> This is the masterpiece of craps. It''s as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that would make Da Vinci weep. And just think, you made it yourself. You may even want to break out the Polaroid camera, but maybe that''s going too far.</p>\n<p>The Empty Roll Crap<br /> You''re done... you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins coldly in your throat. You could use the curtains... no, someone would say, ''Where are the curtains?'' Then what would you say. The rug? Too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that every ''empty roll crapper'' must face... pull up your daks, tighten your arse and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.</p>\n<p>A mate about to run the London Marathon lined up outside the dozens of portaloos on Blackheath to unload a nervous one and discovered when the business was done and he was ready to run a world record race, there was no paper. Panic. The only thing available was a pound note - the last he possessed because they were being replaced by the coin - and he used that, being careful not to use the side with the Queen''s head, of course!</p>\n<p>The Splash Back Crap<br /> You send the crap on its way; it drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you''re wet and embarrassed. Tip: blot instead of wipe.</p>\n<p>The Aborted Crap<br /> You are in mid-crap when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off; go for the phone and save the rest for later. It isn''t pretty, but you''ve gotta do what you''ve gotta do.</p>\n<p>The Caesarean Crap<br /> Pain, that''s what this crap and childbirth have in common. It''s simply a case of too much crap trying to go through too small a hole and there''s no obstetrician to help.</p>\n<p>The Alfresco Crap<br /> Everyone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the nature, and a good bush all contribute to the peaceful ambience that our primitive forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of Brownies or a patch of poison ivy.</p>\n<p>The Tijuana Trot Crap (also known as Delhi Belly, Rabat Runs, Seskatchewan Squits, Balsall Heath Balti Bypass)<br /> The phrase ''shit happens'' really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins. For the next 72 hours you''d be better off if you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a fetal position.</p>\n<p>The Machine Gun Crap<br /> You''re just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like machinegun fire. The guy in the next stall hits the floor like a combat veteran - cradling his umbrella like an AK47.</p>\n<p>The Sound Effect Crap<br /> You feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or workmates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects:<br /> 1. Flush the toilet.<br /> 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem.<br /> 3. Drop a handful of change on the floor.</p>\n<p>The Security Crap<br /> You have enough on your mind when you''re in the toilet without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-crap mode. So how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can''t reach to do this... hum loudly.</p>\n<p>The Cling-On Crap<br /> For the most part you''ve completed your crap, but there''s one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You''re getting impatient. Someone else wants to use the toilet. So you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently on the door has scissors.</p>\n<p>The Houdini Crap<br /> You go, then you stand up to flush and the damn thing has disappeared. Where''d it go? Did it creep down the pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it lurking out of sight? Should you wipe... maybe you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You''d better, because if you don''t, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.</p>\n<p>The Hangover Crap<br /> You feel so bad that you don''t know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your intestines like a vice so you sit down again... up down, up down. Don''t you wish Mum was close by.</p>\n<p>The Porta-Pottie Dump<br /> Construction workers and outdoor concertgoers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best description would be, ''It''s like taking a shit in an upright coffin.'' It''s claustrophobic and it smells bad. Best advice: go in a paper cup.</p>\n<p>The Proctologist Crap<br /> In the beginning, the Lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn''t create this dump because there is nothing biblical about it. You run out of gas. That''s right, you run out of propulsion. The crap is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You''ve only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you''re a proctologist and go after it yourself. Not a pretty picture is it?</p>\n<p>The Whole Roll Crap<br /> No matter how much you wipe, it doesn''t seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times too. The whole episode is consumer waste.</p>\n<p>The Graffiti Crap<br /> You flush the crap and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the crap to the porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way down. You flush again but the curly-Q hangs there... love it or leave it, it''s your choice.</p>\n<p>The Encore Crap<br /> ''Ahhh!'' You''re done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the toilet when you feel another crap on its way. You have to return for a curtain call.</p>\n<p>The Born Again Crap<br /> This is a dump that''s going badly. You say, ''Lord, if I live through this, I''ll take up religion.'' You always get through it, but seldom keep the promises you made in desperation, because a born-again crap is like childbirth - you forget the pain quickly.</p>\n<div id="nodevote result">Score: 0.0, votes: 0</div>\n]

[[surprisingly bi-partisan]''TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE IMPEACHMENTDecember 17, 1998''Twas The Night Before Impeachment, When all through the House, All Congress was stirring, Even Conyers, the louse.  The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care, In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair.  The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds, While visions of perjury danced in their heads.  And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap, Had just settled in for a long evening''s nap.When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter.  When what to their wondering eyes should appear But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer.  With a Presidential address, so lively and quick, They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick!More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came, And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:''Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let''s forget The Vixen!On Barney! On Maxine! I''m no Richard Nixon!!!'' ''From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall, Now dash away, dash away, dash away all !!!''And then the Republicans heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  They scratched their heads and were turning around When resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound.  No longer would he eat from his humble pie, While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky.  A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq, It looked once again like Slick Willie was back.His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, His nose like a cherry.  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the hair on his head was as white as the snow.  The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.  He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf, And the Republicans wept, in spite of themselves.  And a wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave them to know they had something to dread.  He spoke the right words and went straight to his work Hard to believe Mon had called him ''The Jerk.''And shaking his finger and thumbing his nose, By ''Wagging The Dog,'' up the polls he rose.  He turned to his spinmeisters and gave them a whistle, Then they cheered-on Slick Willie as he launched another missile.  They all heard him exclaim, with Impeachment out of sight, ''Happy Ramadan to all, and to all a good night.'']

[Now that it seems almost a certainty that George W. Bush will become the<br /> Republican nominee for President, attention will soon focus upon whom Governor<br /> Bush will pick for his Vice Presidential running mate. It is rumored that one of<br /> the names on the ''short list'' currently being floated in upper level Republican<br /> circles is former Vice President, Dan Quayle. </p>\n<p>For many, there seems to be some very sound reasoning for picking Quayle. As<br /> was pointed out by one senior official who wished not be identified, Quayle<br /> "already knows how to do the job, will contribute gaffes that will deflect<br /> attention away from Bush''s own, and in a cost saving side benefit will help the<br /> party minimize printing costs for new ''Bush-Quayle'' posters and bumper stickers<br /> (since they can use the leftovers from the 1988 and 1992 campaigns). </p>\n<p>Apparently, part of the overall strategy is the targeting of a key demographic<br /> group that has been virtually ignored in previous presidential campaigns: Senile<br /> and confused voters. One recent survey puts the ''senile and confused'' at<br /> approximately 3.8% of the voting population. The hope is that this group will<br /> mistakenly believe that this is the same Bush-Quayle ticket they voted for in<br /> 1988 and 1992 and will once again cast their votes for another, albeit<br /> different, Bush-Quayle ticket. The dilemma facing Republican strategists however<br /> is determining how best to mount an effective campaign that will get out the<br /> ''senile and confused'' vote. One strategist sighed, "They''re a hard group to<br /> reach, let alone give instructions to." </p>\n<p>Additionally, word has it that the former Vice President is undertaking some<br /> unique preparations for another run at the Vice Presidency. Included in his<br /> training regimen is a comprehensive reading of Webster�酶惟s Dictionary cover to<br /> cover as well as listening to the popular vocabulary-building program on<br /> cassette tapes, "Verbal Advantage." </p>\n<p>For many, the inclusion of former Vice President Quayle on the ticket will<br /> spell ''opportunities''. When one reporter asked Quayle "what do you think about<br /> running on a ticket with a Bush again," the former Vice President expressed that<br /> he was "clearly delighted" about it. However, Quayle did seem somewhat puzzled<br /> and perplexed as to why Bush has now added a "W" to his name when he didn''t seem<br /> to use one before.]

[REDMOND, Wash. - Oct. 21, 1997 -- In direct response to accusations made by the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today that it will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of America for an undisclosed sum. </p>\n<p>"It''s actually a logical extension of our planned growth", said Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, "It really is going to be a positive arrangement for everyone". Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of the White House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and assured members of the press that changes will be "minimal". </p>\n<p>The United States will be managed as a wholly owned division of Microsoft. An initial public offering is planned for July of next year, and the federal government is expected to be profitable by "Q4 1999 at latest", according to Microsoft president Steve Ballmer. In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had "willingly and enthusiastically" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting directly to Bill Gates. When asked how it felt to give up the mantle of executive authority to Gates, Clinton smiled and referred to it as "a relief". He went on to say that Gates has a "proven track record", and that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their "full support and confidence". Clinton will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he has earned as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft. Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as "silly", though did say that he would make executive decisions for the U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters. Gates went on to say that the House and Senate would "of course" be Abolished. </p>\n<p>"Microsoft isn''t a democracy", he observed, "and look how well we''re doing". When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was proceeding, Gates said, "We don''t deny that discussions are taking place". Microsoft representatives closed the conference by stating that United States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in government services and discounts on all Microsoft products.</p>\n<p>About Microsoft</p>\n<p>Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ "MSFT") is the worldwide leader in software for personal computers, and democratic government. The company offers a wide range of products and services for public, business and personal use, each designed with the mission of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take advantage of the full power of personal computing and free society every day. </p>\n<p>About the United States</p>\n<p>Founded in 1789, the United States of America is the most successful nation in the history of the world, and has been a beacon of democracy and opportunity for over 200 years.

[An open letter to the rest of America:</p>\n<p>America has engaged in some finger wagging lately because<br /> California doesn''t have enough electricity to meet its needs.<br /> The rest of the country (including George W. Bush''s energy<br /> secretary Spencer Abraham, who wants Californians to suffer<br /> through blackouts as justification for drilling for oil in<br /> Alaska''s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) seems to be just fine<br /> with letting Californians dangle in the breeze without enough<br /> power to meet their needs. They laugh at Californians''<br /> frivolity. Well, everybody. Here''s how it really is:</p>\n<p>California ranks 48th in the nation in power consumed per<br /> person. California grows more than half the nation''s fruit, nuts<br /> and vegetables. We''re keeping them. We need something to eat<br /> when the power goes out. We grow 99 percent or more of the<br /> nation''s almonds, artichokes, dates, figs, kiwifruit, olives,<br /> persimmons, pistachios, prunes, raisins and walnuts. Hope you<br /> won''t miss them. California is the nation''s number one dairy<br /> state. We''re keeping our dairy products. We''ll need plenty of<br /> fresh ones since our refrigerators can''t be relied upon. Got<br /> milk?</p>\n<p>We Californians are gonna keep all our high-tech software in<br /> state. Silicon Valley is ours, after all. Without enough<br /> electricity, which you''re apparently keeping for yourselves, we<br /> just plain don''t have enough software to spare. We''re keeping<br /> all our airplanes. California builds a good percentage of the<br /> commercial airliners available to fly you people to where you<br /> want to go. When yours wear out, you''d better hope Boeing''s<br /> Washington plant can keep you supplied. There isn''t enough<br /> electricity here to allow us to export any more planes than we<br /> need ourselves. And while we''re at it, we''re keeping all our<br /> high tech aerospace stuff, too, like the sophisticated weapons<br /> systems that let you sleep at night, not worried you might wake<br /> up under the rule of some foreign kook. Oh, yeah, and if you<br /> want to make a long-distance call, remember where the satellite<br /> components and tracking systems come from. Maybe you could get<br /> back in the habit of writing letters. Want to see a blockbuster<br /> movie this weekend? Come to California. We make them here. Since<br /> we''ll now have to make them with our own electricity, we''re<br /> keeping them. Even if we shot them somewhere else, the labs,<br /> printing facilities, editing facilities, and sound facilities<br /> are all here.</p>\n<p>Want some nice domestic wine? We produce over 17 million gallons<br /> per year. We''ll need all of it to drown our sorrows when we<br /> think about the fact that no matter how many California products<br /> we export to make the rest of America''s lives better, America<br /> can''t see its way clear to help us out with a little<br /> electricity. You can no longer have any of our wine. You all<br /> complain that we don''t build enough power plants. Well, you<br /> don''t grow enough food, write enough software, make enough<br /> movies, build enough airplanes and defense systems or make<br /> enough wine. This is your last warning, America.

[It was getting a little crowded in heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have a real bummer of a day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.The next day at 12:01, the first person comes to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly says to the man, ''Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died.''''No problem,'' the man says. ''I came home to my 25th floor apartment in my lunch hour and caught my wife half-naked and appearing to be having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. I immediately began searching for him. My wife was yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. Just as I was about to giveup, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of that guy!''Well, I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But wouldn''t you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn''t die. This ticked me off even more. In a rage, I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him. Oddly enough, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony, and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 storeys and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.''The angel sits back and thinks for a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day. It was a crime of passion. So, the angel announces, ''OK sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,'' and lets him in. A few seconds later the next guy comes up. ''Before I can let you in, I need to hear about what your day was like when you died.''The man says, ''No problem. But you''re not going to believe this. I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side!''Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, starts cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom that broke my fall so I didn''t die right away. As I''m laying there face up on the ground, unable to move, and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator of all things off the balcony. It falls the 25 floors and lands on top of me, killing me instantly.''The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. ''I could get used to this new policy,'' he thinks to himself. ''Very well,'' the angel announces, ''welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,'' and he lets the man enter.A few seconds later, a third man comes up to the gate. The angel is warming up to his task. ''OK, please tell me what it was like the day you died.''The man says, ''OK, picture this. I''m naked inside this refrigerator. . .'']

[The following statement has been translated into Ebonics. Good evening. (Yo Yo<br /> Yo, s''up?). This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the<br /> Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury. (Today at my crib these<br /> suckers and playa-haters started grillin'' a brotha). I answered their questions<br /> truthfully, including question about my private life, questions no American<br /> citizen would ever want to answer. (Dey started frontin'' about my game and<br /> asking all kinds of fowl sh-t). Still, I must take complete responsibility for<br /> all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you<br /> tonight. (I''m tired of these haters throwing salt in my game. I''m going to let<br /> yall know my Mackin style tonight). As you know, in a deposition in January, I<br /> was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers<br /> were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. (Awhile back, you nosey<br /> motherfu-ers wanted to know if I was hittin'' hoe-ass Monica''s skins. You ain''t<br /> got any video, so if you want to believe a $10 hoe then oh well).<br /> Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Levwinsky that was not appropriate.<br /> In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a<br /> personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.<br /> (Yeah, I was hittin'' that dime dropping Bit-h! She was only sucking my jammie<br /> though. I was stupid for messing with a young big mouthed skank. My bad, but<br /> don''t hate me because I''m a playa). But I told the grand jury today and I say to<br /> you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence.<br /> (Outside of that hit I told punk-ass AG (Al Gore) to put on gay-ass Star, Monica<br /> and her snitching friend, I was chill the whole time).<br /> I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to<br /> protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. (Check dis, I heard she<br /> was down with what ever, you know a freak ass beiach. She wasn''t all that but I<br /> planned to pimp her around to my boyz in the Senate). The independent counsel<br /> investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life. And<br /> now the investigation itself is under investigation. (Those haters started<br /> sweatin'' my homeys and my peeps. Dey pissed a nugga off when they tried to make<br /> me look like I''m not real or somefin. Matter of fact dey shady asses is on the<br /> take anyway).<br /> This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people.<br /> (Tryin'' to hit me they wasted a lot of Cheddar and pissed off my Crew). Nothing<br /> is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim<br /> my family life for my family. It''s nobody''s business but ours. (I''m a pimp and<br /> playa and I''m going to be one, dey can�酶惟t change a nugga! Get some businesses.<br /> Hillary is chill because I got more than enough White Water dirt on her ass that<br /> will get her sent up before I''m outtied).<br /> It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into<br /> private life and get on with our national life. (Get off my jock because I''m<br /> going to flex regardless. Just in case yall forgot until you chumps ax me I''m<br /> still the sh-t!) Now it is time - in fact, it is past time - to move on. (F-k<br /> all yall, I don''t give an f-k! Peace out!!!)]

The<br /> hitch is, he was never there but interviewed them by phone.<br /> This fact should have been more apparent when he relied on<br /> one heavily sedated Marine''s description of the other as "a<br /> quiet purple centaur with TV coming from his mouth." </p>\n<p>Expense reports show Blair was at home in Brooklyn when he<br /> was supposed to be in Maryland covering the sniper story.<br /> One embarrassingly false report that made the front page of<br /> the Times was titled, "Boy, There Sure is a Lot of Sniping<br /> Going on Here Where I Am. Maryland That is... Where I Am at<br /> Presently. Dang. Look Around at Maryland."]
[Spokesman Shows Footage of President Tumbling from Bike</p>\n<p>In what some political insiders were calling an attempt to lower expectations in the days leading up to the first presidential debate, the White House today announced that President Bush has an I.Q. of 67.</p>\n<p>"The president is far, far less intelligent than is commonly thought," White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.  "Even the simplest tasks remain well beyond his reach."</p>\n<p>Reinforcing the impression that the president will be overmatched in Thursday''s debate with Sen. John Kerry, Mr. McClellan showed reporters never-before-seen footage of Mr. Bush oafishly tumbling from his mountain bike.</p>\n<p>"What a moron," Mr. McClellan said.</p>\n<p>The White House spokesman said that Mr. Bush cannot possibly be expected to do well in a debate with Sen. Kerry, who Mr. McClellan said "has an I.Q. of 193" and "is widely considered the best debater on the planet."</p>\n<p>But within minutes of the White House press conference, Kerry spokesman Joe Lockhart fired back, telling reporters, "John Kerry is much stupider than he looks."</p>\n<p>As evidence of Mr. Kerry''s idiocy, Mr. Lockhart referred to the floral-patterned windsurfing pants the senator wears while enjoying his favorite water sport.</p>\n<p>"His ass looks enormous in those pants," Mr. Lockhart said.

[While visiting England, George W. Bush is invited to tea with the Queen. He<br /> asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround<br /> herself with intelligent people. He asks how she knows if they''re intelligent. </p>\n<p>"I do so by asking them the right questions," says the Queen. "Allow me to<br /> demonstrate." </p>\n<p>She phones Tony Blair and says, "Mr. Prime Minister. Please answer this<br /> question: Your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child<br /> is not your brother or sister. Who is it?" </p>\n<p>Tony Blair responds, "It''s me, ma''am." </p>\n<p>"Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir," says the Queen. She hangs up and says,<br /> "Did you get that, Mr. Bush?" </p>\n<p>"Yes ma''am. Thanks a lot. I''ll definitely be using that!" </p>\n<p>Upon returning to Washington, he decides he''d better put the Chairman of the<br /> Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the test. He summons Jesse Helms to the<br /> White House and says, "Senator Helms, I wonder if you can answer a question for<br /> me." </p>\n<p>"Why, of course, sir. What''s on your mind?" </p>\n<p>"Uh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is<br /> not your brother or your sister. Who is it?" </p>\n<p>Helms hems and haws and finally asks, "Can I think about it and get back to<br /> you?" Bush agrees, and Helms leaves. He immediately calls a meeting of other<br /> senior senators, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody<br /> can come up with an answer. Finally, in desperation, Helms calls Colin Powell at<br /> the State Department and explains his problem. </p>\n<p>"Now look here Colin Powell, your mother has a child, and your father has a<br /> child, and this child is not your brother, or your sister. Who is it?" Powell<br /> answers immediately, "It''s me, of course, you dumb ass." </p>\n<p>Much relieved, Helms rushes back to the White House and exclaims, "I know the<br /> answer, sir! I know who it is! It''s Colin Powell!" And Bush replies in disgust,<br /> "Wrong, you dumb ass, It''s Tony Blair!"]

[A few years ago, I applied for a job at Kodak.  I made it through all the interviews with flying colours, and the only thing left was the drug test.  I was confident in passing, but there was one slight problem: I have *very* shy kidneys.  I''ve had to sneak out of the doctor''s office on more than one occasion, because I can''t "go" and fill up a cup on command.  Usually, this is a good thing, as I can go to a concert or football game, drink beer all day, and be fine until I get home, while my friends are standing in line in the bathrooms several times during the same time period.So, to prepare, on the morning I had to take the test, I drank my usual 10-cup pot of coffee, and several large glasses of water, and for the 20-minute trip to Kodak, I filled a plastic gallon jug with water, and finished it off on the way.   Now, Kodak has huge parking lots, each containg hundreds and hundreds of cars, and by the time I got there, the visitor''s lots were pretty full, and I had to park way in the back.As soon as I got out of my car, I''m thinking, "Good, it worked, I think I can go!"  By the time I''d finished the 10-minute walk to the entrance, I was thinking, "Boy, no problems now, I can *definitely* go!"To get in, I had to go past a security hut.  I told them why I was there, and they told me where to report, about another 10-minute walk, a little ways into the plant.  I had to pass building after building before I got to the right one, every step of the way, becoming actually painful, and before I was there, I was looking at bushes and doorways and the like, thinking, "Well, if it gets too bad, I could go there, or maybe there, or..."By the time I got to the right building, I was just about in agony. I found the right area, and the receptionist told me to take a seat with about 8 other people.  I sat down, thinking that would help, but 10 seconds later I was up, walking around, trying to read stuff on the wall, anything to keep my mind occuppied, but managing to read 5 or 10 words, and then having to pace again.Finally, I couldn''t take it anymore, and after having asked the girl a couple of times how long, I told her, "look, either you get me in *now*, or I use the bathroom over there, and we reschedule!!" She said she''d see what she could do, and left.  I went back to sit down, and it took all of 5 seconds before I was up pacing again. She came back a few minutes later, and told me to go on in.When I got to the actual room, there were 4 people standing in line.  I hopped up and down a couple of times, before I passed the others, went to the nurses, and told them I have to go **NOW**!!! They asked the others in line if anyone objected, and they said no, so they said as soon as one of the 2 bathrooms come free, I could go.  I snatched the cup out of his hand, and practically raced down the aisle to the bathrooms and just stood waiting.  It couldn''t have been more than 20 seconds or so, but they were some of the most agonizing seconds of my life!!Finally, one of the doors opened, and I nearly flattened some poor girl coming out in my rush to get in.  I closed the door, grabbed my pants, breathed in, and dropped them and then my underwear, and then the world caved in...  I started going.  And going.  And going. I could have knocked down the Berlin wall with the force!   But the problem was, that I couldn''t "grab" it!!  It was whipping around like one of those Water Wiggle things.  I''m trying like heck to reign it it in, but just couldn''t.  I''m dancing around in a circle, with my pants around my ankles, trying to grab it, and it was just about impossible for probably a good 15 seconds.  Finally, I did, and was able to aim in the toilet, just remembering at the end to put a shot or two in the cup to put on the little shelf.   By the time I''d stopped, I was physically spent, and just leaned up against the wall, feeling like I''d just run a marathon...It was then that was able to survey the bathroom.  It was a room, about 7x7, but my god...  I had finished the most intense pee of my life in the john, but before I''d gained control, I''d soaked the entire toilet, the sink, the floor, the walls.  You name it, it was drenched -- including my pants and underwear.  I tried soaking it up with toilet paper (using the whole roll as a sponge), but that was drenched and didn''t work that well.  I''d also soaked the extra rolls on the back of the toilet, the paper towel holder, and the extra roll of paper towels.  I went through the garbage, pulling out half-soaked old towels, just trying to make the place semi-presentable, as in the sink and the mirror, but it didn''t do much good.  I was just ending up pushing the wet around, so I finally gave up.Steeling myself, I pulled up my wet underwear, then my wet pants, and pulled down my semi-wet shirt as much as possible, and went out. I whipped back up the aisle, thanking the nurse, without slowing down, and out the door as fast as my legs would carry me, imagining what the next person to use that bathroom would encounter. The silver lining:  I got the job!!]

[An old wizard was walking through a park when he came upon two statues. One statue was male and the other was female. They were positioned on opposite ends of the park, facing each other with their arms extended out as if to embrace. The wizard stood there for a long time examining their sad facial expressions until he got an idea.         He immediately opened up his bag of tricks and cast a spell on the statues to bring them to life. Once the statues realized they were human, they quickly ran up to him. The wizard, being very pleased with himself, told the statues that they could finally be together as a couple but there was one condition. He said, ''''Go off and experience with each other whatever you''ve wanted to do for all these years but you must be back within a half an hour before the spell wears off.''''          Wasting no time, they quickly ran off into the bushes. The wizard, with great pride, sat down on a park bench and waited patiently. Fifteen minutes later the two statues came walking back to him.         The wizard, with great shock exclaimed, ''''For over a hundred years you both have bore your passions and now that you have your chance, you come back after only fifteen minutes? Go back to the bushes and continue what you were doing before you lose your only chance!''''        With that in mind the female turns to the male and exclaims, ''''The old man''s right. But this time you hold down the pigeons and I''ll crap on them!'''']

[Police in George, WA issued a report on the events leading up to the deaths of Ro`ert Uhlenake (24) and his friend, Ormond D. Young (27) at the Metallica concert last Friday. Uhlenake and Young were found dead at the Gorge Amphitheater after the show. Uhlenake was in pickup that was on top of Young at the bottom of a 20 ft drop. Young was found with severe lacerations, numerous fractures, contusions, and a branch in his anal cavity. He also had been stabbed and his pants were in a tree above him, some 15 ft off the ground; adding to the mystery of the heretofore unexplained scene. </p>\n<p>According to Commissioner-In-Charge Inoye Appleton, Uhlenake and Young had tried to get tickets for the sold-out concert. When they were unable to get any tickets, the two decided to stay in the lot and drink. Once the show began, and after the two had consumed 18 beers between the two of them, they hit upon the idea of scaling the 7 foot wooden security fence around the perimeter of the site and sneak in. They apparently moved the truck up to the edge of the fence and decided that Young would go over first and assist Uhlenake later. </p>\n<p>They had not counted on the fact that while it was a 7 foot fence on the parking lot side, there was a 23 foot drop on the other side. Young, who weighed 255 lbs and was quite inebriated, had jumped up and over the fence and promptly fell about half the 23 foot distance before a large tree branch broke his fall AND his left forearm; unfortunately, he also managed to get his shorts caught on the branch. Since he was now in a lot of pain and with no way to extricate himself and his shorts from the tree, he decided, seeing bushes down below, to cut his shorts off and fall to the ground. Upon cutting the last bit of fabric from himself, he suddenly plummeted to earth, losing grip of the knife. </p>\n<p>The "soft" bushes were actually holly bushes and landing in them caused a massive number of cuts. He also had the misfortune of landing squarely on a holly bush branch; effectively impaling himself. The knife, which he had accidentally released 15 ft up, now landed and stabbed him in his left thigh. Apparently, he was in a lot of pain. Enter his friend Robert. Uhlenake had apparently observed the last bit of this and, despite his inebriated state, realized that Young was in trouble. He hit upon the idea of lowering a rope to his friend and pull him up and over the fence. </p>\n<p>This was complicated by the fact that Uhlenake was outweighed by his friend `y a good 100 lbs. Again, despite his state he realized he could use their truck to pull Young out. Unfortunately, because of his state, Uhlenake put the truck in reverse, rather than drive, broke through the fence, landed on Young (killing him), was thrown out of the truck and subsequently died of internal injuries. "So that''s how a dead 255 lb man with no pants on, with a truck on top of him and a stick up his ass came to be" said Commissioner Appleton.]
[Good afternoon. I''m Al Gore, and I''d like to tell you about myself.<br /> I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black<br /> child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I was born in a log cabin<br /> that I built with my own hands. I taught myself to read by candlelight and<br /> helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a<br /> Mississippi River steamboat.<br /> My mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles<br /> to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought I<br /> never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration<br /> for "Huckleberry Finn."<br /> Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens. One day, a<br /> traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going<br /> to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I<br /> made an impression. You see, the minister''s name was Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /> My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and<br /> said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a<br /> hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school."<br /> But life of privilege was not for me. After getting my high school diploma, I<br /> took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the treatment of<br /> the workers there that I organized a union. Later, that experience inspired a<br /> movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me<br /> "Norma Rae."<br /> When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called<br /> and offered me a scholarship. I captained the hockey team to four consecutive<br /> national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win<br /> the Heisman Trophy.<br /> During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing<br /> lead guitar for a little rock band. You may have heard of it-the Rolling<br /> Stones.<br /> But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country. So<br /> I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I was deeply opposed to the<br /> war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the Medal of Honor<br /> and the Croix de Guerre.<br /> When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours. I''ve<br /> crossed the deserts bare, man, I''ve breathed the mountain air, man, I''ve<br /> traveled, I''ve done my share, man, I''ve been everywhere. And the people I met at<br /> truck stops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the<br /> same thing: "Al, we need you in Washington."<br /> I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other<br /> business---building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon Society, doing<br /> the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the<br /> recipe for Mrs. Field''s chocolate chip cookies.<br /> Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and allowed them<br /> to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate, where I established<br /> the US Strategic Oil Reserve. And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for<br /> no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once again and took the<br /> oath of office as Vice President of the United States.<br /> Since then, I''ve been part of the most successful administration in American<br /> history. And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet. Many times Bill Clinton<br /> has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do. And when I<br /> would give him my thoughts, he would invariable say, "Of course. That''s<br /> brilliant. Why didn''t I think of that?"<br /> During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he<br /> only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away form that dark-haired<br /> intern. So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked<br /> if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign. And Bill Clinton<br /> gave me a few simple words of advice-words I''ll never forget.<br /> He looked me in the eye and he said, "Al, just tell the truth, it''s always<br /> worked for me."]

[FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>\n<p>Microsoft Addresses Justice Department Accusations</p>\n<p>REDMOND, Wash. - Jul. 1, 1998 -- In direct response to accusations made by<br /> the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today that it<br /> will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of America<br /> for an undisclosed sum.</p>\n<p>"It''s actually a logical extension of our planned growth", said Microsoft<br /> chairman Bill Gates, "It really is going to be a positive arrangement for<br /> everyone".</p>\n<p>Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of the White<br /> House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and assured members of the press<br /> that changes will be "minimal". The United States will be managed as a<br /> wholly owned division of Microsoft. An initial public offering is planned<br /> for July of next year, and the federal government is expected to be<br /> profitable by "Q4 1999 at latest", according to Microsoft president Steve<br /> Ballmer.</p>\n<p>In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had "willingly and<br /> enthusiastically" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft,<br /> and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting<br /> directly to Bill Gates.

[George W. Bush, John Ash croft, and Kathrine Harris go fishing on the lake by<br /> George W.''s ranch. While speeding across the lake they hit a tree trunk, which<br /> cracks a hole in the bottom of the boat. The boat starts to sink so they look<br /> for life preservers and find only one. George W. Bush says: "I''m the President<br /> selected by the Supreme Court. The people need me to protect the nation from the<br /> new world order and the growth of the new economy and computers and such." John<br /> Ash croft says: "I''m the Attorney General and as the nations'' chief law<br /> enforcement officer I must live so that there will be no fear or panic in the<br /> streets, if you two shall die. And besides I have to outlaw abortion,<br /> affirmative action, campaign finance reform, environmental protection, and same<br /> sex marriages to save the moral fiber of this country." Finally, Kathryn Harris<br /> says: "I''m the Florida Secretary of State and the state Republican Chairwoman,<br /> and I must survive so that I can deliver the votes needed by all the Republican<br /> officials throughout the state, and disenfranchise those minorities who vote for<br /> Democrats, so that Republicans may continue to be elected even though more<br /> people vote for Democrats." And the three of them all agree that each has very<br /> good and moral arguments for the life preserver, so that they decide the only<br /> fair way to decide is by a vote. They cut up three squares of paper and vote by<br /> secret ballot. Then they open the ballots to tally them. The first ballot says<br /> "George W. Bush - one vote," the second ballot says "John Ash croft - one vote",<br /> and the third ballot says "Kathryn Harris - 37 votes."]

[Bush and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all. They sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dogfight. They would have 5 years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side''s dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. </p>\n<p>Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk. After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 " thick and nobody could get near it. </p>\n<p>When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a strange looking animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the Afghanistani dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it''s cage, and slowly waddled over towards Osama''s dog. Osama''s dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged the American Dachshund---but when it got close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed Osama''s dog in one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all. </p>\n<p>Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, "We don''t understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves." </p>\n<p>"That''s nothing,", said Bush. "We had Michael Jackson''s plastic surgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog." </p>\n<p>GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!]

[You lose arguments with inanimate objects. You have to hold onto the lawn to keep from falling off the earth. Your job is interfering with your drinking. Your doctor finds traces of blood in your alchohol stream. Your career won''t progress beyond Senator from Massachusetts. The back of your head keeps getting hit by the toilet seat. You sincerely believe alchohol is the elusive 5th food group. 24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case - coincidence? I think not! Two hands and just one mouth... - now THAT''S a drinking problem! You can focus better with one eye closed. The parking lot seems to have moved while you were in the bar. You fall off the floor... Your twin sons are named Barley and Hops.

[One day in the future, Bill Clinton has a heart attack, dies prematurely --<br /> and goes straight to Hell. The Devil greets him, but says "I don''t know<br /> exactly what to do with you.

I''ll even let you decide who gets to<br /> leave."</p>\n<p>Clinton thought that sounded pretty good, so the Devil opened the first room.<br /> In it was Ted Kennedy and a large pool of water.

I would be in constant agony if<br /> all I could do was break rocks all day," said Bill.</p>\n<p>The devil opened a third door.

Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.</p>\n<p>His eyes widening in disbelief, Clinton grinned as he took in the whole<br /> picture and said, "Oh yea, I know can handle this."</p>\n<p>The Devil nodded and smiled.

[In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com, did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot. And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg.<br /> Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. </p>\n<p>She said unto Abraham, her husband, "Why doth thou travel far from town to town with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?" And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, "How, Dear?" </p>\n<p>And Dot replied, "I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah''s Pony Stable (UPS)." </p>\n<p>Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. The drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. </p>\n<p>A man named Maccabia did secret himself inside Abraham''s drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com''s trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. </p>\n<p>And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would work only with Brother Gates'' drumheads and drumsticks. </p>\n<p>Dot did say, "Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others." And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known "eBay" he said, "we need a name that reflects what we are," and Dot replied, "Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators." </p>\n<p>"YAHOO", said Abraham. And that is how it all began, It wasn''t Al Gore after all.]

[The U.S. warned Iran today that it is in danger of being dropped from the three-nation "Axis of Evil" after a lackluster 2002 in which the purportedly evil country was largely missing in action.</p>\n<p>"When it comes to remaining in the A.O.E., Iran is just hanging by a thread," one State Department source said today. </p>\n<p>While North Korea and Iraq were both front and center in 2002 with their headline-grabbing evildoing, Iran for the most part stayed on the sidelines, jeopardizing its evil status, the source said. </p>\n<p>Remaining in the Axis of Evil is a high priority for Iran, since membership in the A.O.E. results in billions of dollars of free publicity and news coverage every year.</p>\n<p>Partly for this reason, the head of Iran�酶惟s Ministry of Evil in Tehran today disputed the State Department�酶惟s assessment of its less-than-evil performance, arguing that his nation had done many evil things in 2002. </p>\n<p>Evil Minister Farid Mesghali said that Iran�酶惟s links to terrorist groups, as well as its firing up of its nuclear facility in southern Bushehr, had gone largely unnoticed and were overshadowed by such stories as the Trent Lott controversy and the Winona Ryder shoplifting trial.</p>\n<p>"We were really, really evil last year," Mr. Mesghali said. "We just need to do a better job of getting the word out."</p>\n<p>But time may be running out for Iran, who faces expulsion from the A.O.E. if they do not "strut their stuff, evil-wise, pretty darn soon," the State Department source said.</p>\n<p>"Without evil, Iran�酶惟s got no juice at all," the source said. "They might as well be Belgium."]

Who said "Give me Liberty, or give me death?"<br /> She saw only a sea of blank faces, except for that of Toshiba, who had his<br /> hand up. "Patrick Henry, 1775," said the boy.<br /> "Now," said the teacher, "who said ''Government of the people, by the people,<br /> for the people shall not perish from the earth?"<br /> Again, no response except from Toshiba: "Abraham Lincoln, 1863."<br /> The teacher snapped at the class, "You should be ashamed. Toshiba, who is new<br /> to our country, knows more about it than you do."<br /> As she turned to write something on the blackboard, she heard a loud whisper:<br /> "Damned Japanese."<br /> "Who said that?" she demanded.<br /> Toshiba put his hand up. "Lee Iacocca, 1982," he said.<br /> At that point, feeling completely disgusted by Toshiba''s classroom<br /> superiority, a student in the back sighed, "I''m gonna throw up."<br /> Teacher says "Who said that?".<br /> Again, Toshiba raises his hand and says "George Bush to Japanese Prime<br /> Minister, 1991."<br /> Now furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah?

The Bible:    And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken,    ''''Thou shalt cross the road.'''' And the chicken crossed the road, and  there  was much rejoicing.

[A blonde buys two horses and she can''t tell them apart. So she asks the farmer next door what to do. He says to cut one of their tails off. So she does. But then the other horse''s tail gets caught in a bush and rips off. So she can''t tell them apart again. She asks the farmer for advice a second time. He tells her to cut one of the horses ears. So she does. But then the other horse gets its ear ripped in a barbed wire fence. She is still confused. She asks the farmer what to do. He tells her to measure them.

[So Why Did the Chicken Cross the Road? </p>\n<p>GEORGE W BUSH </p>\n<p>We don''t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. Our side of the road is the right side of the road and the chicken is either against us or for us. There is no middle ground for any chicken. </p>\n<p>COLIN POWELL </p>\n<p>Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road. </p>\n<p>DONALD RUMSFELD </p>\n<p>I have known about the chicken crossing the road for several months. I was investigating why the chicken moved but didn''t feel it was necessary to alert anyone. </p>\n<p>HANS BLIX </p>\n<p>We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road. </p>\n<p>JOHN KERRY </p>\n<p>Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road I am now against it! </p>\n<p>RALPH NADER </p>\n<p>The chicken''s habitat on the other side of the road had been polluted by unchecked industrial greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV. </p>\n<p>PAT BUCHANAN </p>\n<p>To steal the job of a decent, hard-working American. </p>\n<p>RUSH LIMBAUGH </p>\n<p>I don''t know why the chicken crossed the road, but I''ll bet it was getting a government grant to cross the road, and I''ll bet that somebody out there is already forming a support group to help chickens with crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars. And when I say tax dollars, I''m talking about your money, money the government took from you to build road for chickens to cross. </p>\n<p>MARTHA STEWART </p>\n<p>No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer''s Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any inside information. </p>\n<p>DR SEUSS </p>\n<p>Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I''ve not been told. </p>\n<p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY </p>\n<p>To die in the rain. Alone. </p>\n<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR </p>\n<p>I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question. </p>\n<p>GRANDPA </p>\n<p>In my day, we didn''t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough. </p>\n<p>BARBARA WALTERS </p>\n<p>Isn''t that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road. </p>\n<p>JOHN LENNON </p>\n<p>Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together -- in peace. </p>\n<p>ARISTOTLE </p>\n<p>It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. </p>\n<p>KARL MARX </p>\n<p>It was a historic inevitability. </p>\n<p>CAPTAIN KIRK </p>\n<p>To boldly go where no chicken has ever gone before. </p>\n<p>SIGMOND FREUD </p>\n<p>The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. </p>\n<p>BILL GATES </p>\n<p>I have just witnessed eChicken2004, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook... and Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken. </p>\n<p>ALBERT EINSTEIN </p>\n<p>Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken? </p>\n<p>BILL CLINTON </p>\n<p>I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.

Not until the final episode would he reveal the truth -- that he has been driven from power and doesn''t have a single weapon of mass destruction to his name." </p>\n<p>Pro Wrestling: If World Wrestling Entertainment needs a new bad guy, he''s the perfect candidate: Saddam Insane. </p>\n<p>"The Real World: Las Vegas": Is there room for one more stranger in the infamous hot tub? </p>\n<p>He could become O.J.

Since it was a secluded spot, they left all their clothes on a big log, ran down the beach to the lake and jumped in the water for a long, refreshing swim.

"No, because the ball fell on a<br /> big rock, bounced over the sand trap, rolled onto the green, and<br /> stopped about six inches from the hole." The two nuns were<br /> silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed and said, "You<br /> missed the fucking putt, didn''t you?"]

[Tigers really are as big and poofy and soft as they look, and they purr like a<br /> freight train going by. You find this out by taking one for a walk. To take a<br /> tiger for a walk, you first need a tiger. Tigers fresh from the bush are not<br /> recommended for the inexperienced. What you need is one who''s used to the<br /> procedure. He or she is thus liable to be merely playful, rather than actively<br /> irritated. You also need a friend, whom you really, really trust. The friend<br /> carries an apple wood cane; apple, or some other wood, which will bend under<br /> stress rather than shattering. This, friend, is your backup, and the cane is his<br /> or her only tool for everything, from knocking stuff out of the way that the<br /> tiger is liable to eat, to crowd control, to hooking on and madly hanging on if<br /> things go wrong.</p>\n<p>What YOU carry is a ten-foot length of pass-link chain. This is your leash.</p>\n<p>Pass-link chain is the stuff where the links will fit through each other. This<br /> is important. You need this so you can hook on a safety clip. The chain is<br /> looped about the tiger''s neck and acks as a giant choke chain, but the clip is<br /> there to keep a loop of some sort in case things go badly wrong. You carry the<br /> chain looped in one hand in a peculiar fashion, which permits the whole length<br /> of chain to be dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with<br /> it. You practice this beforehand till you''re sure you''ve got it right.</p>\n<p>Then you go into the cage with the tiger. Your friend does not. You gauge the<br /> tiger''s mood and put the leash on the tiger. There isn''t a whole lot more to say<br /> about this step except to say that that is why your friend is there, outside the<br /> cage. On your side is the fact that the tiger knows what the leash is for by<br /> this time and presumably is largely in favor of the idea.</p>\n<p>This is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy. They are also much,<br /> much larger than you had ever dreamed, when you''re standing next to one.</p>\n<p>Then you take the tiger for a walk. Your friend walks in front with the cane<br /> to clear the way. You walk with the tiger at your side, keeping pretty good<br /> control and letting the tiger know that you are Paying Attention, because if the<br /> tiger thinks you are not Paying Attention, it will do what housecats do, let you<br /> know that you should be Paying Attention. Unlike housecats, the tiger is big<br /> enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the situation.<br /> Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your legs out from under you<br /> is generally considered good enough by most tigers. They think this is<br /> hilarious. To this extent, tigers differ from housecats in that they seem to<br /> have a sense of humor.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants. In this case,<br /> the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to stop it. Wrapping the<br /> chain around something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away, generally<br /> does this. This will slow it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you<br /> and grab the chain as you go bulleting across the countryside. The weight of two<br /> adult humans will generally slow a tiger down enough to make things manageable,<br /> whereas one will not.</p>\n<p>It is not usual for the tiger to react to freedom by turning around and<br /> turning you into fajitas, though this would actually (at least in the short<br /> term) be an eminently practical thing for the tiger to do. They enjoy their fun<br /> but are generally not ill tempered. If they are they don''t get taken for walks.</p>\n<p>They also purr like a freight train passing. Experts in the field claim that<br /> this is not purring, that it means something else, but you couldn''t put it by<br /> me. Sure sounded like purring, at 16-2/3 RPM, but it sounded like purring.</p>\n<p>All in all, an experience I highly recommend as a lifetime source of cocktail<br /> party conversation, but it sort of tends to leave you limp for the rest of the<br /> day.]
[Looking for savings this holiday season? When you''re out shopping, take<br /> advantage of the George W. Bush discount. You will need unmitigated gall and<br /> several accomplices. Here''s how it works. </p>\n<p>Load up with all sorts of items that you want and take them to the checkout.<br /> When the clerk gets to an item that will not scan on the first attempt say,<br /> petulantly, "My brother says that all these items are mine." The clerk will<br /> insist on rescanning the item. Look bored and incredulous that anybody could be<br /> so incompetent as the clerk tries unsuccessfully to scan the item. Turn to the<br /> people in line behind you and say, "Can you believe this is taking so long?" </p>\n<p>At this point, the clerk will attempt to enter the bar code information by<br /> hand. Insist loudly that the item is yours and that since it didn''t scan after<br /> two attempts, it must be free. Get so worked up that your face starts to break<br /> out. The clerk will still attempt to enter the bar code. At this point, bring<br /> forward your first accomplice who will introduce herself as the Secretary of Bar<br /> Code Scanning and say to the clerk, "I''ll give you two seconds to enter that bar<br /> code. Ready... Set... Times up!" </p>\n<p>The clerk will probably call for the manager, and the two of them will insist<br /> on manually entering the bar code into the cash register. Have dozens of your<br /> accomplices run to the media talking about possible mistakes and mischief that<br /> could arise from manually entering the bar code. Raise questions such as, "How<br /> can I make sure the price is being entered fairly when the clerk works for the<br /> owner?" Say, "These items have been scanned and rescanned. They just want to<br /> keep entering bar codes until they get the total they want." </p>\n<p>At this point, the owner might try to take you to court to get some more time<br /> to manually enter the bar code. He''s really playing right into your hands. </p>\n<p>While he''s getting a time extension from the court, call the office of<br /> Congressman Tom DELAY and ask him to send down a couple of henchmen to lead a<br /> crowd of angry demonstrators into the store to shout and bang on the doors. </p>\n<p>Simultaneously, file an appeal with the Supreme Court asking the highest court<br /> in the land to bring a halt to all manual entry of bar codes. </p>\n<p>In the midst of this confusion, have your first accomplice declare that all<br /> the items are legally yours and that if the owner doesn''t like it, he can take<br /> you to court. The owner will now have to drive to the state capital to file a<br /> lawsuit in which he will ask the judge to manually enter the bar code of the<br /> item that would not scan. Invite some celebrities over for a photo op and<br /> announce that you''ll share the items with them once the items are found to be<br /> rightfully yours. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile in court, the owner will ask the judge to transfer the item from the<br /> checkout line to the courtroom. Have your lawyer tell the judge that that is<br /> simply not enough, that the judge needs to move the entire inventory from the<br /> store lock, stock and barrel to his courtroom. </p>\n<p>When the owner contemplates that this will tie up all his merchandise till<br /> well after the holidays, he will surely give up. But just to be safe, have the<br /> legislature pass a law giving the entire store to you. </p>\n<p>Some people will tell you that you won''t enjoy the goodies you''ve thus<br /> obtained because they are not really yours.]

[LONDON (AP) -- Saucy? The British? Yes, and keeping well abreast of the latest science, judging by a new exhibition of -- er -- underwear at London''s Design Museum. Here, the nation famed for its reserve has raised its hem, offering a peep at sheepskin corsets, barely-there cashmere vests and a glow-in-the-dark bra.Should all the titillation prove too much, there''s also a bra that detects a racing heartbeat and a pair of panties that protects against radiation. ``This exhibit is a compelling statement about British design -- but it''s also quite saucy,'''' said Dame Helena Kennedy, a leading lawyer and chairwoman of the British Council, which launched the show Wednesday.``The perception of British people as being strait-laced is no longer real,'''' Kennedy said. To prove it, the displays are almost as provocative as the garments. Vivienne Westwood''s blue sheepskin corset and ditzy, star-patterned mini-crinoline and Alexander McQueen''s pink satin corset crusted with black Swarovski crystal are suspended inside giant inflatable women''s legs in transparent plastic. Vacuum-packed thongs and Clements Ribeiro''s red silk chiffon panties with polka dots hang from pegs on a washline. Near the entrance, a mannequin sprawls seductively on her back, a vision in pink fishnet stockings and the briefest green teddy and panties by the aptly named Agent Provocateur.And everywhere there are bras to make even 1950s ``sweater girl'''' Lana Turner envious -- from Gossard''s new padded Ultrabra Super Boost in patriotic red-white-and-blue, to Stella McCartney''s tassels and gray beads, to Agent Provocateur''s sliced-away style in sheer black net.For the traditionally minded, there are the more substantial constructions of Rigby and Peller (they put the foundation in foundation garments), suppliers of spine-stiffening unmentionables to the royal family since the 1960s. Owner June Kenton, personal bra fitter to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Mother Elizabeth, believes 80 percent of all women are wearing the wrong size bra ``and have two drawers-full of bras that they don''t wear.''''Rigby and Peller''s offerings contrast with the futuristic Techno Bra, made of conductive textile with silicon gel inserts that contain electronic devices to detect heartbeat changes. A British industrial design company is developing the piece for the commercial market and designer Kirsty Falconer hopes it may one day incorporate a personal alarm that will sound if the wearer is attacked. Constructed in a dun-colored conductive nylon and silver fabric, the anti-radiation panties are no thing of beauty. But if, as their makers claim, they drain electricity from the body -- thereby protecting it from magnetic radiation -- can you afford to be without them? The exhibition runs through July 2, then tours Japan and Australia.]

[A Press Release -</p>\n<p>WASHINGTON D.C. The House Appropriations subcommittee on NASA oversight, in another effort to reduce the NASA budget, passed a resolution today to downsize the solar system. According to an unnamed congressional staffer, House Republicans felt there has been "too much redundancy in the solar system" and that streamlining the 4.5 billion year old planetary system is long overdue. Such action would give NASA fewer places to go and this would allow the agency to carry out its space exploration goals within the funding profile that the House proposed earlier this summer.</p>\n<p>"Look, we have three terrestrial planets" said Congressman Rip U. Apart (R, Del.), "and only one of them really works! So why not get rid of the other two and clean up the neighborhood?" Most subcommittee members felt that while downsizing was definitely in the cards, eliminating both Mars and Venus was going too far. "We have too many international commitments to Mars." said Rush N. Hater (R, Calif.). "So I think we should keep Mars and dump Venus. Its too hot to live on, and liberal Democrats keep using it as an example of what global warming can do. So from a political and practical point of view, Venus has got to go."</p>\n<p>Also at risk is the planet Mercury which lacks support because of its small size and poor visibility from Earth. "Who needs it?" asked Congressman Newt Onian (R, N.C.). "Have you ever seen it? I haven''t. So what good is it? We just don''t need useless planets. And speaking of useless planets, what about the asteroids? If you''ve seen one, you''ve seen them all. So I say we ought to get rid of the little boogers once and for all."</p>\n<p>However, the downsizing recommendations do not stop with the terrestrial planets. The resolution also calls for a reduction in the number of gas giants which contain most of the planetary mass in the solar system. Most subcommittee members favor retaining Jupiter and Saturn, and eliminating Uranus and Neptune. "Jupiter employs the most molecules, and Saturn has those pretty little rings everyone likes." said Rep. Con Mann (R, Fla.). "On the other hand, Uranus is a bore and its rings are dirty. And Neptune, for God''s sake, is just too far away. So begone with those ugly bruisers."</p>\n<p>But the influential Wright I.M. Fornow from South Carolina has publicly announced he will fight to eliminate Saturn. Fornow is especially miffed by NASA''s success thus far in keeping Cassini, the next mission to Saturn, alive which he feels is waste of taxpayers money. "If there ain''t no Saturn, then there ain''t no Cassini" he exclaimed. The congressman also expressed concern about sending back-to-back spacecraft bearing Italian surnames to the outer planets (The Galileo spacecraft arrives at Jupiter this December).</p>\n<p>The subcommittee was unanimous in its views towards Pluto which they deemed a moral misfit. "Now here''s a planet we can definitely do without." continued Fornow. "A few years ago, it was farthest from the sun. Now its not. Its just too confusing. And now they tell me its really two planets instead of one. What the hell is going on here?"</p>\n<p>The resolution must now be presented to the entire House, where it is expected to pass easily since only a minority of Representatives have constituents on the affected planets. NASA Administrator Golden has vowed to resist any further reductions to the solar system, saying that "NASA has expended considerable effort to make the planets cheaper, faster, and better. Much of this work would be wasted if the solar system were downsized" stated Golden.</p>\n<p>Critics say, however, that reducing the number of planets will not produce the expected savings to taxpayers. Textbooks, they note, would have to be revised to reflect the new arrangement, and facilities would need to be constructed to remove the planets themselves. The resolution is also likely to draw strong opposition from religious fundamentalists who have long opposed the elimination of any of the biblical planets. Thus, the matter is far from resolved.]

"What bad things did you do on earth?" </p>\n<p>Clinton thought a bit and answered, "Well, I smoked marijuana, but you shouldn''t hold that against me because I didn''t inhale. I guess I had extramarital sex, but you shouldn''t hold that against me because I didn''t really have sexual relations.

[While visiting England recently, George W. Bush was invited to have tea with the Queen.</p>\n<p>Given his recent political problems, he decides to take advantage of her years of leadership experience and asks her for her advice. She responds that she surrounds herself with the most intelligent people she can find and lets them do their jobs.</p>\n<p>Intrigued with this novel theory, Bush asks her how she is able to tell if the people are intelligent.</p>\n<p>"I do so by asking them a test question" responds the Queen. "Allow me to demonstrate."</p>\n<p>The Queen then dials 10 Downing Street and asks to speak to Tony Blair. "Mr. Prime Minister, please answer a hypothetical question for me."</p>\n<p>"I''ll do my best, Your Majesty" responds Blair.</p>\n<p>"Your mother has a child and your father has a child" says the Queen. "The child is not your brother or your sister. Who is the child?"</p>\n<p>Tony Blair hesitates momentarily and then confidently replies, "Well, Your Majesty, I guess it would have to be me."</p>\n<p>"Correct" says the Queen. "Thank you and good day to you Sir."</p>\n<p>The Queen hangs up and says "Did you hear that Mr. Bush? See how clever he is."</p>\n<p>Impressed, Bush replies "I certainly did. I''ll definitely be using that one when I conduct my next Cabinet shuffle back in the US."</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Washington, Bush decides he''d better put some of his senior Cabinet Members to the test. He summons Dick Cheney to his office and says, "Dick, I wonder if you could answer a question for me?"</p>\n<p>"Why of course Sir" Cheney responds unenthusiastically, annoyed that the President was again seeking his input on something.</p>\n<p>"Well, uh, let''s say your mother has a child and your father too has a child. This child is not your brother and also is not your sister. Who is it?"</p>\n<p>Somewhat surprised at this odd question, Cheney hems and haws and finally asks if he can have some time to think about it.</p>\n<p>"Certainly" responds Bush.</p>\n<p>Cheney immediately calls a meeting of other senior Republicans and they puzzle over the question for several hours. Totally baffled, they decide to conduct some research and contact a loyal Washington consulting firm. A budget of $10 million is provided and intensive research is carried out over the next two weeks. Unfortunately, the consultants are unable to come up with an answer.</p>\n<p>Desperate to prove that he is smarter than George, Cheney decides to take a chance and calls Al Gore.</p>\n<p>"I realize you are just an Tennessee redneck and are not all that wise in the ways of the world, but maybe you can help me out with a problem I have.</p>\n<p>Gore is naturally skeptical about Republican promises, but in the spirit of political co-operation he agrees to do what he can to help out.</p>\n<p>"O.K., here goes" says Cheney. "Your mother has a child and your father has a child. The child is not your brother or your sister. Who is the child?"</p>\n<p>Without hesitating, Gore responds "It would be me, of course."</p>\n<p>Impressed at the his quick response, Cheney quickly brushes off Gore and rushes to the President''s office (where he is watching football and eating snack foods under the careful observation of the Secret Service on the lookout for choking).</p>\n<p>" I know the answer to your question, you Idiot!! I know who the child is!!"</p>\n<p>Bush, who was privately becoming a bit concerned at the delay in hearing back from Cheney, is delighted (when he finally remembers what it was that he asked). "Who is it Dick?" he asks.</p>\n<p>With obvious pride, Cheney replies "It''s Al Gore, George - its Al Gore!!"</p>\n<p>Stunned, Bush shouts in disgust, "Wrong you idiot - it''s Tony Blair!!"]

He begins to trot toward the Bay, looking around to see that the rats now number in the MILLIONS, and are squealing and coming toward him faster and faster. Concerned, even scared, he runs to the edge of the Bay, and throws the bronze rat as far out into the water as he can.  Amazingly, the millions of rats all jump into the Bay after it, and are all drowned.

[(Be read when using the Willy voice in your head)</p>\n<p>SUBJ: Clinton''s Address to the Nation</p>\n<p>Text from Clinton''s Address to the Nation if he were on truth serum.<br /> 10.16 P.m. ET (0216 GMT) August 17, 1998</p>\n<p>Good evening.</p>\n<p>This afternoon in this room, from this chair, in this very spot, I was forced to testify before the Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury.</p>\n<p>I answered their questions truthfully whenever there was compelling physical evidence that would contradict my lies, including questions about having sex while watching an intern do kinky things that I now spin as being part of my private life, questions so embarrassing that no American citizen would ever want to answer.</p>\n<p>Still, the polls indicate that I must take complete responsibility for all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you tonight and not ducking questions while the Marine Band plays loudly and drowns out the media.</p>\n<p>As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While I, a compulsive liar, deemed my answers legally accurate, I was not stupid enough to volunteer any information that might help prove what I did to Paula.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, since I got caught, I can see it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part to destroy all evidence linking me to the events, for which I am solely and completely responsible, but for which I refuse to apologize.</p>\n<p>But I told the grand jury today, and I say to you now, that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence, or to take any other unlawful action. I was a lawyer before becoming your President and I know better than to do these things. I have less important people to do these things whenever I indicate that I would like to see something go away.</p>\n<p>I know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression, and that is what I intended. How could I know this thing would spin out of control or that my spin doctors would be too worn out from the plethora of scandals to be effective.</p>\n<p>I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that, because Hillary is a better lawyer and will clean me out in any divorce settlement.</p>\n<p>I regret misleading my friends because most of them have evidence of other wrongdoing that may hurt me.</p>\n<p>I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. I was also very concerned about protecting myself from my family.</p>\n<p>The fact that these questions were being asked in a politically inspired lawsuit about my tendency to expose my private parts to women, which my lies and obstruction of justice has since caused to be dismissed, was a consideration, too. I could not allow the truth to be known until after the statute of limitations expires.</p>\n<p>In addition, I had real and serious concerns about an independent counsel investigation that began with private business dealings 20 years ago. Dealings, I might add, about which an independent federal agency, staffed with my political appointees and friends, found none of the evidence of wrongdoing by me, or my wife, over two years ago.</p>\n<p>The independent counsel investigation has enough evidence of wrongdoing on my part to move on to my staff and friends, now into my private life with interns in the oval office. And now the investigation itself is under investigation, because my very large staff of lawyers found a gullible judge who is stupid enough to help me by requiring the independent counsel to prove he didn''t leak the things that we leaked.</p>\n<p>This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people, and is getting much to close to the evidence I have worked so hard to conceal. I call upon all of my friends in the sympathetic media to join with me in stopping this out-of-control situation before they get enough evidence to impeach me.</p>\n<p>Now, this matter is among me, the two people I love most -- my wife and our daughter -- and our God. I must put it right, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so. Even the bombing of terrorist camps that we have known about for ten years.</p>\n<p>Nothing is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim my family life for my family. It''s nobody''s business but ours, and the focus groups indicated that there were enough stupid people to believe this nonsense.</p>\n<p>Even presidents have private lives with interns in the oval office. It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into my sex addiction and get on with our national life.</p>\n<p>My stonewalling and lying has caused this country to be distracted by this matter for too long, and I take my responsibility for my part in all of this, even though I did it because of Ken Starr. That is all I can get away with.</p>\n<p>Now it is time -- in fact, it is past time -- to move on. We have important work to do -- new women to seduce, new interns to chase, and real terrorist camps to bomb.</p>\n<p>And so tonight, I ask you to turn away from the spectacle I have created for the past seven months by lying to the American People, to repair the fabric of our national discourse, to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next American century, and to help me shut down the independent counsel before he closes the trap on me in such a manner that I can no longer lie my way out of this mess.</p>\n<p>Thank you for watching and good night.]

[It was getting a little crowded in heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. </p>\n<p>The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have a real bummer of a day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.</p>\n<p>The next day at 12:01, the first person comes to the gates of heaven. </p>\n<p>The angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly says to the man,<br /> ''Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died.''</p>\n<p>''No problem,'' the man says. ''I came home to my 25th floor apartment in my lunch hour and caught my wife half-naked and appearing to be having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. I immediately began searching for him. My wife was yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. Just as I was about to give<br /> up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of that guy!</p>\n<p>''Well, I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But wouldn''t you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn''t die. This ticked me off even more. In a rage, I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him. Oddly enough, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony, and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 storeys and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.''</p>\n<p>The angel sits back and thinks for a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day. It was a crime of passion. So, the angel announces,<br /> ''OK sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,'' and lets him in. </p>\n<p>A few seconds later the next guy comes up. </p>\n<p>''Before I can let you in, I need to hear about what your day was like when you died.''</p>\n<p>The man says, ''No problem. But you''re not going to believe this. I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side!</p>\n<p>''Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, starts cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom that broke my fall so I didn''t die right away. As I''m laying there face up on the ground, unable to move, and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator of all things off the balcony. It falls the 25 floors and lands on top of me, killing me instantly.''</p>\n<p>The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. </p>\n<p>''I could get used to this new policy,'' he thinks to himself. ''Very well,'' the angel announces, ''welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,'' and he lets the man enter.</p>\n<p>A few seconds later, a third man comes up to the gate.

[EUREKA! The Discovery that political conservatism is determined by the genes opens a window on a brighter tomorrow. (After all, who would actually choose to be Republican?)                     By Daniel MendelsohnThe startling discovery that affiliation with the Republican Party is genetically determined, announced by scientists in the current issue of the journal Nurture, threatens to overshadow the announcement by scientists that there might be a gene for homosexuality in men. Reports of the gene that codes for political conservatism, discovered after a long study of quintuplets in Orange County, Calif., has sent shock waves through the medical, political and golfing communities. Psychologists and psychoanalysts have long believed that Republicans'' unnatural and frequently unconstitutional tendencies result from unhealthy family life -- a remarkable high percentage of Republicans had authoritarian, domineering fathers and emotionally distant mothers who didn''t teach them how to be kind and gentle. But biologists have long suspected that conservatism in inherited. "After all," said on author of the Nurture article, "it''s quite common for a Republican to have a brother or sister who is a Republican." The finding has been greeted with relief by parents and friends of Republicans, who have tended to blame themselves for the political views of otherwise lovable people -- their children, friends and unindicted co-conspirators. One mother, a long time Democrat, clasped her hands in ecstasy on hearing of the findings: "I just knew it was genetic," she said, seated beside her two sons, both avowed Republicans. "I just knew nobody would actually choose that lifestyle!" When asked what the Republican lifestyle was, she said, "Well, you can just tell from watching TV, like at the convention in Houston: the loud outfits, the flaming xenophobia, the flamboyant demagogy -- you know." Both sons said they had suspected their Republicanism from an early age but did not confirm it until they were in college, when they became convinced it wasn''t just a phase they were going through. Despite the near certainty of the medical community about Republicanism''s genetic origins, troubling issues remain. The Nurture article offered no response to the suggestion that the startling high incidence of Republicanism among siblings could result from the fact that they hare not only genes but also psychological and emotional attitudes, being the products of the same parents and family dynamics. And it remains to be explained why so many avowed Democrats are known to vote Republican occasionally -- or at least to fantasize about doing so. Polls show that three out of five adult Democrats admit to having had a Republican experience. In well-adjusted people, however, this experimentation rarely outlasts adolescence. Surprisingly, some Republican activists hail the findings as a step forward rather that as an invitation to more conservophobia. They agree than since Republicans didn''t "choose" their unwholesome lifestyle any more that someone "chooses" to have a ski-jump nose, they shouldn''t be denied civil rights to which normal people are entitled. Other Republicans, recalling 19th century studies that "proved" the mental inferiority of blacks, find the frenzied search for the biological cause of Republicanism pointless, if not downright sinister. But for most real Americans, the discovery opens a window on a brighter tomorrow. In a few years, gene therapy could eradicate Republicanism altogether. If conservatism is not the result of sheer orneriness (as many suspect) but is something Republicans can''t help and probably even don''t like, there''s no reason why we shouldn''t tolerate Republicans in the military or even high elected office -- provided they don''t flaunt their political beliefs.]

[ADVICE FROM THE ANCIENTS.....   Bill Clinton went jogging one morning  last week to clear his head and think  about his troubles.  He came upon the  Washington monument and paused. Looking up he said,  ''George, what should I do?''   After a few seconds George replied,   ''Abolish the IRS and start over.''   Bill thought about this for a  few seconds and continued jogging. Shortly he came upon the Jefferson  Memorial and stopped. He said  ''Tom,  what should I do?''   After a few seconds Tom replied,   ''Abolish welfare and start over.''   Bill continued jogging after thinking  about this and came upon the Lincoln  Memorial. He said,  ''Abe, what should  I do?''   After a few seconds Abe replied ''Why  don''t you take the night off and go to  the theater?'']

[It is with deep regret, hesitation and contrition that I, the President of the United States of America offer apology to the Chinese Nation and its peoples. I apologize for the heinous act performed by our large, sluggish, propeller driven airplane when it got in the way of your highly maneuverable, supersonic, technologically superior jet aircraft. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, I sincerely regret the fact that by flying in international airspace, we afforded your highly competent pilot the opportunity to fly his aircraft into our own, causing him to spiral to his death into the ocean. We regret the choice made by said pilot when he used deficient judgment in electing to attempt aerial intimidation upon our slower moving, unarmed surveillance vehicle. </p>\n<p>This situation brings to mind a similar episode when I was in grade school and my face got in the way of a schoolyard bully''s fist. He broke a bone in his hand and I felt compelled to apologize for that incident as I do for this one. </p>\n<p>Let me summarize by stating that it is our sincere hope that you accept this heartfelt apology for the actions committed by your pilot. We are sorry that we got in the way. </p>\n<p>We are sorry that we had to leave international airspace and land in Chinese Territory. We are sorry that you were forced to provide food and housing for our military personnel. Most of all we are sorry that you have in your possession, some of our most technically advanced surveillance equipment on the planet. </p>\n<p>I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive us. I hope that you will soon be compelled to release our men and our property because, I really don''t want to have to apologize again when we have to kick your ass. </p>\n<p>Sincerely, </p>\n<p>George W.

[Tigers really are as big and poofy and soft as they look, and they purr like a freight train going by. You find this out by taking one for a walk. To take a tiger for a walk, you first need a tiger. Tigers fresh from the bush are not recommended for the inexperienced. What you need is one who''s used to the procedure. He or she is thus liable to be merely playful, rather than actively irritated. You also need a friend, whom you really, really trust. The friend carries an apple wood cane; apple, or some other wood which will bend under stress rather than shattering. This, friend, is your backup, and the cane is his or her only tool for everything, from knocking stuff out of the way that the tiger is liable to eat, to crowd control, to hooking on and madly hanging on if things go wrong.</p>\n<p>What YOU carry is a ten foot length of pass-link chain. This is your leash.</p>\n<p>Pass-link chain is the stuff where the links will fit through each other. This is important. You need this so you can hook on a safety clip. The chain is looped about the tiger''s neck and acks as a giant choke-chain, but the clip is there to keep a loop of some sort in case things go badly wrong. You carry the chain looped in one hand in a peculiar fashion which permits the whole length of chain to be dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with it. You practice this beforehand till you''re sure you''ve got it right.</p>\n<p>Then you go into the cage with the tiger. Your friend does not. You gauge the tiger''s mood and put the leash on the tiger. There isn''t a whole lot more to say about this step except to say that that is why your friend is there, OUTside the cage. On your side is the fact that the tiger knows what the leash is for by this time and presumably is largely in favor of the idea.</p>\n<p>This is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy. They are also much, much larger than you had ever dreamed, when you''re standing next to one.</p>\n<p>Then you take the tiger for a walk. Your friend walks in front with the cane to clear the way. You walk with the tiger at your side, keeping pretty good control and letting the tiger know that you are Paying Attention, because if the tiger thinks you are not Paying Attention, it will do what housecats do, let you know that you should be Paying Attention. Unlike housecats, the tiger is big enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the situation. Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your legs out from under you is generally considered good enough by most tigers. They think this is hilarious. To this extent, tigers differ from housecats in that they seem to have a sense of humor.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants. In this case, the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to stop it. This is generally done by wrapping the chain around something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away. This will slow it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you and grab the chain as you go bulleting across the countryside. The weight of two adult humans will generally slow a tiger down enough to make things manageable, whereas one will not.</p>\n<p>It is not usual for the tiger to react to freedom by turning around and turning you into fajitas, though this would actually (at least in the short term) be an eminently practical thing for the tiger to do. They enjoy their fun but are generally not ill-tempered. If they are they don''t get taken for walks.</p>\n<p>They also purr like a freight train passing. Experts in the field claim that this is not purring, that it means something else, but you couldn''t put it by me. Sure sounded like purring, at 16-2/3 RPM, but it sounded like purring.</p>\n<p>All in all, an experience I highly recommend as a lifetime source of cocktail party conversation, but it sort of tends to leave you limp for the rest of the day.]

[Things came to a head last week and the name Monica Lewinsky is fast<br /> becoming a real mouthful at the White House. The latest news about<br /> President Clinton is definitely hard to swallow and seems certain to<br /> leave a nasty taste in the mouth of the current administration. It<br /> will be some time before all the stains resulting from this issue are<br /> removed from the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>Monica Lewinsky has proved to be not as tight lipped as Clinton had<br /> hoped and is expected to spit out the truth to a Grand Jury tomorrow.<br /> She will surely go down in history for her orations concerning the<br /> comings and goings behind the doors of the Oval Office. Monica was<br /> apparently on her knees when she received the recent gagging order<br /> from the White House and now has to decide whether to swallow her pride<br /> and dispose of the evidence, or to succumb to the deep throated<br /> rumblings of the Washington Press Corp. and spill the issue wide open.</p>\n<p>Any attempt by Lewinsky to suck up to Clinton can only be construed as<br /> lip service and Clinton would be advised to try and minimize the<br /> impact of this, the latest in a long series of blows he has received<br /> since coming to power. Despite this latest blow, job security for the<br /> President seems to be assured, as he can rely on his proven oral<br /> skills to promote a career in public speaking, being, as he has often<br /> shown, a cunning linguist. (Although Hillary Clinton may disagree with<br /> this, as she claims she is rarely on the end of a tongue lashing from<br /> Bill!)</p>\n<p>Miss Lewinsky is from a naval background and her choice of Bill<br /> Clinton as a lover is somewhat surprising, given her preference for<br /> seamen. According to her lawyer, Miss Lewinsky likes to see men in<br /> power and relished the thought of taking a length of time to chew things<br /> over with the President, whenever she could fit him in. And the<br /> President was equally keen to see Miss Lewinsky, always putting on a<br /> spurt when he entered her office.</p>\n<p>Miss Leweinsky has apparently been offered a PR job by Listerine, who<br /> described her as spunky enough for any job. Her name has also been<br /> associated with Big Gulp soda advertising and Kleenex.]

Saddam ducks, but nothing happens. George snickers. A few seconds later<br /> he presses the second button. Saddam jumps up, but again nothing happens. Bush<br /> roars with laughter.

[And the Lord spoke to Noah and said: "In six months I''m going to make it rain until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people are destroyed. But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind ofliving thing on the planet. I am ordering you to build Me an Ark."</p>\n<p>And in a flash of lightning he delivered the specifications for an Ark. "OK," said Noah, trembling in fear and fumbling with the blueprints. "Six months, and it starts to rain," thundered the Lord. "You''d better have my Ark completed, or learn how to swim for a very long time." And six months passed. The skies began to cloud up and rain began to fall.</p>\n<p>The Lord saw that Noah was sitting in his front yard, weeping. And there  was no Ark. "Noah," shouted the Lord, "where is my Ark?" A lightning bolt crashed into the ground next to Noah.</p>\n<p>"Lord, please forgive me!" begged Noah. "I did my best. But there were big problems. First I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction project, and your plans didn''t meet code. So I had to hire an engineer to redraw the plans. Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark needed a fire sprinkler system. My neighbors objected, claiming I was violating zoning by building the Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city planning commission.</p>\n<p>Then I had a big problem getting enough wood for the Ark because there was a ban on cutting trees to save the Spotted Owl. I had to convince U.S. Fish and Wildlife that I needed the wood to save the owls. But they wouldn''t let me catch any owls. So no owls.</p>\n<p>Then the carpenters formed a union and went out on strike. I had to negotiate a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board before anyone would pick up a saw or a hammer. Now we have 16 carpenters going on the boat, and still no owls.</p>\n<p>Then I started gathering up animals, and got sued by an animal rights group. They objected to me taking only two of each kind. Just when I got the suit dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn''t complete the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your proposed flood. They didn''t take kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being.</p>\n<p>Then the Army Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the Proposed new flood plain. I sent them a globe.</p>\n<p>Right now I''m still trying to resolve a complaint from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over how many Croatians I''m supposed to hire, the IRS has seized all my assets claiming I''m trying to avoid paying taxes by leaving the country, and I just got a notice from the state about owing some kind of use tax. I really don''t think I can finish your Ark for at least another five years," Noah wailed.</p>\n<p>The sky began to clear. The sun began to shine. A rainbow arched across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled. "You mean you''re not going to destroy the earth?" Noah asked, hopefully.</p>\n<p>"No," said the Lord sadly, "Government already has."]

I got on with small business, because I was one myself. I''m less now.<br /> But I''m also more. We are all less and more. More or less. And I believe we must<br /> match our compassionate hearts to our preservative minds.<br /> I know you would rather be watching TV, and so would I, so I will draw to<br /> confusion. My message is: I will get things done. I will inspire and untie. I<br /> will appeal to people''s better angles. I will prove that politics can be bigger<br /> than you ever thought possible. We will trust the people we serve, and serve the<br /> people we trust.

[Dear Mom and Dad:</p>\n<p>It has been six months since I left for college. I''m sorry I<br /> haven''t written more often and I''m very sorry for my<br /> unthoughtfulness. I''m sure you have been worried about me.</p>\n<p>Let me bring you up to date, but before you read on, please sit<br /> down Ok? Don''t read any further unless you''re sitting down.</p>\n<p>Ok? Good.</p>\n<p>I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the<br /> concussion I got from jumping out of the window of my dormitory<br /> when it caught on fire several months ago, are pretty much<br /> healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital! Mom always<br /> said the girls in our family heal fast.</p>\n<p>In fact, I can almost see normally again and I only get<br /> headaches three times a day now.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump were<br /> witnessed by a gas station attendant who immediately called 911.<br /> He''s so sweet. He even visited me in the hospital, and since I<br /> had nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dorm, he was kind<br /> enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It''s really<br /> a basement room, but it''s kind of cute.</p>\n<p>He really is a good person with a kind heart. We have fallen<br /> deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven''t set<br /> the exact date yet, but I''m sure that it will be before I start<br /> to show. That''s right, Mom and Dad, I''m pregnant! I know how<br /> much you are looking forward to being grandparents, and I know<br /> that you will give that baby the same love, devotion and tender<br /> care you gave me when I was growing up.</p>\n<p>We would get married now, but we both failed our premarital<br /> blood tests because of some minor infection. He told me about it<br /> beforehand, but dumb me, I carelessly caught it anyway. Not to<br /> worry though, the doctor said my daily penicillin injections<br /> should clear it up by next month.</p>\n<p>I know you will welcome him into our family with open arms. He<br /> is kind, and although not well educated, he is ambitious -- just<br /> like Dad!</p>\n<p>Also, he is of a different race and religion than ours, but I<br /> know, after all your years of teaching me tolerance, that you<br /> won''t mind the fact that he is somewhat darker than we are. I''m<br /> sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good<br /> too! I am told that his father is an important gun bearer in his<br /> native African village. That''s an important government position<br /> where he comes from. Well, I guess that''s all! Now you know why<br /> I wanted you to sit down when you read this letter.</p>\n<p>Now that I''ve brought you up to date, I just wanted to let you<br /> know there was no dormitory fire, I didn''t suffer a concussion<br /> or a skull fracture, I wasn''t in the hospital, I''m not pregnant,<br /> I''m not engaged, I don''t have syphilis and there is no boyfriend<br /> of another race or religion in my life; however, I DID vote for<br /> Gov. Bush, and I just wanted you both to see this in its proper<br /> perspective.</p>\n<p>Your loving daughter,</p>\n<p>-Chelsea</p>\n<p>P.S. Stanford is great...

[Members of Congress...people of America....I banged her. </p>\n<p>I banged her like a cheap gong. Which is not news, folks, because if you think Monica Lewinsky was the only skin flute player in my orchestra, you haven''t been paying attention. The only babes in DC I haven''t tried to do are the First Lady, Reno, Albright, and Shalala, mostly because they''re a little older than I like and they have legs that former Houston Oiler Earl Campbell would envy. Which isn''t to say I don''t appreciate Hillary...I do. If not for the ice-water coursing through her veins, I''d be pumping gas into farm equipment in Hope, Arkansas, and she''d be married to the President. </p>\n<p>So, let me set the record straight. I dodged the draft, hid FBI files, smoked dope, flipped Whitewater property, set up a new Korean wing in the White House, fired the travel staff, paid hush money to Hubbell, sold the Lincoln bedroom like an upscale Motel 6, and grabbed every ass that entered the Oval Office. Got it? Good. </p>\n<p>Six years ago, there''s not a man, woman, or child who didn''t know I was as horny as Woody Allen. But, you elected me anyway, which turned out to be a good move on your part. Your other choice was Bush, an aging baseball player and part-time resident of some place called "Kennebunkport." Before him, it was Reagan, who left the office with the same Alzheimer''s he came in with. There was Carter before him who brought you a 17% prime interest rate, smiling the whole time like his lithium drip had just kicked in. Nixon before that coined, but never really understood, the concept of ''plausible deniability,'' and almost got a one-way ticket to San Clemente for his crackerjack style of governing. Johnson was an inbred, power-mad war criminal whose major contribution to American society was Agent Orange. And Johnny Kennedy, who was more than a little naughty himself, didn''t hang around long enough for America to spot that curious atavistic tic for beaver-wrestling shared by at least a dozen former residents of the White House. </p>\n<p>Which brings me back to my point. Since I have been strumming the banjo here at the White House, government is doing more for less. The budget is balanced for the first time since JFK did a one gun salute to Marilyn, a fact the press didn''t seem to care about, evidently. Unemployment is so low today a blind felon can get a job as a night-watchman. And the stock market is higher than a D-student on a full gram of dumb-dust, and anyone with a degree from a junior college who can spell ''Internet'' has enough money to ponder the annual maintenance cost of his boat, instead of where his or her next meal is coming from. </p>\n<p>Bottom line: I''m running a country here and I''m doing it with my pecker showing. What I''m asking for is your support, not a date with your daughter...unless, of course, she''s a hotty with thin ankles, and then I''d like to discuss it. I may be a pervert, but I''m also a realist. I know that if the economy was going down the crapper, I''d-a been out on my fat ass after the ''96 election. But I''m a lucky pervert-the economy is hotter than Paula Jones in a leather teddy.

[There was a man named Bubba and Bubba knew EVERYONE in the whole<br /> world!!</p>\n<p>Once when Bubba got a new job, he says to his new boss, "Boss, I<br /> know everyone in the whole world!" His boss doesn''t believe him,<br /> so he says "No you do not know everyone in the whole world" but<br /> Bubba says "Yes I do!" so Bubba''s boss says "Well prove it!"<br /> then Bubba says "Pick someone and I know them!"</p>\n<p>Well Bubba''s boss thinks for a minute and then comes up with a<br /> name.</p>\n<p>"Tom Selleck! I bet you don''t know Tom Selleck!" Bubba say "Tom<br /> Selleck! Tom and I were in boy scouts together when we were<br /> kids!" but Bubba''s boss says "No you weren''t!" then Bubba says<br /> "Yes we were!" so they fly to Hollywood and drive up to Tom<br /> Selleck''s house. Bubba knocks on the door and Tom Selleck<br /> answers and Bubba says "Tom!!!" and Tom says "Bubba!" and they<br /> hug and catch up for 30 minutes and Bubba''s boss can''t believe<br /> it. But then he thinks "Well that could happen, it''s just one<br /> person," so he tells Bubba and Bubba says "OK, pick somebody<br /> else!"</p>\n<p>This time Bubba''s boss has someone in mind! "The president, Bill<br /> Clinton! You don''t know Bill Clinton!" but Bubba says "Oh yes I<br /> do! Bill and I were on debate team together in college!" Bubba''s<br /> boss says "No you weren''t!" and Bubba says "Yes we were!" So<br /> they fly to Washington and they catch up with the President at a<br /> press conference. They work their way through the crowd until<br /> Bubba gets close enough to catch Clinton''s eye and waves "Bill!"<br /> and the President waves "Bubba!" and after the press conference<br /> they hug and catch up for 30 minutes and Bubba''s boss is stunned<br /> - he can''t believe it. But then he thinks "Well that''s just two<br /> people in one country - that doesn''t mean he knows everyone in<br /> the whole world!" so he tells Bubba and Bubba says "OK, pick<br /> someone out of the world spectrum and I know them!"</p>\n<p>And Bubba''s boss knows just who to pick so he says "The Pope!<br /> You do not know the Pope!" and Bubba says "The Pope! The Pose<br /> BAPTIZED me!" and Bubba''s boss says "No he didn''t!" and Bubba<br /> says "Yes he did!" So they fly to Rome where the Pope is giving<br /> Mass in front of hundreds of thousands of people. They work<br /> their way through the crowd - without much luck - so Bubba says<br /> "Boss, we''re never gonna get there together through all these<br /> people so I tell you what - I''ll work my way up there and when I<br /> do, I''ll give you a sign that show you I know the Pope!" and he<br /> leaves. Well Bubba''s boss waits and waits and waits and just<br /> when he''s about to give up, he sees the Pope come out onto the<br /> balcony and right there beside him is Bubba!</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, Bubba''s boss passes out. Bubba comes back<br /> and finds his boss passed out and he fans him and says "Boss!<br /> Boss! Wake up!" and when his boss comes to, he asks "Boss what<br /> happened?" Bubba''s boss looks at Bubba and says, "OK, I can see<br /> Tom Selleck. I can see Bill Clinton and I can even take the<br /> Pope! But when somebody standing next to me asks</p>\n<p>''Who''s that up there with Bubba?'', that''s a little more than I<br /> can take!"]

[Dear Friend, </p>\n<p>We have the distinguished honor of being on the committee for raising five<br /> million dollars for placing a statue of Bill Clinton in the hall of fame in<br /> Washington, D. C. The committee was in a quandary as to where to place the<br /> statue. It was not wise to place it beside the statue of George Washington,who<br /> never told a lie, nor beside Jesse Jackson, who never told the truth, since Bill<br /> Clinton could never tell the difference. </p>\n<p>We finally decided to place it beside Christopher Columbus, the greatest<br /> democrat of all. He left not knowing where he was going, did not know where he<br /> was, returned not knowing where he had been, and did it all on borrowed money. </p>\n<p>Over 5,000 years ago, Moses said to the people of Israel, "Pick up your<br /> shovels, mount your asses and camels, and I will lead you to the promised land."<br /> Nearly 5,000 years later, Roosevelt said, " Lay down your shovels, sit on your<br /> asses, and light up a camel, this is the promised land." </p>\n<p>Now, Bill Clinton is going to steal your shovel, kick your asses, raise the<br /> price of camels, and mortgage the promised land. If you are one of the fortunate<br /> people who has anything left after paying taxes, we expect a generous<br /> contribution to this worthwhile project. Fraternally,<br /> Bill Clinton Statue Committee]

[By Terry Jones (of Monty Python)<br /> February 20, 2002<br /> Times Observer</p>\n<p>To prevent terrorism by dropping bombs on Iraq is such an obvious idea that I can''t think why no one has thought of it before. It''s so simple. If only the UK had done something similar in Northern Ireland, we wouldn''t be in the mess we are in today. The moment the IRA blew up the Horseguards'' bandstand, the Government should have declared its own War on Terrorism. It should have immediately demanded that the Irish government hand over Gerry Adams. If they refused to do so - or quibbled about needing proof of his guilt - we could have told them that this was no time for prevarication and that they must hand over not only Adams but all IRA terrorists in the Republic. If they tried to stall by claiming that it was hard to tell who were IRA terrorists and who weren''t, because they don''t go around wearing identity badges, we would have been free to send in the bombers. </p>\n<p>It is well known that the best way of picking out terrorists is to fly 30,000ft above the capital city of any state that harbours them and drop bombs - preferably cluster bombs. It is conceivable that the bombing of Dublin might have provoked some sort of protest, even if just from James Joyce fans, and there is at least some likelihood of increased anti-British sentiment in what remained of the city and thus a rise in the numbers of potential terrorists. But this, in itself, would have justified the tactic of bombing them in the first place. We would have nipped them in the bud, so to speak. I hope you follow the argument. </p>\n<p>Having bombed Dublin and, perhaps, a few IRA training bogs in Tipperary, we could not have afforded to be complacent. We would have had to turn our attention to those states which had supported and funded the IRA terrorists through all these years. The main provider of funds was, of course, the USA, and this would have posed us with a bit of a problem. Where to bomb in America? It''s a big place and it''s by no means certain that a small country like the UK could afford enough bombs to do the whole job. It''s going to cost the US billions to bomb Iraq and a lot of that is empty countryside. America, on the other hand, provides a bewildering number of targets. </p>\n<p>Should we have bombed Washington, where the policies were formed? Or should we have concentrated on places where Irishmen are known to lurk, like New York, Boston and Philadelphia? We could have bombed any police station and fire station in most major urban centres, secure in the knowledge that we would be taking out significant numbers of IRA sympathisers. On St Patrick''s Day, we could have bombed Fifth Avenue and scored a bull''s-eye. </p>\n<p>In those American cities we couldn''t afford to bomb, we could have rounded up American citizens with Irish names, put bags over their heads and flown them in chains to Guernsey or Rockall, where we could have given them food packets marked ''My Kind of Meal'' and exposed them to the elements with a clear conscience. </p>\n<p>The same goes for Australia. There are thousands of people in Sydney and Melbourne alone who have actively supported Irish republicanism by sending money and good wishes back to people in the Republic, many of whom are known to be IRA members and sympathisers. A well-placed bomb or two Down Under could have taken out the ringleaders and left the world a safer place. Of course, it goes without saying that we would also have had to bomb various parts of London such as Camden Town, Lewisham and bits of Hammersmith and we should certainly have had to obliterate, if not the whole of Liverpool, at least the Scotland Road area. </p>\n<p>And that would be it really, as far as exterminating the IRA and its supporters. Easy. The War on Terrorism provides a solution so uncomplicated, so straightforward and so gloriously simple that it baffles me why it has taken a man with the brains of George W. Bush to think of it. </p>\n<p>So, sock it to Iraq, George. Let''s make the world a safer place.]

Clinton says, "Nope, I don''t think I''d like that kind of punishment." So they go on to the next room.There was Bob Dole, tied to a long pole and suspended over a large tub of raw sewage. He is lowered into the tank until completely submerged. After a few minutes he is lifted out of the tank, gasping and fighting for breath. As soon as he gets his breath back, he''s lowered again. "uh-uh!" says Clinton. "That''s not for me."Finally they come to a room where Kenneth Starr is hanging from the wall by his thumbs. His pants are down around his ankles, and Monica Lewinsky is performing oral sex on him. Clinton says "OK, if I have to be punished forever, I''ll go for that way."Satan says, "Fine. . . that will be your punishment for the next billion years. Monica! Your replacement is here!"]

[Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day. Apparently it had<br /> been a pretty busy day, though, so St. Peter had to tell the first one,<br /> "Heaven''s getting pretty close to full today, and I''ve been asked to admit only<br /> people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what''s your story?" </p>\n<p>The first man replies: "Well, for a while I''ve suspected my wife has been<br /> cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I<br /> came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my<br /> searching around didn''t reveal where this other guy could have been hiding.<br /> Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging<br /> off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started<br /> beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn''t you know it, he wouldn''t fall off.<br /> So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering<br /> on his fingers. Of course, he couldn''t stand that for long, so he let go and<br /> fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I<br /> couldn''t stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge, and<br /> threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all<br /> the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the<br /> balcony." </p>\n<p>"That sounds like a pretty bad day to me," said Peter, and let the man in. </p>\n<p>The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and<br /> again asks for his story. </p>\n<p>"It''s been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my<br /> apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well,<br /> this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But<br /> I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew<br /> I couldn''t hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the<br /> balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and<br /> kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and<br /> grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but<br /> again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just<br /> when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out<br /> of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I''m here." </p>\n<p>Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible<br /> death. </p>\n<p>The third man came to the front of the line, and St. Peter asked for his<br /> story. </p>\n<p>"Picture this," says the third man, "I''m hiding naked inside a<br /> refrigerator..."]

[The Lord spoke to Noah and said, "Noah, in six months I am going to make it<br /> rain until the whole world is covered with water and all the evil things are<br /> destroyed. But, I want to save a few good people and two of every living thing<br /> on the planet. I am ordering you to build an ark." And, in a flash of lightning,<br /> he delivered the specifications for the ark.<br /> "Okay," Noah said, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints, "I''m<br /> your man."<br /> "Six months and it starts to rain," thundered the Lord. "You better have my<br /> ark completed or learn to swim for a long, long time!"<br /> Six months passed, the sky began to cloud up, and the rain began to fall in<br /> torrents. The Lord looked down and saw Noah sitting in his yard, weeping, and<br /> there was no ark.<br /> "Noah!" shouted the Lord, "where is my ark?" A lightning bolt crashed into the<br /> ground right beside Noah.<br /> "Lord, please forgive me!" begged Noah. "I did my best, but there were some<br /> problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the ark''s construction, but<br /> your plans did not meet their code. So, I had to hire an engineer to redo the<br /> plans, only to get into a long argument with him about whether to include a<br /> fire-sprinkler system.<br /> "My neighbors objected, claiming that I was violating zoning ordinances by<br /> building the ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city<br /> planning board.<br /> "Then, I had a big problem getting enough wood for the ark, because there was<br /> a ban on cutting trees to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince the<br /> environmentalists and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that I needed the wood<br /> to save the owls, but they wouldn''t let me catch them, so no owls.<br /> "Next, I started gathering up the animals but got sued by an animal rights<br /> group that objected to me taking along only two of each kind.<br /> "Just when the suit got dismissed, the EPA notified me that I couldn''t<br /> complete the ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your<br /> proposed flood. They didn''t take kindly to the idea that they had no<br /> jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being.<br /> "Then, the Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed flood plan. I sent<br /> them a globe!<br /> "Right now, I''m still trying to resolve a complaint with the Equal<br /> Opportunities Commission over how many minorities I''m supposed to hire.<br /> "The IRS has seized all my assets claiming that I am trying to leave the<br /> country, and I just got a notice from the state that I owe some kind of use tax.<br /> Really, I don''t think I can finish the ark in less than five years."<br /> With that, the sky cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow arched<br /> across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled. "You mean you are not going to<br /> destroy the world?" he asked hopefully.<br /> "No," said the Lord, "the government already has."]
[George W. Bush was walking through an airport last week, when he saw an old man with white hair, a long white beard, wearing a long white robe and holding a staff. He walked up to the man, who was staring at the ceiling, and "Excuse me sir, aren''t you Moses?"</p>\n<p>The man stood perfectly still and continued to stare at the ceiling, saying nothing. Again, George W. asked, a little louder this time, "Excuse me sir, aren''t you Moses?" Again, the old man stared at the ceiling motionless without saying a word. George W. tried a third time, louder yet. "Excuse me sir, aren''t you Moses?" Again, no movement or words from the old man. He continued to stare at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>One of George W''s aides asked him if there was a problem, and George W. said, "Either this man is deaf or extremely rude. I have asked him three times if he was Moses, and he has not answered me yet." To which the man, still staring at the ceiling finally replied to the aide, "I can hear him and yes, I am Moses, but the last time I spoke to a bush, I spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness."]
[Just in off the AP wire...</p>\n<p>BUSH SUES SANTA</p>\n<p>AUSTIN, TX - Dec.15 - Attorneys for Texas Governor George W. Bush filed suit in federal court today, seeking to prevent Santa Claus from making his list and then checking it twice. The complaint seeks an immediate injunction against the beloved Christmas icon, asking the court to effectively ban his traditional practice of checking the list of good boys and girls one additional time before packing his sleigh.</p>\n<p>The suit, filed in the Federal District Court of Austin, Texas, asks a federal judge to "hereby order Mr. Claus to cease and desist all repetitive and duplicative list-checking activity, and certify the original list as submitted, without amendment, alteration, deletion, or other unnecessary modification."</p>\n<p>"There are no standards for deciding who is naughty, and who is nice. It''s totally arbitrary and capricious. How many more times does he need to check? This checking, checking, and re-checking over and over again must stop now," said former Secretary James Baker.</p>\n<p>Baker further claimed that unnamed GOP observers witnessed an elf remove all boys named Brad from the "nice" list, filing them under "naughty" instead because "everyone knows all boys named Brad are brats."</p>\n<p>Gov. Bush cited the potential for unauthorized list tampering, and blasted what he called the "fuzzy math up there at the North Pole."</p>\n<p>"Their security is really awful, really bad," said Bush. "My mother just walked right in, told ''em she was Mrs. Claus. They didn''t check her ID or nothing."</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dick Cheney, Gov. Bush''s running mate, issued a direct plea to St. Nick himself. "Mr. Claus, I call on you to do the honorable thing, and quit checking your list. The children of the world have had enough. They demand closure now," Cheney said, adding that his granddaughter has already selected a name for the pony that she''s asked for.</p>\n<p>Santa Claus could not be reached for comment, but a spokes-elf said he was "deeply distressed" by news of the pending legal action against him. "He''s losing weight, and he hasn''t said ''Ho Ho Ho'' for days," said the spokes-elf. "He''s just not feeling jolly."]

You have never sat through a entire movie without having at least one device on your body beep or buzz. </p>\n<p>3. You need to fill out a form that must be typewritten, but you can''t because there isn''t one typewriter in your house -- only computers with laser printers. </p>\n<p>4.

You go to computer trade shows and map out your path of the exhibit hall in advance. But you cannot give someone directions to your house without looking up the street names. </p>\n<p>20. You would rather get more dots per inch than miles per gallon. </p>\n<p>21.

[Subject: MEMO TO THE FAA<br /> Date: June 2002</p>\n<p>Dear Sirs:</p>\n<p>I''ve had a lot of time on my hands of late and believe that I may have the<br /> solution for the prevention of hijackings, and at the same time we just might<br /> get the Airline industry back on its feet. </p>\n<p>Here''s my plan: </p>\n<p>Since Muslim men are not allowed to look at naked women, we should replace all<br /> of our flight attendants with naked females. Muslims would not then board our<br /> planes for fear of seeing a naked woman. Of course, every businessman in this<br /> country would start flying again in anticipation of seeing naked women.<br /> Hijackings would come to a screeching halt and the airline industry would<br /> probably have record sales. Hell, I''d fly all over just for the scenery. </p>\n<p>It truly puzzles me that our Republican Congress didn''t already come up with<br /> this. Am I the only one who thinks clearly on these issues? </p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br /> Bush]
[Dear Diary:</p>\n<p>Day 1</p>\n<p>Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to celebrate. When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, he locked himself in the bathroom and cried.</p>\n<p>Day 2</p>\n<p>Today, he says he has a big secret to tell me. He''s impotent, he says, and he wants me to be the first to know. Why doesn''t he tell me something I don''t know! I mean, gimme a break. He''s been dysfunctional for so long that he even walks with a limp.</p>\n<p>Day 3</p>\n<p>This marriage is in trouble. A woman has needs. Yesterday, I saw a picture of the Washington Monument and burst into tears.</p>\n<p>Day 4</p>\n<p>A miracle has happened! There''s a new drug on the market that will fix his ''problem.'' It''s called Viagra. I told him that if he takes Viagra, things will be just like they were on our wedding night. He said, ''this time, I''d rather not have your mother join us.'' I think this will work. I replaced his Prozac with the Viagra, hoping to lift something other than his mood.</p>\n<p>Day 7</p>\n<p>This Viagra thing has gone to his head. No pun intended! Yesterday, at Burger King, the manager asked me if I''d like a Whopper. He thought they were talking about him. Get over yourself! Not everything is about you!</p>\n<p>Day 8</p>\n<p>I think he took too many over the weekend. Yesterday, instead of mowing the lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed wacker.</p>\n<p>Day 10</p>\n<p>Okay, I admit it. I''m hiding. I mean, a girl can only take so much. And to make matters worse, he''s washing the Viagra down with hard cider! The photo of Janet Reno isn''t working. What am I gonna do?</p>\n<p>Day 11</p>\n<p>The side effects are starting to get to him. Everything is turning blue. The other day, we were watching Kenneth Branaugh in Hamlet and he thought it was The Smurfs Do Denmark.</p>\n<p>Day 12</p>\n<p>I''m basically being drilled to death. It''s like going out with a Black and Decker power tool.</p>\n<p>Day 13</p>\n<p>I wish he was gay. I bought 400 Liza Minelli albums and I keep saying ''fabulous,'' and still he keeps coming after me!</p>\n<p>Day 14</p>\n<p>Now I know how Saddam Hussein''s wife feels. Every time I shut my eyes, there''s a sneak attack! It''s like going to bed with a scud missile. Let''s hope he''s not like ex-President Bush and takes 100 days to pull out!</p>\n<p>Day 15</p>\n<p>I''ve done everything to turn him off. Nothing is working. I even started dressing like a nun. Now he tells me sister Wendy revs his motor.</p>\n<p>Day 16</p>\n<p>I may just have to kill him. Then he''ll go out the way he wants to... stiff! With my luck, I won''t be able to close the casket.]

[TO: Honorable Secretary of Agriculture </p>\n<p>Washington, D.C. </p>\n<p>Dear Sir; </p>\n<p>My friend, Ed Peterson, over at Wells Iowa, received a check for $1,000 from the government for not raising hogs.  So, I want to go into the "not raising hogs" business next year. What I want to know is, in your opinion, what is the best kind of farm not to raise hogs on, and what is the best breed of hogs not to raise?  </p>\n<p>I want to be sure that I approach this endeavor in keeping with all governmental policies.  I would prefer not to raise razorbacks, but if that is not a good breed not to raise, then I will just as gladly not raise Yorkshires or Durocs. As I see it, the hardest part of this program will be in keeping an accurate inventory of how many hogs I haven''t raised. </p>\n<p>My friend, Peterson, is very joyful about the future of the business. He has been raising hogs for twenty years or so, and the best he ever made on them was $422 in 1968, until this year when he got your check for $1000 for not raising hogs. If I get $1000 for not raising 50 hogs, will I get $2000 for not raising 100 hogs?  I plan to operate on a small scale at first, holding myself down to about 4000 hogs not raised, which will mean about $80,000 the first year.  Then I can afford an airplane. </p>\n<p>Now another thing, these hogs I will not raise will not eat 100,000 bushels of corn.   I understand that you also pay farmers for not raising corn and wheat.  Will I qualify for payments for not raising wheat and corn not to feed the 4000 hogs I am not going to raise? </p>\n<p>Also, I am considering the "not milking cows" business, so send me any information you have on that too. In view of these circumstances, you understand that I will be totally unemployed and plan to file for unemployment and food stamps. Be assured you will have my tote in the coming election.</p>\n<p>Patriotically Yours, </p>\n<p>Morgan P.S.  </p>\n<p>Would you please notify me when you plan to distribute more free cheese.]

As it passed over a a bit of forest near the green, the squirrel dropped my ball."</p>\n<p>"Did you swear THEN?" asks the now impatient Priest.</p>\n<p>"No, because as the ball fell it struck a tree, bounced through some bushes, careened off a big rock, and rolled through a sand trap onto the green and stopped within six inches of the hole."</p>\n<p>The Priest sighs, "You missed the putt, didn''t you?!?"]

[Bush and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all. They sat down and<br /> decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. They would have 5 years<br /> to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side''s dog won would<br /> be entitled to dominate the world.<br /> Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the<br /> world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the<br /> biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which<br /> gave him all the milk. After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog<br /> the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 " thick and<br /> nobody could get near it. </p>\n<p>When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a strange looking<br /> animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because<br /> there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the<br /> Afghanistani dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it''s<br /> cage, and slowly waddled over towards Osama''s dog. Osama''s dog snarled and<br /> leaped out of its cage and charged the American Dachshund---but when it got<br /> close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed Osama''s dog in<br /> one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all. </p>\n<p>Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, "We don''t understand how<br /> this could have happened.

Clinton escorted Bush into a large, heavily guarded compound, then took him into the first building.

If we''re threatened by a European or South American country, we''ll send them in so they can sleep with country''s leaders and neutralize the threat." </p>\n<p>Bush nodded. In the next building, he saw a group of very effeminate teenage boys. Clinton explained, "When these boys got AIDS, we made them eunuchs. If we''re threatened by China, we''ll send them in to satisfy the desires of the Chinese leaders. They''ll be infected, and the crisis will be averted." Bush nodded. </p>\n<p>They entered the largest of the three buildings, and saw a huge group of adult men cavorting around on all fours. Bush said, "What are these guys doing?" </p>\n<p>Clinton said, "These men will serve their country if there''s another crisis in Iraq, Iran, or anywhere else in the Middle East." </p>\n<p>"I don''t understand.

[Noah''s Ark... If it happened today </p>\n<p>And the Lord spoke to Noah and said, "In six months I''m going to make it rain<br /> until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people are<br /> destroyed. But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind of living<br /> thing on the planet. I am commanding you to build an Ark." </p>\n<p>And in a flash of lightning, He delivered the specifications for an Ark.<br /> "Okay," said Noah, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints. </p>\n<p>"Six months, and it starts to rain," thundered the Lord. "You''d better have<br /> the Ark completed, or learn to swim for a very long time." </p>\n<p>Six months passed, the skies clouded up and rain began to fall. The Lord saw<br /> that Noah was sitting in his front yard, weeping. ..... and there was no Ark. </p>\n<p>"Noah," shouted the Lord, "Where is the Ark?" </p>\n<p>"Lord, please forgive me!" begged Noah. "I did my best. But there were big<br /> problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction<br /> project, and your plans didn''t meet code. So I had to hire an engineer to re-<br /> draw the plans. Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark needed a<br /> fire sprinkler system. </p>\n<p>"Then my neighbor objected, claiming I was violating zoning by building the<br /> Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city planning<br /> commission. </p>\n<p>"Then I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark, because there was a ban<br /> on cutting trees to save the Spotted Owl. I had to convince the U.S. Fish and<br /> Wildlife that I need the wood to save the Owls. But they wouldn''t let me catch<br /> any owls. So, no owls. </p>\n<p>"The carpenters formed a union and went out on strike. I had to negotiate a<br /> settlement with the National Labor Relations Board before anyone would pick up a<br /> saw or hammer. Now we have sixteen carpenters going on the boat, and still no<br /> owls. </p>\n<p>"Then I started gathering up animals, and got sued by an animal rights group.<br /> They objected to me taking only two of each kind. </p>\n<p>"Just when I got the suit dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn''t complete<br /> the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your proposed flood.<br /> They didn''t take kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the<br /> conduct of a Supreme Being. </p>\n<p>"Then the Army Corp of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed new flood plain.<br /> I sent them a globe. </p>\n<p>"Right now, I''m still trying to resolve a complaint from the Equal Employment<br /> Opportunity Commission over how many Croatians I''m supposed to hire. The IRS has<br /> seized all my assets, claiming I''m trying to avoid paying taxes by leaving the<br /> country. And I just got a notice from the state about owing them some kind of<br /> use tax. I really don''t think I can finish the Ark for at least another five<br /> years," Noah wailed. </p>\n<p>The sky began to clear. The sun began to shine. A rainbow arched across the<br /> sky. Noah looked up and smiled. </p>\n<p>"You mean you''re not going to destroy the earth?" Noah asked hopefully. </p>\n<p>"No," said the Lord sadly. "The government already has."]

[URGENT ASSISTANCE - FROM USA </p>\n<p>IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED : HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL </p>\n<p>FROM: GEORGE WALKER BUSH<br /> 202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111<br /> FAX: 202.456.2461 </p>\n<p>Dear Sir / Madam, </p>\n<p>I am GEORGE WALKER BUSH, son of the former president of the United States of<br /> America George Herbert Walker Bush, and currently serving as President of the<br /> United States of America. This letter might surprise you because we have not met<br /> neither in person nor by correspondence. I came to know of you in my search for<br /> a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business<br /> transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to an account<br /> requiring maximum confidence. </p>\n<p>I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in<br /> acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq. My<br /> partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my<br /> father, who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the<br /> United States of America, and bravely served his country as director of the<br /> United States Central Intelligence Agency. </p>\n<p>In the decade of the nineteen-eighties, my father, then vice-president of the<br /> United States of America, sought to work with the good offices of the President<br /> of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring<br /> Islamic republic of Iran. This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a<br /> falling-out with his Iraqi partner, who sought to acquire additional oil revenue<br /> sources in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait, a wholly-owned U.S.-British<br /> subsidiary. </p>\n<p>My father re-secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of<br /> sixty-one billion u.s. dollars ($61,000,000,000). Out of that cost, thirty-six<br /> billion dollars ($36,000,000,000) were supplied by his partners in the Kingdom<br /> of Saudi Arabia and other persian gulf monarchies, and sixteen billion dollars<br /> ($16,000,000,000) by German and Japanese partners. But my father''s former Iraqi<br /> business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum<br /> reserves. </p>\n<p>My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the<br /> President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his<br /> country, as compensation for the costs of removing him from power.<br /> Unfortunately, our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of<br /> this new venture, which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to<br /> 200 billion dollars ($100,000,000,000 - $200,000,000,000), both in the initial<br /> acquisition and in long-term management. </p>\n<p>Without the funds from our 1991 partners, we would not be able to acquire the<br /> oil revenue trapped within Iraq. That is why my family and our colleagues are<br /> urgently seeking your gracious assistance. Our distinguished colleagues in this<br /> business transaction include the sitting vice-president of the United States of<br /> America, Richard Cheney, who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and<br /> former head of the Halliburton oil company, and Condoleeza Rice, whose<br /> professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a<br /> Chevron oil tanker after her. </p>\n<p>I would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty-five percent<br /> (10-25 %) of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important venture.<br /> The internal revenue service of the United States of America will function as<br /> our trusted intermediary. I propose that you make this transfer before the<br /> fifteenth (15th) of the month of April. </p>\n<p>I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and<br /> worried. But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. A<br /> bold step taken shall not be regretted, I assure you. Please do be informed that<br /> this business transaction is 100% legal. If you do not wish to co-operate in<br /> this transaction, please contact our intermediary representatives to further<br /> discuss the matter. </p>\n<p>I pray that you understand our plight. My family and our colleagues will be<br /> forever grateful. Please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers<br /> below.<br /> 202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111]

[Bill Clinton Statue Committee<br /> 1040 Buffoon Street<br /> Little Rock, AR 72205</p>\n<p>Dear Friend:</p>\n<p>We have the distinguished honor of being on the committee for raising 5<br /> million dollars for placing a statue of Bill Clinton in the hall of fame<br /> in Washington, DC.</p>\n<p>This committee was in a quandary as to where to place the statue. It was<br /> not wise to place it beside George Washington who never told a lie, nor<br /> beside Jesse Jackson who never told the truth, since Bill Clinton could<br /> never tell the difference.</p>\n<p>We finally decided to place it next to Christopher Columbus, the greatest<br /> democrat of all. He left not knowing where he was going, did not know<br /> where he was, he returned not knowing where he had been, and he did it all<br /> on borrowed money.</p>\n<p>5,000 years ago Moses said, "Pack up your camel, pick up your shovel, move<br /> your ass, and I will lead you to the promised land." </p>\n<p>5,000 years later FDR said, "Lay down your shovel, sit on your ass, light<br /> up a camel for this is the promised land."</p>\n<p>This year Bill Clinton will steal your shovel, kick your ass, raise the<br /> price of camels, and mortgage the promised land. If you are one of the<br /> fortunate people who has anything left after paying taxes, we expect a<br /> generous contribution to this worthwhile project.</p>\n<p>Fraternally,</p>\n<p>Bill Clinton Statue Committee]

[After a few days on the new Earth, the Lord called to Adam and said, ''''It is time for you and Eve to begin the process of populating the earth, so I want you to kiss her.'''' Adam answered, ''''Yes, Lord, but what is a ''kiss''?'''' The Lord gave a brief description to Adam, who took Eve by the hand and took her to a nearby bush. A few minutes later, Adam emerged and said, ''''Thank you Lord, that was enjoyable.'''' And the Lord replied, ''''Yes Adam, I thought you might enjoy that. Now, I''d like you to caress Eve.'''' And Adam said, ''''What is a ''caress''?'''' So, the Lord again gave Adam a brief description and Adam went behind the bush with Eve. Quite a few minutes later, Adam returned, smiling, and said, ''''Lord, that was even better than the kiss.'''' And the Lord said, ''''You''ve done well Adam. And now, I want you to make love to Eve.'''' And Adam asked, ''''What is ''make love'', Lord?'''' So, the Lord again gave Adam directions and Adam went again to Eve behind the bush, but this time he re-appeared in two seconds. And Adam said, ''''Lord, what is a ''headache''?'''']

[The rules for playing bedroom golf.</p>\n<p>Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play, normally<br /> one club and two balls.</p>\n<p>Play on course must be approved by the owner of the hole.</p>\n<p>Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole<br /> and keep the balls out.</p>\n<p>For the most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.</p>\n<p>Course owners are permitted to check shaft before play begins.</p>\n<p>Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid<br /> damage to the hole.</p>\n<p>The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary<br /> until the owner is satisfied play is complete. Failure to do so<br /> may result in being denied permission to play again.</p>\n<p>It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately<br /> upon arrival. Experienced players will normally take time to<br /> admire the entire course, paying special attention to well<br /> formed mounds and bunkers.</p>\n<p>Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have<br /> played on in the past or are currently playing on to the owner<br /> of the course being played.</p>\n<p>Upset owners have been known to damage a players equipment for<br /> this reason.</p>\n<p>Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear, just in case.</p>\n<p>Players should not assume that the course is in shape to play at<br /> all times. Players may be embarrassed if they find the course<br /> temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely<br /> tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find<br /> alternate means of play when this is the case.</p>\n<p>Players should assume their match has been properly scheduled<br /> particularly when playing a new course for the 1st time.</p>\n<p>Previous players have been known to become irate if they<br /> discover someone else is playing what they considered to be a<br /> private course.</p>\n<p>The owner of the course is responsible for the pruning of any<br /> bushes, which may reduce the visibility of the hole.</p>\n<p>Players are also advised not to play on courses where there is<br /> no bush surrounding the hole.</p>\n<p>Players are strongly advised to get the owners permission before<br /> attempting to play the backside.</p>\n<p>Slow play is encouraged, however, players should be prepared to<br /> proceed at a quicker pace at the owners request.</p>\n<p>It is considered an outstanding performance, time permitting, to<br /> play the same hole several times in one match. </p>\n<p>You do not have to let other players play through. </p>\n<p>It is not advisable for two players to attempt the same hole at<br /> the same time.</p>\n<p>Beware: Some courses may be contaminated. Report these courses<br /> to all fellow players and course owners so that they will not<br /> contaminate other courses or equipment. Should your equipment<br /> become contaminated, avoid playing any further courses until the<br /> contamination is removed. Should your course become<br /> contaminated, restrict all players from the course until the<br /> contamination is removed.]

She calls Tony Blair in and asks, "Tony, your parents had a<br /> baby.<br /> It isn''t your sister and it isn''t your brother. Who is it?" Tony Blair<br /> replies, "It''s me!"<br /> So G.W. calls Dick Cheney and says, "Dick, your parents had a baby.<br /> It isn''t your sister and it isn''t your brother. Who is it?" And Cheney says,<br /> "Wow, that''s a tough one. Let me get back to you."<br /> So Cheney calls Colin Powell and says, "Colin, your parents had a baby.<br /> It isn''t your sister and it isn''t your brother. Who is it?" And Colin Powell<br /> says,<br /> "It''s me!" So Cheney calls Bush and says, "It''s Colin Powell."<br /> And Bush says, "No, you idiot! It''s Tony Blair!"]

[A college couple had been dating for about 6 months. One day in the cafeteria<br /> they are having lunch. After beating around the bush for a few minutes, the<br /> boyfriend expresses that he''s interested in going "all the way". The girlfriend<br /> excalaims that she has been wanting to also but was unsure on how to address the<br /> issue. After several more minutes of small talk, the girlfriend says she is<br /> willing to finally consumate their relationship, but that the boyfriend must<br /> first meet her parents and bring protection. He agrees and accepts her<br /> invitation to dinner at her house that evening. The boyfriend proceeds directly<br /> to the pharmacy after his last class and walks directly to the condom aisle.<br /> Upon reaching said aisle, he is quickly overwhelmed by the seemingly endless<br /> variety and begins to scratch his head in indecision. Seeing this from behind<br /> the counter, the Pharmacist proceeds the boyfriends location and asks him of his<br /> quandry. After a moment of verbal stammering, he explains to the pharmicist that<br /> it''s his first time buying condoms and he''s not sure what kind to buy, but that<br /> he needs a lot of them as he and she are going to make a marathon night of it.<br /> The pharmicist chuckles, hands him a "bonus pack" of the most popular brand, and<br /> sends the boyfriend on his way. A few hours pass as the boyfriend feverishly<br /> prepares for the night he''s hoping will make him into a man. Finally the moment<br /> of truth arrives as he arrives at his quarrys abode, with not a hair out of<br /> place and a bilfold full of condoms, he nervously rings the doorbell.

At the end of<br /> the prayer, the girlfriend exclaims "I had no idea you were so religious". The<br /> boyfriend sweating from his labor exlaims in turn "I had no idea your father was<br /> a pharmicist"!]

["We are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not occur."<br /> - Governor George W. Bush]
[GEORGE W. BUSH:<br /> We don''t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to<br /> know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is<br /> either against us or for us. There is no middle ground here. </p>\n<p>COLIN POWELL:<br /> Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image<br /> of the chicken crossing the road. </p>\n<p>JOHN KERRY:<br /> Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road I am now against it! </p>\n<p>RALPH NADER:<br /> The chicken''s habitat on the other side of the road had been polluted<br /> by unchecked industrial greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled<br /> habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the<br /> wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV. </p>\n<p>PAT BUCHANAN:<br /> To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American. </p>\n<p>RUSH LIMBAUGH:<br /> I don''t know why the chicken crossed the road, but I''ll bet it was<br /> getting a government grant to cross the road, and I''ll bet that somebody<br /> out there is already forming a support group to help chickens with<br /> crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this<br /> can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their<br /> tax dollars. And when I say tax dollars, I''m talking about your money,<br /> money the government took from you to build a road for chickens to<br /> cross. </p>\n<p>MARTHA STEWART:<br /> No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a<br /> standing order at the Farmer''s Market to sell my eggs when the price<br /> dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information. </p>\n<p>JERRY FALWELL:<br /> Because the chicken was gay --- isn''t it obvious? Can''t you people see<br /> the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the<br /> ''''other side''. That''s what they call it the other side. Yes, my friends,<br /> that chicken is gay. And if you eat that chicken, you will become gay<br /> too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination<br /> that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like<br /> "the other side." </p>\n<p>DR. SEUSS:<br /> Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the<br /> chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I''ve not been told. </p>\n<p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY:<br /> To die in the rain. Alone. </p>\n<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.:<br /> I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads<br /> without having their motives called into question. </p>\n<p>GRANDPA:<br /> In my day, we didn''t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody<br /> told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough. </p>\n<p>BARBARA WALTERS:<br /> Isn''t that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the<br /> chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it<br /> experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its<br /> life long dream of crossing the road. </p>\n<p>JOHN LENNON:<br /> Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together - in<br /> peace. </p>\n<p>ARISTOTLE:<br /> It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. </p>\n<p>KARL MARX:<br /> It was an historic inevitability. </p>\n<p>CAPTAIN KIRK:<br /> To boldly go where no chicken had ever gone before. </p>\n<p>SIGMUND FREUD:<br /> The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the<br /> road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. </p>\n<p>BILL GATES:<br /> I have just witnessed eChicken2003, which will not only cross roads,<br /> but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your<br /> checkbook.... and Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken. </p>\n<p>ALBERT EINSTEIN:<br /> Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the<br /> chicken? </p>\n<p>BILL CLINTON:<br /> I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What is your definition of<br /> chicken? </p>\n<p>AL GORE:<br /> I invented the chicken! </p>\n<p>THE BIBLE:<br /> And God came down from heaven, and he said unto the chicken "THOU SHALT CROSS THE ROAD." And the chicken didst cross the road, and there was much rejoicing. </p>\n<p>COLONEL SANDERS:<br /> Did I miss one? </p>\n<p>Submitted by yisman<br /> Edited by Curtis]

[Every once in a while each of us experiences a perfect crap. It''s rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects. You sit down expecting the worst, but what you get is the smooth-sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. But that''s not the end of it. You use some toilet paper only to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it. On the other hand (so to speak) there is:The Beer Crap Talk about nasty craps. Depending on the crapper''s tolerance, the beer crap is the result of too many beers. It could have been two or 22, it doesn''t matter. What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy crap accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.The Chilli Crap Hot when it goes in and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chilli crap stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a heat shield.The Cable Crap Long, curly and perfectly formed like two feet of telephone coaxial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. You wonder admiringly, ''Did I do that? Where did it come from?'' You leave the toilet pleased with yourself.The Latrine Crap In case you didn''t know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it - where soldiers, boy scouts and flies go to crap. Tip: don''t ever look down the hole.The Mona Lisa Crap This is the masterpiece of craps. It''s as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that would make Da Vinci weep. And just think, you made it yourself. You may even want to break out the Polaroid camera, but maybe that''s going too far.The Empty Roll CrapYou''re done... you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins coldly in your throat. You could use the curtains... no, someone would say, ''Where are the curtains?'' Then what would you say. The rug? Too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that every ''empty roll crapper'' must face... pull up your daks, tighten your arse and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.A mate about to run the London Marathon lined up outside the dozens of portaloos on Blackheath to unload a nervous one and discovered when the business was done and he was ready to run a world record race, there was no paper. Panic. The only thing available was a pound note - the last he possessed because they were being replaced by the coin - and he used that, being careful not to use the side with the Queen''s head, of course!The Splash Back CrapYou send the crap on its way; it drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you''re wet and embarrassed. Tip: blot instead of wipe.The Aborted CrapYou are in mid-crap when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off; go for the phone and save the rest for later. It isn''t pretty, but you''ve gotta do what you''ve gotta do.The Caesarean CrapPain, that''s what this crap and childbirth have in common. It''s simply a case of too much crap trying to go through too small a hole and there''s no obstetrician to help.The Alfresco CrapEveryone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the nature, and a good bush all contribute to the peaceful ambience that our primitive forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of Brownies or a patch of poison ivy.The Tijuana Trot Crap (also known as Delhi Belly, Rabat Runs, Seskatchewan Squits, Balsall Heath Balti Bypass) The phrase ''shit happens'' really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins. For the next 72 hours you''d be better off if you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a fetal position.The Machine Gun CrapYou''re just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like machinegun fire. The guy in the next stall hits the floor like a combat veteran - cradling his umbrella like an AK47.The Sound Effect CrapYou feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or workmates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects: 1. Flush the toilet. 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem. 3. Drop a handful of change on the floor.The Security CrapYou have enough on your mind when you''re in the toilet without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-crap mode. So how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can''t reach to do this... hum loudly.The Cling-On CrapFor the most part you''ve completed your crap, but there''s one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You''re getting impatient. Someone else wants to use the toilet. So you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently on the door has scissors.The Houdini CrapYou go, then you stand up to flush and the damn thing has disappeared. Where''d it go? Did it creep down the pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it lurking out of sight? Should you wipe... maybe you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You''d better, because if you don''t, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.The Hangover CrapYou feel so bad that you don''t know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your intestines like a vice so you sit down again... up down, up down. Don''t you wish Mum was close by.The Porta-Pottie DumpConstruction workers and outdoor concertgoers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best description would be, ''It''s like taking a shit in an upright coffin.'' It''s claustrophobic and it smells bad. Best advice: go in a paper cup.The Proctologist CrapIn the beginning, the Lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn''t create this dump because there is nothing biblical about it. You run out of gas. That''s right, you run out of propulsion. The crap is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You''ve only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you''re a proctologist and go after it yourself. Not a pretty picture is it?The Whole Roll CrapNo matter how much you wipe, it doesn''t seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times too. The whole episode is consumer waste.The Graffiti CrapYou flush the crap and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the crap to the porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way down. You flush again but the curly-Q hangs there... love it or leave it, it''s your choice.The Encore Crap''Ahhh!'' You''re done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the toilet when you feel another crap on its way. You have to return for a curtain call.The Born Again CrapThis is a dump that''s going badly. You say, ''Lord, if I live through this, I''ll take up religion.'' You always get through it, but seldom keep the promises you made in desperation, because a born-again crap is like childbirth - you forget the pain quickly.]

There are two roads to get there.<br /> One is a straight path which takes you there quickly, but it is very plain<br /> and boring. The other is curvy and full of wonderful sights on the way,<br /> but it takes quite a while to reach your loved one''s house.</p>\n<p>Do you choose the short or the long path?</p>\n<p>2) On the way, you see two rose bushes. One is full of red roses, the<br /> other is full of white roses. You decide to pick 20 roses for your love.<br /> You can give your love any kind of color combination of roses that you<br /> choose. All white, 15 red and 5 white, half and half, 19 white and 1 red,<br /> whatever!</p>\n<p>What color combination do you choose?</p>\n<p>3) You finally reach your love''s house.

You can ask the maid to please get your loved one for you, or you<br /> may go upstairs and get your love yourself.</p>\n<p>Do you ask the maid or get your love yourself?</p>\n<p>4) Now, you go upstairs to your love''s room. No one is there. You want to<br /> suprise your love by leaving the roses on the bed or by the windowsill.</p>\n<p>Do you leave the roses on the bed or windowsill?</p>\n<p>5) Later, it''s time for bed. You and your loved one go to sleep in<br /> separate rooms. You wake up early in the morning to check on your love.<br /> You enter the room.</p>\n<p>Is your love awake or sleeping?</p>\n<p>6) It''s time to go now, and you start to head back. You can take either<br /> path home now: the plain, boring one that gets you home fast or the curvy,<br /> sight filled path that you can casually take your time with and enjoy the<br /> view on your way home.</p>\n<p>Do you choose the short or long path home?</p>\n<p>The interpretations are below...

If you chose the long path, hit<br /> takes you a while to trust someone and fall in love.</p>\n<p>2) The number of roses you choose of each color determines how much of<br /> yourself you give in a relationship and how much you expect from the other<br /> person. The number of white is how much of yourself you give, the nuumber<br /> of red is how much you expect from your partner. For example, if you chose<br /> all white, you give yourself fully and unconditionally in a relationship.<br /> If you chose half and half your relationships are equally balanced. Or if<br /> you chose a few more red than white you tend to take a bit more than give<br /> in a relationship.</p>\n<p>3) If you asked the maid to go get your love for you, you tend to avoid<br /> confrontation and ignore problems in your relationship for as long as<br /> possible. If you went to get your loved one yourself you always bring up<br /> problems with your partner and want them resolved quickly. You don''t mind<br /> fighting once in a while.</p>\n<p>4) If you left the roses on the bed, you''re very attached and you want to<br /> see your love all the time. If you left the roses on the windowsill, you<br /> don''t mind just seeing your love once in a while.</p>\n<p>5) If your love is awake you want for them to change. If you chose<br /> sleeping, you love them just the way they are.</p>\n<p>6) If you chose the short path home, you tend to fall out of love easily.<br /> You are fickle and have a tendency to bounce around from relationship to<br /> relationship. It is easy for you to get over someone. If you chose the<br /> long path home, you stay in love for a long time. When you fall, you fall<br /> hard. </p>\n<p>Now..about that wish...]

[Bush and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all. They sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dogfight. They would have 5 years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side''s dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk. After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 " thick and nobody could get near it. When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a strange looking animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the Afghanistani dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it''s cage, and slowly waddled over towards Osama''s dog. Osama''s dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged the American Dachshund---but when it got close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed Osama''s dog in one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all. Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, "We don''t understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves." "That''s nothing,", said Bush. "We had Michael Jackson''s plastic surgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog." GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!]

[Noah''s Ark...If it happened in 2000</p>\n<p>And the Lord spoke to Noah and said "In six months I''m going to make it rain until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people are destroyed.</p>\n<p>But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind of living thing on the planet. I am commanding you to build an Ark." And in a flash of lightning, He delivered the specifications for an Ark, "Okay," said Noah, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints.</p>\n<p>"Six months and it starts to rain," thundered the Lord. "You''d better have the Ark completed, or learn to swim for a very long time." Six months passed, the skies clouded up and rain began to fall. The Lord saw that Noah was sitting in his front yard, weeping. And there was no Ark. "Noah!" shouted the Lord, "where is the Ark?"</p>\n<p>"Lord, please forgive me!" begged Noah. "I did my best. But there were big problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction project, and your plans didn''t meet code. I had to hire an engineer to redraw the plans. Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark needed a fire sprinkler system."</p>\n<p>"Then my neighbor objected, claiming I was violating zoning by building the Ark in my front yard, I had to get a variance from the city planning commission. Then I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark, because there was a ban on cutting trees to save the spotted owl. I had to convince the U.S. Fish and Wildlife that I needed the wood to save the owls. But they wouldn''t let me catch any owls. So, no owls."</p>\n<p>"The carpenters formed a union and went out on strike. I had to negotiate a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board before anyone would pick up a saw or hammer. Now we have sixteen carpenters going on the boat, and still no owls. Then I started gathering up animals, and got sued by an animal rights group. They objected to me taking only two of each kind. Just when I got the suit dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn''t complete the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your proposed flood."</p>\n<p>"They didn''t take kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being. Then the Army Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed new flood plain. So I sent them a globe. Right now, I''m still trying to resolve a complaint from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over how many Croations I''m supposed to hire."</p>\n<p>"The IRS has seized all my assets, claiming I''m trying to avoid paying taxes by leaving the country. And I just got a notice from the state about owing them some kind of use tax. I really don''t think I can finish the Ark for at least another five years," Noah wailed.</p>\n<p>The sky began to clear. The sun began to shine. A rainbow arched across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled, "You mean you''re not going to destroy the earth?" Noah asked hopefully.</p>\n<p>"No," said the Lord sadly.

[Democrats buy most of the books that have been banned somewhere. Republicans form censorship committees and read them as a group. Democrats give their worn out clothes to those less fortunate. Republicans wear theirs. Democrats name their children after currently popular sports figures, politicians, and entertainers. Republican children are named after their parents or grandparents, according to where the money is. Republicans tend to keep their shades drawn, although there is seldom any reason why they should. Democrats ought to, but don''t. Republican boys date Democratic girls. They plan to marry Republican girls, but feel that they''re entitled to a little fun first.

[This is an actual account by a worker at a technical support and service center. One particular customer had an old console-type machine with a print head that would ride back and forth on a spiral shaft.  They also had a big bushy cat who liked to sit on the edge of the printer next to the operator.Well, one day we got a service call that said, "Cat caught in machine, come quick!"When I arrived I saw everyone sitting around mending their various wounds, scratches and contusions.  No sight of the cat.  It appears that while they were running the machine the cat was twirling his tail in his usual fashion and stuck it down into the printer at the most inopportune time and got sucked in! Apparently, the cat absolutely freaked out and clawed at everyone who came close. They finally freed the cat, and to this day, the cat goes nowhere near the machine.]

[The Lord spoke to Noah and said, ''''In six months I am going to make it rain until the whole world is covered with water and all the evil things are destroyed. But, I want to save a few good people and two of every living thing on the planet. I am ordering you to build an ark.'''' And, in a flash of lightning, he delivered the specifications for the ark. ''''OK,'''' Noah said, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints, ''''I''m your man.'''' </p>\n<p>Six months passed, the sky began to cloud up, and the rain began to fall in torrents. The Lord looked down and saw Noah sitting in his yard, weeping, and there was no ark. </p>\n<p>''''Noah!'''' shouted the Lord, ''''Where is My ark?'''' A lightning bolt crashed into the ground right beside Noah. </p>\n<p>''''Lord, please forgive me!'''' begged Noah. ''''I did my best, but there were some big problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the ark''s construction, but Your plans did not meet their code. So, I had to hire an engineer to redo the plans, only to get into a long argument with him about whether to include a sprinkler system. </p>\n<p>''''My neighbors objected, claiming that I was violating zoning ordinances by building the ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city planning board. </p>\n<p>Then, I had a big problem getting enough wood for the ark, because there was a ban on cutting trees to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince the environmentalists and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that I needed the wood to save the owls, but they wouldn''t let me catch them, so no owls. </p>\n<p>''''Next, I started gathering up the animals but got sued by an animal rights group that objected to me taking along only two of each kind. </p>\n<p>''''Just when the suit got dismissed, the EPA notified me that I couldn''t complete the ark without filling out an environmental impact statement on Your proposed flood. They didn''t take kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the Supreme Being. Then, the Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed flood plan. I sent them a globe! </p>\n<p>''''Right now, I''m still trying to resolve a complaint with the Equal Opportunities Commission over how many minorities I''m supposed to hire. The IRS has seized all my assets claiming that I am trying to leave the country, and I just got a notice from the state that I owe some kind of use tax. Really, I don''t think I can finish the ark in less than five years.'''' </p>\n<p>With that, the sky cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow arched across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled. ''''You mean you are not going to destroy the world?'''' he asked hopefully. </p>\n<p>''''No,'''' said the Lord. ''''The government already has.'''']

[Sometimes a story comes along that needs no polishing or enhancement to make it better. This is one of those. It is a real letter submitted to the IRS the midst of 1995''s weird and bizarre denial of dependents, exemptions and credits. The letter speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>Dear Sirs:</p>\n<p>I am responding to your letter denying the deduction for two of the three dependents I claimed on my 1994 Federal Tax return. Thank you, I have questioned whether or not these are my children for years. They are evil and expensive. </p>\n<p>It''s only fair that, since they are minors and no longer my responsibility, the government should know something about them and what to expect over the next year. Please do not try to reassign them to me next year and reinstate the deduction. They are yours! </p>\n<p>The oldest, Kristen, is now 17. She is brilliant. Ask her! I suggest you put her to work in your office where she can answer people''s questions about their returns. While she has no formal training, it has not seemed to hamper her mastery of any subject you can name. Taxes should be a breeze. </p>\n<p>Next year she is going to college. I think it''s wonderful that you will now be responsible for that little expense. While you mull that over, keep in mind that she has a truck. It doesn''t run at the moment, so you have the choice of appropriating some Department of Defense funds to fix the vehicle, or getting up early to drive her to school. </p>\n<p>Kristen also has a boyfriend. Oh joy! While she possesses all of the wisdom of the universe, her alleged mother and I have felt it best to occasionally remind her of the virtues of abstinence, or in the face of overwhelming passion, safe sex. This is always uncomfortable, and I am quite relieved you will be handling this in the future. May I suggest that you reinstate Dr. Jaclyn Elders who had a rather good handle on the problem.</p>\n<p>Patrick is 14. I''ve had my suspicions about this one. His eyes are a little closer together than those of normal people. He may be a tax examiner himself one day, if he is not incarcerated first. In February, I was awakened at three in the morning by a police officer who was bringing Pat home. He and his friends were TP''ing houses. </p>\n<p>In the future, would you like him delivered to the local IRS office, or to Ogden, UT? Kids at 14 will do almost anything on a dare. His hair is purple. Permanent dye, temporary dye, what''s the big deal? Learn to deal with it. You''ll have plenty of time, as he is sitting out a few days of school after instigating a food fight in the cafeteria. </p>\n<p>I''ll take care of filing your phone number with the vice principal.

Most people under twenty understand the curious patois she fashioned out of valley girls/boys in the hood/reggae/yuppie/political double speak. The school sends her to a speech pathologist who has her roll her r''s. It added a refreshing Mexican/Irish touch to her voice. </p>\n<p>She wears hats backwards, baggy pants, and wants one of her ears pierced four more times. There is a fascination with tattoos that worries me, but I am sure that you can handle it. Bring a truck when you come to get her, she sort of "nests" in her room and I think that it would be easier to move the entire thing than find out what it is really made of. </p>\n<p>You denied two of the three exemptions, so it is only fair that you get to pick which two you will take.

[While walking down the street one day, a Republican head of state is tragically hit by a truck and dies. His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. </p>\n<p>"Welcome to Heaven," says St. Peter. "Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we''re not sure what to do with you."</p>\n<p>"No problem, just let me in." says the Republican.</p>\n<p>"Well, I''d like to but I have orders from higher up.   What we''ll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity."</p>\n<p>"Really, I''ve made up my mind. I want to be in Heaven," says the Republican head of state.</p>\n<p>"I''m sorry but we have our rules." And with that, St. Peter escorts the Republican to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course.   In the distance is a club and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him, everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, hug him, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at expense of the people.   They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar. Also present is the Devil (a Republican, too), who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes.</p>\n<p>They are having such a good time that, before he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator<br /> rises. The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.</p>\n<p>"Now it''s time to visit Heaven." So 24 hours pass with the Republican head of state joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.</p>\n<p>"Well then, you''ve spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now choose your eternity."</p>\n<p>He reflects for a minute, then the head of state answers: "Well, I would never have thought it, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in Hell."</p>\n<p>So Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. The Devil comes over to the Republican and lays an arm on his neck.</p>\n<p>"I don''t understand," stammers the Republican head of state. Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and club and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.</p>\n<p>The Devil looks at him, smiles and says, "Yesterday we were campaigning.  Today you voted for us!"]

Mr. Jennings guessed.</p>\n<p>"No, I''m sorry," Mr. Trebek replied.  "The correct question is, ''What is a thriving Middle Eastern democracy and a beacon of hope for the entire region?''"</p>\n<p>Mr. Bush, disappointed by Mr. Jennings'' performance, reportedly told aides, "Ken Jennings may be the smartest man in the world but when it comes to Iraq he''s as dumb as a post."</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, in yet another embarrassment for CBS, the network today acknowledged that "not everyone" loves Raymond.]

[Ignoring the fact that George Bush declined Saddam Hussein''s challenge to a<br /> televised debate, Tim Dowling exclusively reveals what could have happened had<br /> they met Tuesday February 25, 2003 </p>\n<p>Tony Blair, moderator: Welcome to the first televised debate between George W.<br /> Bush and Saddam Hussein, live from United Nations headquarters in New York. We<br /> will begin with a brief opening statement from each of you. </p>\n<p>Bush: First of all I would just like to welcome my evil friend to the UN, one<br /> of the great American institutions for the propulsion of freedom throughout the<br /> world. </p>\n<p>Saddam: Thank you, Great Satan. I hope that in today''s debate we may find some<br /> common ground between the Iraqi people''s commitment to peace and human progress<br /> and America''s desire to destroy the Middle East. </p>\n<p>Bush: Do I answer that? </p>\n<p>Blair: No. The first question is quite simply this: do you have any links with<br /> al-Qaida? </p>\n<p>Bush: I do not. </p>\n<p>Blair: The question is for Saddam. </p>\n<p>Saddam: As I told Mr. Tony Benn clearly and simply, if I had links with<br /> al-Qaida and I enjoyed those links then I would not be ashamed to tell the<br /> world, but since I am ashamed to tell the world of this, it follows that I have<br /> no such links. </p>\n<p>Bush: Neither do I. </p>\n<p>Blair: The second question is for President Bush. President Bush, if America<br /> and Iraq were to go to war tomorrow, who would win? </p>\n<p>Bush: That''s easy. America, right? </p>\n<p>Saddam: Even I knew that one. </p>\n<p>Bush: That''s because the great United American States of America are on the<br /> side of rightliness and Americanity, against an evil Axis of Evil made up of<br /> Iraq, North Korea and... how many are in an axis? Three? </p>\n<p>Blair: I think you''re allowed as many as you like. </p>\n<p>Bush: OK, Iraq, North Korea and France.! </p>\n<p>Saddam: I will tell you frankly and directly that Iraq is not part of any Axis<br /> of Evil. </p>\n<p>Bush: Who am I thinking of then? Irania? </p>\n<p>Blair: Let''s move on. Saddam, are you willing to destroy your stockpile of<br /> Samoud 2 missiles in accordance with UN weapons inspectors'' orders? </p>\n<p>Saddam: I explain to you now that if Iraq possessed these so-called weapons,<br /> we would never destroy them, but since we do not have any such weapons, we are<br /> happy to comply, even though these non-existent weapons certainly do not exceed<br /> the proscribed range of 150 kms. I''ve tested them myself, and we don''t have any. </p>\n<p>Blair: The final question is for George Bush. Mr President, is there any way<br /> that Saddam Hussein can avoid war, and what steps must he now take in order to<br /> reach a negotiated solution? </p>\n<p>Bush: Listen to me. It''s very simple. First Saddam must compile 200% with the<br /> UN inspectorers, and I mean activated compilation, not passivist compilation.<br /> Second, he must disarm fully, in keeping with UN revelation 1441 and the next<br /> one coming, 1441B, which will require him to disarm even more fully than that.<br /> Then he must destroy all Samoud missiles and any other weapons of mass<br /> destruction he is found, or not found, to be possessive of, without being asked.<br /> Finally, there is one more task he must perform, which I am not at liberty to<br /> revulge. And even that will not be enough. </p>\n<p>Blair: The translator would like to take your answer home with him and work on<br /> it over the weekend. </p>\n<p>Bush: Fine, but we require nothing less than total disarmature. </p>\n<p>Saddam: OK. </p>\n<p>Blair: Sorry, but I''m not sure that "disarmature" is a word. I defer to the UN<br /> Keeper of the Dictionary, Mr Richard Stilgoe. </p>\n<p>Stilgoe: Yes, you can have disarmature. It means, "the action of disarming"<br /> according to the OED. </p>\n<p>Bush: Exactly. He must cut his own arms off. </p>\n<p>Saddam: If it means peace, I will do it. </p>\n<p>Bush: Too late. </p>\n<p>Stilgoe: Did you know that Saddam Hussein is an anagram of ''Demands a Sushi''? </p>\n<p>Saddam: Yes, I''ve heard them all. </p>\n<p>Bush: I don''t eat sushi. Is there a fish option? </p>\n<p>Blair: I''d like to remind everyone at home that the Monica Lewinsky-Tonya<br /> Harding fight follows after the break.]

[I have only one firm belief in the American political system, and that is this: God is a Republican and Santa Claus is a Democrat. </p>\n<p>God is an elderly or, at any rate, middle-aged male, a stern fellow, patriarchal rather than paternal and a great believer in rules and regulations. He holds men strictly accountable for their actions. He has little apparent concern for the material well-being of the disadvantaged. He is politically connected, socially powerful and holds the mortgage on literally everything in the world. God is difficult. God is unsentimental. It is very hard to get into God''s heavenly country club. </p>\n<p>Santa Claus is another matter. He''s cute. He non-threatening. He''s always cheerful. And he loves animals. He may know who''s been naughty and who''s been nice, but he never does anything about it. He gives everyone everything they want without thought of a quid pro quo. He works hard for charities, and he''s famously generous to the poor. Santa Claus is preferable to God in every way but one: There is no such thing as Santa Claus.]

[Bill Clinton went to sleep at his desk one afternoon and had a strange dream. In the dream, he died and went to hell. When he gets there, Satan greets him and tells him that he will be there for all eternity, but, because of the way he behaved on earth while living, he gets to choose the type of punishment he will receive.Satan escorts him around and they come to a room where Newt Gingrich is stretched out on a rack, screaming in agony as the wheel is turned. Clinton says, "Nope, I don''t think I''d like that kind of punishment." So they go on to the next room.There was Bob Dole, tied to a long pole and suspended over a large tub of raw sewage. He is lowered into the tank until completely submerged. After a few minutes he is lifted out of the tank, gasping and fighting for breath. As soon as he gets his breath back, he''s lowered again. "uh-uh!" says Clinton. "That''s not for me."Finally they come to a room where Kenneth Starr is hanging from the wall by his thumbs. His pants are down around his ankles, and Monica Lewinsky is performing oral sex on him. Clinton says "OK, if I have to be punished forever, I''ll go for that way."Satan says, "Fine. . . that will be your punishment for the next billion years. Monica! Your replacement is here!"]
[When you''re 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: "Just because you''ve reached middle age, that doesn''t mean you shouldn''t take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it."</p>\n<p>This is the voice of Satan.</p>\n<p>I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales.</p>\n<p>I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. "I''ll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets" is a typical breakfast order for me these days.</p>\n<p>This is because I went snowboarding.</p>\n<p>For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough.</p>\n<p>These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, "Cool."</p>\n<p>People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together.</p>\n<p>We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill).</p>\n<p>If anybody asks if you''re OK, you say, "I''m just catching my breath!" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you''re going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you''re planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw.</p>\n<p>At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance.</p>\n<p>So I thought I''d take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing.</p>\n<p>In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range.</p>\n<p>Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can''t stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you.</p>\n<p>Skiers hate snowboarders. It''s a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc.</p>\n<p>Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd.</p>\n<p>I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope.</p>\n<p>Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who''s going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete.</p>\n<p>You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.)</p>\n<p>We learned snowboarding via a two step method:</p>\n<p>STEP ONE: Watching Brad do something.</p>\n<p>STEP TWO: Trying to do it ourselves.</p>\n<p>I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics.</p>\n<p>I''d struggle to my feet, and I''d be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot.</p>\n<p>"Keep your knees bent!" Brad would yell, helpfully.</p>\n<p>Have you noticed that whatever sport you''re trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if THAT would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, "FORGET MY KNEES! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE GRAVITY CHUNKS!"</p>\n<p>Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me.</p>\n<p>If I hadn''t gotten out of there, they''d have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding.</p>\n<p>So I think, when my body heals, I''ll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you''ll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.]

[Turmoil rocked Heaven this morning as allegations arose that God had had an affair with a former worshiper.</p>\n<p>The scandal was begun when a 21 year old woman, known only as Mary, claimed that she had given birth to God''s "only son" last week in a barn in the hamlet of Bethlehem.</p>\n<p>Sources close to Mary claim that she "had loved God for a long time," that she was constantly talking about her relationship with God, and that she was "thrilled to have had his child."</p>\n<p>In a press conference this morning, God issued a vehement denial, saying that "No sexual relationship existed" and that "the facts of this story will come out in time, verily."</p>\n<p>Independent counsel Kenneth Beazulbub immediately filed a brief with the Justice department to expand his investigation to cover questions of whether any commandments may have been broken, and whether God had illegally funneled laundered money to his illegitimate child through three foreign operatives identified only as the "Wise Men".</p>\n<p>Beazulbub has issued subpoenas to several angels who are rumored to have acted as go-betweens in the affair.</p>\n<p>Critics have pointed out that these allegations have little to do with the charges that Beazulbub was originally appointed to investigate, that God had created large-scale flooding in order to cover up evidence of a failed land deal.</p>\n<p>In recent months, Beazulbub''s investigation has already been expanded to cover questions surrounding the large number of locusts that plagued God''s political opponents in the last election, as well as to claims that the giveaway of a parcel of public land in Promised County to a Jewish special interest group was quid pro quo for political contributions.</p>\n<p>Some journalists have speculated that the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gommorah may have been to divert attention away from God''s political problems. If these allegations prove to be true, this could be a huge blow to God''s career, much of which has been spent crusading for stricter moral standards and harsher punishments for wrongdoers.</p>\n<p>Known for his fiery oratory, God has sometimes been criticized for his political theatrics, as when he introduced the bill he styled "The Ten Commandments" by appearing as a burning bush on the Senate floor.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, however, it is unlikely that a sitting God can be removed from power. Most legal scholars are in agreement that indicting God would constitute taking His name in vain.]

Remember to drive on the right side of the road at all times, except when passing an older tractor or a buddy in a wagon.</p>\n<p>5. En route always buy a full tank of gas. A dollar''s worth at a time requires too many gas stops.</p>\n<p>6. On arrival in Washington, immediately get settled in a tourist or boarding house. If they don''t feed, try to locate near an all-nite cafe. Leave soda crackers, Viennas, R.C. Colas and Moon Pies In car or pick-up. First class tourist homes do not take kindly to guests who prepare food in their sleeping rooms.</p>\n<p>7. Do not take live chickens or hogs - for some reason people in Virginia think that they have good hams. For the sake of national unity, we don''t want to show them up. Besides, their dogs would chase our chickens and our hogs would eat their dogs... just making a hell of a mess.</p>\n<p>8. Do not take Sears catalog or corn cobbs with you. Up there the out-houses are always inside and they furnish a rolled paper substitute, but remember to turn the knob on the white bowl as this is a house rule and creates less air pollution problems. Brother Al Gore gets all heated about this pollution and we don''t want to set him off.</p>\n<p>9. If invited by a county agent, fertilizer manufacturer''s representative or hog vaccine manufacturer''s salesman to have a drink in his hotel room, do not spit tobacco juice on the carpeted floor. When asked what you drink, don''t say "stump juice". Tell them all classy people from Arkansas drink B&amp;B (Bourbon and Branch water).</p>\n<p>10. And above all else - don''t let any Yankee show you up. Constant screaming of "He''s a good ole boy" will make it difficult for them to engage you in conversation on their intelligence level. You can also keep up the chant started by Cousin Slick, "It''s time for change!" As you know, we plan a change of underwear on the first of every month. First cousins change with second cousins, but always keep it in the family. Willie has passed a decree, even when divorced you can still be cousins in Arkansas.]

The angel took Al Gore into a room full of<br /> clocks the clocks second hand represented how many times they<br /> had lied in their life. Looking around, He saw mother Teresa''s<br /> whose hand only moved once an hour The second one was George<br /> Washington whose moved 30 seconds and hour after seeing everyone<br /> he knew he noticed Bill Clinton''s was missing so he asked the<br /> Angel where Bills was and the Angel said "oh, Jesus has it in<br /> his room.

[''Twas the night before crisis,<br /> And behind White House doors,<br /> Not a creature was stirring,<br /> Especially Al Gore.

When on the East Lawn,<br /> There arose such a clatter,<br /> Even Sam Donaldson<br /> Lost control of his bladder. Away to our TVs<br /> We flew like a flash,<br /> There''s a special report,<br /> And it''s pre-empting M*A*S*H! And what to our wondering<br /> Eyes should appear,<br /> But a homely lil'' troll,<br /> With tapes for us to hear. With a K-Mart bought blazer,<br /> And a bad frizzy ''do,<br /> And a tale to be told-<br /> To me, and to you. On the chair! On the carpet!<br /> On the Oval Office desk!<br /> With a chubby young intern,<br /> Who was all eyes and chest. The Pres had been careless,<br /> Indeed, dumb and dumber.<br /> Now the whole world knew<br /> Bubba Had gotten a hummer. And Monica Lewinsky<br /> Emerged from the rubble,<br /> If she''d just kept her mouth shut,<br /> We''d not have all this trouble. And thus set in motion,<br /> A whole web o'' spiders,<br /> With pundits galore,<br /> And "White House insiders. You ask, "Who would care<br /> About Bill and his penis?"<br /> Republican Ken Starr,<br /> And he''s armed with subpoenas! More rapid than eagles,<br /> Process servers, they flew!<br /> "Here''s one for you!<br /> And for you! And you, too!" "Now Jordan! Now Cockell!<br /> Is there anyone else?!?<br /> Let''s subpoena the lawyers!<br /> And Bubba himself!!" "We want you to tell us<br /> About Bill''s private life,<br /> And anyone he sleeps with,<br /> ''cept, of course, his wife." And many months later,<br /> After long we''ve all suffered,<br /> Let''s examine more closely<br /> Just what Starr''s uncovered. We''ve learned "Little Bill"<br /> Has a mind of his own,<br /> And - horror of horrors -<br /> He likes to get blown! A funny fact surfaced,<br /> After 40 million bucks:<br /> Seems most people don''t care<br /> Just who Clinton, er, makes love to. The economy''s great,<br /> And shows no signs of slowing.<br /> Hell, we hope Ms. Lewinsky<br /> NEVER stops blowing! Now the public''s grown weary.<br /> Will this sleaze never end?<br /> We just want to get back<br /> To "E.R.", and to "Friends." Now Monica, Linda-<br /> And Ken Starr, you suck -<br /> Get the hell off my TV,<br /> Your 15 minutes are up.]

[The Perfect Dump -- Every once in a while, each of us experiences a perfect dump, it''s rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects. You sit down expecting the worst, but what you get is a smooth sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. But that''s not the end of it. You use some toilet tissue only to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it. The Beer Dump -- Talk about nasty dumps. Depending on the dumper''s tolerance, the beer dump is the end result of too many beers. it could have been 2 or 22, it doesn''t matter. What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy dump accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.  The Chili Dump - Hot when it goes in, and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chili dump stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a heat shield. The Cable Dump -- Long, curly and perfectly formed like 2 feet of E13 telephone CO-axial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. You wonder admiringly, ''''DID I DO THAT? Where did it come from?'''' you leave the bathroom pleased with yourself.  The Latrine Dump -- In case you didn''t know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it where soldiers, boy scouts and flies go to dump. Tip: Don''t ever, ever look in the hole.  The Mona Lisa Dump -- This is the masterpiece of dumps. It''s as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that would make da Vinci weep. And just think, you made it yourself. You may even want to break out the Polaroid, but maybe that''s going a bit too far.  The Empty Roll Dump - You''re done...you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins coldly in your throat. You could use the curtains...no, someone would say ''''Where are the curtains?'''' Then what would you say? The rug?...too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that every ''''empty roll dumper'''' must face...Pull up your slacks, tighten your tush and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.  The Splash-Back Dump - You send the dump on its way, it drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you''re wet and embarrassed. Tip: Blot instead of wiping.  The Aborted Dump - You are in mid-dump when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off, go for the phone, and save the rest for later. It isn''t pretty, but you''ve gotta do what you gotta do.  The Alfresco Dump -- Everyone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the nature, and a good bush all contribute to the peaceful ambiance that our primitive forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of Brownies or a patch of poison ivy.  The Childbirth Dump -- This is a dump that is simply too big to go through the aperture provided by nature for the purpose. You sit there, thinking over your dilemma. First it hurts, and it isn''t going to get any better. You wonder if you''ll ever see your loved ones again. You imagine the newspaper headlines screaming ''''Man dies trying to hatch monster loaf.'''' You realize you''ll have to resolve the crisis before you can leave the bathroom. Basically there are only three things you can do: Scream, call an Obstetrician, or just hope like hell have enough Vaseline to get you through it.  The Tijuana Trot Dump -- The phrase ''''Shit Happens'''' really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins. For the next 72 hours you''d be better off if you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a fetal position. Now you realize why Mexico never had a navy.  The Machine Gun Dump -- You''re just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like machine gun fire. The guy in the next stall hits the floor like a combat veteran, cradling his umbrella like an M16 and shrieking something about �酶惟damn Commies.�酶惟  The Sound Effect Dump -- You feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or work mates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects: flush the toilet, sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem, or drop a handful of quarters on the floor  The Security Dump -- You have enough on your mind when you''re in the bathroom without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-dump mode. So how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can''t reach to do this... hum loudly.  The Cling-On Dump -- For the most part you''ve completed your dump, but there''s one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You''re getting impatient. Someone else wants to use your stall. So, you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the bowl water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently on the door has scissors.  The Houdini Dump -- You go, then you stand up to flush, and the darn thing has disappeared. Where''d it go? Did it creep down the pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it lurking out of sight? Should you wipe...maybe you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You''d better, because if you don''t, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.  The Flu Dump -- You feel so bad that you don''t know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your intestines like a vice so you sit down again...up down up down. Don''t you wish Mom were close by?  The Porta-Pottie Dump -- Construction workers and outdoor concert goers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best description would be, �酶惟It''s like taking a shit in an upright coffin.�酶惟 It''s claustrophobic and it smells bad... best advice... go in a paper cup.  The Proctologist Dump -- In the beginning, the Lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn''t create this dump, because there is nothing biblical about it -- you run out of gas. That''s right, you run out of propulsion. The dump is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You''ve only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you''re a proctologist and go after it yourself. Not a pretty picture is it??  The Whole Roll Dump -- No matter how much you wipe, it doesn''t seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times too. The whole episode is consumer waste.  The Graffiti Dump -- You flush the dump and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the dump to the porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way down. You flush again but the curlicue hangs there...love it or leave it. Its your choice.  The Encore Dump - Ahhhh, you''re done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the bathroom when you feel another dump coming. You have to return for a curtain call. The world''s record is seven encores.  The Born Again Dump - This is a dump that''s going so badly, you say �酶惟Lord, if I live through this, I''ll take up religion.�酶惟 You always get through it, but seldom keep the promise you made in desperation, because a born again dump is like childbirth... you forget the pain quickly.]

[Ollie and Olga were two Norwegians in the United States who were<br /> madly in love. They decided to be married in the middle of duck<br /> hunting season and have their honeymoon in Minnesota. They could<br /> not afford to fly, so the had to take a bus from Chicago through<br /> Wisconsin with a bunch of duck hunters. The bus is driving<br /> along, and all of a sudden it breaks down in the middle of<br /> Milwaukee. So while they are waiting, the duck hunters go inside<br /> a coffee shop. Outside, Ollie, who is much to anxious to wait<br /> for Minnesota, asks Olga, "Hey Olga, you vant to mess around in<br /> the bushes?" </p>\n<p>Olga replies quite upset, "No! I vant to vait until Minnesota so<br /> it tis right!"

[Dear Sirs,I am responding to your letter denying the deduction for two of the three dependents I claimed on my 1994 Federal Tax return. Thank you. I have questioned whether these are my children for years. They are evil and expensive.<br /> It''s only fair that since they are minors and not my responsibility that the government (who evidently is taxing me more to care for these waifs) knows something about them and what to expect over the next year. You may apply next year to reassign them to me and reinstate the deduction. This year they are yours!</p>\n<p>The oldest, Kristen, is now 17. She is brilliant. Ask her. I suggest you put her to work in your office where she can answer people''s questions about their returns. While she has no formal training, it has not seemed to hamper her knowledge of any other subject you can name. Taxes should be a breeze.Next year she is going to college. I think it''s wonderful that you will now be responsible for that little expense. While you mull that over keep in mind she has a truck. It doesn''t run at the moment so you have the immediate decision of appropriating some Department of Defense funds to fix the vehicle or getting up early to drive her to school. Kristen also has a boyfriend. Oh joy. While she possesses all the wisdom of the universe, her alleged mother and I have felt it best to occasionally remind her of the virtues of abstinence. This is always uncomfortable and I am quite relieved you will be handling this in the future. </p>\n<p>Patrick is 14. I''ve had my suspicions about this one. His eyes are a little close together for normal people. He may be a tax examiner himself one day if you do not incarcerate him first. In February I was awakened at three in the morning by a police officer who was bringing Pat home. He and his friends were TP''ing houses. In the future would you like him delivered to the local IRS office or to Ogden, UT? Kids at 14 will do almost anything on a dare. His hair is purple. Permanent dye, temporary dye, what''s the big deal? Learn to deal with it. You''ll have plenty of time as he is sitting out a few days of school after instigating a food fight. I''ll take care of filing your phone number with the vice principal. Oh yes, he and his friends have raging hormones. This is a house of testosterone and it will be much more peaceful when he lives in your home. DO NOT leave any of them unsupervised with girls, explosives, inflammables, inflatable, vehicles, or telephones. (I''m sure that you will find telephones a source of unimaginable amusement, and be sure to lock out the 900 and 976 numbers])</p>\n<p>Heather is an alien. She slid through a time warp and appeared quite by magic one year. I''m sure this one is yours. She is 10 going on 21. She came from a bad trip in the sixties. She wears tie-dyed clothes, beads, sandals,and hair that looks like Tiny Tim''s. Fortunately you will be raising mt taxes to help offset the pinch of her remedial reading courses. Hooked On Phonics is expensive so the schools dropped it. Good news! You can buy it yourself for half the amount of the deduction that you are denying! It''s quite obvious that we were terrible parents (ask the other two) so they have helped raise this one to a new level of terror. She cannot speak English.Most people under twenty understand the curious patois she fashioned out of valley girls/boys in the hood/reggae/yuppie/ political doublespeak. I don''t. The school sends her to a speech pathologist who has her roll her R''s. It added a refreshing Mexican/Irish touch to her voice. She wears hats backwards, pants baggy and wants one of her ears pierced four more times.There is a fascination with tattoos that worries me but I am sure that you can handle it. Bring a truck when you come to get her, she sort of "nests"in her room and I think that it would be easier to move the entire thing than find out what it is really made of.</p>\n<p>You denied two of the three exemptions so it is only fair you get to pick which two you will take. I prefer that you take the youngest, I still go bankrupt with Kristen''s college but then I am free. If you take the two oldest then I still have time for counseling before Heather becomes a teenager. If you take the two girls then I won''t feel so bad about putting Patrick in a military academy. Please let me know of your decision as soon as possible as I have already increased the withholding on my W-4 to cover the $395 in additional tax and made a down payment on an airplane.</p>\n<p>Yours Truly,"Bob"</p>\n<p>Note: The taxpayer in question was allowed the deductions.]

[You might be a redneck if...You surf the net primarily for tater gun building instructions. Your car is the only one in a parking lot and you can''t find it. You think your IQ is the number of coons you shot out of season. You ever wonder what happened to that nice John F. Kennedy boy. The fuel for your main mode of transportation is oats. You''ve run out of room on your arm from the tattoos of all wives names. You refuse to wash your truck on account that you have a strong suspicion that mud and rust is all that''s holding it together. People mistakenly come to your house thinking your having a yard sale. You''ve ever told the local sheriff that you smell a pig and he replies, "I knew I should have taken a shower after I slopped the hogs today." Your idea of a luxury car is one that has the white fur covered seats in it.You think the internet is a new fishing tool. There''s a pothole in the road and you swerve . . . to hit it. Your Truck has more Neon on it than the window of your local bar. You argue to the government that the budwiser plant should be one of the 7 wonders of the world.Your kids can''t go out for Hollween because there''s nobody within walking distance to get candy from.You buy the lot next to your house because you need the room for all your "stuff" (cars, trucks building materials). Your idea of new siding on the house is more tar paper. The oak tree in the front yard is an essential piece of automotive repair equipment (how else are you gonna pull the engine out of the old Dodge?) Instead of locking the doors of your house, you keep a shotgun within reach, "just in case".You consider pickled deer organs a delicacy.]

[And the Lord spoke to Noah and said, "In six months I''m going to make it<br /> rain until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people<br /> are destroyed. But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind<br /> of living thing on the planet. I am commanding you to build an Ark." And<br /> in a flash of lightning, He delivered the specifications for an Ark. </p>\n<p>"Okay," said Noah, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints.<br /> Six months passed, the skies clouded up and rain began to fall. The Lord<br /> saw that there was no Ark. </p>\n<p>"Noah," shouted the Lord, "Where is the Ark?" </p>\n<p>"Lord, please forgive me!" begged Noah. "I did my best. But there were big<br /> problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction<br /> project, and your plans didn''t meet code. So I had to hire an engineer to<br /> redraw the plans."</p>\n<p>"Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark needed a fire<br /> sprinkler system. "</p>\n<p>"Then my neighbor objected, claiming I was violating zoning by building<br /> the Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city<br /> planning commission."</p>\n<p>"Then I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark, because there was a<br /> ban on cutting trees to save the Spotted Owl. I had to convince the U.S.<br /> Fish and Wildlife that I need the wood to save the owls. But they wouldn''t<br /> let me catch any owls. So, no owls."</p>\n<p>"The carpenters formed a union and went out on strike. I had to negotiate<br /> a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board before anyone would<br /> pick up a saw or hammer. Now we have sixteen carpenters going on the boat,<br /> and still no owls."</p>\n<p>"Just when I got the suit dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn''t<br /> complete the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your<br /> proposed flood. They didn''t take kindly to the idea that they had no<br /> jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being."</p>\n<p>"Then the Army Corp of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed new flood<br /> plain. I sent them a globe. The IRS has seized all my assets, claiming I''m<br /> trying to avoid paying taxes by leaving the country."</p>\n<p>"I really don''t think I can finish the Ark for at least another five<br /> years," The sky began to clear. The sun began to shine. A rainbow arched<br /> across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled. </p>\n<p>"You mean you''re not going to destroy the earth?" Noah asked hopefully. </p>\n<p>"No," said the Lord sadly. "The government already has."]

[***The Rules Of Bedroom Golf!***</p>\n<p>1.  Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play - normally one club and two balls.</p>\n<p>2.  Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.</p>\n<p>3.  Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out.</p>\n<p>4.  For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.<br /> Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.</p>\n<p>5.  Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to the hole.</p>\n<p>6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary<br /> until the course owner is satisfied that play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.</p>\n<p>7.  It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special attention to well formed bunkers.</p>\n<p>8.  Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played , or are currently playing, to the owner of the course being played. Upset course owners have been known to damage players equipment for this reason.</p>\n<p>9.  Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection.</p>\n<p>10. Players should ensure themselves that their match has been<br /> properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time. Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course.</p>\n<p>11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all<br /> times. Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course<br /> to be temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play when this is the case.</p>\n<p>12. The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush around the hole to allow for improved viewing of,<br /> alignment with, and approach to the hole.</p>\n<p>13. Players are advised to obtain the course owners permission<br /> before attempting to play the back nine.</p>\n<p>14. Slow play is encouraged. However, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owners request.</p>\n<p>15. It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.]

[George W. Bush was giving a third-grader a lesson on politics. First he asked<br /> the kid to write "The President" on the blackboard.<br /> Then Bush asked the child what he thought the President should accomplish and<br /> the child replied, "Protect the environment and clean up the air."<br /> Dubya countered, "Why should the clouds be white and the water be blue when<br /> they could be all kinds of cool colors? Is that so terrible. Can''t we agree on<br /> it? Can you spell "Is" and "We"?<br /> The boy spells out "Is" then "We" on the blackboard.<br /> "My friends at the oil companies can make chemicals to make trees tall. If<br /> fact, they already did. Can you write, "tall" and "did"?<br /> The boy writes the words on the blackboard.<br /> "Now young man, what have you learned from your talk with the President?"<br /> The boys stand up and read what he has written on the blackboard aloud: "The<br /> President is we tall did."]
[During a neighborhood party, Joe got into an argument with his neighbor, about<br /> presidential politics. Finally, the neighbor asked me why Joe was such a<br /> dedicated Republican.<br /> Joe told him that his father and grandfather were both Republicans and he was<br /> carrying on the family tradition. </p>\n<p>"That''s it?" said the exasperated neighbor. "What if your father and<br /> grandfather had been horse thieves?" </p>\n<p>"Well..." Joe replied, "I suppose then I''d be a Democrat like you."]
[This just in: Monica Lewinsky, in a statement released today, countered<br /> President Clinton''s firm denial: "I have had enough. This whole experience has<br /> left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I can''t stomach any more. I feel as if I am<br /> getting the shaft, that this ugly matter has come to a head and has blown up in<br /> my face. This may be a load to handle, but when things are hard, that is when I<br /> am at my best. I have faced hard things in the past, and I know what is coming.<br /> will meet this challenge the only way I know how ... head on. I have licked<br /> bigger things than this before, and I will again. No one will ever be able to<br /> say that Monica Lewinsky isn''t a finisher, that she quit before the job was<br /> done.  I will work nonstop and fight this, blow by blow, until I am wiped clean<br /> of this dirty affair.  I will not be stained by it. "  Thank you,  Monica<br /> Lewinsky.]
