A blonde bought two horses, and could never remember which was<br /> which.</p>\n<p>A neighbor suggested that she cut the tail of one horse and that<br /> worked great until the other horse got his tail caught in a<br /> bush. It tore just right and looked exactly like the other<br /> horse''s tail and our friend was stuck again.</p>\n<p>The neighbor suggested her to notch the ear of one horse. That<br /> worked fine until the other horse caught his ear on a barbed<br /> wire fence.

When<br /> she did, she was very pleased to find that the white horse was 2<br /> inches taller than the black.

Bill Clinton is visiting a school. In one class, he asks the<br /> students if anyone can give him an example of a "TRAGEDY". One<br /> little boy stands up and offers, "If my best friend who lives<br /> next door was playing in the street when a car came along and<br /> killed him, that would be a TRAGEDY." "No," Clinton says, "That<br /> would be an ACCIDENT."</p>\n<p>A girl raises her hand. "If a school bus carrying fifty children<br /> drove off a cliff, killing everyone involved... that would be a<br /> TRAGEDY." I''m afraid not," explains Clinton. "That is what we<br /> would call a GREAT LOSS." The room is silent; none of the other<br /> children volunteer. "What?" asks Clinton. "Isn''t there any one<br /> here who can give me an example of a TRAGEDY?"</p>\n<p>Finally, a boy in the back raises his hand. In a timid voice, he<br /> speaks: "If an airplane carrying Bill and Hillary Clinton were<br /> blown up by a bomb, that would be a TRAGEDY." "Wonderful!"<br /> Clinton beams. "Marvelous! And can you tell me WHY that would be<br /> a TRAGEDY?"</p>\n<p>"Well," says the boy, "because it wouldn''t be an ACCIDENT, and<br /> it certainly would be no GREAT LOSS!"

So I went out onto the balcony, we live on the 25th<br /> floor, and found this man hanging over the edge by his fingertips. I went<br /> inside, got a hammer, and started hitting his hands. He fell, but landed in some<br /> bushes. So, I got the refrigerator and pushed it over the balcony and it crushed<br /> him. The strain of the act gave me a heart attack, and I died."<br /> St. Peter couldn''t deny that this was a pretty bad day, and since it was a<br /> crime of passion, he let the man in.<br /> He then asked the next man in line about the day he died. "Well, sir, it was<br /> awful," said the second man. "I was doing aerobics on the balcony of my 26th<br /> floor apartment when I twisted my ankle and slipped over the edge. I managed to<br /> grab the balcony of the apartment below, but some maniac came out and started<br /> pounding on my fingers with a hammer. Luckily I landed in some bushes. But, then<br /> the guy dropped a refrigerator on me!"<br /> St. Peter chuckled, let him into heaven and decided he could really start to<br /> enjoy this job.<br /> "Tell me about the day you died?�酶惟 he said to the third man in line.<br /> "OK, picture this; I''m naked, hiding inside a refrigerator...."

Two nude statues (one male and one female) had been standing in a beautiful park for 99 years. </p>\n<p>On their 100th anniversary in the park an angel came down from heaven to talk to the statues.</p>\n<p>He said to them, ''God has been watching you for the past 100 years and has been very pleased with the two of you. So pleased in fact that he has decided to make you human for a short time.''</p>\n<p>The angel then went on to say that they would be human for 15 minutes and would finally be able to pleasure themselves in a manner in which they have only fantasized about for the last 100 years.</p>\n<p>The statues were so excited they could hardly believe it. The second they became human they ran off together behind the bushes. The angel heard the rustling of the bushes and shouts of joy and laughter.</p>\n<p>After 10 minutes the statues returned from behind the bushes sweating and laughing. The angel told the statues that they still had five more minutes.</p>\n<p>The male statue quickly turned to the female statue and said:<br /> `Cool, this time, you hold down the pigeon and I''ll shit on its head.''

I feel as if I''m getting the shaft, that this ugly matter has come to a head and blown up in my face.</p>\n<p>This may be a load to handle, but when things are hard, that''s when I am at my best.

The President was so impressed, touched, and amused that he instructed his secretary to send the little boy a $5.00 bill.  President Bush thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy.The little boy was delighted with the $5.00 and sat down to write a thank you note to God, which read:Dear God,Thank you very much for sending the money, however, I noticed that for some reason you had to send it through Washington D.C. and, as usual, those crooks deducted $95.00.

In olden times, it could be decades before major events were cast in verse.<br /> But The Great 2000 Election Controversy is so big that a bunch of all-star poets<br /> have come out of retirement to quickly set the story to rhyme.</p>\n<p>For starters, history buff Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:<br /> Listen, my children, don''t dare ignore,<br /> The midnight actions of Bush and Gore<br /> In early November, the year ought-ought,<br /> Hard to believe the mess they wrought.<br /> Two billion bucks of campaign bounty<br /> All came down to Palm Beach County.<br /> What result could have been horrider<br /> Than the situation we found in Florider?</p>\n<p>Edgar Allan Poe is his usual gloomy self:<br /> Once upon a campaign dreary, one which left us weak and weary<br /> O''er many a quaint and curious promise of political lore<br /> While we nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a yapping,<br /> As of some votes overlapping, energy-zapping to the core<br /> "''Tis a mess here," we all muttered, as the network anchors stuttered,<br /> Stuttered over Bush and Gore.<br /> Could there be another election with such a case of misdirection,<br /> One with such a weak selection, yet fraught with tension to the core?<br /> Quoth the ravers, "Nevermore."<br /> Britain''s Edward Lear''s limerick is lighter:<br /> There once was a U.S. election<br /> That called for some expert detection -<br /> How thousands of pollers<br /> Could become two-holers<br /> Like outhouses of recollection.<br /> Ditto Ogden Nash:<br /> I regret to admit that all my knowledge<br /> Is what I learned at Electoral Colleges,<br /> So tell me please, though I hate to troubya,<br /> Will the winner be Al, or will it be Dubya?<br /> Joyce Kilmer''s a media analyst:<br /> I thought that I would never see<br /> The networks all so up a tree.<br /> Walt Whitman is lyrical, as always:<br /> O''Captain! My Captain!<br /> Our fearful trip''s not done<br /> The ship has weather''d every rack,<br /> But nobody knows who''s won.<br /> Alfred Noyes rhythmically rumbles:<br /> And still of an autumn night they say, with the White House on the line,<br /> When the campaign''s a ghostly galleon and both candidates cry "Tis mine!"<br /> When the road is a ribbon of ballots, all within easy reach,<br /> A highwayman comes riding, riding, riding,<br /> A highwayman comes riding, and punches two holes in each.<br /> Dr. Seuss takes a look at election officials:<br /> I cannot count them in a box<br /> I cannot count them with a fox<br /> I cannot count them by computer<br /> I will not with a Roto-Rooter<br /> I cannot count them card-by-card<br /> I will not ''cause it''s way too hard<br /> I cannot count them on my fingers<br /> I will not while suspicion lingers.<br /> I''ll leave the country in a jam -<br /> I can''t count ballots, Sam-I-Am.<br /> "Clement Moore" adopts a holiday theme:<br /> ''Twas the month before Christmas, when all through the courts,<br /> All the plaintiffs made stirring bad ballot reports.<br /> Which leaves the problem.<br /> Perhaps the best way to stop complaints that are so raucous is to start over<br /> again, with the Iowa caucuses!

Bill Gates grabbed my back<br /> pack.

The Washington Post  february 4, 1988 I BelieveThis is more commentary than humor, but what the heck...------------------------------------I believe the president. I have always believed him. I believed him when he said he had never been drafted in the Vietnam War and I believed him when he said he had forgotten to mention that he had been drafted in the Vietnam War. I believed him when he said he hadn''t had sex with Gennifer Flowers and I believe him now, when he reportedly says he did.I believe the president did not rent out the Lincoln Bedroom, did not sell access to himself and the vice president to hundreds of well-heeled special pleaders and did not supervise the largest, most systematic money-laundering operation in campaign finance history, collecting more than $ 3 million in illegal and improper donations. I believe that Charlie Trie and James Riady were motivated by nothing but patriotism for their adopted country.I believed Vice President Gore when he said that he had made dunning calls to political contributors ''on a few occasions'' from his White House office, and I believed when he said that, actually, ''a few'' meant 46. I believe in no controlling legal authority.I believe Bruce Babbitt when he says that the $ 286,000 contributed the DNC by Indian tribes opposed to granting a casino license to rival tribes had nothing to do with his denial of the license. I believed the secretary when he said that he had not been instructed this matter by then-White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. I believed him when he said that he had told lobbyist and friend Paul Eckstein that Ickes had told him to move on the casino decision, but that he had been lying to Eckstein. I agree with the secretary that it is an outrage that anyone would question his integrity. I believe in the Clinton Standard of adherence to the campaign finance and bribery laws, enunciated by the president on March 7, 1997: ''I don''t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.'' I note with approval the use of the word ''evidence'' and also the use of the word ''solely.'' I believe that it is proper to change government policy to address the concerns of people who have given the president money, as long as nobody can find evidence of this being the sole reason. I believe the president has lived up to his promise to preside over the most ethical administration in American history. I believe that indicted former agriculture secretary Mike Espy did not accept $35,000 in illegal favors from Tyson Foods and other regulated businesses. I believe that indicted former housing secretary Henry Cisneros did not lie to the FBI and tell others to lie to cover up $ 250,000 in blackmail payments to his former mistress.  I believe that convicted former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell was not involved in the obstruction of justice when the president''s minions arranged for Hubbell to receive $ 400,000 in sweetheart consulting deals at a time when he was reneging on his promise to cooperate with Kenneth Starr''s Whitewater investigation. I believe Paula Jones is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Kathleen Willey is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Monica Lewinsky is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Lewinsky was fantasizing in her 20 hours of conversation in which she reportedly detailed her sexual relationship with the president and begged Linda Tripp to join her in lying about the relationship. I believe that any gifts, correspondence, telephone calls and the 37 post-employment White House visits that may have passed between Lewinsky and the president are evidence only of a platonic relationship; such innocent intimate friendships are quite common between middle-aged married men and young single women, and also between presidents of the United States and White House interns. I see nothing suspicious in the report that the president''s intimate, Vernon Jordan, arranged a $ 40,000-per-year job for Lewinsky shortly after she signed but before she filed an affidavit saying she had not had sex with the president. Nor do I read anything into the fact that the ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, visited Lewinsky at the Watergate to offer her a job. I believe the instructions Lewinsky gave Tripp informing her on how to properly perjure herself in the Willey matter simply wrote themselves.I believe that The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News &amp; World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR are all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. Especially NPR.

Good evening my fellow Americans.</p>\n<p>First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New<br /> York and all Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You<br /> can rest assured that anything and everything that can be done<br /> to assure the safety of our country will be done. This is the<br /> greatest country in the world and we will get through this<br /> trying time. Now is the time for all people to set aside our<br /> petty differences and show the world that no one or nothing can<br /> destroy the fortitude of the American people.</p>\n<p>To the people responsible for today''s tragedy, I say this: Are<br /> you fucking kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped<br /> too tight? Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not<br /> know who you are fucking with? Americans are so hungry to kill,<br /> that we shoot at each other every day. We will relish that<br /> opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you<br /> forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started<br /> fucking around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over<br /> in Japan? We slapped them all over the Pacific and roasted about<br /> 2 million of them in their own back yard. That''s what we in<br /> America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen Texas on a map? Ever<br /> wonder why it''s so big? Because we wanted it that way, Mexico<br /> started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our<br /> lawns. England? We sent them packing.</p>\n<p>Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good ''ole USA. The<br /> only reason he got away the first time is because it''s too hard<br /> to shoot someone when you''re doubled over laughing at them. Our<br /> soldiers aren''t trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now<br /> he couldn''t stop a pack of cub scouts from taking over his<br /> shitty little country.</p>\n<p>Trust us, Afghanistan will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go<br /> ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden. There''s not a hole deep enough<br /> or a mountain high enough that''s going to keep your camel riding<br /> asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that harbors<br /> him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he<br /> was there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that<br /> have pissed us off in the past. This is America. We kick ass.<br /> This is what we do. Go ahead and laugh now, but the Tomahawks<br /> are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.</p>\n<p>God bless America!

Why doesn''t George W. Bush eat parrots?<br /> A little thing called cannibalism.
Three little boys went out to play in the snow and make snowmen.<br /> The first boy came in after just a few minutes.  His mother asked him if he<br /> was finished with his snowman already.  He answered that he had made a Superman<br /> snow man and it was easy, because he just had to add a cape.<br /> The second boy came in after about an hour, so his mother asked him why it<br /> took him so long.  He answered that he had made a Harry Potter snowman, and that<br /> it took a while to find a pair of glasses.<br /> The third boy was out in the yard all day; in fact, he missed dinner.  When he<br /> finally came in, it was after dark, and his mother asked why it had taken him so<br /> long.  He answered that he had made a president George W. Bush snowman and that<br /> it had taken a lot longer than he thought to hollow out his head.

When you''re 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: "Just because you''ve reached middle age, that doesn''t mean you shouldn''t take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it." </p>\n<p>This is the voice of Satan. </p>\n<p>I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales. </p>\n<p>I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. "I''ll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets" is a typical breakfast order for me these days. </p>\n<p>This is because I went snowboarding. </p>\n<p>For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough. </p>\n<p>These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, "Cool." </p>\n<p>People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together. </p>\n<p>We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill). </p>\n<p>If anybody asks if you''re OK, you say, "I''m just catching my breath!" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you''re going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you''re planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw. </p>\n<p>At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance. </p>\n<p>So I thought I''d take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing. </p>\n<p>In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range. </p>\n<p>Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can''t stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you. </p>\n<p>Skiers hate snowboarders. It''s a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc. </p>\n<p>Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd. </p>\n<p>I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope. </p>\n<p>Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who''s going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete. </p>\n<p>You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.) </p>\n<p>We learned snowboarding via a two step method: </p>\n<p>STEP ONE: Watching Brad do something. </p>\n<p>STEP TWO: Trying to do it ourselves. </p>\n<p>I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics. </p>\n<p>I''d struggle to my feet, and I''d be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot. </p>\n<p>"Keep your knees bent!" Brad would yell, helpfully. </p>\n<p>Have you noticed that whatever sport you''re trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if THAT would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, "FORGET MY KNEES! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE GRAVITY CHUNKS!" </p>\n<p>Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me. </p>\n<p>If I hadn''t gotten out of there, they''d have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding. </p>\n<p>So I think, when my body heals, I''ll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you''ll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.

Good afternoon all. I''m Al Gore, and I''d like to tell you a<br /> little about myself. </p>\n<p>I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a<br /> poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I<br /> was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands. I taught<br /> myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers<br /> and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi<br /> River steamboat. Frequently we would stop the ship and I would<br /> cut and split five cords of wood for fuel overnight for the<br /> steam engines. </p>\n<p>My mother taught me the value of education, so every day, I<br /> would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a<br /> mischievous, fun loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one<br /> day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for<br /> "Huckleberry Finn." </p>\n<p>Back then, we Jewish black folks in the south were second-class<br /> citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I<br /> asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee<br /> civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an<br /> impression. You see, the minister''s name was Martin Luther King,<br /> Jr. </p>\n<p>My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his<br /> knee and said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama,<br /> someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to<br /> an exclusive prep school." As a young Hindu boy, these were very<br /> valuable lessons. But life of privilege was not for me. </p>\n<p>Being Chinese, after getting my high school diploma, I took a<br /> job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the<br /> treatment of the workers there that I organized a union. Later,<br /> that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my<br /> close friends at the AFL-CIO call me "Norma Rae." </p>\n<p>When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done,<br /> Harvard University called and offered me a scholarship. I<br /> captained the hockey team to four consecutive national<br /> championships, but I also played football and was good enough to<br /> win the Heisman Trophy. </p>\n<p>During my college years, I lived in a housing project and<br /> moonlighted writing songs and playing lead guitar for a little<br /> rock band. You may have heard of us - The Rolling Stones. I''m<br /> the one with the lips. </p>\n<p>But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my<br /> country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I<br /> was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier<br /> and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de<br /> Guerre. My battlefield expertise is current requisite reading<br /> material for Officers Candidates to this very day. My being a<br /> wounded female officer serving in disguise as a journalist was a<br /> full time project, but my military knowledge helped save tens of<br /> thousands of lives. Many cities in Southeast Asia are named<br /> after me to this very day. Statues of me are still commonplace<br /> in many official Government buildings in Viet Nam. </p>\n<p>When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of<br /> ours. I''ve crossed the deserts bare, man, I''ve breathed the<br /> mountain air, man, I''ve traveled, I''ve done my share, man, I''ve<br /> been everywhere. I''ve hunted all the dangerous species of big<br /> game in five continents using only a handmade spear or my<br /> handmade laser sighted compound bow. </p>\n<p>And the people I met at truck stops and campgrounds and homeless<br /> shelters on that journey all said the same thing: "Al, we need<br /> you in Washington." </p>\n<p>I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some<br /> other business---building the World Trade Center, finding a low<br /> cost, more reliable nuclear weapon trigger design, founding the<br /> Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking<br /> caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field''s<br /> chocolate chip cookies. I was, in fact, the third (still silent)<br /> partner of Ben &amp; Jerry with over half of the flavors personally<br /> developed by Tipper and me in our own kitchen.</p>\n<p>My extensive knowledge of Arctic Sea life keeps me busy in the<br /> research laboratory, but those endangered species need love too!<br /> Translating the dead sea scrolls is one of my favorite hobbies,<br /> and my current volume is in print in over 73 languages and is<br /> being studied in Seminaries worldwide. Being Indian, both Native<br /> American and the Mid East kind, this is valuable experience for<br /> me. Have towel and Tee Pee, will travel.</p>\n<p>Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee<br /> and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and<br /> the Senate. And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for<br /> no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once<br /> again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the<br /> United States. </p>\n<p>I also invented the Internet. Since then, I''ve been part of the<br /> most successful administration in American history. My friend,<br /> Bill Gates has asked me many times why I gave him the ideas of<br /> software development and asked for no money. Gosh, it just<br /> wouldn''t be right! </p>\n<p>Many times President Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave<br /> decision and has asked me what to do. And when I would give him<br /> my thoughts, he would invariable say, "Of course. That''s<br /> brilliant. Why didn''t I think of that?" During the darkest days<br /> of the impeachment battles, the President told me he only wished<br /> he had listened when I told him to stay away form that<br /> dark-haired intern with the big hooters. </p>\n<p>So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and<br /> asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my<br /> campaign. And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of<br /> advice-words I''ll never forget. He looked me in the eye and he<br /> said, "Al, just tell the truth, it''s always worked well for me." </p>\n<p>Thanks, I''m Al Gore and I want to be your next President. You<br /> can trust and believe me.

George Bush, Saddam Hussein and General Cosgrove were all walking along a<br /> beach together after a peace talk , when they spotted an empty champagne bottle<br /> lying in the sand .

I also wish I had a fleet of<br /> a million oil tankers, to take his oil supplies when I''m done!"<br /> The Genie granted the Chief Executive his wish.<br /> "Ha!" Saddam retorted. "You won''t defeat me so easily! I wish there was an<br /> impregnable wall around all of Iraq, so no Iranians, Israelis or infidel<br /> Westerners may enter! I also wish to be transported safely back to my palace in<br /> Baghdad!"<br /> And with that, the Genie did his bidding, and Saddam vanished in a puff of<br /> smoke.<br /> This left only General Cosgrove.<br /> "Well, first of all," said the good General,"tell me about this wall."<br /> "Well, it''s higher than any aero plane can fly and thicker than any explosive<br /> can penetrate," replied the Genie. "There are no entrances or exits. Basically,<br /> nothing can get in or out."<br /> "Right," replied Cosgrove. "Fill it with water."

As my elderly aunt and uncle strolled downtown one afternoon they run into their old friends. They spend some time discussing this and that when one friend asks my uncle where they has been. "We just left the office of our memory doctor""Memory doctor? What is that all about?""Well" replies my uncle "As you know we are getting up there in age, and our memory just isn''t as sharp as it once was.""Is the doctor effective?""Oh, yes, he''s wonderful.""Really. You know, my memory is not too sharp these days either. Maybe I''ll pay him a visit. Whats his name?""Oh. Uh. Well." replies my uncle. "Um. You know those things that grow out of the ground?". "You mean trees?""Kind of, but smaller.""You mean a bush?""Yes, a bush or a plant, but ... Um ... You know, more colorful.""A flower?"."Yes. A flower.

During a political debate the politicians were asked to use the word<br /> "fascinate" in a sentence.<br /> The first one, a democrat, came up with an answer right away. He said, "One of<br /> my hobbies is painting, and no matter if I paint with water colors, or oils I<br /> always fascinate people with my work." </p>\n<p>The second politician, the republican, said "My grandfather was a magician,<br /> and when ever he performed a trick be it with cards, or hoops, or magic balls he<br /> would always fascinate us." </p>\n<p>The third politician, an independent, said "I don''t know if I can do that." </p>\n<p>The MC of the debate said, "Go ahead take a couple of minutes then give it<br /> your best." </p>\n<p>The third politician thought for a while then said, "I know this gal, one time<br /> she went to the store to buy a new blouse. The blouse had ten buttons on it, but<br /> when she went to button it her boobs were so big that she could only fasten<br /> eight."

A first grade teacher explains to her class that she is a liberal Democrat.<br /> She asks her students to raise their hands if they were liberal Democrats too.<br /> Not really knowing what a liberal Democrat was but wanting to be like their<br /> teacher, their hands explode into the air like fleshy fireworks.<br /> There is, however, one exception. A girl named Lucy has not gone along with<br /> the crowd. The teacher asks her why she has decided to be different. "Because<br /> I''m not a liberal Democrat."<br /> Then, asks the teacher, what are you?  "Why I''m a proud conservative<br /> Republican.", boasts the little girl.<br /> The teacher is a little perturbed now, her face slightly red. She asks Lucy<br /> why she is a conservative Republican.<br /> "Well, I was brought up to trust in myself instead of relying on an intrusive<br /> government to care for me and do all of my thinking. My Dad and Mom are<br /> conservative Republicans, and I am a conservative Republican too."<br /> The teacher is now angry. "That''s no reason," she says loudly.  "What if your<br /> Mom was a moron, and your dad was a moron. What would you be then?"<br /> A pause, and a smile. "Then," says Lucy, "I''d be a liberal Democrat."

Then grumbled about the impertinence of the woman, and said "Very well, I want to awaken with three white women in my bed in the morning, so just do it and be off with you !"</p>\n<p>The annoyed genie said, "So be it !" and disappeared. </p>\n<p>The next morning Bin Laden woke up in bed with Lorena Bobbitt, Tonya Harding, and Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>His penis was gone, his knee was broken, and he had no health insurance.

Every once in a while each of us experiences a perfect crap. It''s rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects. You sit down expecting the worst, but what you get is the smooth-sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. </p>\n<p>But that''s not the end of it. You use some toilet paper only to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it. </p>\n<p>On the other hand (so to speak) there is:</p>\n<p>The Beer Crap<br /> Talk about nasty craps. Depending on the crapper''s tolerance, the beer crap is the result of too many beers. It could have been two or 22, it doesn''t matter.<br /> What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy crap accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.</p>\n<p>The Chilli Crap<br /> Hot when it goes in and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chilli crap stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a heat shield.</p>\n<p>The Cable Crap<br /> Long, curly and perfectly formed like two feet of telephone coaxial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. You wonder admiringly, ''Did I do that? Where did it come from?'' You leave the toilet pleased with yourself.</p>\n<p>The Latrine Crap<br /> In case you didn''t know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it - where soldiers, boy scouts and flies go to crap. Tip: don''t ever look down the hole.</p>\n<p>The Mona Lisa Crap<br /> This is the masterpiece of craps. It''s as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that would make Da Vinci weep. And just think, you made it yourself. You may even want to break out the Polaroid camera, but maybe that''s going too far.</p>\n<p>The Empty Roll Crap<br /> You''re done... you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins coldly in your throat. You could use the curtains... no, someone would say, ''Where are the curtains?'' Then what would you say. The rug? Too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that every ''empty roll crapper'' must face... pull up your daks, tighten your arse and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.</p>\n<p>A mate about to run the London Marathon lined up outside the dozens of portaloos on Blackheath to unload a nervous one and discovered when the business was done and he was ready to run a world record race, there was no paper. Panic. The only thing available was a pound note - the last he possessed because they were being replaced by the coin - and he used that, being careful not to use the side with the Queen''s head, of course!</p>\n<p>The Splash Back Crap<br /> You send the crap on its way; it drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you''re wet and embarrassed. Tip: blot instead of wipe.</p>\n<p>The Aborted Crap<br /> You are in mid-crap when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off; go for the phone and save the rest for later. It isn''t pretty, but you''ve gotta do what you''ve gotta do.</p>\n<p>The Caesarean Crap<br /> Pain, that''s what this crap and childbirth have in common. It''s simply a case of too much crap trying to go through too small a hole and there''s no obstetrician to help.</p>\n<p>The Alfresco Crap<br /> Everyone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the nature, and a good bush all contribute to the peaceful ambience that our primitive forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of Brownies or a patch of poison ivy.</p>\n<p>The Tijuana Trot Crap (also known as Delhi Belly, Rabat Runs, Seskatchewan Squits, Balsall Heath Balti Bypass)<br /> The phrase ''shit happens'' really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins. For the next 72 hours you''d be better off if you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a fetal position.</p>\n<p>The Machine Gun Crap<br /> You''re just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like machinegun fire. The guy in the next stall hits the floor like a combat veteran - cradling his umbrella like an AK47.</p>\n<p>The Sound Effect Crap<br /> You feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or workmates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects:<br /> 1. Flush the toilet.<br /> 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem.<br /> 3. Drop a handful of change on the floor.</p>\n<p>The Security Crap<br /> You have enough on your mind when you''re in the toilet without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-crap mode. So how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can''t reach to do this... hum loudly.</p>\n<p>The Cling-On Crap<br /> For the most part you''ve completed your crap, but there''s one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You''re getting impatient. Someone else wants to use the toilet. So you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently on the door has scissors.</p>\n<p>The Houdini Crap<br /> You go, then you stand up to flush and the damn thing has disappeared. Where''d it go? Did it creep down the pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it lurking out of sight? Should you wipe... maybe you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You''d better, because if you don''t, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.</p>\n<p>The Hangover Crap<br /> You feel so bad that you don''t know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your intestines like a vice so you sit down again... up down, up down. Don''t you wish Mum was close by.</p>\n<p>The Porta-Pottie Dump<br /> Construction workers and outdoor concertgoers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best description would be, ''It''s like taking a shit in an upright coffin.'' It''s claustrophobic and it smells bad. Best advice: go in a paper cup.</p>\n<p>The Proctologist Crap<br /> In the beginning, the Lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn''t create this dump because there is nothing biblical about it. You run out of gas. That''s right, you run out of propulsion. The crap is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You''ve only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you''re a proctologist and go after it yourself. Not a pretty picture is it?</p>\n<p>The Whole Roll Crap<br /> No matter how much you wipe, it doesn''t seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times too. The whole episode is consumer waste.</p>\n<p>The Graffiti Crap<br /> You flush the crap and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the crap to the porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way down. You flush again but the curly-Q hangs there... love it or leave it, it''s your choice.</p>\n<p>The Encore Crap<br /> ''Ahhh!'' You''re done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the toilet when you feel another crap on its way. You have to return for a curtain call.</p>\n<p>The Born Again Crap<br /> This is a dump that''s going badly. You say, ''Lord, if I live through this, I''ll take up religion.'' You always get through it, but seldom keep the promises you made in desperation, because a born-again crap is like childbirth - you forget the pain quickly.</p>\n<div id="nodevote result">Score: 0.0, votes: 0</div>\n

Fresh off of the Associated Press Wire...<br /> AP - Monica Lewinsky, in a statement released today, countered President<br /> Clinton''s firm denial:<br /> "I have had enough. This whole experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth,<br /> and I can''t stomach any more. I feel as if I am getting the shaft, that this<br /> ugly matter has come to a head and blown up in my face.<br /> "This may be a load to handle, but when things are hard, that is when I am at<br /> my best. I have faced hard things in the past, and I know what is coming. I will<br /> meet this challenge the only way I know how: head on.<br /> "I have licked bigger things than this before, and I will again.

I will work non-stop and fight this, blow by blow, until I am<br /> wiped clean of this dirty affair. I will not be stained by it.<br /> "Thank you."<br /> Monica Lewinsky.

Jesus is on one side of the Jordan River while Al Gore and<br /> George Bush are on the other side. George Bush says "Jesus,how<br /> can we get to the other side so we can praise you?" and Jesus<br /> replys "Walk across the river and you will only sink as far as<br /> the sins you have committed."

It was a special reserve unit made up of lawyers and accountants. When the time came we ordered them to charge--and boy, did they know how to charge."</p>\n<p>A blind rabbit and a blind snake ran into each other on the road one day.

[surprisingly bi-partisan]''TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE IMPEACHMENTDecember 17, 1998''Twas The Night Before Impeachment, When all through the House, All Congress was stirring, Even Conyers, the louse.  The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care, In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair.  The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds, While visions of perjury danced in their heads.  And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap, Had just settled in for a long evening''s nap.When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter.  When what to their wondering eyes should appear But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer.  With a Presidential address, so lively and quick, They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick!More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came, And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:''Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let''s forget The Vixen!On Barney! On Maxine! I''m no Richard Nixon!!!'' ''From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall, Now dash away, dash away, dash away all !!!''And then the Republicans heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  They scratched their heads and were turning around When resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound.  No longer would he eat from his humble pie, While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky.  A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq, It looked once again like Slick Willie was back.His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, His nose like a cherry.  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the hair on his head was as white as the snow.  The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.  He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf, And the Republicans wept, in spite of themselves.  And a wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave them to know they had something to dread.  He spoke the right words and went straight to his work Hard to believe Mon had called him ''The Jerk.''And shaking his finger and thumbing his nose, By ''Wagging The Dog,'' up the polls he rose.  He turned to his spinmeisters and gave them a whistle, Then they cheered-on Slick Willie as he launched another missile.  They all heard him exclaim, with Impeachment out of sight, ''Happy Ramadan to all, and to all a good night.''
A first grade teacher in a small town in Texas explains to her class that<br /> she is a George Bush fan. She asks her students to raise their hands if they<br /> are Bush fans too. Not really knowing what a Bush fan is,<br /> but wanting to be liked by the teacher, their hands fly into the air.<br /> There is, however, one exception. A little boy named Mike has not gone along<br /> with the crowd.<br /> The teacher asks him why he has decided to be different.<br /> "Because I''m not a Bush fan" he retorts. "Then," asks the teacher "what are<br /> you?"<br /> "I''m a proud Al Gore fan!" boasts the little boy. The teacher is a little<br /> perturbed now,<br /> her face slightly red. She asks Mike why he is a Gore fan<br /> "Well, my Dad and Mom are Gore fans, so I''m a Gore fan too" he responds.<br /> The teacher is now angry. "That''s no reason," she says loudly.<br /> "What if your Mom was a moron, and your Dad was an idiot.<br /> What would you be then?" Mike says, "Then I''d be a Bush fan."

Many parents today are concerned that their offspring might somehow be involved in the world of illegal pharmaceuticals, or "drugs".  This is a healthy concern.  Knowing your kids are "high" is the first step toward helping them avoid problems with their health, their grades,  the law, and getting those hard-to-clean vomit stains out of the Oriental rug.</p>\n<p>KNOW THE WARNING SIGNS- select the option which best describes your child.</p>\n<p>1. Your child''s idea of a fun sport to play is: </p>\n<p>A) tossing a pigskin ball around </p>\n<p>B) throwing an orange rubber ball into a netted hole </p>\n<p>C) inserting a pointy needle into a vein and mixing foreign substances into the human bloodstream.</p>\n<p>2. Your child''s idea of a responsible adult is: </p>\n<p>A) Bill Clinton </p>\n<p>B) Tom Hanks </p>\n<p>C) Charles Manson.</p>\n<p>3. Your child''s favorite hobbies include: </p>\n<p>A) Model Rocketry </p>\n<p>B) Baseball </p>\n<p>C) Taking white, powdery substances from a big bag and breaking it down into many smaller bags.</p>\n<p>4. Your child''s pet is: </p>\n<p>A) a puppy dog </p>\n<p>B) a 16'' python </p>\n<p>C) a colony of imaginary bugs and spiders that crawl under their skin.</p>\n<p>5. Your child''s breath smells like: </p>\n<p>A) a fresh, minty mountain top </p>\n<p>B) lunch </p>\n<p>C) an opium den.</p>\n<p>6. When your young ones dress up to go out, they look like: </p>\n<p>A) Fred and Ginger </p>\n<p>B) Regis and Kathy Lee </p>\n<p>C) Sid and Nancy</p>\n<p>7. Your child would identify Tijuana Gold as: </p>\n<p>A) a precious metal </p>\n<p>B) a Mexican theme park </p>\n<p>C) a good deal, but not as potent as the stuff from Thailand.</p>\n<p>8. When you ask your child how their day at school was at the dinner table they answer: </p>\n<p>A) they scored a goal for their soccer team </p>\n<p>B) they got the highest grade in class on a math test </p>\n<p>C) they scored a dime bag and got high.</p>\n<p>Total up the number of times you answered "C" to the questions above, and consult the table below.</p>\n<p>0 "C''s"- Chances are your child is not on drugs.  They probably aren''t that exciting either.  Kick them out of the house and force them to live on the cold streets for a few months to let them really appreciate life in all it''s murkiness.</p>\n<p>1-3 "C''s"- Your child might be on drugs, but you can''t be certain.  Put a flashlight up to their face and flash it in their eyes.  This doesn''t really tell you anything, but it scares the pants off your kids and is kind of fun.</p>\n<p>3-6 "C''s"- You may as well face it, you''ve got a little druggie on your hands.  Your child is a menace to society and must be dealt with accordingly.  We suggest a good flaying to help them kick their nasty habit.  Confiscate all their stash and send it to Ooze.</p>\n<p>7-8 "C''s"- Your child has never used drugs.  No sir. Just smile nicely at them and slink out of the house. Never return.
George W. Bush told Dick Cheney, "I really hate all the stupid jokes people make about me." Cheney reassured him by saying,  "Jokes can''t hurt you.  They are just made up by a bunch of stupid people. In fact, most humans are quite stupid.  Here, I''ll show you what I mean."Cheney goes outside and hails a D.C. cab and says to the driver, "Please take me to 261 M street to see if I''m home," said Cheney. Without a word, the cabbie took them straight to M Street.  Cheney then rang the doorbell, came back to the car and said, "Oh, I guess I''m not there! Take us back to where we started, please."The cabbie did what he was told without a word.  Cheney leaned over and said to Dubya, "You get the idea?  People are idiots wherever you go! Don''t worry about their opinions!"Bush said, "Thanks Dick.  I feel a lot better."  Then he winked and whispered, "Hooboy, was he stupid! He picked us up right in front of a phone booth. He should have realized you could have called instead!
Why did the chicken cross the road?</p>\n<p>MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why?<br /> The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.</p>\n<p>JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn''t anyone ever<br /> think to ask, What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the<br /> place, anyway?"</p>\n<p>FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the<br /> road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.</p>\n<p>BILL GATES: I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000, which will cross<br /> roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your<br /> checkbook.</p>\n<p>OLIVER STONE: The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the<br /> road?" Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we<br /> overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"</p>\n<p>CHARLES DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally<br /> selected in such a way that they are now genetically disposed to cross roads.</p>\n<p>ALBERT EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved<br /> beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.</p>\n<p>BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.</p>\n<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road. It transcended it.</p>\n<p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die. In the rain.</p>\n<p>COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one?</p>\n<p>BILL CLINTON : I did not, and I repeat, did not have sexual relations with<br /> that chicken. </p>\n<p>Pat Buchanan: To steal a job from a decent, hard working American.<br /> L.A. Police Department: Give us five minutes with the chicken and we''ll find<br /> out.<br /> Dr. Seuss: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad?<br /> Yes! The chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I''ve not been told!<br /> Grandpa: In my day, we didn''t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone<br /> told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.<br /> Aristotle: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.<br /> Bill Clinton: I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. However, I did ask<br /> Vernon Jordan to find the chicken a job in New York.
George W. Bush was out walking when he saw Moses.<br /> "Hey, Moses! STOP!!" he yelled. But Moses walked on, ignoring him. After a few<br /> blocks, Bush caught up with him.

Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush meet up in Baghdad for the first round of talks in a new peace process. When George sits down, he notices three buttons on the side of Saddam''s chair. They begin talking. After about five minutes Saddam presses the First button. A boxing glove springs out of a box on the desk and punches Bush in the face.Confused, Bush carries on talking as Saddam laughs. A few minutes later the second button is pressed. This time a big boot comes out and kicks Bush in the shin. Again Saddam laughs, and again Bush carries on talking, not wanting to put off the bigger issue of peace between the two countries. But when the third button is pressed and another boot comes out and kicks Bush in the privates, he''s finally had enough, knowing that he can''t do much without them functioning well."I''m going back home!" he tells the Iraqi."We''ll finish these talks in two weeks!"A fortnight passes and Saddam flies to the United States for talks. As the two men sit down, Hussein notices three buttons on Bush''s chair and prepares himself for the Yank''s revenge. They begin talking and Bush presses the first button. Saddam ducks, but nothing happens. George snickers. A few seconds later he presses the second button. Saddam jumps up, but again nothing happens. Bush roars with laughter. When the third button is pressed, Saddam jumps up again, and again nothing happens. Bush falls on the floor in a fit of hysterics."Forget this," says Saddam."I''m going back to Baghdad!"Dubya says through tears of laughter, "What Baghdad?"
Now that it seems almost a certainty that George W. Bush will become the<br /> Republican nominee for President, attention will soon focus upon whom Governor<br /> Bush will pick for his Vice Presidential running mate. It is rumored that one of<br /> the names on the ''short list'' currently being floated in upper level Republican<br /> circles is former Vice President, Dan Quayle. </p>\n<p>For many, there seems to be some very sound reasoning for picking Quayle. As<br /> was pointed out by one senior official who wished not be identified, Quayle<br /> "already knows how to do the job, will contribute gaffes that will deflect<br /> attention away from Bush''s own, and in a cost saving side benefit will help the<br /> party minimize printing costs for new ''Bush-Quayle'' posters and bumper stickers<br /> (since they can use the leftovers from the 1988 and 1992 campaigns). </p>\n<p>Apparently, part of the overall strategy is the targeting of a key demographic<br /> group that has been virtually ignored in previous presidential campaigns: Senile<br /> and confused voters. One recent survey puts the ''senile and confused'' at<br /> approximately 3.8% of the voting population. The hope is that this group will<br /> mistakenly believe that this is the same Bush-Quayle ticket they voted for in<br /> 1988 and 1992 and will once again cast their votes for another, albeit<br /> different, Bush-Quayle ticket. The dilemma facing Republican strategists however<br /> is determining how best to mount an effective campaign that will get out the<br /> ''senile and confused'' vote. One strategist sighed, "They''re a hard group to<br /> reach, let alone give instructions to." </p>\n<p>Additionally, word has it that the former Vice President is undertaking some<br /> unique preparations for another run at the Vice Presidency. Included in his<br /> training regimen is a comprehensive reading of Webster�酶惟s Dictionary cover to<br /> cover as well as listening to the popular vocabulary-building program on<br /> cassette tapes, "Verbal Advantage." </p>\n<p>For many, the inclusion of former Vice President Quayle on the ticket will<br /> spell ''opportunities''. When one reporter asked Quayle "what do you think about<br /> running on a ticket with a Bush again," the former Vice President expressed that<br /> he was "clearly delighted" about it. However, Quayle did seem somewhat puzzled<br /> and perplexed as to why Bush has now added a "W" to his name when he didn''t seem<br /> to use one before.

One day, Bill Clinton and the Pope died. Bill Clinton was saying,�酶惟 Yes!! No I<br /> get to go to hell and meet the devil!" The Pope was saying,�酶惟 Finally, after all<br /> these years, I get to meet the Virgin marry." Well, while they were waiting to<br /> go to heaven, the office angels accidentally switched their files. So Bill<br /> Clinton ended up going to heaven, and the Pope to hell. Well after about 2<br /> weeks, God realized that the files were switched. So he ordered them to go to<br /> the right places. Well on the way to their places, Bill Clinton and the Pope met<br /> up with each other''s elevator. The pope was excited, "NOW I FINALLY GET TO MEET<br /> THE VIRGIN MARY!!!" Then Bill Clinton replied, "SHE AIN''T NO VIRGIN ANY MORE!"

WASHINGTON D.C. (Rooters) Incredibly, it now appears that over the last five years the White House actually issued these official knee-pads to all female interns between the ages of 18 and 29.''It''s something we haven''t seen since the Kennedy Administration,'' Landford Phlegm, official White House historian, said yesterday. ''What a guy! It only proves he isn''t in it to meet heads of state.''But since the scandal broke, the White House has sought to rid itself of its surplus. ''We had several hundred pair on hand,'' one aide reported. ''Enough to last until the year 2000. Well -- almost enough.''
Bill Clinton is visiting a school. In one class, he asks the students if<br /> anyone can give him an example of a "tragedy". One little boy stands up and<br /> offers that, "If my best friend who lives next door was playing in the street<br /> and a car came along and killed him, that would be a tragedy." </p>\n<p>"No," Clinton says, "That would be an ACCIDENT." </p>\n<p>A girl raises her hand. "If a school bus carrying fifty children drove off a<br /> cliff, killing everyone involved...that would be a tragedy." </p>\n<p>"I''m afraid not," explains Clinton. "That is what we would call a GREAT LOSS." </p>\n<p>The room is silent; none of the other children volunteer. </p>\n<p>"What?" asks Clinton, "Isn''t there any one here who can give me an example of<br /> a tragedy?" </p>\n<p>Finally, a boy in the back raises his hand. In a timid voice, he says: "If an<br /> airplane carrying Bill and Hillary Clinton were blown up by a bomb, that would<br /> be a tragedy." </p>\n<p>"Wonderful!" Clinton beams. "Marvelous! And can you tell me WHY that would be<br /> a tragedy?" </p>\n<p>"Well," says the boy, "because it wouldn''t be an accident, and it certainly<br /> would be no great loss!"

The only thing that the IRS has not yet taxed is the male penis. This is due to the fact that 40% of the time it is hanging around unemlpoyed, 30% of the time it is hard up, 20% of the time it is pissed off and 10% of the time it is in the hole. On top of that, it has two dependents and they are both nuts.</p>\n<p>Effective January 1st, 2004 your penis will be taxed according to size.

REDMOND, Wash. - Oct. 21, 1997 -- In direct response to accusations made by the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today that it will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of America for an undisclosed sum. </p>\n<p>"It''s actually a logical extension of our planned growth", said Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, "It really is going to be a positive arrangement for everyone". Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of the White House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and assured members of the press that changes will be "minimal". </p>\n<p>The United States will be managed as a wholly owned division of Microsoft. An initial public offering is planned for July of next year, and the federal government is expected to be profitable by "Q4 1999 at latest", according to Microsoft president Steve Ballmer. In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had "willingly and enthusiastically" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting directly to Bill Gates. When asked how it felt to give up the mantle of executive authority to Gates, Clinton smiled and referred to it as "a relief". He went on to say that Gates has a "proven track record", and that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their "full support and confidence". Clinton will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he has earned as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft. Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as "silly", though did say that he would make executive decisions for the U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters. Gates went on to say that the House and Senate would "of course" be Abolished. </p>\n<p>"Microsoft isn''t a democracy", he observed, "and look how well we''re doing". When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was proceeding, Gates said, "We don''t deny that discussions are taking place". Microsoft representatives closed the conference by stating that United States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in government services and discounts on all Microsoft products.</p>\n<p>About Microsoft</p>\n<p>Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ "MSFT") is the worldwide leader in software for personal computers, and democratic government. The company offers a wide range of products and services for public, business and personal use, each designed with the mission of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take advantage of the full power of personal computing and free society every day. </p>\n<p>About the United States</p>\n<p>Founded in 1789, the United States of America is the most successful nation in the history of the world, and has been a beacon of democracy and opportunity for over 200 years. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the United States is a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation.

WASHINGTON, DC - President Bush expressed frustration and anger Monday over a<br /> U.N. report stating that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein is now fully complying<br /> with weapons inspections. "Enough is enough," a determined Bush told reporters.<br /> "We are not fooled by Saddam''s devious attempts to sway world opinion by doing<br /> everything the U.N. asked him to do. We will not be intimidated into backing<br /> down and, if we have any say in the matter, neither will Saddam." Bush added<br /> that any further Iraqi attempt to meet the demands of the U.N. or U.S. will be<br /> regarded as "an act of war."

An open letter to the rest of America:</p>\n<p>America has engaged in some finger wagging lately because<br /> California doesn''t have enough electricity to meet its needs.<br /> The rest of the country (including George W. Bush''s energy<br /> secretary Spencer Abraham, who wants Californians to suffer<br /> through blackouts as justification for drilling for oil in<br /> Alaska''s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) seems to be just fine<br /> with letting Californians dangle in the breeze without enough<br /> power to meet their needs. They laugh at Californians''<br /> frivolity. Well, everybody. Here''s how it really is:</p>\n<p>California ranks 48th in the nation in power consumed per<br /> person. California grows more than half the nation''s fruit, nuts<br /> and vegetables. We''re keeping them. We need something to eat<br /> when the power goes out. We grow 99 percent or more of the<br /> nation''s almonds, artichokes, dates, figs, kiwifruit, olives,<br /> persimmons, pistachios, prunes, raisins and walnuts. Hope you<br /> won''t miss them. California is the nation''s number one dairy<br /> state. We''re keeping our dairy products. We''ll need plenty of<br /> fresh ones since our refrigerators can''t be relied upon. Got<br /> milk?</p>\n<p>We Californians are gonna keep all our high-tech software in<br /> state. Silicon Valley is ours, after all. Without enough<br /> electricity, which you''re apparently keeping for yourselves, we<br /> just plain don''t have enough software to spare. We''re keeping<br /> all our airplanes. California builds a good percentage of the<br /> commercial airliners available to fly you people to where you<br /> want to go. When yours wear out, you''d better hope Boeing''s<br /> Washington plant can keep you supplied. There isn''t enough<br /> electricity here to allow us to export any more planes than we<br /> need ourselves. And while we''re at it, we''re keeping all our<br /> high tech aerospace stuff, too, like the sophisticated weapons<br /> systems that let you sleep at night, not worried you might wake<br /> up under the rule of some foreign kook. Oh, yeah, and if you<br /> want to make a long-distance call, remember where the satellite<br /> components and tracking systems come from. Maybe you could get<br /> back in the habit of writing letters. Want to see a blockbuster<br /> movie this weekend? Come to California. We make them here. Since<br /> we''ll now have to make them with our own electricity, we''re<br /> keeping them. Even if we shot them somewhere else, the labs,<br /> printing facilities, editing facilities, and sound facilities<br /> are all here.</p>\n<p>Want some nice domestic wine? We produce over 17 million gallons<br /> per year. We''ll need all of it to drown our sorrows when we<br /> think about the fact that no matter how many California products<br /> we export to make the rest of America''s lives better, America<br /> can''t see its way clear to help us out with a little<br /> electricity. You can no longer have any of our wine. You all<br /> complain that we don''t build enough power plants. Well, you<br /> don''t grow enough food, write enough software, make enough<br /> movies, build enough airplanes and defense systems or make<br /> enough wine. This is your last warning, America. Lighten (us) up<br /> before it''s too late.</p>\n<p>Love,<br /> The Californians</p>\n<p>"I love California - I practically grew up in Phoenix." -Dan<br /> Quayle

It was getting a little crowded in heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have a real bummer of a day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.The next day at 12:01, the first person comes to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly says to the man, ''Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died.''''No problem,'' the man says. ''I came home to my 25th floor apartment in my lunch hour and caught my wife half-naked and appearing to be having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. I immediately began searching for him. My wife was yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. Just as I was about to giveup, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of that guy!''Well, I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But wouldn''t you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn''t die. This ticked me off even more. In a rage, I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him. Oddly enough, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony, and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 storeys and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.''The angel sits back and thinks for a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day. It was a crime of passion. So, the angel announces, ''OK sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,'' and lets him in. A few seconds later the next guy comes up. ''Before I can let you in, I need to hear about what your day was like when you died.''The man says, ''No problem. But you''re not going to believe this. I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side!''Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, starts cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom that broke my fall so I didn''t die right away. As I''m laying there face up on the ground, unable to move, and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator of all things off the balcony. It falls the 25 floors and lands on top of me, killing me instantly.''The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. ''I could get used to this new policy,'' he thinks to himself. ''Very well,'' the angel announces, ''welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,'' and he lets the man enter.A few seconds later, a third man comes up to the gate. The angel is warming up to his task. ''OK, please tell me what it was like the day you died.''The man says, ''OK, picture this. I''m naked inside this refrigerator. . .''

President George W. Bush was getting angry about the public opinion of his<br /> ability to govern, so he arranged a press conference to let the American public<br /> know what was on his mind.<br /> He started strongly, "The American People must know that I am wholly fit,<br /> capable, and prepared to serve this nation as commander-in-chief. And I say to<br /> those people who believe that I don''t have a mind of my own..." Bush said and<br /> froze. He looked over at Cheney and whispered, "Dick, what do I say to them<br /> again...?"
There''s a teacher in a small Texas town. She asks her class how many of them are Bush fans. Not really knowing what a Bush fan is, but wanting to be liked by the teacher, all the kids raise their hands except one boy, little Johnny. The teacher asks little Johnny why he has decided to be different. Johnny says, "I''m not a Bush fan." The teacher says, "Why aren''t you a Bush fan?" Johnny says, "Because I''m a Clinton fan." The teacher asks why he''s a Clinton fan. The boy says, "Well, my mom''s a Clinton fan and my dad''s a Clinton fan, so I''m a Clinton fan!" The teacher is kind of angry, because this is Texas, so she says, "What if you''re mom was a moron and you''re dad was an idiot, what would that make you?" Johnny says, "That would make me a Bush fan!"

He danced with joy and did a flip. </p>\n<p>As Jesus walked toward the Democrat, the Democrat jumped back and exclaimed, "Don''t touch me, I''m drawing disability!"

There are a lot of stupid people out there.

Little David was in his 5th grade class when the teacher asked the children what their fathers did for a living. All the typical answers came up -- fireman, policeman, salesman, doctor, lawyer, etc.</p>\n<p>David was being uncharacteristically quiet and so he teacher asked him about his father. "My father''s an exotic dancer in a gay cabaret and takes off all his clothes in front of other men. Sometimes, if the offer''s really good, he''ll go out to the alley with some guy and do nasty things with him for money."</p>\n<p>The teacher, obviously shaken by this statement, hurriedly set the other children to work on some exercises and took little David aside to ask him, "Is that really true about your father?" "No," said David, "He works for the Bush administration, but I was too embarrassed to say that in front of the other kids."
George W. Bush told Dick Cheney, "I really hate all the stupid jokes people<br /> make about me."<br /> Cheney reassured him by saying, "Jokes can''t hurt you. They are just made up<br /> by a bunch of stupid people. In fact, most humans are quite stupid. Here, I''ll<br /> show you what I mean." </p>\n<p>Cheney goes outside and hails a D.C. cab and says to the driver, "Please take<br /> me to 261 M street to see if I''m home," said Cheney. </p>\n<p>Without a word, the cabbie took them straight to M Street. Cheney then rang<br /> the doorbell, came back to the car and said, "Oh, I guess I''m not there! Take us<br /> back to where we started, please." </p>\n<p>The cabbie did what he was told without a word. Cheney leaned over and said to<br /> Dubya, "You get the idea?

White House staffers were perplexed one morning to see Bill Clinton walk<br /> into the Oval Office with a pair of woman''s panties pinned to his arm. Somewhat<br /> used to the president''s tendencies, they let it go and went about their daily<br /> tasks.<br />     As the day wore on, several VIPs were ushered in and out of the Oval<br /> Office for meetings with Clinton about important affairs of the state.  Each one<br /> left with a puzzled expression on his face, but no one dared ask the President''s<br /> personal business.<br />     Finally, Betty Currie, Clinton''s loyal secretary walked into the office<br /> between appointments and gently closed the door behind her.  "Mr. President,"<br /> she said.<br />     "We''ve come to expect many unusual things from you but we''re all quite<br /> concerned that you seem to be wearing a pair of woman''s panties on your arm.<br /> Please tell me this doesn''t mean more   ''trouble''."<br />     "Oh no," the President grinned, "it''s the patch.  I''m trying to quit."

Bush and Cheney are at a restaurant for lunch. The waitress comes over and<br /> asks what they will be having. Bush says, "I''ll have a quickie." The waitress<br /> steps back in disgust and say, "Mr. President, I thought that kind of piggish<br /> behavior went out with the last administration!" She storms off and Dubai looks<br /> confused. Cheney shakes his head at the president and says, "George, it''s<br /> pronounced QUICHE."

It is said about the US president that before 9-11 he thought that the Taliban<br /> was a Bavarian brass band. Now the president of the world''s most powerful nation<br /> has put his foot in his mouth yet again. It was Condoleezza Rice, his national<br /> security advisor who had to rescue the situation. When talking with Brazilian<br /> president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 71, Bush surprisingly asked: "Do you have<br /> Blacks too?" Ms. Rice noticed how stunned and surprised Cardoso looked and<br /> quickly told Bush that Brazil likely has more blacks than the US and that<br /> outside of Africa it was the place with the highest number of blacks. The<br /> Brazilian president remarked later that Bush was "still in a learning-phase"<br /> when it came to South America."
The following statement has been translated into Ebonics. Good evening. (Yo Yo<br /> Yo, s''up?). This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the<br /> Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury. (Today at my crib these<br /> suckers and playa-haters started grillin'' a brotha). I answered their questions<br /> truthfully, including question about my private life, questions no American<br /> citizen would ever want to answer. (Dey started frontin'' about my game and<br /> asking all kinds of fowl sh-t). Still, I must take complete responsibility for<br /> all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you<br /> tonight. (I''m tired of these haters throwing salt in my game. I''m going to let<br /> yall know my Mackin style tonight). As you know, in a deposition in January, I<br /> was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers<br /> were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. (Awhile back, you nosey<br /> motherfu-ers wanted to know if I was hittin'' hoe-ass Monica''s skins. You ain''t<br /> got any video, so if you want to believe a $10 hoe then oh well).<br /> Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Levwinsky that was not appropriate.<br /> In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a<br /> personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.<br /> (Yeah, I was hittin'' that dime dropping Bit-h! She was only sucking my jammie<br /> though. I was stupid for messing with a young big mouthed skank. My bad, but<br /> don''t hate me because I''m a playa). But I told the grand jury today and I say to<br /> you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence.<br /> (Outside of that hit I told punk-ass AG (Al Gore) to put on gay-ass Star, Monica<br /> and her snitching friend, I was chill the whole time).<br /> I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to<br /> protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. (Check dis, I heard she<br /> was down with what ever, you know a freak ass beiach. She wasn''t all that but I<br /> planned to pimp her around to my boyz in the Senate). The independent counsel<br /> investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life. And<br /> now the investigation itself is under investigation. (Those haters started<br /> sweatin'' my homeys and my peeps. Dey pissed a nugga off when they tried to make<br /> me look like I''m not real or somefin. Matter of fact dey shady asses is on the<br /> take anyway).<br /> This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people.<br /> (Tryin'' to hit me they wasted a lot of Cheddar and pissed off my Crew). Nothing<br /> is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim<br /> my family life for my family. It''s nobody''s business but ours. (I''m a pimp and<br /> playa and I''m going to be one, dey can�酶惟t change a nugga! Get some businesses.<br /> Hillary is chill because I got more than enough White Water dirt on her ass that<br /> will get her sent up before I''m outtied).<br /> It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into<br /> private life and get on with our national life. (Get off my jock because I''m<br /> going to flex regardless. Just in case yall forgot until you chumps ax me I''m<br /> still the sh-t!) Now it is time - in fact, it is past time - to move on. (F-k<br /> all yall, I don''t give an f-k! Peace out!!!)
Jon bought two horses, and could never remember which was which. A neighbor suggested that he cut the tail of one horse  and that worked great until the other horse got his tail caught in  a bush. It tore just right and looked exactly like the other  horse''s tail and our friend was stuck again.The neighbor suggested Jon notch the ear of one horse. That  worked fine until the other horse caught his ear on a barbed  wire fence. Once again our friend couldn''t tell them apart.The neighbor suggested he measure the horses for height.  When he did, he was very pleased to find that the white horse  was 2 inches taller than the black.

I have a moral question for you. This is an imaginary situation, but I think it is fun to decide what one would do.The situation: You are in the Midwest, and there is a huge flood in progress.

A new priest is being given instructions on what to do when he takes confession. The older priest tells the new man, for things like stealing, give 5 hail mary''s, and for sleeping with the neighbours, 10 hail mary''s.</p>\n<p>So the new priest is taking confession one day. The first man in tells the priest he slept with the woman next door. The priest tells him to do 10 hail mary''s and he''s on his way.</p>\n<p>The next man in, confesses to having a wank behind a bush. Somewhat puzzled, the priest steps out of the confessional box and asks two passing alter boys what the "old man" gives for a wank behind a bush.</p>\n<p>The two boys reply, "A can of Coke and a Mars Bar."
President Clinton finishes his time on earth and approaches the Pearly Gates<br /> of Heaven.</p>\n<p>"And who might you be?" inquires St. Peter.</p>\n<p>"It''s me, Bill Clinton, formerly the President of the United States and Leader<br /> of the Free World."</p>\n<p>"Oh... Mr. President! What may I do for you?" asks St. Peter.</p>\n<p>"I''d like to come in," replies Clinton.</p>\n<p>"Sure," says the Saint. "But first you have to confess your sins. What bad<br /> things have you done in your life?"</p>\n<p>Clinton bites his lip and answers, "Well, I tried marijuana, but you can''t<br /> call it ''dope-smoking'' because I didn''t inhale. There were inappropriate<br /> extramarital relationships, but you can''t call it ''adultery'' because I didn''t<br /> have full ''sexual relations.'' And I made some statements that were misleading,<br /> but legally accurate, but you can''t call it ''bearing false witness'' because, as<br /> far as I know, it didn''t meet the legal standard of perjury."</p>\n<p>With that St. Peter consults the Book of Life briefly, and declares, "OK,<br /> here�酶惟s the deal. We''ll send you somewhere hot, but we won''t call it ''Hell.<br /> You''ll be there indefinitely, but we won''t call it ''eternity.'' And when you<br /> enter, you don''t have to "abandon all hope"; just don''t hold your breath<br /> waiting for it to freeze over!
One day, two skunks were walking down the street.One was a momma skunk, and one was a baby skunk. Suddenly, a little baby duck was crying in some bushes. The momma skunk says to the baby duck," why are you crying." The baby duck says," my mommy never told me what I was before she died." The momma skunk said," well, you have flippers, and white fur, you must be a duck. Suddenly, a car passes by and kills the momma skunk. Then the baby skunk starts crying. The baby duck says," why are you crying,". The baby skunk says," my mommy never told me what I was before she died." The baby duck said," well, your black, your white, and you sure do stink, you must be Puertorican.
One day three midgets were sitting around the table drinking tea and having crumpets.<br /> The first midget says to the other two, "You know, I think I have the smallest hands in the world."

I think I''ll go with you and try to get into the record book, too!" </p>\n<p>The third midget joins in with, "I''m going too because I think I have the smallest penis in the world. Let''s go!" </p>\n<p>So the midgets set off to the offices of the Guiness Book of World Records. </p>\n<p>When they arrive, the first midget is called in and is gone for awile. Finally he comes out very excited. "I made it! They measured my hands, and sure enough they are the smallest in the world. I''m in the record book!!" </p>\n<p>The second midget is called in, and soon he comes out very excited. "I made it too! They measured my feet and sure enough, they are the smallest in the world. I''m in the record book, too!!" </p>\n<p>The third midget goes in, is gone a very long time, so long that his friends became concerned. Finally he appears with a rather forlorn look on his face. </p>\n<p>"What''s the matter?", his friends asked. </p>\n<p>The third midget responds with "Who the hell is Bill Clinton?!?!!" </p>\n<p>Note to this joke: You can insert anyone''s (male) name in place of Bill Clinton.

When he does so, she begins to gently caress his beard which is full and bushy. </p>\n<p>"Are you the manager?" she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands." </p>\n<p>"Actually, no" he replies. </p>\n<p>"Can you get him for me - I need to speak to him?" she asks, running her hands up beyond his beard and into his hair. </p>\n<p>"I''m afraid I can''t" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. "Is there anything I can do?" </p>\n<p>"Yes there is. I need you to give him a message" she continues huskily, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently. "Tell him" she says "that there is no toilet paper or hand soap in the ladies room."

Bill Clinton steps out onto the White House lawn in the dead of winter. Right<br /> in front of him, on the White House lawn, he sees "The President Must Go"<br /> written in urine across the snow. Well, old Bill is pretty ticked off. He storms<br /> into his security staff�酶惟s HQ, and yells "Somebody wrote a threat in the snow on<br /> the front damn lawn! And they wrote it in urine! Son-of-a-bitch had to be<br /> standing right on the porch when he did it! Where were you guys?" The security<br /> guys stay silent and stare ashamedly at the floor. Bill hollers "Well dammit,<br /> don�酶惟t just sit there! Get out and FIND OUT WHO DID IT! I want an answer, and I<br /> want it TONIGHT!" The entire staff immediately jumps up and races for the exits.<br /> Later that evening, his chief security officer approaches him and says, "Well<br /> Mr. President, we have some bad news and we have some really bad news. Which do<br /> you want first?" Clinton says "Oh hell, give me the bad news first." The officer<br /> says, "Well, we took a sample of the urine and tested it. The results just came<br /> back, and it was Al Gore�酶惟s urine." Clinton says "Oh my god, I feel so... so...<br /> betrayed! My own Vice President! Damn.... Well, what�酶惟s the really bad news?"

A group of Texans are driving down the road, whooping it up, drinking beer and shooting off their guns when they get into an accident with busload of nuns and orphans, killing everyone. The Texans go straight to Hell. When they arrive the Devil is shocked to see that they are not in agony over the heat and he demands an explanation. </p>\n<p>"Well, sir, we''re from Texas, and we''re used to the heat," says one. This infuriates the Devil and he cranks the thermostat up to its highest setting. The lost souls all over hell start wailing. "I''ll check on them in the morning and see how they like THIS." He snorts and disappears in a ball of fire.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the Devil shows up at the Texans'' camp site, and sure enough they are showing some signs of discomfort. They have taken off their 10 Gallon hats and are fanning themselves. One has even rolled up his sleeves. "Well, sir," explains a Texan, "when you have been on a cattle drive in Lubbock during August, this ain''t hardly nothing." The Devil is now so angry he is seeing red.</p>\n<p>"Those damn Texans seem immune to heat, let ''s see what happens when I turn OFF the heat," he says as he heads to the thermostat. "I''ll check on them tomorrow."</p>\n<p>So in the morning the Devil arrives at the Texans'' campsite, and they are all whoopin'' and hollerin'' and drinkin'' the beers from the ice chest in the back of the pick up, now that they have ice to chill them with. The wail of the lost souls is deafening but the Texans are partyin'' like there is no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>"I don''t get it," the Devil says, completely defeated. "I tried to roast you and it had no effect, and then I tried to freeze you and you are partying. You Texans are made of tough stuff. But why are you celebrating?"</p>\n<p>A Texan takes a swig from a Bud in a longneck and replies, "Look around! Hell is frozen over. That''s just gotta mean George Bush got re-elected."

The Brazilians were who crashed the planes..."</p>\n<p>Entonces, Bush no soporta y despotrica:</p>\n<p>"FUCKING BRAZILIANS! ATTACK THEM! DESTROY THEM! Launch missiles, nuclear bombs, biological weapons, anthrax, hepatitis, gonorrhea, whatever! Start with their principal cities! Destroy their Capital City! I need to know which city is their Capital! Ask him!"</p>\n<p>El int�酶惟rprete puso su mejor voz conciliadora y como si nada pasara, pregunt�酶惟:</p>\n<p>"Disculpen os senhores, pero por gentileza, podriam me decir cual es a sua capital?"</p>\n<p>Era la pregunta que el brasile�酶惟o estaba esperando:</p>\n<p>"Seguro, tudo mundo conhece a nossa capital e...

I walk into our room and surely enough, find her sprawled out nekkid alone on our bed.  Sure that the guy was in the house, I searched frantically to find him... Under the bed, in the closet... Finally I found him hanging from our ledge on our balcony.  Furious, I stepped on his hand and he went plummetting two stories down.  However, he landed in a bush and I wasn''t sure if he was dead yet.  So I lifted the refrigerator and tossed it onto him.  Later, I felt so guilty I committed suicide."</p>\n<p>"Wow," said St. Peter, "that''s a pretty fantastic story."</p>\n<p>So St. Peter calls in the second guy.</p>\n<p>He said, "One day, I was having an argument with my wife.  She gets so mad that she pushes me right out the window of our fourth-story apartment.  So, quickly I grabbed on a ledge of a balcony on the second floor.  Then, suddenly, some nutcase steps on my hand and I go plummeting to the ground.  Luckily I landed on a bush, but then the nutcase drops a fridge on me!"</p>\n<p>Then St. Peter called in the third guy.  He says, "Alright, picture this:  You''re nekkid, and in a refrigerator..."

Reasons Women Should Not Have Freedom of Speech...</p>\n<p>1. She doesn''t need to talk to get me a beer.</p>\n<p>2. If she''s in the kitchen like she should be, no one can hear her anyway.</p>\n<p>3. If she can talk, all she''ll do is complain.</p>\n<p>4. Because she won''t say "I will" instead of "I do."</p>\n<p>5. No man wants to hear "first down" during a basketball game.</p>\n<p>6. Because PMS is no excuse for whining.</p>\n<p>7. No man needs or wants to hear the word "period" unless it has to do with hockey.</p>\n<p>8. Women created tampon and yeast infection commercials during football.</p>\n<p>9. Affirmative action.</p>\n<p>10. When men whistle at them in the street, they should just shut up and obey.</p>\n<p>11. If my dick''s in her mouth, she can''t talk anyway.</p>\n<p>12. Oprah.</p>\n<p>13. Feminists.</p>\n<p>14. Because that stupid look on her face should not be accompanied by an equally stupid statement.</p>\n<p>15. The 2nd and 19th amendments.</p>\n<p>16. I don''t want to be made to lie and say "I love you" after sex.</p>\n<p>17. Highway fatalities would decrease by over 90%.</p>\n<p>18.

If she can''t talk, she can''t bitch when I forget important dates.</p>\n<p>45. There are no speaking parts in pornos anyway.</p>\n<p>46. When she talks she''s not drinking, it''s hard to get her drunk when she talking.</p>\n<p>47. Nothing should come out a woman''s mouth, SWALLOW BITCH!</p>\n<p>48. The Mute button only works on the TV.</p>\n<p>49. Whores get paid by the hour not by the word.</p>\n<p>50. Helen Keller was the ultimate woman.</p>\n<p>51. Equality is for math.</p>\n<p>52. The credit card bill speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>53. If it hurts, I don''t wanna hear it.</p>\n<p>54. Marcia Clark.</p>\n<p>55. Chick-flicks.</p>\n<p>56. You don''t see Victoria''s Secret models talking, do you?</p>\n<p>57. Janet, Mariah, and Whitney.</p>\n<p>58. Michael Jackson.</p>\n<p>59. Silence and sex make a great combination.</p>\n<p>60. N. O.

As the Democratic Party hones its campaign strategy for<br /> next year''s election, it might look to Austin, Texas, where<br /> Democrats are facing off against Republicans using a<br /> strategy experts have dubbed "running like hell."</p>\n<p>Fifty-three legislators from the Texas House of<br /> Representatives bolted for the Oklahoma state line to<br /> prevent a vote that would redraw voting districts to favor<br /> the Republican House Majority.</p>\n<p>Speaker of the house Tom Craddick broke the news,<br /> saying, "we have found 40-plus members located in Ardmore,<br /> Oklahoma, they are staying at the Holiday Inn, at the<br /> present time, five minutes ago they were having dinner at<br /> Denny''s, for those of you who might be interested in that."<br /> Divisions in the Democratic ranks appeared at Denny''s,<br /> where representatives were deadlocked over the issue of<br /> whether or not the "Moons Over My Hammy" is delicious. </p>\n<p>VIOLENT DRILL TEAM </p>\n<p>A nationwide bio-terrorism drill was kicked off in Seattle<br /> last week, as a mock explosion of a dirty bomb tested the<br /> preparedness of firefighters, police, and other emergency<br /> workers. </p>\n<p>The Seattle drill is said to have run smoothly until news<br /> of the wartime re-enactment reached a group of nearby Civil<br /> War buffs, who excitedly set up a basecamp and attempted to<br /> saw off victims'' legs. </p>\n<p>According to Seattle mayor Greg Nickels, such an event is<br /> crucial to national security because, quote, "homeland<br /> security really begins at home." Nickels is actually<br /> speaking literally. Homeland security really does begin at<br /> his home as Tom Ridge is crashing on his couch for a couple<br /> of days. </p>\n<p>BLAIRLY LEGAL </p>\n<p>The New York Times recently printed an exhaustive front-<br /> page story flagellating itself for the deceptions of a<br /> Times reporter, Jayson Blair, while also providing the<br /> first evidence we''ve seen in years that newspapers have any<br /> sense of shame. </p>\n<p>Blair was discovered to have falsified and plagiarized<br /> dozens of stories for the Times. One glaring example of<br /> Blair''s deception were his vivid bedside descriptions of<br /> wounded Marines at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. The<br /> hitch is, he was never there but interviewed them by phone.<br /> This fact should have been more apparent when he relied on<br /> one heavily sedated Marine''s description of the other as "a<br /> quiet purple centaur with TV coming from his mouth." </p>\n<p>Expense reports show Blair was at home in Brooklyn when he<br /> was supposed to be in Maryland covering the sniper story.<br /> One embarrassingly false report that made the front page of<br /> the Times was titled, "Boy, There Sure is a Lot of Sniping<br /> Going on Here Where I Am. Maryland That is... Where I Am at<br /> Presently. Dang. Look Around at Maryland."
Spokesman Shows Footage of President Tumbling from Bike</p>\n<p>In what some political insiders were calling an attempt to lower expectations in the days leading up to the first presidential debate, the White House today announced that President Bush has an I.Q. of 67.</p>\n<p>"The president is far, far less intelligent than is commonly thought," White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.  "Even the simplest tasks remain well beyond his reach."</p>\n<p>Reinforcing the impression that the president will be overmatched in Thursday''s debate with Sen. John Kerry, Mr. McClellan showed reporters never-before-seen footage of Mr. Bush oafishly tumbling from his mountain bike.</p>\n<p>"What a moron," Mr. McClellan said.</p>\n<p>The White House spokesman said that Mr. Bush cannot possibly be expected to do well in a debate with Sen. Kerry, who Mr. McClellan said "has an I.Q. of 193" and "is widely considered the best debater on the planet."</p>\n<p>But within minutes of the White House press conference, Kerry spokesman Joe Lockhart fired back, telling reporters, "John Kerry is much stupider than he looks."</p>\n<p>As evidence of Mr. Kerry''s idiocy, Mr. Lockhart referred to the floral-patterned windsurfing pants the senator wears while enjoying his favorite water sport.</p>\n<p>"His ass looks enormous in those pants," Mr. Lockhart said.  "What kind of a moron would leave the house with his ass looking like that?"</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said today that it was unfair to compare the upcoming Iraqi elections to those held in America, "except for Florida."

While visiting England, George W. Bush is invited to tea with the Queen. He<br /> asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround<br /> herself with intelligent people. He asks how she knows if they''re intelligent. </p>\n<p>"I do so by asking them the right questions," says the Queen. "Allow me to<br /> demonstrate." </p>\n<p>She phones Tony Blair and says, "Mr. Prime Minister. Please answer this<br /> question: Your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child<br /> is not your brother or sister. Who is it?" </p>\n<p>Tony Blair responds, "It''s me, ma''am." </p>\n<p>"Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir," says the Queen. She hangs up and says,<br /> "Did you get that, Mr. Bush?" </p>\n<p>"Yes ma''am. Thanks a lot. I''ll definitely be using that!" </p>\n<p>Upon returning to Washington, he decides he''d better put the Chairman of the<br /> Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the test. He summons Jesse Helms to the<br /> White House and says, "Senator Helms, I wonder if you can answer a question for<br /> me." </p>\n<p>"Why, of course, sir. What''s on your mind?" </p>\n<p>"Uh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is<br /> not your brother or your sister. Who is it?" </p>\n<p>Helms hems and haws and finally asks, "Can I think about it and get back to<br /> you?" Bush agrees, and Helms leaves. He immediately calls a meeting of other<br /> senior senators, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody<br /> can come up with an answer. Finally, in desperation, Helms calls Colin Powell at<br /> the State Department and explains his problem. </p>\n<p>"Now look here Colin Powell, your mother has a child, and your father has a<br /> child, and this child is not your brother, or your sister. Who is it?" Powell<br /> answers immediately, "It''s me, of course, you dumb ass." </p>\n<p>Much relieved, Helms rushes back to the White House and exclaims, "I know the<br /> answer, sir! I know who it is! It''s Colin Powell!" And Bush replies in disgust,<br /> "Wrong, you dumb ass, It''s Tony Blair!"

Two guys were on a long drive back from a fishing trip, when the<br /> blond guy turned to the other and said he needed to go to the<br /> bathroom. So they stopped the truck and he went behind the<br /> bushes. When he came back the other said, "That was fast."</p>\n<p>"Well I need to take a shit but I''ve got nothing to wipe my ass<br /> with."</p>\n<p>The other answers, "That''s easy just go on back, pull out a<br /> dollar, and wipe your ass with it."</p>\n<p>"O.K." he says as he goes back over to the bush.

Not only did I get<br /> shit all over me, I''ve got 4 quarters stuck up my ass!"
One night, a group of gay men were playing truth or dare.   One man is dared  to walk down to the mini market naked and buy condoms and candy.   The man  goes to the store and buys the condom and candy, barely able to stop thinking  about how he will use the condoms when he got back to the house, but on the  way back he sees three nuns approaching.   The man jumped into a bush, but he  fails to conceal his erection.   One of the nuns sees his penis, and says.    "oh, look! a slot machine. ill go first". so the nun yanks down on the mans  penis and waits to see if she one.   The man is pushed against a prickly  bush, and drops the condom.   "oh, look! i got a bendable thimble! now i  won''t poke myself when i sew." "oh, i wonder what i will get?" she pulls on  the "handle", and out falls the candy.   The third nun yanks on the handle,  hoping for something good, and shouts out: "i got hand lotion!"
Paul, a little boy was in church one Sunday with his mother, when he started<br /> feeling sick. "Mommy," he said, "can we leave now?"<br /> "No" the mother replied.<br /> "Well, I think I have to throw up!"<br /> "Then go out the front door and around to the back of the church and throw up<br /> behind a bush."<br /> After about sixty seconds, Paul returned to his seat.<br /> "Did you throw up?" Mom asked.<br /> "Yes."<br /> "How could you have gone all the way to the back of the church and returned so<br /> quickly?"<br /> "I didn''t have to go out of the church, Mommy. They have a box next<br /> to the front door that says, ''For the Sick''."

This is from a contest on Long Island. The requirements were to use the words<br /> Lewinski and Kaczynski in a limerick. Here are the 3 winners. Entry # 1 There<br /> once was a gal named Lewinsky Who played on a flute like Stravinsky ''Twas "Hail<br /> to the Chief" on this flute made of beef that stole the front page from<br /> Kaczynski. Entry # 2 Said Bill Clinton to young Ms. Lewinsky We don''t want to<br /> leave clues like Kaczynski, Since you look such a mess, use the hem of your<br /> dress And wipe that stuff off of your chinsky. Entry # 3 Lewinsky and Clinton<br /> have shown what Kaczynski must surely have known: that an intern is better than<br /> a bomb in a letter given the choice of how to be blown.

Last winter, George W. Bush wanted to go ice fishing, so after gathering up<br /> all of the equipment, he headed toward the nearest frozen lake.  After getting<br /> comfy on his stool, he started to cut a circular hole in the ice.<br /> Then from the heavens, a voice boomed, ''''THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.''''<br /> Startled, George moved further down the ice, poured a thermos of hot chocolate<br /> and started to cut yet another hole in the ice.<br /> The voice boomed, ''''THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.''''<br /> This time, he was quite scared, so George moved to the far end of the ice and<br /> started another hole.<br /> Once again the voice said, ''''THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.''''<br /> The very scared, very shook up, "leader of the free world" raised his head and<br /> trembled, ''''Is that you, Lord?''''<br /> The voice answered, ''''NO.  IT IS THE MANAGER OF THE ICE RINK.''''

A few years ago, I applied for a job at Kodak.  I made it through all the interviews with flying colours, and the only thing left was the drug test.  I was confident in passing, but there was one slight problem: I have *very* shy kidneys.  I''ve had to sneak out of the doctor''s office on more than one occasion, because I can''t "go" and fill up a cup on command.  Usually, this is a good thing, as I can go to a concert or football game, drink beer all day, and be fine until I get home, while my friends are standing in line in the bathrooms several times during the same time period.So, to prepare, on the morning I had to take the test, I drank my usual 10-cup pot of coffee, and several large glasses of water, and for the 20-minute trip to Kodak, I filled a plastic gallon jug with water, and finished it off on the way.   Now, Kodak has huge parking lots, each containg hundreds and hundreds of cars, and by the time I got there, the visitor''s lots were pretty full, and I had to park way in the back.As soon as I got out of my car, I''m thinking, "Good, it worked, I think I can go!"  By the time I''d finished the 10-minute walk to the entrance, I was thinking, "Boy, no problems now, I can *definitely* go!"To get in, I had to go past a security hut.  I told them why I was there, and they told me where to report, about another 10-minute walk, a little ways into the plant.  I had to pass building after building before I got to the right one, every step of the way, becoming actually painful, and before I was there, I was looking at bushes and doorways and the like, thinking, "Well, if it gets too bad, I could go there, or maybe there, or..."By the time I got to the right building, I was just about in agony. I found the right area, and the receptionist told me to take a seat with about 8 other people.  I sat down, thinking that would help, but 10 seconds later I was up, walking around, trying to read stuff on the wall, anything to keep my mind occuppied, but managing to read 5 or 10 words, and then having to pace again.Finally, I couldn''t take it anymore, and after having asked the girl a couple of times how long, I told her, "look, either you get me in *now*, or I use the bathroom over there, and we reschedule!!" She said she''d see what she could do, and left.  I went back to sit down, and it took all of 5 seconds before I was up pacing again. She came back a few minutes later, and told me to go on in.When I got to the actual room, there were 4 people standing in line.  I hopped up and down a couple of times, before I passed the others, went to the nurses, and told them I have to go **NOW**!!! They asked the others in line if anyone objected, and they said no, so they said as soon as one of the 2 bathrooms come free, I could go.  I snatched the cup out of his hand, and practically raced down the aisle to the bathrooms and just stood waiting.  It couldn''t have been more than 20 seconds or so, but they were some of the most agonizing seconds of my life!!Finally, one of the doors opened, and I nearly flattened some poor girl coming out in my rush to get in.  I closed the door, grabbed my pants, breathed in, and dropped them and then my underwear, and then the world caved in...  I started going.  And going.  And going. I could have knocked down the Berlin wall with the force!   But the problem was, that I couldn''t "grab" it!!  It was whipping around like one of those Water Wiggle things.  I''m trying like heck to reign it it in, but just couldn''t.  I''m dancing around in a circle, with my pants around my ankles, trying to grab it, and it was just about impossible for probably a good 15 seconds.  Finally, I did, and was able to aim in the toilet, just remembering at the end to put a shot or two in the cup to put on the little shelf.   By the time I''d stopped, I was physically spent, and just leaned up against the wall, feeling like I''d just run a marathon...It was then that was able to survey the bathroom.  It was a room, about 7x7, but my god...  I had finished the most intense pee of my life in the john, but before I''d gained control, I''d soaked the entire toilet, the sink, the floor, the walls.  You name it, it was drenched -- including my pants and underwear.  I tried soaking it up with toilet paper (using the whole roll as a sponge), but that was drenched and didn''t work that well.  I''d also soaked the extra rolls on the back of the toilet, the paper towel holder, and the extra roll of paper towels.  I went through the garbage, pulling out half-soaked old towels, just trying to make the place semi-presentable, as in the sink and the mirror, but it didn''t do much good.  I was just ending up pushing the wet around, so I finally gave up.Steeling myself, I pulled up my wet underwear, then my wet pants, and pulled down my semi-wet shirt as much as possible, and went out. I whipped back up the aisle, thanking the nurse, without slowing down, and out the door as fast as my legs would carry me, imagining what the next person to use that bathroom would encounter. The silver lining:  I got the job!!

One night, at the lodge of a hunting club, two new members were being<br /> introduced to other members and shown around. The man leading them around<br /> said, "See that old man asleep in the chair by the fireplace? He is our<br /> oldest member and can tell you some hunting stories you''ll never forget."<br /> They awakened the old man and asked him to tell them a hunting story.<br /> "Well, I remember back in 1944, we went on a lion hunting expedition in<br /> Africa. We were on foot and hunted for three days without seeing a thing.<br /> On the fourth day, I was so tired I had to rest my feet. I found a fallen<br /> tree, so I laid my gun down, propped my head on the tree, and fell asleep.<br /> I don''t know how long I was asleep when I was awakened by a noise in the<br /> bushes. I was reaching for my gun when the biggest lion I ever saw jumped<br /> out of the bushes at me like this, ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!! I<br /> tell you, I just shit in my pants." The young men looked astonished and<br /> one of them said, "I don''t blame you, I would have shit my pants too if a<br /> lion jumped out at me." The old man shook his head and said, "No, no, not<br /> then, just now when I said ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!

Here''s something everyone should probably know:<br /> You may remember that on July 2, 1947, witnesses claim a spaceship with four<br /> aliens aboard crashed on a sheep-and-cattle ranch outside Roswell, New Mexico.<br /> This is an incident, of course, that many say has been covered up by the<br /> government.<br /> However, you may not know that on March 31,1948, exactly nine months after<br /> that day, Al Gore was born.<br /> Now, that clears up a lot of things.
One day George W. Bush, Al Gore, and Bill Clinton were in a boat. All of a<br /> sudden the boat sprung a leak and they had only one life jacket.

An atheist was walking through the woods one day in Alaska, admiring<br /> all that evolution had created. "What majestic trees! What a powerful<br /> river! What beautiful animals!" he said to himself. As he was<br /> walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind<br /> him. Turning to look, he saw a 13-foot Kodiak brown bear beginning<br /> to charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could down the path. He<br /> looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was rapidly closing<br /> on him. Somehow, he ran even faster, so scared that tears came to his<br /> eyes. He looked again and the bear was even closer. His heart pounding<br /> in his chest, he tried to run faster yet. But alas, he tripped and<br /> fell to the ground. As he rolled over to pick himself up, the bear was<br /> right over him, reaching for him with its left paw and raising its<br /> right paw to strike him.</p>\n<p>"OH MY GOD! ..."</p>\n<p>Time stopped.</p>\n<p>The bear froze.</p>\n<p>The forest was silent.</p>\n<p>Even the river stopped moving ...</p>\n<p>As a brilliant light shone upon the man; a thunderous voice came from<br /> all around...</p>\n<p>"YOU DENY MY EXISTENCE FOR ALL THESE YEARS, TEACH OTHERS THAT I DON''T<br /> EXIST AND EVEN CREDIT CREATION TO SOME COSMIC ACCIDENT. DO YOU EXPECT<br /> ME TO HELP YOU OUT OF THIS PREDICAMENT? AM I TO COUNT YOU AS A<br /> BELIEVER?"</p>\n<p>Difficult as it was, the atheist looked directly into the light and<br /> said, "It would be hypocritical to ask to be a Christian after all<br /> these years, but perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?"</p>\n<p>"VERY WELL." Said God.</p>\n<p>The light went out.</p>\n<p>The river ran.</p>\n<p>The sounds of the forest resumed.</p>\n<p>... And the bear dropped down on his knees, brought both paws<br /> together, bowed his head and spoke: "Lord, thank you for this food<br /> which I am about to receive."

With the upcoming 2000 elections there has been a lot of confusion over the<br /> players crucial to the next election. So I''ve found a way to simplify this topic<br /> very well. </p>\n<p>This is all the Wizard of Oz. Dan Quayle is the scarecrow who needs a brain.<br /> Al Gore is the tinman. Colin Powell is the cowardly lion who never manages to<br /> run for office. Elizabeth Dole is Dorothy who doesn''t know where she is and not<br /> quite sure where she''s going. </p>\n<p>And of course we have to mention Clinton because he''s a factor while all this<br /> is going on. Clinton is of course Toto, because throughout all this he''s trying<br /> to get up into Dorothy''s skirt.

Bush and Cheney went hunting, killed a giant buck, and were dragging it by the legs back to their car, when they were approached by a seasoned old hunter."Hello, Mr. President, and Vice President.  If I may please make a suggestion... it would be much easier for you to drag your deer in the other direction.   Then the antlers won''t dig into the ground." The leaders of the free world thanked the man and tried his suggesion.  A while later Cheney said, "You know, that was good thinking. This is a lot easier!""Yessir," agreed Bush."But durn it!

One day they are walking together past the White House when they hear the voice of a man crying out, "Help, Help." </p>\n<p>Quickly, they respond to the call by leaping over the White House fence, and by following the cries, they eventually come upon Bill Clinton, drowning in the White House swimming pool. In an heroic rush, they pull him from the pool, then give him artificial respiration, clearly saving his life. </p>\n<p>After a few minutes, Clinton says to them, "Well, boys, today you saved my life! And I am willing to give each of you any wish you desire, as long as it is within my power as President!" </p>\n<p>The first fellow thinks for a few seconds then says, "I have always wanted to go to West Point. Can you get me an appointment?" </p>\n<p>"You bet!" said the President, "I''ll sign the papers this afternoon!" </p>\n<p>Then the second fellow said, "I''ve always wanted to go to Annapolis. Can you get me in?" </p>\n<p>"You bet I can," said the President. "I''ll sign the papers for it this afternoon, too." </p>\n<p>After a few moments more, the third fellow said, "I''d like to know, can you get me buried in Arlington National Cemetery?" </p>\n<p>Clinton, a bit startled, thought for a second or two, then said, "Sure, but tell me, aren''t you awfully young to be thinking about such things?" </p>\n<p>"Nope," replied the remaining fellow. "Because when I get home and tell my old man what I did today, he''s going to kill me!"

Today''s headline read: "Clinton Probe Expands".</p>\n<p> It turned out to be a direct quote attributed to Monica Lewinsky.
A young nun joined a church to serve God. She was very religious<br /> and very good. It all happened one day, she suddenly had this<br /> desire to have sex. She knew it''s wrong but she couldn''t help<br /> it. Confused, she consulted with an elder nun for solution.</p>\n<p>The old nun handed her a gun and said, "My young one, in this<br /> sort of situation, you can go somewhere, where nobody can find<br /> you, and fire a blank shot from the gun. It''ll ease your desire."</p>\n<p>The Young Nun didn''t believe it, but she thought, what could be<br /> worse? So she found herself a place and shot the gun.<br /> Mysteriously, the desire had vanished. The young nun thanked the<br /> Old nun.</p>\n<p>Days after days, week after weeks, the desire started to grow<br /> stronger and stronger. The young nun started to fire the gun<br /> more and more. She couldn''t help it. Disturbed, she wondered why<br /> the old nun seemed to have no sexual desire or whatsoever. She<br /> decided to investigate.</p>\n<p>One afternoon after lunch, the young nun followed the old nun<br /> until she went back to her room. After hours of waiting, the old<br /> nun came out with a huge backpack, sneaking out the church. The<br /> curious young nun followed her.</p>\n<p>The old nun stopped at the tip of the hill behind the church.<br /> The young nun hid behind a bush and observed. To her horror, the<br /> old nun grabbed two assault rifles from the pack, and started<br /> firing, with a grenade launcher ready at hand.

An old wizard was walking through a park when he came upon two statues. One statue was male and the other was female. They were positioned on opposite ends of the park, facing each other with their arms extended out as if to embrace. The wizard stood there for a long time examining their sad facial expressions until he got an idea.         He immediately opened up his bag of tricks and cast a spell on the statues to bring them to life. Once the statues realized they were human, they quickly ran up to him. The wizard, being very pleased with himself, told the statues that they could finally be together as a couple but there was one condition. He said, ''''Go off and experience with each other whatever you''ve wanted to do for all these years but you must be back within a half an hour before the spell wears off.''''          Wasting no time, they quickly ran off into the bushes. The wizard, with great pride, sat down on a park bench and waited patiently. Fifteen minutes later the two statues came walking back to him.         The wizard, with great shock exclaimed, ''''For over a hundred years you both have bore your passions and now that you have your chance, you come back after only fifteen minutes? Go back to the bushes and continue what you were doing before you lose your only chance!''''        With that in mind the female turns to the male and exclaims, ''''The old man''s right. But this time you hold down the pigeons and I''ll crap on them!''''

Bush asks: "George, what is the best thing I could do to help the<br /> country?" </p>\n<p>"Set an honest and honorable example, just as I did," Washington advises. </p>\n<p>The next night, the ghost of Thomas Jefferson moves through the dark bedroom.<br /> "Tom," W asks, "what is the best thing I could do to help the country?" </p>\n<p>"Cut taxes and reduce the size of government," Jefferson advises. </p>\n<p>Bush isn''t sleeping well the next night, and sees another figure moving in the<br /> shadows. It''s Abraham Lincoln''s ghost. "Abe, what is the best thing I could do<br /> to help the country?" Bush asks.</p>\n<p>Abe answers: "Go see a play."
Monica Lweinski came into Bill Clintons office. Bill got up and closed the<br /> door. He walked over to Monica, dropped his pants, pointed to his pecker and<br /> said, "How do you like my clock?" </p>\n<p>Monica said, "What are you talking about, thats not a clock?" </p>\n<p>Bill answered, "Well then, put two hands and a face on it!"

One thing we can all agree on... Bill Cilnton will be remembered as the<br /> President after Bush!
Laura Bush goes to a new doctor in Washington for an examination and he discovers that she has CRABS. He thinks to himself, "How am I going to tell the 1st lady that she has crabs?" After the exam he tells her to get dressed and meet him back in his office. Once there he proceeds to tell her that she has a very unusual condition. She is quite concerned and asks him what it is. He responds that she is suffering from NIXON''S  DISEASE. The first lady says, "WHAT?" He again responds, "Nixon''s  Disease." She says, "Level with me doc, what does it mean?" He responds, "Well Mrs. Bush, to put it very bluntly, you''ve got bugs in your oval office!!"
Knock knock?<br /> Who�酶惟s there?<br /> Mr. Bush.<br /> Mr. Bush who?<br /> Mr. Bush but hit her belly.
George W. Bush was passing through an airplane terminal and he<br /> noticed an old man in a long white robe, with a long white<br /> beard, long white hair and carrying two stone tablets in his<br /> arms. He approached the man and asked reverently, "Aren''t you<br /> Moses?" </p>\n<p>But the man wouldn''t listen to him and continued walking. George<br /> asked him again, "Aren''t you Moses?"</p>\n<p>The old man continued ignoring him, even turning his back on<br /> little Bush. George grabs the man''s arm, looks him right in the<br /> eye and insists, "Answer me -- Aren''t you Moses?" </p>\n<p>The man replies, "I''m not saying a thing! The last time I spoke<br /> to a Bush I ended up roaming the desert for 40 years!"
Police in George, WA issued a report on the events leading up to the deaths of Ro`ert Uhlenake (24) and his friend, Ormond D. Young (27) at the Metallica concert last Friday. Uhlenake and Young were found dead at the Gorge Amphitheater after the show. Uhlenake was in pickup that was on top of Young at the bottom of a 20 ft drop. Young was found with severe lacerations, numerous fractures, contusions, and a branch in his anal cavity. He also had been stabbed and his pants were in a tree above him, some 15 ft off the ground; adding to the mystery of the heretofore unexplained scene. </p>\n<p>According to Commissioner-In-Charge Inoye Appleton, Uhlenake and Young had tried to get tickets for the sold-out concert. When they were unable to get any tickets, the two decided to stay in the lot and drink. Once the show began, and after the two had consumed 18 beers between the two of them, they hit upon the idea of scaling the 7 foot wooden security fence around the perimeter of the site and sneak in. They apparently moved the truck up to the edge of the fence and decided that Young would go over first and assist Uhlenake later. </p>\n<p>They had not counted on the fact that while it was a 7 foot fence on the parking lot side, there was a 23 foot drop on the other side. Young, who weighed 255 lbs and was quite inebriated, had jumped up and over the fence and promptly fell about half the 23 foot distance before a large tree branch broke his fall AND his left forearm; unfortunately, he also managed to get his shorts caught on the branch. Since he was now in a lot of pain and with no way to extricate himself and his shorts from the tree, he decided, seeing bushes down below, to cut his shorts off and fall to the ground. Upon cutting the last bit of fabric from himself, he suddenly plummeted to earth, losing grip of the knife. </p>\n<p>The "soft" bushes were actually holly bushes and landing in them caused a massive number of cuts. He also had the misfortune of landing squarely on a holly bush branch; effectively impaling himself. The knife, which he had accidentally released 15 ft up, now landed and stabbed him in his left thigh. Apparently, he was in a lot of pain. Enter his friend Robert. Uhlenake had apparently observed the last bit of this and, despite his inebriated state, realized that Young was in trouble. He hit upon the idea of lowering a rope to his friend and pull him up and over the fence. </p>\n<p>This was complicated by the fact that Uhlenake was outweighed by his friend `y a good 100 lbs. Again, despite his state he realized he could use their truck to pull Young out. Unfortunately, because of his state, Uhlenake put the truck in reverse, rather than drive, broke through the fence, landed on Young (killing him), was thrown out of the truck and subsequently died of internal injuries. "So that''s how a dead 255 lb man with no pants on, with a truck on top of him and a stick up his ass came to be" said Commissioner Appleton.
Good afternoon. I''m Al Gore, and I''d like to tell you about myself.<br /> I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black<br /> child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I was born in a log cabin<br /> that I built with my own hands. I taught myself to read by candlelight and<br /> helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a<br /> Mississippi River steamboat.<br /> My mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles<br /> to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought I<br /> never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration<br /> for "Huckleberry Finn."<br /> Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens. One day, a<br /> traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going<br /> to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I<br /> made an impression. You see, the minister''s name was Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /> My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and<br /> said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a<br /> hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school."<br /> But life of privilege was not for me. After getting my high school diploma, I<br /> took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the treatment of<br /> the workers there that I organized a union. Later, that experience inspired a<br /> movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me<br /> "Norma Rae."<br /> When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called<br /> and offered me a scholarship. I captained the hockey team to four consecutive<br /> national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win<br /> the Heisman Trophy.<br /> During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing<br /> lead guitar for a little rock band. You may have heard of it-the Rolling<br /> Stones.<br /> But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country. So<br /> I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I was deeply opposed to the<br /> war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the Medal of Honor<br /> and the Croix de Guerre.<br /> When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours. I''ve<br /> crossed the deserts bare, man, I''ve breathed the mountain air, man, I''ve<br /> traveled, I''ve done my share, man, I''ve been everywhere. And the people I met at<br /> truck stops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the<br /> same thing: "Al, we need you in Washington."<br /> I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other<br /> business---building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon Society, doing<br /> the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the<br /> recipe for Mrs. Field''s chocolate chip cookies.<br /> Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and allowed them<br /> to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate, where I established<br /> the US Strategic Oil Reserve. And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for<br /> no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once again and took the<br /> oath of office as Vice President of the United States.<br /> Since then, I''ve been part of the most successful administration in American<br /> history. And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet. Many times Bill Clinton<br /> has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do. And when I<br /> would give him my thoughts, he would invariable say, "Of course. That''s<br /> brilliant. Why didn''t I think of that?"<br /> During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he<br /> only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away form that dark-haired<br /> intern. So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked<br /> if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign. And Bill Clinton<br /> gave me a few simple words of advice-words I''ll never forget.<br /> He looked me in the eye and he said, "Al, just tell the truth, it''s always<br /> worked for me."

Bill Clinton and his driver were cruising along a country road one night<br /> when all of a sudden they hit a pig, killing it instantly. Bill told his<br /> driver to go up to the farmhouse and explain to the owners what had<br /> happened. About one hour later Bill sees his driver staggering back to the<br /> car with a bottle of wine in one hand, a cigar in the other and his<br /> clothes all ripped and torn. "What happend to you?" asked Bill. "Well, the<br /> Farmer gave me the wine, his wife gave me the cigar and his 19-year-old<br /> daughter made mad passionate love to me." "My God, what did you tell<br /> them?" asks Clinton. The driver replies, "I''m Bill Clinton''s driver, and I<br /> just killed the pig."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>\n<p>Microsoft Addresses Justice Department Accusations</p>\n<p>REDMOND, Wash. - Jul. 1, 1998 -- In direct response to accusations made by<br /> the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today that it<br /> will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of America<br /> for an undisclosed sum.</p>\n<p>"It''s actually a logical extension of our planned growth", said Microsoft<br /> chairman Bill Gates, "It really is going to be a positive arrangement for<br /> everyone".</p>\n<p>Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of the White<br /> House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and assured members of the press<br /> that changes will be "minimal". The United States will be managed as a<br /> wholly owned division of Microsoft. An initial public offering is planned<br /> for July of next year, and the federal government is expected to be<br /> profitable by "Q4 1999 at latest", according to Microsoft president Steve<br /> Ballmer.</p>\n<p>In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had "willingly and<br /> enthusiastically" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft,<br /> and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting<br /> directly to Bill Gates. When asked how it felt to give up the mantle of<br /> executive authority to Gates, Clinton smiled and referred to it as "a<br /> relief". He went on to say that Gates has a "proven track record", and<br /> that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their "full support and confidence".</p>\n<p>Clinton will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he<br /> has earned as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as<br /> "silly", though did say that he would make executive decisions for the<br /> U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters. Gates<br /> went on to say that the House and Senate would "of course" be abolished.<br /> "Microsoft isn''t a democracy", he observed,"and look how well we''re doing".</p>\n<p>When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was proceeding,<br /> Gates said, "We don''t deny that discussions are taking place".</p>\n<p>Microsoft representatives closed the conference by stating that United<br /> States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in<br /> government services and discounts on all Microsoft products.</p>\n<p>About Microsoft</p>\n<p>Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ "MSFT") is the worldwide leader in<br /> software for personal computers, and democratic government. The company<br /> offers a wide range of products and services for public, business and<br /> personal use, each designed with the mission of making it easier and more<br /> enjoyable for people to take advantage of the full power of personal<br /> computing and free society every day.</p>\n<p>About the United States</p>\n<p>Founded in 1789, the United States of America is the most successful<br /> nation in the history of the world, and has been a beacon of democracy and<br /> opportunity for over 200 years. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the<br /> United States is a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation.

George W. Bush, John Ash croft, and Kathrine Harris go fishing on the lake by<br /> George W.''s ranch. While speeding across the lake they hit a tree trunk, which<br /> cracks a hole in the bottom of the boat. The boat starts to sink so they look<br /> for life preservers and find only one. George W. Bush says: "I''m the President<br /> selected by the Supreme Court. The people need me to protect the nation from the<br /> new world order and the growth of the new economy and computers and such." John<br /> Ash croft says: "I''m the Attorney General and as the nations'' chief law<br /> enforcement officer I must live so that there will be no fear or panic in the<br /> streets, if you two shall die.

Finally, Kathryn Harris<br /> says: "I''m the Florida Secretary of State and the state Republican Chairwoman,<br /> and I must survive so that I can deliver the votes needed by all the Republican<br /> officials throughout the state, and disenfranchise those minorities who vote for<br /> Democrats, so that Republicans may continue to be elected even though more<br /> people vote for Democrats."

They cut up three squares of paper and vote by<br /> secret ballot. Then they open the ballots to tally them. The first ballot says<br /> "George W. Bush - one vote," the second ballot says "John Ash croft - one vote",<br /> and the third ballot says "Kathryn Harris - 37 votes."

"How can you prove to me you''re<br /> George W. Bush?" Saint Peter said. Bush replied, "Well heck, I don�酶惟t know." St.<br /> Peter says, "Well, Albert Einstein showed me his equations and Picasso drew his<br /> famous pictures. What can you do to prove you''re George W. Bush?" Bush replies,<br /> "Who are Albert Einstein and Picasso?" St. Peter says, "It must be you, George,<br /> c''mon on in."

The phone, it went Green, Green, Green, I Pink it up and sez Yellow?"

One day a fly was flying over a lake. In the lake a trout said<br /> to himself, "If that fly will drop four inches, I can jump out<br /> and catch it." Behind a shrub a bear said to himself, "If that<br /> fly will drop four inches, the trout will jump out of the water<br /> and catch it, so I can reach out and grab the trout." On a hill<br /> sat a hunter who said, "If that fly will drop four inches, the<br /> trout will jump out of the water and catch it, the bear will<br /> reach out and grab the trout, and it will expose him for a clear<br /> shot." Behind A bush there was a rat who said, "If that fly will<br /> drop four inches, the trout will jump out of the water and catch<br /> it, the bear will reach out and grab the trout, the hunter will<br /> have a clear shot at the bear and run down to get his kill, and<br /> I can steal his food." Behind a tree was a cat who said, "If<br /> that fly will drop four inches, the trout will jump out of the<br /> water and catch it, the bear will reach out and grab the trout,<br /> the hunter will have a clear shot at the bear and run down to<br /> get his kill, the rat will steal the hunter''s food, and I can<br /> pounce on the rat." Well, everything began: the fly dropped four<br /> inches, the trout caught the fly, the bear reached out and<br /> grabbed the trout exposing himself, the hunter shot the bear and<br /> ran down for his kill, the rat stole the hunter''s food, and the<br /> cat tripped and rolled all the way down the hill into the lake.</p>\n<p>Moral: When the fly drops, the pussy gets wet.

A group of Texans are driving down the road, whooping it up, drinking beer and shooting off their guns when they get into an accident with busload of nuns and orphans, killing everyone. The Texans go straight to Hell. When they arrive the Devil is shocked to see that they are not in agony over the heat and he demands an explanation.</p>\n<p>"Well, sir, we''re from Texas, and we''re used to the heat," says one. This infuriates the Devil and he cranks the thermostat up to its highest setting. The lost souls all over hell start wailing. "I''ll check on them in the morning and see how they like THIS." He snorts and disappears in a ball of fire.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the Devil shows up at the Texans'' camp site, and sure enough they are showing some signs of discomfort. They have taken off their 10 Gallon hats and are fanning themselves. One has even rolled up his sleeves. "Well, sir," explains a Texan, "when you have been on a cattle drive in Lubbock during August, this ain''t hardly nothing." The Devil is now so angry he is seeing red.</p>\n<p>"Those damn Texans seem immune to heat, let ''s see what happens when I turn OFF the heat," he says as he heads to the thermostat. "I''ll check on them tomorrow." </p>\n<p>So in the morning the Devil arrives at the Texans'' campsite, and they are all whoopin'' and hollerin'' and drinkin'' the beers from the ice chest in the back of the pick up, now that they have ice to chill them with. The wail of the lost souls is deafening but the Texans are partyin'' like there is no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>"I don''t get it," the Devil says, completely defeated. "I tried to roast you and it had no effect, and then I tried to freeze you and you are partying. You Texans are made of tough stuff. But why are you celebrating?"</p>\n<p>A Texan takes a swig from a Bud in a longneck and replies, "Look around! Hell is frozen over. That''s just gotta mean there is another Bush in the White House."

There was this fly hovering about 8 inches above the surface of the river, but unbeknown to the fly, just below the surface of the river there was this salmon looking up at the fly thinking, ''If that fly was to come just six inches lower I would leap out of this water and have it for my tea.'' But unbeknown to the fish, there was this bear watching it, thinking, ''If that fly was to come just six inches lower, that fish would leap out of the water and take it for its tea, and I could reach out and take that fish for my tea.'' But unbeknown to the bear, in the bushes was a hunter with his gun thinking, ''If that fly was to come just six inches lower, that fish would leap out of the water and take it for its tea, that bear would reach out and take that fish for its tea, and I could lean forward with my gun and shoot that bear.'' But, unbeknown to the hunter, there was this mouse thinking, ''If that fly was to come just six inches lower, that fish would leap out of the water and take it for its tea, that bear would reach out and take that fish for its tea, that hunter would lean forward with his gun and shoot that bear and I could run between the hunters legs and have his sandwich''s for my tea.'' But unbeknown to the mouse, there was this cat thinking, ''If that fly was to come just six inches lower, that fish would leap out of the water and take it for its tea, that bear would reach out and take that fish for its tea, that hunter would lean forward with his gun and shoot that bear, that mouse would run between the hunters legs and have his sandwich''s for its tea and I could leap onto the mouse and have it for my tea.''<br /> Just then the fly dropped six inches, the fish jumped, the bear reached, the hunter leaned, the mouse ran, the cat leaped and missed, falling into the water. </p>\n<p>Which only goes to prove that "Whenever a fly drops six inches there is going to be a wet pussy".

Two nude statues (one male and one female) had been standing in a beautiful park for 99 years. On their 100th anniversary in the park an angel came down from heaven to talk to the statues.He said to them, ''God has been watching you for the past 100 years and has been very pleased with the two of you. So pleased in fact that he has decided to make you human for a short time.''The angel then went on to say that they would be human for 15 minutes and would finally be able to pleasure themselves in a manner in which they have only fantasized about for the last 100 years.The statues were so excited they could hardly believe it. The second they became human they ran off together behind the bushes. The angel heard the rustling of the bushes and shouts of joy and laughter.After 10 minutes the statues returned from behind the bushes sweating and laughing. The angel told the statues that they still had five more minutes.The male statue quickly turned to the female statue and said: `Cool, this time, you hold down the pigeon and I''ll shit on its head.''

Dear Diary:</p>\n<p>Day 1<br /> Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to celebrate. When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, he locked himself in the bathroom and cried.</p>\n<p>Day 2<br /> Today, he says he has a big secret to tell me. He''s impotent, he says, and he wants me to be the first to know. Why doesn''t he tell me something I don''t know! I mean, gimme a break. He''s been dysfunctional for so long that he even walks with a limp.</p>\n<p>Day 3<br /> This marriage is in trouble. A woman has needs. Yesterday, I saw a picture of the Washington Monument and burst into tears.</p>\n<p>Day 4<br /> A miracle has happened! There''s a new drug on the market that will fix his ''problem.'' It''s called Viagra. I told him that if he takes Viagra, things will be just like they were on our wedding night. He said, ''this time, I''d rather not have your mother join us.'' I think this will work. I replaced his Prozac with the Viagra, hoping to lift something other than his mood.</p>\n<p>Day 7<br /> This Viagra thing has gone to his head. No pun intended! Yesterday, at Burger King, the manager asked me if I''d like a Whopper. He thought they were talking about him. Get over yourself! Not everything is about you!</p>\n<p>Day 8<br /> I think he took too many over the weekend. Yesterday, instead of mowing the lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed wacker.</p>\n<p>Day 10<br /> Okay, I admit it. I''m hiding. I mean, a girl can only take so much. And to make matters worse, he''s washing the Viagra down with hard cider! The photo of Janet Reno isn''t working. What am I gonna do?</p>\n<p>Day 11<br /> The side effects are starting to get to him. Everything is turning blue. The other day, we were watching Kenneth Branaugh in Hamlet and he thought it was The Smurfs Do Denmark.</p>\n<p>Day 12<br /> I''m basically being drilled to death. It''s like going out with a Black and Decker power tool.</p>\n<p>Day 13<br /> I wish he was gay. I bought 400 Liza Minelli albums and I keep saying ''fabulous,'' and still he keeps coming after me!</p>\n<p>Day 14<br /> Now I know how Saddam Hussein''s wife feels. Every time I shut my eyes, there''s a sneak attack! It''s like going to bed with a scud missile. Let''s hope he''s not like ex-President Bush and takes 100 days to pull out!</p>\n<p>Day 15<br /> I''ve done everything to turn him off. Nothing is working. I even started dressing like a nun. Now he tells me sister Wendy revs his motor.</p>\n<p>Day 16<br /> I may just have to kill him. Then he''ll go out the way he wants to... stiff! With my luck, I won''t be able to close the casket.

Bush and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all. They sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dogfight. They would have 5 years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side''s dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. </p>\n<p>Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk. After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 " thick and nobody could get near it. </p>\n<p>When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a strange looking animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the Afghanistani dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it''s cage, and slowly waddled over towards Osama''s dog. Osama''s dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged the American Dachshund---but when it got close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed Osama''s dog in one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all. </p>\n<p>Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, "We don''t understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves." </p>\n<p>"That''s nothing,", said Bush. "We had Michael Jackson''s plastic surgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog." </p>\n<p>GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!
What do Osama Bin Laden and pantyhose have in common?</p>\n<p>They both irritate Bush.
A gruop of reporters were interviewing Paula Jones. One of the reporters<br /> asked, "Ms. Jones was your relationship with the president anything like<br /> Monica Lewinsky''s?" Paula responded, "Close, but no cigar!"
You lose arguments with inanimate objects. You have to hold onto the lawn to keep from falling off the earth. Your job is interfering with your drinking. Your doctor finds traces of blood in your alchohol stream. Your career won''t progress beyond Senator from Massachusetts. The back of your head keeps getting hit by the toilet seat. You sincerely believe alchohol is the elusive 5th food group. 24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case - coincidence? I think not! Two hands and just one mouth... - now THAT''S a drinking problem! You can focus better with one eye closed. The parking lot seems to have moved while you were in the bar. You fall off the floor... Your twin sons are named Barley and Hops. Hey, 5 beers has just as many calories as a burger, screw dinner! Mosquitoes catch a buzz after attacking you. At AA meetings you begin: ''Hi my name is... uh...'' Your idea of cutting back is less salt. You wake up in the bedroom, your underwear is in the bathroom, you fell asleep clothed. The whole bar says ''Hi'' when you come in... You think the Four Basic Food Groups are Caffeine, Nicotine, Alchohol, and [Women or Men]. Every night you''re beginning to find your roommate''s cat more and more attractive. Roseanne looks good. Don''t recognize wife unless seen through bottom of glass. That damned pink elephant followed me home again. Senators Kennedy and Packwood shake their heads when they walk past you. I''m as sober as a judge. The shrubbery''s drunk from too frequent watering. You wake up screaming ''TORO TORO TORO!'' in the middle of the night.
Question: How do you tell the difference between Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Republicans?</p>\n<p>The answer can be found by posing the following problem.</p>\n<p>You''re walking down a deserted street with your wife and two small children.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a dangerous looking man with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, raises the knife, and charges.</p>\n<p>You are carrying a Glock and you are an expert shot. You have mere seconds before he reaches you and your family. What do you do?</p>\n<p>Democrat''s Answer:</p>\n<p>Well, that''s not enough information to answer the question!</p>\n<p>Does the man look poor or oppressed?</p>\n<p>Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack?</p>\n<p>Could we run away?</p>\n<p>What does my wife think?</p>\n<p>What about the kids?</p>\n<p>Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of his hand?</p>\n<p>What does the law say about this situation?</p>\n<p>Does the Glock have an appropriate safety built into it?</p>\n<p>Why am I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind of message does this send to society and to my children?</p>\n<p>Is it possible he''d be happy with just killing me and not my family?</p>\n<p>Does he definitely want to kill me, or would he be content just to wound me?</p>\n<p>If I were to grab his knees and hold on, could my family get away while he was stabbing me?</p>\n<p>Should I call 9-1-1?</p>\n<p>Why is this street so deserted?</p>\n<p>We need to raise taxes, have a paint and gardening day and make this a happier, healthier street that would discourage such behavior.</p>\n<p>This is all so confusing!</p>\n<p>I need to debate this with some friends for a few days and try to come to a consensus.</p>\n<p>Republican''s Answer:</p>\n<p>BANG!</p>\n<p>Southern Republican''s Answer:</p>\n<p>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!<br /> Click...(sounds of reloading).
Three limericks from a Long Island contest where you had to use the words Lewinski and Kaczynski.There once was a gal named LewinskyWho played on a flute like Stravinsky ''Twas ''''Hail to the Chief''''  On this flute made of beefThat stole the front page from Kaczynski.Said Bill Clinton to young Ms. LewinskyWe don''t want to leave clues like Kaczynski, Since you look such a mess, Use the hem of your dressAnd wipe that stuff off of your chinsky.Lewinsky and Clinton have shownWhat Kaczynski must surely have known: That an intern is better Than a bomb in a letterGiven the choice of how to be blown.
One day in the future, Bill Clinton has a heart attack, dies prematurely --<br /> and goes straight to Hell. The Devil greets him, but says "I don''t know<br /> exactly what to do with you. Of course you are on my list, so you will have<br /> to stay -- but you got here a little earlier than I expected and I don''t have<br /> your room ready yet."</p>\n<p>The Devil thinks for a moment and says, "Tell you what I can do. There are a<br /> couple folks here who weren''t quite as bad as you were. I can let one of them<br /> go so long as you take their place. I''ll even let you decide who gets to<br /> leave."</p>\n<p>Clinton thought that sounded pretty good, so the Devil opened the first room.<br /> In it was Ted Kennedy and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and<br /> surfacing empty handed. Over and over and over. Such was his fate in hell.</p>\n<p>"No," Bill said. "I don''t think so. I''m not a good swimmer and I don''t think<br /> I could be doing that all day long."</p>\n<p>The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Newt Gingrich with a<br /> sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, over<br /> and over again.</p>\n<p>"No, I''ve got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if<br /> all I could do was break rocks all day," said Bill.</p>\n<p>The devil opened a third door. In it, Clinton�酶惟saw Jesse Jackson, lying on the<br /> floor with his arms staked over his head, and his legs staked in a spread<br /> eagle position. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.</p>\n<p>His eyes widening in disbelief, Clinton grinned as he took in the whole<br /> picture and said, "Oh yea, I know can handle this."</p>\n<p>The Devil nodded and smiled. "OK, Monica, you''re free to go!"

George W. Bush said he is going to run his own campaign and be his own man.<br /> The amazing thing is he said this while his father was drinking a glass of<br /> water.
What is Monica Lewinsky''s favorite instrument?<br /> Well, she''s pretty good on the skin flute, but she really sucks on the organ.
In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com, did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot. And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg.<br /> Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. </p>\n<p>She said unto Abraham, her husband, "Why doth thou travel far from town to town with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?" And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, "How, Dear?" </p>\n<p>And Dot replied, "I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah''s Pony Stable (UPS)." </p>\n<p>Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. The drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. </p>\n<p>A man named Maccabia did secret himself inside Abraham''s drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com''s trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. </p>\n<p>And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would work only with Brother Gates'' drumheads and drumsticks. </p>\n<p>Dot did say, "Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others." And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known "eBay" he said, "we need a name that reflects what we are," and Dot replied, "Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators." </p>\n<p>"YAHOO", said Abraham. And that is how it all began, It wasn''t Al Gore after all.

Bill Clinton, George Bush and Osama Bin Ladin were riding in an airplane.  Bill Clinton said, "Hey, do you dare me to throw this acorn out of the window?", they said yes and he did.  George Bush said, "Hey, do you dare me to throw this apple core out of the window?", they said yes, and he did.  Osama Bin Ladin said, "Hey, do you dare me to throw this bomb out of the window?", they screamed "No!", but he did anyway.

I found<br /> a fallen<br /> tree, so I laid my gun down, propped my head on the tree, and<br /> fell asleep.</p>\n<p>I don''t know how long I was asleep when I was awakened by a noise<br /> in the<br /> bushes.  I was reaching for my gun when the biggest lion I ever<br /> saw jumped<br /> out of the bushes at me like this,<br /> ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!.</p>\n<p>I tell you, I just shit in my pants." </p>\n<p>The young men looked<br /> astonished and one<br /> of them said, "I don''t blame you, I would have shit my pants<br /> too if a lion<br /> jumped out at me." </p>\n<p>The old man shook his head and said,<br /> "No, no, not then,<br /> just now when I said ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!

Q: What is the difference between Hitler and Bill Clinton?<br /> A: Hitler intended to deliver on his speeches.
One beautiful morning a athiest was walking through the forest, admiring<br /> natures surroundings... </p>\n<p>He looked up and saw the trees swaying in the wind high above him and<br /> smiled... </p>\n<p>He saw the river glisten in the sun twinkle like a new born star and it made<br /> him warm inside... </p>\n<p>He thought to himself that mother nature had made a true and wonderful<br /> world... </p>\n<p>The athiest had walked a little further down the track he had taken when<br /> suddenly a bear jumped out of the bushes only a few yards ahead of him and<br /> started growling, looking hungry and ran quickly towards him... </p>\n<p>Seeing the big bear bounding towards him he screamed in horror and started<br /> running as fast as he could away from the bear... </p>\n<p>Knowing that the bear would catch up to him and he had no chance, the athiest<br /> soon ran out of breath and in a few paces fell to the ground... </p>\n<p>As the bears shadow fell upon his face and his paws come down upon his chest,<br /> the athiest screamed<br /> "oh help me god" </p>\n<p>Suddenly the trees that he so much admired stopped swaying... </p>\n<p>The river he loved suddenly stopped flowing.. </p>\n<p>And the sky opened up and a voice begun to speak.. </p>\n<p>"I am god, and even though you dont believe in me, i am here for every being<br /> on this earth" </p>\n<p>The athiest felt relieved a little bit and asked god... </p>\n<p>"Im sort of in this situation, im only asking if you can help me get out of<br /> it" </p>\n<p>God thought for a moment and said... </p>\n<p>"I will give you one wish to help you and that is all, you may proceed with<br /> this wish" </p>\n<p>The athiest thought about this wish for a moment and then spoke to god.. </p>\n<p>" Well i dont really want to become a christian, so i wish the bear to become<br /> a christian" </p>\n<p>God spoke... </p>\n<p>"So be it done" </p>\n<p>Suddenly the sky closed up... </p>\n<p>The river turned back into its flowing glory... </p>\n<p>The trees began to sway again... </p>\n<p>And the bear clapped his paws together and said... </p>\n<p>"Thankyou god for this meal im about to recieve"

Welstone of m.n. </p>\n<p>Gorge boy getting very upset and could not find any way to get rid of<br /> welstone. So he called crying to his dad and said�酶惟 dad I am going to lose m.n.<br /> To the democrats.hes dad replies�酶惟 I know, but I will take care of this just like<br /> I took care of you d.w.i.''s, your drug charges and your school grades".

His<br /> father replies, "I have, I put one of mr lautens suicide pilots in place of his<br /> reg. pilots. This way not only will you get to see him crash and burn but you<br /> will be also able to see what is going to happen in just a few weeks; oh by the<br /> way do not read the cia reports on your desk, that way after planes start<br /> falling out of the sky you can just say it was the cia fault for not keeping<br /> tabs on terrorist activity". With that said gorge boy tell his dad "what would I<br /> do with out you". His father says laughing " well you would just be getting out<br /> of prison and would be working at mucky d''s right now!!!" gorge boy says with<br /> excitement "really I always wanted to be a manager at micky d''s!!!
I have a moral question for you. This is an imaginary situation, but think it<br /> is fun to decide what one would do. The situation: You are in the Midwest, and<br /> there is a huge flood in progress. Many homes have been lost, water supplies<br /> compromised, and infrastructure destroyed. Let''s say you''re a photographer out<br /> getting still photos for a news service, traveling alone, looking for<br /> particularly poignant scenes. If you were to stumble across Bill Clinton<br /> struggling to keep from being swept away in a raging river and you had a choice<br /> of rescuing him or getting a Pulitzer prize-winning photograph of the President<br /> being swept away...........
One night, George W. Bush is awakened by George Washington''s ghost in the White House. Bush asks: "George, what is the best thing I could do to help the country?" </p>\n<p>"Set an honest and honorable example, just as I did," Washington advises. </p>\n<p>The next night, the ghost of Thomas Jefferson moves through the dark bedroom. "Tom," George asks, "what is the best thing I could do to help the country?" </p>\n<p>"Cut taxes and reduce the size of government," Jefferson advises. </p>\n<p>Bush isn''t sleeping well the next night, and sees another figure moving in the shadows. It''s Abraham Lincoln''s ghost. "Abe, what is the best thing I could do to help the country?" Bush asks. Abe answers flatly, "Go see a play."
At an Italian restaurant in Rome ... the owner wants to sue Bill Clinton for not showing up. </p>\n<p>The owner said it''s not fair that he should be kept waiting until two a.m. wondering if Bill was going to show or not. </p>\n<p>Hillary said ''Hey, tell me about it.''</p>\n<p>-Jay Leno

"We''ve tripled the amount of money �酶惟 I believe it''s from $50 million up to<br /> $195 million available." �酶惟George W. Bush, Lima, Peru, March 23, 2002
A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a<br /> comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the<br /> intercom, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to<br /> Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead<br /> is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now<br /> sit back and relax - OH MY GOD!" </p>\n<p>Silence followed and after a few minutes, the captain came back on the<br /> intercom and said, "Ladies and gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you<br /> earlier, but while I was talking, the flight-attendant brought me a cup of<br /> coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. You should see the front of<br /> my pants!" </p>\n<p>A passenger said, "That''s nothing. He should see the back of mine!"
George W. Bush is sitting in a hotel lobby, planning his speech to a group of<br /> businessmen, when a little man walks up to him. "Excuse me, Mr. Bush, but my<br /> name is Steve Case, and I''m here with an extremely important client tonight.<br /> We''re going to see your speech tonight, and it would be a great help to me if,<br /> when we walk by, you could impress him by saying, ''Hello, Steve''." </p>\n<p>Bush readily agrees, and fifteen minutes later, the little man walks by, deep<br /> in conversation with his client. </p>\n<p>Bush came up and said, "Hello, Steve." </p>\n<p>The little man says, "F**k off, Bush! I''m in a meeting," and keeps walking.
What might''ve happened:</p>\n<p>Saddam Hussein and Bill Clinton meet up in Baghdad for the first round of talks in a new peace process. When Bill sits down, he notices three buttons on the side of Saddam''s chair.</p>\n<p>They begin talking. After about five minutes Saddam presses the first button. A boxing glove springs out of a box on the desk and punches Clinton in the face.</p>\n<p>Confused, Clinton carries on talking as Saddam laughs.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later the second button is pressed. This time a big boot comes out and kicks Clinton in the shin. Again Saddam laughs, and again Clinton carries on talking, not wanting to put off the bigger issue of peace between the two countries.</p>\n<p>But when the third button is pressed and another boot comes out and kicks Clinton in the privates, he''s finally had enough, knowing that he can''t do much without them functioning well. "I''m going back home!" he tells the Iraqi. "We''ll finish these talks in two weeks!"</p>\n<p>A fortnight passes and Saddam flies to the United States for talks. As the two men sit down, Hussein notices three buttons on Clinton''s chair and prepares himself for the Yank''s revenge.</p>\n<p>They begin talking and Bill presses the first button. Saddam ducks, but nothing happens. Clinton snickers. A few seconds later he presses the second button. Saddam jumps up, but again nothing happens. Clinton roars with laughter. When the third button is pressed, Saddam jumps up again, and again nothing happens. Clinton falls on the floor in a fit of hysterics.</p>\n<p>"Forget this," says Saddam. "I''m going back to Baghdad!"</p>\n<p>Clinton says through tears of laughter, "What Baghdad?"
George Bush is so dumb he thinks the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a bunch of<br /> Indians who roll extra fat dhobis.

A farmhand in Australia was out checking farm fences in his Landcruiser when he hit something. He radioed the farm for advice.</p>\n<p>"There''s a pig stuck in the bullbar and is still alive but he''s kicking and squealing so much I can''t get him free" he said.</p>\n<p>"Okay," said the boss. "In the back of the ''cruiser there''s a pistol.  Put it up to the pig''s head and shoot it. When its body goes all limp you''ll be able to get it off the bullbar and throw it into the bush."</p>\n<p>About 45 minutes later the farmhand called in again, "I did what you said, boss. I shot the pig in the head, he went all limp and I got him out of the bullbar, no problem. But I still can''t go on."</p>\n<p>"Why not?" Asked the boss. "What''s the problem?"</p>\n<p>"Well it''s his motorbike ... the flashing blue light is jammed under the wheel-arch."</p>\n<p>Submitted by Calamjo<br /> Edited by Curtis

"Our largest condom factory has exploded," the Russian President cried. "My<br /> people''s favorite form of birth control.

There are these two statues in a park; one of a nude man and one of a nude woman. They had been facing each other across a pathway for a hundred years, when one day an angel comes down from the sky and, with a single gesture, brings the two to life.</p>\n<p>The angel tells them, "As a reward for being so patient through a hundred blazing summers and dismal winters, you have been given life for thirty minutes to do what you''ve wished to do the most."</p>\n<p>He looks at her, she looks at him, and they go running behind the shrubbery. The angel waits patiently as the bushes rustle and giggling ensues. After fifteen minutes, the two return, out of breath and laughing.</p>\n<p>The angel tells them, "Um, you have fifteen minutes left. Would you care to do it again?" He asks her, "Shall we?" She eagerly replies, "Oh, yes, let''s! But let''s change positions. This time I hold the pigeon down and you crap on its head!"

Adam was roaming around the Garden of Eden making up names<br /> for all the animals that were there.  He also noticed that<br /> there were two kinds of each species - male and female.<br /> And he also noticed that most of the animals were mating<br /> and seemed to be enjoying this very act.  So, he went to<br /> his special place and called out in a loud voice, "Hey, God!".<br /> And a loud booming voice replied, "Yes, Adam". </p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Adam:</dt>\n<dd>"Hey, God - There''s an awful lot of animals down here." </dd>\n<dt>God: </dt>\n<dd>"Yes, Adam - I have created many species and I trust<br />       you have not run out of names for then." </dd>\n<dt>Adam:</dt>\n<dd> "No, that''s not the problem.  But, I have noticed<br />       that there are two kinds of each species." </dd>\n<dt>God: </dt>\n<dd> "Yes, Adam.  One kind is male and the other is female." </dd>\n<dt>Adam: </dt>\n<dd>"Hey, God - why is there a male and a female of each<br />        species ?" </dd>\n<dt>God: </dt>\n<dd> "So they can mate and procreate.  This will ensure<br />        the continuation of the species." </dd>\n<dt>Adam:</dt>\n<dd> "Hey, God." </dd>\n<dt>God: </dt>\n<dd> (sigh) "Yes, Adam." </dd>\n<dt>Adam: </dt>\n<dd>"Which am I?" </dd>\n<dt>God:  </dt>\n<dd>"You, Adam, are a male." </dd>\n<dt>Adam: </dt>\n<dd>"Hey, God, I''ve noticed that most of the animals are<br />        mating --- and they seem to be really enjoying<br />        themselves.  If it isn''t too much trouble, do you<br />        think...maybe,....I could..." </dd>\n<dt>God: </dt>\n<dd> "All right, Adam.  The time has come for me to<br />        provide you with a mate.  Go lie down and when you<br />        have fallen asleep, I will create your mate." </dd>\n</dl>\n<p> So, Adam leaves his special place, finds a patch of soft<br /> grass under a tree, lies down, and falls asleep.   Some<br /> time later he awakes (possibly due to a slight pain in his<br /> side) and heads immediately to his special place.<br /> \n<dl>\n<dt>Adam: </dt>\n<dd>"Hey, God." </dd>\n<dt>God: </dt>\n<dd> "Yes, Adam." </dd>\n<dt>Adam:</dt>\n<dd> "Hey, God - did you remember to do what you promised ?" </dd>\n<dt>God: </dt>\n<dd> "Yes, Adam.  While you were sleeping I created for<br />        you a mate.  Her name is Eve.  You will find her in<br />        the bushes near the place where you were sleeping." </dd>\n</dl>\n<p> Adam rushes off to find Eve in the bushes.  A few minutes<br /> later he is back at his special place, calling ...<br /> \n<dl>\n<dt>Adam: </dt>\n<dd> "Hey, God." </dd>\n<dt>God:  </dt>\n<dd> "Yes, Adam."\n

Merlin agreed and summoned them all to<br /> his palace,  where he announced he would meet with them one at a<br /> time.</p>\n<p>Sleeping Beauty went in first and not a minute later came out<br /> beaming. "I am the most beautiful person in the world, Merlin said<br /> so."</p>\n<p>In went Tom Thumb and out he came as quickly as had Sleeping Beauty.<br /> "I am the smallest person in the world.  Merlin agrees."</p>\n<p>In goes Don Juan and in he stays, a half hour, an hour, an hour and a<br /> half later. Finally, he emerges distraught, muttering, "Who the hell<br /> is Bill Clinton"

It was the first day of school and a new student, the son of a Japanese<br /> businessman, Toshiba, entered the fourth grade.<br /> The teacher greeted the class and said, "Let''s begin by reviewing some<br /> American history." Who said "Give me Liberty, or give me death?"<br /> She saw only a sea of blank faces, except for that of Toshiba, who had his<br /> hand up. "Patrick Henry, 1775," said the boy.<br /> "Now," said the teacher, "who said ''Government of the people, by the people,<br /> for the people shall not perish from the earth?"<br /> Again, no response except from Toshiba: "Abraham Lincoln, 1863."<br /> The teacher snapped at the class, "You should be ashamed. Toshiba, who is new<br /> to our country, knows more about it than you do."<br /> As she turned to write something on the blackboard, she heard a loud whisper:<br /> "Damned Japanese."<br /> "Who said that?" she demanded.<br /> Toshiba put his hand up. "Lee Iacocca, 1982," he said.<br /> At that point, feeling completely disgusted by Toshiba''s classroom<br /> superiority, a student in the back sighed, "I''m gonna throw up."<br /> Teacher says "Who said that?".<br /> Again, Toshiba raises his hand and says "George Bush to Japanese Prime<br /> Minister, 1991."<br /> Now furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah? Well, suck my...."<br /> Once again, it''s Toshiba with the answer, "Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky,<br /> 1997."

President Bush call in the head of the CIA and ask, "How come the Jews know<br /> everything before we do?</p>\n<p>The CIA chief says, "It''s simple. The Jews have an expression, ''Nu, Vus Tutus''<br /> (English translation: What''s Happening). They just ask each other and that''s how<br /> they find out everything."</p>\n<p>Impressed, George W. Bush says he personally wants to go undercover to see how<br /> this system works.</p>\n<p>So the president gets disguised (the hat, beard, long sideburns etc.) as an<br /> Orthodox Jew, and is secretly flown in an unmarked plane to New York where he is<br /> secretly picked up in an unmarked car and secretly dropped off in Crown Heights,<br /> one of Brooklyn''s most Jewish neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>As the president stands quietly on a busy street corner, a little old Jewish<br /> man comes shuffling along. Bush approaches him and whispers "Nu, Vus Tutus?"</p>\n<p>The old guy whispers back, "Did you hear that puts Bush is in Brooklyn?"
Saddam Hussein and Bill Clinton meet up in Baghdad for talks on<br /> sanctions. When Bill sits down he notices Saddam''s chair has<br /> three buttons on the armrest. They begin talking but after 5<br /> minutes Saddam presses a button and a boxing glove pops out of<br /> Clinton''s chair and bashes him on his face.</p>\n<p>Clinton, barely believing it, carries on talking, but after<br /> another few minutes Saddam presses a second button and out comes<br /> a large boot and kicks him in the groin. Clinton is pissed off<br /> but still remains outwardly calm.</p>\n<p>They resume the talks, but after 5 minutes Saddam presses the<br /> final button and from under the table another boxing glove hits<br /> Clinton, right in the groin. Clinton is really fed up by it now<br /> and stands up to leave.</p>\n<p>"We''ll continue this talk next week in the White House" says the<br /> President. Saddam, choking from laughing, is too proud to say<br /> no, so the appointment stands. A week later Clinton receives<br /> Saddam in the Oval Office, and as Saddam sits down, he sees<br /> three buttons in the arm-rest of Clinton''s chair. As the meeting<br /> goes on, Saddam sees Clinton press the first button, and ducks<br /> really fast, but nothing seems to happen.</p>\n<p>This doesn''t stop Clinton from laughing...really loudly. After<br /> this, Clinton continues where he left off, until he presses<br /> another button. Saddam reacts really quickly, and jumps up.<br /> Absolutely nothing happens, and this time Clinton falls out of<br /> his chair laughing. Saddam doesn''t get it--what the hell is<br /> happening here? But he hasn''t been harmed yet, so he sits down<br /> again to talk further.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes Clinton presses the final button. This time,<br /> Saddam stays sitting, but Clinton isn''t, he''s rolling on the<br /> floor, doubled up from laughing. Saddam is really annoyed by<br /> now, so he stands up from his chair and shouts: "I''ve had enough<br /> of this, I''m going back to Baghdad" (Through tears of laughter<br /> from the floor): "Baghdad?...What fucking Baghdad?"

10&gt; As we aimed all those surgical strikes</p>\n<p>    At the target of all our dislikes,</p>\n<p>       We grew slowly aware</p>\n<p>       That Saddam''s facial hair</p>\n<p>    Was the lamest since, well, the Third Reich''s.</p>\n<p> 9&gt; Saddam once had sensitive skin</p>\n<p>    And no hair on his chinny-chin-chin.</p>\n<p>       But his lip was pubescent,</p>\n<p>       A real fertile crescent,</p>\n<p>    Where follicles quickly grew in.</p>\n<p> 8&gt; The dictator ruling Iraq</p>\n<p>    Grew a mustache all shaggy and black.</p>\n<p>       A little while later</p>\n<p>       He lay in a crater,</p>\n<p>    As vultures approached for a snack.</p>\n<p> 7&gt; "Dad''s mustache exceeds any other!"</p>\n<p>    Cried young Uday to Qusay, his brother,</p>\n<p>       "It will always be there</p>\n<p>       Because thick facial hair</p>\n<p>    Is the one trait he shared with his mother."</p>\n<p> 6&gt; In order to set an example,</p>\n<p>    Hussein was the right guy to trample.</p>\n<p>       Now his bushy mustache</p>\n<p>       And a bit of eyelash</p>\n<p>    Are what''s left for his DNA sample.</p>\n<p> 5&gt; Next to Hitler''s, it''s not trimmed as well.</p>\n<p>    More like Stalin''s, as best I can tell.</p>\n<p>       Lenin, too, might dispute</p>\n<p>       Saddam''s ''stache was a beaut.</p>\n<p>    They can argue about it in hell.</p>\n<p> 4&gt; Saddam cut a figure quite charming --</p>\n<p>    Stalin-like, but perhaps less alarming.</p>\n<p>       His lip was hirsute,</p>\n<p>       Which he thought made him cute.</p>\n<p>    It''s too bad that he wasn''t disarming.</p>\n<p> 3&gt; Samson''s strength was dependent on hair.</p>\n<p>    Can Saddam Hussein''s mustache compare?</p>\n<p>       We could tell our troops: "Wait!</p>\n<p>       Spend a buck ninety-eight --</p>\n<p>    You can rub out the bastard with Nair!"</p>\n<p>2&gt; While Saddam grew his ''stache with no trouble,</p>\n<p>    Not so lucky was Chuckie, his double.</p>\n<p>       Though Hussein in his wrath</p>\n<p>       Threw Rogaine in the Baath,</p>\n<p>    He could still hardly sprout more than stubble.</p>\n<p>1&gt; Saddam, now most likely "the late,"</p>\n<p>    Suffered one final, humbling fate:</p>\n<p>       His mustache ditched his lip</p>\n<p>       Like a rat from a ship,</p>\n<p>    And was seen crawling south t''wards Kuwait.</p>\n<p>             [  The Top 5 List   www.topfive.com  ]</p>\n<p>             [   Copyright 2003 by Chris White    ]

One cold, but sunny winter morning, Bill Clinton is out jogging in the park. He is running past a big pile of snow, when he notices something strange. In the snow, "Bill Clinton is an idiot" is written in urine.Furious, he hurries back to the oval room and contacts his Chief of Secret Police, asking him to solve the mystery. A few days later, Bill''s Chief of Secret Police returns. He tells Bill that their scientists have concluded their testing on the matter, and that there is good and bad news. "Well, give me the good news first," Bill says. "The good news is, that it was Al Gore''s urine." "That''s the GOOD news?" the President shouts. "What''s the bad news then?""It was Hillary''s handwriting," the chief says.

A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax - OH NO !Silence.Then, the captain came back on the intercom and said,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you earlier, but while I was talking, the flight-attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. You should see the front of my pants!"A passenger in Coach said, "That''s nothing. You should see the back of mine!"

What''s going to happen?"</p>\n<p>Bush says, "Well, we''re going to kill 140 million Iraqis this time and one bicycle repairman."</p>\n<p>The guy exclaimed, "A bicycle repairman!!! Why kill a bicycle repairman?"</p>\n<p>Bush turns to Powell, punches him on the shoulder and says,  "See, dummy! I told you no one would worry about the 140 million Iraqis!"
Bush is my shepherd, I shall be in want. He leadeth me beside the still factories, He maketh me to lie down on park benches, He restoreth my doubts about the Republican party, He guideth me onto the paths of unemployment for the party''s sake. I do fear the evildoers, for thou talkst about them constantly. Thy tax cuts for the rich and thy deficit spending They do discomfort me. Thou anointeth me with never-ending debt, And my savings and assets shall soon be gone. Surely poverty and hard living shall follow me, And my jobless children shall dwell in my basement forever.
Why did the chicken cross the road? Pat Buchanan:    To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American. Louis Farrakhan:    The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken    crossed the ''''black man'''' in order to trample him and keep him down. The Bible:    And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken,    ''''Thou shalt cross the road.'''' And the chicken crossed the road, and  there  was much rejoicing. Colonel Sanders:    I missed one? L.A. Police Department:    Give us five minutes with the chicken and we''ll find out. Richard M. Nixon:    The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did not    cross the road. I don''t know any chickens. I have never known any    chickens. Dr. Seuss:    Did the chicken cross the road?    Did he cross it with a toad?    Yes! The chicken crossed the road,    but why it crossed, I''ve not been told! Ernest Hemingway:    To die. In the rain. Martin Luther King, Jr.:    I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads    without having their motives called into question. Grandpa:    In my day, we didn''t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone    told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough  for  us. Aristotle:    It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. Karl Marx:     It was an historical inevitability. Saddam Hussein    This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified    in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.                       Ronald Reagan:    What chicken? Captain James T. Kirk:    To boldly go where no chicken has gone before. Fox Mulder:    You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more    chickens have to cross before you believe it? Machiavelli:    The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The    end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was. Freud:    The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the    road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. Bill Gates:    I have just released Chicken Coop 98, which will not only cross    roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance  your cheque book, and Explorer is an inextricable part of the operating  system. Einstein:    Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath    the chicken? Bill Clinton:    I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. However, I did ask    Vernon Jordan to find the chicken a job in New York.

After a few days on the new Earth, the Lord called to Adam and said, ''''It is time for you and Eve to begin the process of populating the earth, so I want you to kiss her.'''' Adam answered, ''''Yes, Lord, but what is a ''kiss''?'''' The Lord gave a brief description to Adam, who took Eve by the hand and took her to a nearby bush. A few minutes later, Adam emerged and said, ''''Thank you Lord, that was enjoyable.'''' And the Lord replied, ''''Yes Adam, I thought you might enjoy that. Now, I''d like you to caress Eve.'''' And Adam said, ''''What is a ''caress''?'''' So, the Lord again gave Adam a brief description and Adam went behind the bush with Eve. Quite a few minutes later, Adam returned, smiling, and said, ''''Lord, that was even better than the kiss.'''' And the Lord said, ''''You''ve done well Adam. And now, I want you to make love to Eve.'''' And Adam asked, ''''What is ''make love'', Lord?'''' So, the Lord again gave Adam directions and Adam went again to Eve behind the bush, but this time he re-appeared in two seconds. And Adam said, ''''Lord, what is a ''headache''?''''

A blonde buys two horses and she can''t tell them apart. So she asks the farmer next door what to do. He says to cut one of their tails off. So she does. But then the other horse''s tail gets caught in a bush and rips off. So she can''t tell them apart again. She asks the farmer for advice a second time. He tells her to cut one of the horses ears. So she does. But then the other horse gets its ear ripped in a barbed wire fence. She is still confused. She asks the farmer what to do. He tells her to measure them. She comes back and says, "The white horse is 2 inches taller than the black horse!"
So Why Did the Chicken Cross the Road? </p>\n<p>GEORGE W BUSH </p>\n<p>We don''t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. Our side of the road is the right side of the road and the chicken is either against us or for us. There is no middle ground for any chicken. </p>\n<p>COLIN POWELL </p>\n<p>Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road. </p>\n<p>DONALD RUMSFELD </p>\n<p>I have known about the chicken crossing the road for several months. I was investigating why the chicken moved but didn''t feel it was necessary to alert anyone. </p>\n<p>HANS BLIX </p>\n<p>We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road. </p>\n<p>JOHN KERRY </p>\n<p>Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road I am now against it! </p>\n<p>RALPH NADER </p>\n<p>The chicken''s habitat on the other side of the road had been polluted by unchecked industrial greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV. </p>\n<p>PAT BUCHANAN </p>\n<p>To steal the job of a decent, hard-working American. </p>\n<p>RUSH LIMBAUGH </p>\n<p>I don''t know why the chicken crossed the road, but I''ll bet it was getting a government grant to cross the road, and I''ll bet that somebody out there is already forming a support group to help chickens with crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars. And when I say tax dollars, I''m talking about your money, money the government took from you to build road for chickens to cross. </p>\n<p>MARTHA STEWART </p>\n<p>No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer''s Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any inside information. </p>\n<p>DR SEUSS </p>\n<p>Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I''ve not been told. </p>\n<p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY </p>\n<p>To die in the rain. Alone. </p>\n<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR </p>\n<p>I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question. </p>\n<p>GRANDPA </p>\n<p>In my day, we didn''t ask why the chicken crossed the road.

You know he didn''t get there by<br /> himself, he doesn''t belong there, he can''t get anything done while he''s up<br /> there, and you just want to help the poor thing down. That''s a post turtle."
This morning, National Public Radio reported that Monica Lewinsky had been in<br /> an accident with her Sport Utility Vehicle. Immediately, four things came to my<br /> mind: </p>\n<p>1. She must have blown a rod.<br /> 2. Obviously, her driving sucks too.<br /> 3. It''s not the first time she flipped over something with a spare tire.<br /> 4. I wonder how badly THIS accident stained her dress?

Here is a moral question for you. This is an imaginary situation, but it may<br /> be interesting deciding what you would do.<br /> The situation: You are in the Midwest, and there is a huge flood in progress.<br /> Many homes have been lost, water supplies compromised, and infrastructure<br /> destroyed. Let''s say you''re a photographer out getting still photos for a news<br /> service, traveling alone, looking for particularly poignant scenes. If you were<br /> to stumble across Bill Clinton struggling to keep from being swept away in a<br /> raging river and you had a choice of rescuing him or getting a Pulitzer<br /> prize-winning photograph of the death of a President, what shutter speed would<br /> you use?

They scout the whole island but can''t find him.Just as they are returning to camp, the Jap jumps out from behind a tree and shouts, ''Surplize, surplize.''

Rose Bushel, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered that her<br /> presidential husband''s great-great uncle, Gunther Bushel, a fellow lacking<br /> in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Texas in<br /> 1889. The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing on the<br /> gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:</p>\n<p>"Gunther Bushel; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885, escaped 1887,<br /> robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times.  Caught by Pinkerton Detectives,<br /> convicted and hanged in 1889."</p>\n<p>After letting her husband and his political staff of professional image<br /> consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther''s picture,<br /> scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with image processing<br /> software so that all that''s seen is a head shot.</p>\n<p>The following accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the Associated<br /> Press:</p>\n<p>"Gunther Bushel was a famous rancher in early Texas history. His business<br /> empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and<br /> intimate dealings with the Texas railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted<br /> several years of his life to service at a government facility, finally<br /> taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad.  In 1887,  he was a<br /> key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective<br /> Agency.  In 1889, Gunther passed away during an important  civic function<br /> held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed."

None of the pieces fit together and I can''t find any edges."</p>\n<p>"What''s it a picture of?" asks Cheney.</p>\n<p>"A big rooster," replies Bush.</p>\n<p>"All right," sighs Cheney, "I''ll come over and have a look."</p>\n<p>So he leaves his office and heads over to the Oval Office. Bush points at the<br /> jigsaw on his desk.</p>\n<p>Cheney looks at the desk and then turns to Bush and says, "For crying out<br /> loud, George - put the corn flakes back in the box."

Osama bin Laden has a heart attack and dies. </p>\n<p>He immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him. </p>\n<p>"I don''t know what to do here," the devil says. "You''re on my list, but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to stay here, so I''ll tell you what I''m going to do...</p>\n<p>I''ve got a couple of people here who weren''t quite as bad as you. I''ll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I''ll even let YOU decide who leaves."</p>\n<p>Osama thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil led him into the first room.</p>\n<p>In it was Manuel Noriega and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty-handed. Over and over and over. Such was his fate in hell.</p>\n<p>"No," bin Laden said, "I don''t think so. I''m not a good swimmer and I don''t think I could do that all day long."</p>\n<p>So the devil led him to the next room. In it was the Ayatollah Khomeini with a sledgehammer and a huge pile of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.</p>\n<p>"No, I''ve got this problem with my shoulder. I''d be in constant agony if all I did was break rocks all day," bin Laden commented.</p>\n<p>So the devil opened a third door. In it, bin Laden saw Bill Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was his girl Monica, doing what she does best. Osama bin Laden stared in disbelief and finally said, "Yeah, I can handle this."</p>\n<p>The devil smiled and said, "OK, Monica, you''re free to go."

Now that one plan offered by Bush to Saddam is exile, the question is Where? Roy Rivenburg of the L.A. Times (with a little help from the newspaper The Oregonian''s column The Edge) have come up with some ideas:</p>\n<p>Fox TV: Writes Rivenburg: "On the heels of ''Joe Millionaire,'' Fox could produce a new series called ''Joe Dictator,'' in which 20 beautiful women compete to become Saddam''s mistress.

Saddam Hussein and Bill Clinton meet up in Baghdad for the first round of talks in a new peace process. When Bill sits down, he notices three buttons on the side of Saddam''s chair.<br /> They begin talking. After about five minutes Saddam presses the first button. A boxing glove springs out of a box on the desk and punches Clinton in the face. Confused, Clinton carries on talking as Saddam laughs. </p>\n<p>A few minutes later the second button is pressed. This time a big boot comes out and kicks Clinton in the shin. Again Saddam laughs, and again Clinton carries on talking, not wanting to put off the bigger issue of peace between the two countries. </p>\n<p>But when the third button is pressed and another boot comes out and kicks Clinton in the privates, he''s finally had enough, knowing that he can''t do much without them functioning well. </p>\n<p>"I''m going back home!" he tells the Iraqi. "We''ll finish these talks in two weeks!" </p>\n<p>A fortnight passes and Saddam flies to the United States for talks. As the two men sit down, Hussein notices three buttons on Clinton''s chair and prepares himself for the Yank''s revenge. </p>\n<p>They begin talking and Bill presses the first button. Saddam ducks, but nothing happens. Clinton snickers. A few seconds later he presses the second button. Saddam jumps up, but again nothing happens. Clinton roars with laughter. When the third button is pressed, Saddam jumps up again, and again nothing happens. Clinton falls on the floor in a fit of hysterics. </p>\n<p>"Forget this," says Saddam. "I''m going back to Baghdad!" </p>\n<p>Clinton says through tears of laughter, "What Baghdad?"

In a clearing not far from the camp, they came upon a chilling sight the mother-in-law was backed up against a thick, impenetrable bush, and a large male lion stood facing her. </p>\n<p>The wife cried, "What are we going to do?" </p>\n<p>"Nothing," said the hunter husband.

A minister, a priest and a rabbi went for a hike one very hot day. They were sweating profusely by the time they came upon a small lake with a sandy beach. Since it was a secluded spot, they left all their clothes on a big log, ran down the beach to the lake and jumped in the water for a long, refreshing swim. Refreshed, they were halfway back up the beach to the spot they''d left their clothes, when a group of ladies from town came along. Unable to get to their clothes in time, the minister and the priest covered their privates and the rabbi covered his face while they ran for cover in the bushes. After the ladies wandered on and the men got dressed again, the minister and the priest asked the rabbi why he covered his face rather than his privates. The rabbi replied, ''''I don''t know about you, but in MY congregation, it''s my face they would recognize.''''
No Beating Around The BushGee Miss., I know I haven''t know you for a very long time, and I shouldn''t be asking this so soon.  But, I really do need it very badly.

A nun is sitting with her Mother Superior chatting. "I used some<br /> horrible language this week and feel absolutely terrible about<br /> it." "When did you use this awful language?" asks the elder.<br /> "Well, I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked<br /> like it was going to go over 280 yards, but it struck a phone<br /> line that was hanging over the fairway and fell straight down to<br /> the ground after going only about 10 yards." "Is that when you<br /> swore?" "No, Mother," says the nun. "After that, a squirrel ran<br /> out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in its mouth and began to<br /> run away." "Is THAT when you swore?" asks the Mother Superior<br /> again. "Well, no." says the nun. "You see, as the squirrel was<br /> running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel<br /> in his talons and began to fly away!" "Is THAT when you swore?"<br /> asks the amazed elder nun. "No, not yet. As the eagle carried<br /> the squirrel away in its claws, it flew near the green and the<br /> squirrel dropped my ball." "Did you swear THEN?" asked Mother<br /> Superior, becoming impatient. "No, because the ball fell on a<br /> big rock, bounced over the sand trap, rolled onto the green, and<br /> stopped about six inches from the hole." The two nuns were<br /> silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed and said, "You<br /> missed the fucking putt, didn''t you?"

A Safe Bet, Bush Reassures Nation</p>\n<p>In a bold move to privatize Social Security, President George W. Bush today put all of the program''s funds under the control of former Education Secretary William Bennett, urging Mr. Bennett to "work your magic" on the nation''s nest egg. </p>\n<p>Recognizing that many retirees are nervous about the privatization of America''s retirement system, Mr. Bush reassured them today, stating flatly, "Bill Bennett is a safe bet."</p>\n<p>"I have known Bill Bennett for many years," Mr. Bush told reporters.  "This is a man who knows when to hold ''em and knows when to fold ''em."</p>\n<p>A beaming Mr. Bennett stood at Mr. Bush''s side, the former Education Secretary wearing what he later called "my lucky hat."</p>\n<p>He spoke briefly with reporters before boarding a plane for the Venetian casino in Las Vegas, where he said he would begin to implement his "can''t lose" investment plan for Social Security.</p>\n<p>But on Capitol Hill, leading Democrats howled in protest over Mr. Bennett''s appointment, arguing that the nation should not place an important program like Social Security in the hands of just one man, especially a controversial figure like Mr. Bennett.</p>\n<p>"Why don''t we just bet all our retirees'' money on the daily double while we''re at it," fumed South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson.</p>\n<p>For his part, Mr. Bennett remained tight-lipped about his plans for the nation''s retirement funds, telling reporters, "What happens in Social Security, stays in Social Security."

A guy dies and goes to heaven. It''s a slow day for St. Peter,<br /> so, upon passing the entrance test, St. Peter says, "I''m not<br /> very busy today, why don''t you let me show you around?"</p>\n<p>The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the<br /> offer.

When a clock runs out of<br /> time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged." The<br /> guy thinks this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks<br /> are going faster than others. He asks why is that?</p>\n<p>St. Peter explains, "Every time a living person tells a lie, it<br /> speeds his clock."</p>\n<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the<br /> room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the<br /> ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an<br /> unbelievable rate. So he asks, "What''s the story with that<br /> clock?"</p>\n<p>"Oh, that," St. Peter replies, "That''s Bill Clinton''s clock. We<br /> decided to use it as a fan."

One night, at the lodge of a hunting club, two new members were being introduced to other members and shown around. The man leading them around said, "See that old man asleep in the chair by the fireplace? He is our oldest member and can tell you some hunting stories you''ll never forget."They awakened the old man and asked him to tell them a story."Well, I remember back in 1944, we went on a lion hunting expedition in Africa. We were on foot and hunted for three days without seeing a thing. On the fourth day, I was so tired I had to rest my feet. I found a fallen tree, so I laid my gun down, propped my head on the tree, and fell asleep. I don''t know how long I was asleep when I was awakened by a noise in the bushes. I was reaching for my gun when the biggest damn lion I''d ever seen jumped out of the bushes at me like this: RRROOAARRR!!! ...........I tell you, I just crapped my pants."The young men looked astonished and one of them said, "I don''t blame you, I would have crapped my pants too if a lion jumped out at me."The old man shook his head and said, "No, no... not back then, just now, when I said RRROOAAARRR!!!" ______________________

Tigers really are as big and poofy and soft as they look, and they purr like a<br /> freight train going by. You find this out by taking one for a walk. To take a<br /> tiger for a walk, you first need a tiger. Tigers fresh from the bush are not<br /> recommended for the inexperienced. What you need is one who''s used to the<br /> procedure. He or she is thus liable to be merely playful, rather than actively<br /> irritated. You also need a friend, whom you really, really trust. The friend<br /> carries an apple wood cane; apple, or some other wood, which will bend under<br /> stress rather than shattering. This, friend, is your backup, and the cane is his<br /> or her only tool for everything, from knocking stuff out of the way that the<br /> tiger is liable to eat, to crowd control, to hooking on and madly hanging on if<br /> things go wrong.</p>\n<p>What YOU carry is a ten-foot length of pass-link chain. This is your leash.</p>\n<p>Pass-link chain is the stuff where the links will fit through each other. This<br /> is important. You need this so you can hook on a safety clip. The chain is<br /> looped about the tiger''s neck and acks as a giant choke chain, but the clip is<br /> there to keep a loop of some sort in case things go badly wrong. You carry the<br /> chain looped in one hand in a peculiar fashion, which permits the whole length<br /> of chain to be dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with<br /> it. You practice this beforehand till you''re sure you''ve got it right.</p>\n<p>Then you go into the cage with the tiger. Your friend does not. You gauge the<br /> tiger''s mood and put the leash on the tiger. There isn''t a whole lot more to say<br /> about this step except to say that that is why your friend is there, outside the<br /> cage. On your side is the fact that the tiger knows what the leash is for by<br /> this time and presumably is largely in favor of the idea.</p>\n<p>This is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy. They are also much,<br /> much larger than you had ever dreamed, when you''re standing next to one.</p>\n<p>Then you take the tiger for a walk. Your friend walks in front with the cane<br /> to clear the way. You walk with the tiger at your side, keeping pretty good<br /> control and letting the tiger know that you are Paying Attention, because if the<br /> tiger thinks you are not Paying Attention, it will do what housecats do, let you<br /> know that you should be Paying Attention. Unlike housecats, the tiger is big<br /> enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the situation.<br /> Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your legs out from under you<br /> is generally considered good enough by most tigers. They think this is<br /> hilarious. To this extent, tigers differ from housecats in that they seem to<br /> have a sense of humor.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants. In this case,<br /> the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to stop it. Wrapping the<br /> chain around something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away, generally<br /> does this. This will slow it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you<br /> and grab the chain as you go bulleting across the countryside. The weight of two<br /> adult humans will generally slow a tiger down enough to make things manageable,<br /> whereas one will not.</p>\n<p>It is not usual for the tiger to react to freedom by turning around and<br /> turning you into fajitas, though this would actually (at least in the short<br /> term) be an eminently practical thing for the tiger to do. They enjoy their fun<br /> but are generally not ill tempered. If they are they don''t get taken for walks.</p>\n<p>They also purr like a freight train passing. Experts in the field claim that<br /> this is not purring, that it means something else, but you couldn''t put it by<br /> me. Sure sounded like purring, at 16-2/3 RPM, but it sounded like purring.</p>\n<p>All in all, an experience I highly recommend as a lifetime source of cocktail<br /> party conversation, but it sort of tends to leave you limp for the rest of the<br /> day.
Looking for savings this holiday season? When you''re out shopping, take<br /> advantage of the George W. Bush discount. You will need unmitigated gall and<br /> several accomplices. Here''s how it works. </p>\n<p>Load up with all sorts of items that you want and take them to the checkout.<br /> When the clerk gets to an item that will not scan on the first attempt say,<br /> petulantly, "My brother says that all these items are mine." The clerk will<br /> insist on rescanning the item. Look bored and incredulous that anybody could be<br /> so incompetent as the clerk tries unsuccessfully to scan the item. Turn to the<br /> people in line behind you and say, "Can you believe this is taking so long?" </p>\n<p>At this point, the clerk will attempt to enter the bar code information by<br /> hand. Insist loudly that the item is yours and that since it didn''t scan after<br /> two attempts, it must be free. Get so worked up that your face starts to break<br /> out. The clerk will still attempt to enter the bar code. At this point, bring<br /> forward your first accomplice who will introduce herself as the Secretary of Bar<br /> Code Scanning and say to the clerk, "I''ll give you two seconds to enter that bar<br /> code. Ready... Set... Times up!" </p>\n<p>The clerk will probably call for the manager, and the two of them will insist<br /> on manually entering the bar code into the cash register. Have dozens of your<br /> accomplices run to the media talking about possible mistakes and mischief that<br /> could arise from manually entering the bar code. Raise questions such as, "How<br /> can I make sure the price is being entered fairly when the clerk works for the<br /> owner?" Say, "These items have been scanned and rescanned. They just want to<br /> keep entering bar codes until they get the total they want." </p>\n<p>At this point, the owner might try to take you to court to get some more time<br /> to manually enter the bar code. He''s really playing right into your hands. </p>\n<p>While he''s getting a time extension from the court, call the office of<br /> Congressman Tom DELAY and ask him to send down a couple of henchmen to lead a<br /> crowd of angry demonstrators into the store to shout and bang on the doors. </p>\n<p>Simultaneously, file an appeal with the Supreme Court asking the highest court<br /> in the land to bring a halt to all manual entry of bar codes. </p>\n<p>In the midst of this confusion, have your first accomplice declare that all<br /> the items are legally yours and that if the owner doesn''t like it, he can take<br /> you to court. The owner will now have to drive to the state capital to file a<br /> lawsuit in which he will ask the judge to manually enter the bar code of the<br /> item that would not scan. Invite some celebrities over for a photo op and<br /> announce that you''ll share the items with them once the items are found to be<br /> rightfully yours. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile in court, the owner will ask the judge to transfer the item from the<br /> checkout line to the courtroom. Have your lawyer tell the judge that that is<br /> simply not enough, that the judge needs to move the entire inventory from the<br /> store lock, stock and barrel to his courtroom. </p>\n<p>When the owner contemplates that this will tie up all his merchandise till<br /> well after the holidays, he will surely give up. But just to be safe, have the<br /> legislature pass a law giving the entire store to you. </p>\n<p>Some people will tell you that you won''t enjoy the goodies you''ve thus<br /> obtained because they are not really yours.

LONDON (AP) -- Saucy? The British? Yes, and keeping well abreast of the latest science, judging by a new exhibition of -- er -- underwear at London''s Design Museum. Here, the nation famed for its reserve has raised its hem, offering a peep at sheepskin corsets, barely-there cashmere vests and a glow-in-the-dark bra.Should all the titillation prove too much, there''s also a bra that detects a racing heartbeat and a pair of panties that protects against radiation. ``This exhibit is a compelling statement about British design -- but it''s also quite saucy,'''' said Dame Helena Kennedy, a leading lawyer and chairwoman of the British Council, which launched the show Wednesday.``The perception of British people as being strait-laced is no longer real,'''' Kennedy said. To prove it, the displays are almost as provocative as the garments. Vivienne Westwood''s blue sheepskin corset and ditzy, star-patterned mini-crinoline and Alexander McQueen''s pink satin corset crusted with black Swarovski crystal are suspended inside giant inflatable women''s legs in transparent plastic. Vacuum-packed thongs and Clements Ribeiro''s red silk chiffon panties with polka dots hang from pegs on a washline. Near the entrance, a mannequin sprawls seductively on her back, a vision in pink fishnet stockings and the briefest green teddy and panties by the aptly named Agent Provocateur.And everywhere there are bras to make even 1950s ``sweater girl'''' Lana Turner envious -- from Gossard''s new padded Ultrabra Super Boost in patriotic red-white-and-blue, to Stella McCartney''s tassels and gray beads, to Agent Provocateur''s sliced-away style in sheer black net.For the traditionally minded, there are the more substantial constructions of Rigby and Peller (they put the foundation in foundation garments), suppliers of spine-stiffening unmentionables to the royal family since the 1960s. Owner June Kenton, personal bra fitter to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Mother Elizabeth, believes 80 percent of all women are wearing the wrong size bra ``and have two drawers-full of bras that they don''t wear.''''Rigby and Peller''s offerings contrast with the futuristic Techno Bra, made of conductive textile with silicon gel inserts that contain electronic devices to detect heartbeat changes. A British industrial design company is developing the piece for the commercial market and designer Kirsty Falconer hopes it may one day incorporate a personal alarm that will sound if the wearer is attacked. Constructed in a dun-colored conductive nylon and silver fabric, the anti-radiation panties are no thing of beauty. But if, as their makers claim, they drain electricity from the body -- thereby protecting it from magnetic radiation -- can you afford to be without them? The exhibition runs through July 2, then tours Japan and Australia.

First Lady Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno . . .<br /> . . . were having one of those girl to girl talks. Hillary says to Janet,<br /> You''re lucky that you don''t have to put up with men having sex with you.

"Just because I am considered ugly, doesn''t mean I don''t have<br /> to fight off unwelcome sexual advances."<br /> Hillary asks, "Well how do you deal with the problem?"<br /> Janet: "Whenever I feel that a guy is getting ready to make a pass at me, I<br /> muster all my might and squeeze out the loudest, nastiest, fart I can."<br /> Well, that night, Bill was already in bed with the lights out when Hillary<br /> headed for bed. She could hear him start to stir, and knew that he would be<br /> wanting some action. She had been saving her farts all day, and was ready for<br /> him. She tenses up her butt cheeks and forces out the most disgusting sounding<br /> fart you could imagine.<br /> Bill rolls over and says, "Is that you Janet?"

Kjell Magne Bondevik goes to Washington for a meeting with Bill Clinton.<br /> After dinner, Bill says to Kjell " Well Kjell, I don''t know what you think of the members of your Cabinet, but mine are all bright and brilliant."<br /> "How do you know?" asks Kjell Magne.<br /> "Oh well, it''s simple", says Bill. "They all have to take special tests before they can be a minister. Wait a second". He calls Madeleine Albright over and says to her "Tell me Madeleine, who is the child of your father and of your mother who is not your brother and is not your sister?"<br /> Ah, that''s simple Mr. President", says Madeleine, "it is me!"<br /> "Well done Madeleine," says Clinton and Kjell Magne Bondevik is very impressed.</p>\n<p>Kjell Magne Bondevik returns to Oslo and wonders about the intelligence of the members of his Cabinet. He calls in Lars Sponheim and says: "Lars, tell me, who is the child of your father and of your mother who is not your brother and is not your sister?"<br /> Lars thinks and thinks and doesn''t know the answer. "Can I think about it a bit further Kjell ? May I let you know tomorrow?"<br /> "Of course," says Bondevik, "you''ve got 24 hours."<br /> Lars Sponheim goes away, thinks as hard as he can, calls in his team, but no-one knows the answer. 20 hours later, Lars is very worried - still no answer and only 4 hours to go. Eventually Lars Sponheim says "I''ll ask Gudmund Restad, he''s clever, he''ll know the answer." He calls Restad.<br /> "Gudmund," he says, "tell me who is the child of your father and of your mother who is not your brother and is not your sister?"<br /> "Very simple", says Gudmund, "it''s me!"<br /> "Of course" says Lars and calls Kjell Magne Bondevik.<br /> "Kjell Magne", says Lars, "I''ve got the answer: it''s Gudmund Restad".<br /> "No you idiot", says Bondevik, "it''s Madeleine Albright".

A Press Release -</p>\n<p>WASHINGTON D.C. The House Appropriations subcommittee on NASA oversight, in another effort to reduce the NASA budget, passed a resolution today to downsize the solar system. According to an unnamed congressional staffer, House Republicans felt there has been "too much redundancy in the solar system" and that streamlining the 4.5 billion year old planetary system is long overdue. Such action would give NASA fewer places to go and this would allow the agency to carry out its space exploration goals within the funding profile that the House proposed earlier this summer.</p>\n<p>"Look, we have three terrestrial planets" said Congressman Rip U. Apart (R, Del.), "and only one of them really works! So why not get rid of the other two and clean up the neighborhood?" Most subcommittee members felt that while downsizing was definitely in the cards, eliminating both Mars and Venus was going too far. "We have too many international commitments to Mars." said Rush N. Hater (R, Calif.). "So I think we should keep Mars and dump Venus. Its too hot to live on, and liberal Democrats keep using it as an example of what global warming can do. So from a political and practical point of view, Venus has got to go."</p>\n<p>Also at risk is the planet Mercury which lacks support because of its small size and poor visibility from Earth. "Who needs it?" asked Congressman Newt Onian (R, N.C.). "Have you ever seen it? I haven''t. So what good is it? We just don''t need useless planets. And speaking of useless planets, what about the asteroids? If you''ve seen one, you''ve seen them all. So I say we ought to get rid of the little boogers once and for all."</p>\n<p>However, the downsizing recommendations do not stop with the terrestrial planets. The resolution also calls for a reduction in the number of gas giants which contain most of the planetary mass in the solar system. Most subcommittee members favor retaining Jupiter and Saturn, and eliminating Uranus and Neptune. "Jupiter employs the most molecules, and Saturn has those pretty little rings everyone likes." said Rep. Con Mann (R, Fla.). "On the other hand, Uranus is a bore and its rings are dirty. And Neptune, for God''s sake, is just too far away. So begone with those ugly bruisers."</p>\n<p>But the influential Wright I.M. Fornow from South Carolina has publicly announced he will fight to eliminate Saturn. Fornow is especially miffed by NASA''s success thus far in keeping Cassini, the next mission to Saturn, alive which he feels is waste of taxpayers money. "If there ain''t no Saturn, then there ain''t no Cassini" he exclaimed. The congressman also expressed concern about sending back-to-back spacecraft bearing Italian surnames to the outer planets (The Galileo spacecraft arrives at Jupiter this December).</p>\n<p>The subcommittee was unanimous in its views towards Pluto which they deemed a moral misfit. "Now here''s a planet we can definitely do without." continued Fornow. "A few years ago, it was farthest from the sun. Now its not. Its just too confusing. And now they tell me its really two planets instead of one. What the hell is going on here?"</p>\n<p>The resolution must now be presented to the entire House, where it is expected to pass easily since only a minority of Representatives have constituents on the affected planets. NASA Administrator Golden has vowed to resist any further reductions to the solar system, saying that "NASA has expended considerable effort to make the planets cheaper, faster, and better. Much of this work would be wasted if the solar system were downsized" stated Golden.</p>\n<p>Critics say, however, that reducing the number of planets will not produce the expected savings to taxpayers. Textbooks, they note, would have to be revised to reflect the new arrangement, and facilities would need to be constructed to remove the planets themselves. The resolution is also likely to draw strong opposition from religious fundamentalists who have long opposed the elimination of any of the biblical planets. Thus, the matter is far from resolved.
Clinton died and went to heaven or to be more accurate, approached the Pearly Gates. After knocking at the gates, St. Peter appeared. </p>\n<p>"Who goes there?" inquired St. Peter. </p>\n<p>"Tis I, your lordship, President Bill Clinton." </p>\n<p>"And what do you want?" asked St. Peter. </p>\n<p>"Lemme in!" replied Clinton. </p>\n<p>"Soooo," pondered St. Peter. "What bad things did you do on earth?" </p>\n<p>Clinton thought a bit and answered, "Well, I smoked marijuana, but you shouldn''t hold that against me because I didn''t inhale. I guess I had extramarital sex, but you shouldn''t hold that against me because I didn''t really have sexual relations. And I lied, but I didn''t commit perjury." </p>\n<p>After several moments of deliberation St. Peter replied, "OK, here''s the deal. We''ll send you someplace where it is very hot, but we won''t call it ''Hell.'' You''ll be there for an indefinite period of time, but we won''t call it ''eternity.'' And don''t ''abandon all hope'' upon entering, just don''t hold your breath waiting for it to freeze over."

If I may please make a<br /> suggestion... it would be much easier for you to drag your deer in the other<br /> direction.

A little girl was in church with her mother when she started feeling ill.</p>\n<p>"Mommy," she said, "can we leave now?"</p>\n<p>"No" her mother replied.</p>\n<p>"Well, I think I have to throw up!"</p>\n<p>"Then go out the front door and around to the back of the church and throw up behind a bush."</p>\n<p>After about 60 seconds the little girl returned to her seat.</p>\n<p>"Did you throw up?" Mom asked.</p>\n<p>"Yes."</p>\n<p>"How could you have gone all the way to the back of the church and returned so quickly?"</p>\n<p>"I didn''t have to go out of the church, Mommy. They have a box next to the front door that says, ''For the Sick''."
An Israeli soap powder company is using the U.S. presidential sex scandal to sell stain-removing detergent.In a television commercial, the Lever Israel company suggests that its Biomat detergent can deal with even the most stubborn stains caused by what has euphemistically been called DNA material.It shows ''''FBI agents'''' entering the ''''home'''' of Monica Lewinsky to remove, wash and return the dress at the center of an investigation into whether President Bill Clinton had an affair with the former White House intern and told her to lie about it.For what the company called legal reasons, the spelling of Lewinsky''s name on a mailbox outside the house was Monika Lavinsky.But the two agents slip up in their apparent mission to protect the president.On leaving the house, they report by wrist radio the dress is now ''''whiter then white'''' -- only to be told by a voice in their earpieces: ''''White? But it''s a blue dress.''''The commercial, already aired on Israeli news programs, premiered on Monday to coincide with Clinton''s closed circuit television testimony to a federal grand jury.''''We believe that this kind of humor will help us reach the consumer,'''' Yair Sharett, a Lever Israel representative, told Reuters

George W.

Entertainment A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax - OH MY GOD!"</p>\n<p>Silence followed and after a few minutes, the captain came back on the intercom and said, "Ladies and Gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you earlier, but while I was talking, the flight-attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. You should see the front of my pants!"</p>\n<p>A passenger in Coach said, "That''s nothing. He should see the back of mine!"

While the Pope was in St. Louis he decided to grant absolution to three sinners. The first person to come up was Richard Nixon.</p>\n<p>The Pope asked, "What is your sin?"</p>\n<p>"I hired people to break into the Watergate hotel."</p>\n<p>The Pope replied, "Kneel down. I''ll bless you and grant you absolution." </p>\n<p>Next in line was Bill Clinton. "What was your sin, son?"</p>\n<p>"I cheated on my wife." The Philanderer in Chief replied. </p>\n<p>"Kneel down, my son. I''ll bless you and grant you absolution." </p>\n<p>A third person came up and the Pope asked, "What is your name?" </p>\n<p>"Monica Lewinsky." The Pope stroked his chin. "Hmmmm..... Perhaps you should remain standing."
As the sun rose over Parris Island, the senior drill instructor realised that one of his recruits had gone AWOL, so a search party was dispatched immediately.After a few hours, the recruit was discovered hiding in some bushes nearby. He was sent back to the base and promptly escorted to the drill instructor''s office.The instructor asked the young recruit, "Why did you go AWOL?"The recruit replied, "On my first day here, you issued me a comb and then proceeded to cut my hair off. On the second day, you issued me a toothbrush and then sent me to the dentist, who proceeded to pull out some of my teeth. Finally, on the third day, you issued me a jock strap... and I wasn''t about to wait around to find out what would follow that, Sir."

The European Union commissioners have announced that agreement has been<br /> reached to adopt English as the preferred language for European communications,<br /> rather than German, which was the other possibility.<br /> As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty''s Government conceded that English<br /> spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a five-year phased plan<br /> for what will be known as Euro-English (Euro for short). In the first year, ''s''<br /> will be used instead of the soft ''c''. Sertainly, sivil servants will resieve<br /> this news with joy. Also, the hard ''c'' will be replaced with ''k.'' Not only will<br /> this klear up konfusion, but typewriters kan have one less letter.<br /> There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the<br /> troublesome ''ph'' will be replaced by ''f''. This will make words like ''fotograf''<br /> 20 per sent shorter.<br /> In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to<br /> reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will<br /> enkourage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to<br /> akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of silent ''e''s in the<br /> languag is disgrasful, and they would go.<br /> By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing ''th'' by<br /> ''z'' and ''W'' by ''V''.

Bill Clinton steps out onto the White House lawn in the dead of winter. Right in front of him, on the White House lawn, he sees "The President Must Die" written in urine across the snow. </p>\n<p>Well, old Bill is pretty ticked off. He storms into his security staff''s HQ, and yells "Somebody wrote a death threat in the snow on the front lawn! And they wrote it in urine! The guy had to be standing right on the porch when he did it! Where were you guys?!"</p>\n<p>The security guys stay silent and stare ashamedly at the floor. Bill hollers "Well, don''t just sit there! Get out and FIND OUT WHO DID IT! I want an answer, and I want it TONIGHT!"</p>\n<p>The entire staff immediately jump up and race for the exits. Later that evening, his chief security officer approaches him and says "Well Mr. President, we have some bad news and we have some REALLY bad news. Which do you want first?"</p>\n<p>Clinton says "Give me the bad news first."</p>\n<p>The officer says "Well, we took a sample of the urine and tested it.</p>\n<p>The results just came back, and it was Al Gore''s urine."</p>\n<p>Clinton says "I feel so... so... betrayed! My own vice president!</p>\n<p>...Well, what''s the REALLY bad news?"</p>\n<p>The officer replies "Well, it''s Hillary''s handwriting."
You lose arguments with inanimate objects.  You have to hold onto the lawn to keep from falling off the earth.  Your job is interfering with your drinking.  Your doctor finds traces of blood in your alchohol stream.  Your career won''t progress beyond Senator from Massachusetts.  The back of your head keeps getting hit by the toilet seat.  You sincerely believe alchohol is the elusive 5th food group.  24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case - coincidence? I think not!  Two hands and just one mouth... - now THAT''S a drinking problem!  You can focus better with one eye closed.  The parking lot seems to have moved while you were in the bar.  You fall off the floor...  Your twin sons are named Barley and Hops.  Hey, 5 beers has just as many calories as a burger, screw dinner! Mosquitoes catch a buzz after attacking you. At AA meetings you begin: ''Hi my name is... uh...'' Your idea of cutting back is less salt. You wake up in the bedroom, your underwear is in the bathroom, you fell asleep clothed. The whole bar says ''Hi'' when you come in... You think the Four Basic Food Groups are Caffeine, Nicotine, Alchohol, and [Women or Men]. Every night you''re beginning to find your roommate''s cat more and more attractive. Roseanne looks good. Don''t recognize wife unless seen through bottom of glass. That damned pink elephant followed me home again. Senators Kennedy and Packwood shake their heads when they walk past you. I''m as sober as a judge. The shrubbery''s drunk from too frequent watering. You wake up screaming ''TORO TORO TORO!'' in the middle of the night.
Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton were sleeping one night at the White House. Hillary wakes up and starts shaking Bill to wake him up. "Bill, Bill wake up."<br /> Bill stays sleeping. Hillary continues, "Bill, Bill wake up." </p>\n<p>Bill finally wakes up and says, "What do you want?" Hillary responds, "I have to go use the bathroom." </p>\n<p>To which Bill says, "Please tell me you didn''t wake me up just to tell me you have to go to the bathroom." </p>\n<p>Hillary says, "No, I just wanted to tell you to save my spot."

The bad news is it is Bill''s urine and the worse news is it is<br /> Monica''s hand writing.

While visiting England recently, George W.

"Allow me to demonstrate."</p>\n<p>The Queen then dials 10 Downing Street and asks to speak to Tony Blair. "Mr. Prime Minister, please answer a hypothetical question for me."</p>\n<p>"I''ll do my best, Your Majesty" responds Blair.</p>\n<p>"Your mother has a child and your father has a child" says the Queen. "The child is not your brother or your sister. Who is the child?"</p>\n<p>Tony Blair hesitates momentarily and then confidently replies, "Well, Your Majesty, I guess it would have to be me."</p>\n<p>"Correct" says the Queen. "Thank you and good day to you Sir."</p>\n<p>The Queen hangs up and says "Did you hear that Mr. Bush? See how clever he is."</p>\n<p>Impressed, Bush replies "I certainly did. I''ll definitely be using that one when I conduct my next Cabinet shuffle back in the US."</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Washington, Bush decides he''d better put some of his senior Cabinet Members to the test. He summons Dick Cheney to his office and says, "Dick, I wonder if you could answer a question for me?"</p>\n<p>"Why of course Sir" Cheney responds unenthusiastically, annoyed that the President was again seeking his input on something.</p>\n<p>"Well, uh, let''s say your mother has a child and your father too has a child. This child is not your brother and also is not your sister.

Totally baffled, they decide to conduct some research and contact a loyal Washington consulting firm.

I know who the child is!!"</p>\n<p>Bush, who was privately becoming a bit concerned at the delay in hearing back from Cheney, is delighted (when he finally remembers what it was that he asked).

While visiting England recently, George W. Bush was invited to have tea with the Queen.</p>\n<p>Given his recent political problems, he decides to take advantage of her years of leadership experience and asks her for her advice. She responds that she surrounds herself with the most intelligent people she can find and lets them do their jobs.</p>\n<p>Intrigued with this novel theory, Bush asks her how she is able to tell if the people are intelligent.</p>\n<p>"I do so by asking them a test question" responds the Queen. "Allow me to demonstrate."</p>\n<p>The Queen then dials 10 Downing Street and asks to speak to Tony Blair. "Mr. Prime Minister, please answer a hypothetical question for me."</p>\n<p>"I''ll do my best, Your Majesty" responds Blair.</p>\n<p>"Your mother has a child and your father has a child" says the Queen. "The child is not your brother or your sister. Who is the child?"</p>\n<p>Tony Blair hesitates momentarily and then confidently replies, "Well, Your Majesty, I guess it would have to be me."</p>\n<p>"Correct" says the Queen. "Thank you and good day to you Sir."</p>\n<p>The Queen hangs up and says "Did you hear that Mr. Bush? See how clever he is."</p>\n<p>Impressed, Bush replies "I certainly did. I''ll definitely be using that one when I conduct my next Cabinet shuffle back in the US."</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Washington, Bush decides he''d better put some of his senior Cabinet Members to the test. He summons Dick Cheney to his office and says, "Dick, I wonder if you could answer a question for me?"</p>\n<p>"Why of course Sir" Cheney responds unenthusiastically, annoyed that the President was again seeking his input on something.</p>\n<p>"Well, uh, let''s say your mother has a child and your father too has a child. This child is not your brother and also is not your sister. Who is it?"</p>\n<p>Somewhat surprised at this odd question, Cheney hems and haws and finally asks if he can have some time to think about it.</p>\n<p>"Certainly" responds Bush.</p>\n<p>Cheney immediately calls a meeting of other senior Republicans and they puzzle over the question for several hours. Totally baffled, they decide to conduct some research and contact a loyal Washington consulting firm. A budget of $10 million is provided and intensive research is carried out over the next two weeks. Unfortunately, the consultants are unable to come up with an answer.</p>\n<p>Desperate to prove that he is smarter than George, Cheney decides to take a chance and calls Al Gore.</p>\n<p>"I realize you are just an Tennessee redneck and are not all that wise in the ways of the world, but maybe you can help me out with a problem I have.</p>\n<p>Gore is naturally skeptical about Republican promises, but in the spirit of political co-operation he agrees to do what he can to help out.</p>\n<p>"O.K., here goes" says Cheney.

It got crowded in heaven, so, for one day it was decided only to<br /> accept people who had really had a bad day on the day they died. St.<br /> Peter was standing at the pearly gates and said to the first man,<br /> "Tell me about the day you died."</p>\n<p>The man said, "Oh, it was awful. I was sure my wife was having an<br /> affair, so I came home early to catch her with him. I searched all<br /> over the apartment but couldn''t find him anywhere. So I went out onto<br /> the balcony, we live on the 25th floor, and found this man hanging<br /> over the edge by his fingertips. I went inside, got a hammer, and<br /> started hitting his hands. He fell, but landed in some bushes. So, I<br /> got the refrigerator and pushed it over the balcony and it crushed<br /> him. The strain of the act gave me a heart attack, and I died."</p>\n<p>St. Peter couldn''t deny that this was a pretty bad day, and since it<br /> was a crime of passion, he let the man in.</p>\n<p>He then asked the next man in line about the day he died. "Well, sir,<br /> it was awful," said the second man. "I was doing aerobics on the<br /> balcony of my 26th floor apartment when I twisted my ankle and<br /> slipped over the edge. I managed to grab the balcony of the apartment<br /> below, but some maniac came out and started pounding on my fingers<br /> with a hammer. Luckily I landed in some bushes. But, then the guy<br /> dropped a refrigerator on me!"</p>\n<p>St. Peter chuckled, let him into heaven and decided he could really<br /> start to enjoy this job.</p>\n<p>"Tell me about the day you died?", he said to the third man in line.</p>\n<p>"OK, picture this; I''m naked, hiding inside a refrigerator...."
A tourist walks into a curio shop in San Francisco. Looking around at the exotica, he notices a very lifelike life-sized bronze statue of a rat.  It has no price tag, but is so strikingly unique that he decides he must have it.</p>\n<p>He takes it to the owner: "How much for the bronze rat?"  "$12 for the rat, $100 for the story," says the owner.  The tourist gives the man $12. "I''ll just take the rat, you can keep the story."</p>\n<p>As he walks down the street carrying his bronze rat, he notices that a few real rats have crawled out of the alleys and sewers and begun following him down the street. This is disconcerting, and he begins walking faster. But within a couple of blocks, the herd of rats behind him has grown to hundreds, and they begin squealing.  He begins to trot toward the Bay, looking around to see that the rats now number in the MILLIONS, and are squealing and coming toward him faster and faster. Concerned, even scared, he runs to the edge of the Bay, and throws the bronze rat as far out into the water as he can.  Amazingly, the millions of rats all jump into the Bay after it, and are all drowned.  The man walks back to the curio shop.</p>\n<p>"Ah ha," says the owner, "you have come back for the story?"</p>\n<p>"No," says the man, "I came back to see if you have a bronze Republican."

Clinton replies, "Yes, I''d like a<br /> quickie!"</p>\n<p>"A quickie?!?" the waitress replies.  "Sir, given the past<br /> situation of your personal life I don''t think that is a good idea.<br /> I''ll come back when you are ready to order from the menu!" She walks<br /> away.</p>\n<p>Gore leans over to Clinton and says, "It''s pronounced Quiche."

The Geography of a Woman</p>\n<p>------------------------</p>\n<p>Between the ages of 18 - 21 a woman is like Africa or Australia. She is half discovered, half wild and naturally beautiful with bushland around the fertile deltas.</p>\n<p>Between the ages of 21 - 30 a woman is like America or Japan. Completely discovered, very well developed and open to trade especially with countries with cash or cars.</p>\n<p>Between the ages of 30 - 35, she is like India or Spain. Very hot, relaxed and convinced of its own beauty.</p>\n<p>Between the ages of 35 - 40 a woman is like France or Argentina. She may have been half destroyed during the war but can still be a warm and desirable place to visit.</p>\n<p>Between the ages of 40 - 50 she is like Yugoslavia or Iraq. She lost the war and is haunted by past mistakes. Massive reconstruction is now necessary.</p>\n<p>Between the ages of 50 - 60 she is like Russia or Canada. Very wide, quiet and the borders are practically unpatrolled but the frigid climate keeps people away.</p>\n<p>Between the ages of 60 - 70 a woman is like England or Mongolia. With a glorious and all conquering past but alas no future (a bit like Tony Blair, maybe Blair''s a women really).</p>\n<p>After 70, they become Albania or Afghanistan.

While suturing a laceration on the hand of a 90-year-old man, the doctor asked his patient how he thought George W. Bush was doing as President.The old man said, "Ya know, Bush is a post turtle." Not knowing what the old man meant, the doctor asked him what a "post turtle" was.He said, "Did you ever drive down a country road and come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top? You know he didn''t get there by himself, he doesn''t belong there, he can''t get anything done while he''s up there, and you just want to help the poor thing down. That''s a post turtle."
