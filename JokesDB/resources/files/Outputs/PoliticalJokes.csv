A blonde bought two horses, and could never remember which was<br /> which.</p>\n<p>A neighbor suggested that she cut the tail of one horse and that<br /> worked great until the other horse got his tail caught in a<br /> bush. It tore just right and looked exactly like the other<br /> horse''s tail and our friend was stuck again.</p>\n<p>The neighbor suggested her to notch the ear of one horse. That<br /> worked fine until the other horse caught his ear on a barbed<br /> wire fence.

When<br /> she did, she was very pleased to find that the white horse was 2<br /> inches taller than the black.

Bill Clinton is visiting a school. In one class, he asks the<br /> students if anyone can give him an example of a "TRAGEDY". One<br /> little boy stands up and offers, "If my best friend who lives<br /> next door was playing in the street when a car came along and<br /> killed him, that would be a TRAGEDY." "No," Clinton says, "That<br /> would be an ACCIDENT."</p>\n<p>A girl raises her hand. "If a school bus carrying fifty children<br /> drove off a cliff, killing everyone involved... that would be a<br /> TRAGEDY." I''m afraid not," explains Clinton. "That is what we<br /> would call a GREAT LOSS." The room is silent; none of the other<br /> children volunteer. "What?" asks Clinton. "Isn''t there any one<br /> here who can give me an example of a TRAGEDY?"</p>\n<p>Finally, a boy in the back raises his hand. In a timid voice, he<br /> speaks: "If an airplane carrying Bill and Hillary Clinton were<br /> blown up by a bomb, that would be a TRAGEDY." "Wonderful!"<br /> Clinton beams. "Marvelous! And can you tell me WHY that would be<br /> a TRAGEDY?"</p>\n<p>"Well," says the boy, "because it wouldn''t be an ACCIDENT, and<br /> it certainly would be no GREAT LOSS!"

So I went out onto the balcony, we live on the 25th<br /> floor, and found this man hanging over the edge by his fingertips. I went<br /> inside, got a hammer, and started hitting his hands. He fell, but landed in some<br /> bushes. So, I got the refrigerator and pushed it over the balcony and it crushed<br /> him. The strain of the act gave me a heart attack, and I died."<br /> St. Peter couldn''t deny that this was a pretty bad day, and since it was a<br /> crime of passion, he let the man in.<br /> He then asked the next man in line about the day he died. "Well, sir, it was<br /> awful," said the second man. "I was doing aerobics on the balcony of my 26th<br /> floor apartment when I twisted my ankle and slipped over the edge. I managed to<br /> grab the balcony of the apartment below, but some maniac came out and started<br /> pounding on my fingers with a hammer. Luckily I landed in some bushes. But, then<br /> the guy dropped a refrigerator on me!"<br /> St. Peter chuckled, let him into heaven and decided he could really start to<br /> enjoy this job.<br /> "Tell me about the day you died?�酶惟 he said to the third man in line.<br /> "OK, picture this; I''m naked, hiding inside a refrigerator...."

Two nude statues (one male and one female) had been standing in a beautiful park for 99 years. </p>\n<p>On their 100th anniversary in the park an angel came down from heaven to talk to the statues.</p>\n<p>He said to them, ''God has been watching you for the past 100 years and has been very pleased with the two of you. So pleased in fact that he has decided to make you human for a short time.''</p>\n<p>The angel then went on to say that they would be human for 15 minutes and would finally be able to pleasure themselves in a manner in which they have only fantasized about for the last 100 years.</p>\n<p>The statues were so excited they could hardly believe it. The second they became human they ran off together behind the bushes. The angel heard the rustling of the bushes and shouts of joy and laughter.</p>\n<p>After 10 minutes the statues returned from behind the bushes sweating and laughing. The angel told the statues that they still had five more minutes.</p>\n<p>The male statue quickly turned to the female statue and said:<br /> `Cool, this time, you hold down the pigeon and I''ll shit on its head.''

I feel as if I''m getting the shaft, that this ugly matter has come to a head and blown up in my face.</p>\n<p>This may be a load to handle, but when things are hard, that''s when I am at my best.

The President was so impressed, touched, and amused that he instructed his secretary to send the little boy a $5.00 bill.  President Bush thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy.The little boy was delighted with the $5.00 and sat down to write a thank you note to God, which read:Dear God,Thank you very much for sending the money, however, I noticed that for some reason you had to send it through Washington D.C. and, as usual, those crooks deducted $95.00.

In olden times, it could be decades before major events were cast in verse.<br /> But The Great 2000 Election Controversy is so big that a bunch of all-star poets<br /> have come out of retirement to quickly set the story to rhyme.</p>\n<p>For starters, history buff Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:<br /> Listen, my children, don''t dare ignore,<br /> The midnight actions of Bush and Gore<br /> In early November, the year ought-ought,<br /> Hard to believe the mess they wrought.<br /> Two billion bucks of campaign bounty<br /> All came down to Palm Beach County.<br /> What result could have been horrider<br /> Than the situation we found in Florider?</p>\n<p>Edgar Allan Poe is his usual gloomy self:<br /> Once upon a campaign dreary, one which left us weak and weary<br /> O''er many a quaint and curious promise of political lore<br /> While we nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a yapping,<br /> As of some votes overlapping, energy-zapping to the core<br /> "''Tis a mess here," we all muttered, as the network anchors stuttered,<br /> Stuttered over Bush and Gore.<br /> Could there be another election with such a case of misdirection,<br /> One with such a weak selection, yet fraught with tension to the core?<br /> Quoth the ravers, "Nevermore."<br /> Britain''s Edward Lear''s limerick is lighter:<br /> There once was a U.S. election<br /> That called for some expert detection -<br /> How thousands of pollers<br /> Could become two-holers<br /> Like outhouses of recollection.<br /> Ditto Ogden Nash:<br /> I regret to admit that all my knowledge<br /> Is what I learned at Electoral Colleges,<br /> So tell me please, though I hate to troubya,<br /> Will the winner be Al, or will it be Dubya?<br /> Joyce Kilmer''s a media analyst:<br /> I thought that I would never see<br /> The networks all so up a tree.<br /> Walt Whitman is lyrical, as always:<br /> O''Captain! My Captain!<br /> Our fearful trip''s not done<br /> The ship has weather''d every rack,<br /> But nobody knows who''s won.<br /> Alfred Noyes rhythmically rumbles:<br /> And still of an autumn night they say, with the White House on the line,<br /> When the campaign''s a ghostly galleon and both candidates cry "Tis mine!"<br /> When the road is a ribbon of ballots, all within easy reach,<br /> A highwayman comes riding, riding, riding,<br /> A highwayman comes riding, and punches two holes in each.<br /> Dr. Seuss takes a look at election officials:<br /> I cannot count them in a box<br /> I cannot count them with a fox<br /> I cannot count them by computer<br /> I will not with a Roto-Rooter<br /> I cannot count them card-by-card<br /> I will not ''cause it''s way too hard<br /> I cannot count them on my fingers<br /> I will not while suspicion lingers.<br /> I''ll leave the country in a jam -<br /> I can''t count ballots, Sam-I-Am.<br /> "Clement Moore" adopts a holiday theme:<br /> ''Twas the month before Christmas, when all through the courts,<br /> All the plaintiffs made stirring bad ballot reports.<br /> Which leaves the problem.<br /> Perhaps the best way to stop complaints that are so raucous is to start over<br /> again, with the Iowa caucuses!

Bill Gates grabbed my back<br /> pack.

The Washington Post  february 4, 1988 I BelieveThis is more commentary than humor, but what the heck...------------------------------------I believe the president. I have always believed him. I believed him when he said he had never been drafted in the Vietnam War and I believed him when he said he had forgotten to mention that he had been drafted in the Vietnam War. I believed him when he said he hadn''t had sex with Gennifer Flowers and I believe him now, when he reportedly says he did.I believe the president did not rent out the Lincoln Bedroom, did not sell access to himself and the vice president to hundreds of well-heeled special pleaders and did not supervise the largest, most systematic money-laundering operation in campaign finance history, collecting more than $ 3 million in illegal and improper donations. I believe that Charlie Trie and James Riady were motivated by nothing but patriotism for their adopted country.I believed Vice President Gore when he said that he had made dunning calls to political contributors ''on a few occasions'' from his White House office, and I believed when he said that, actually, ''a few'' meant 46. I believe in no controlling legal authority.I believe Bruce Babbitt when he says that the $ 286,000 contributed the DNC by Indian tribes opposed to granting a casino license to rival tribes had nothing to do with his denial of the license. I believed the secretary when he said that he had not been instructed this matter by then-White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. I believed him when he said that he had told lobbyist and friend Paul Eckstein that Ickes had told him to move on the casino decision, but that he had been lying to Eckstein. I agree with the secretary that it is an outrage that anyone would question his integrity. I believe in the Clinton Standard of adherence to the campaign finance and bribery laws, enunciated by the president on March 7, 1997: ''I don''t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.'' I note with approval the use of the word ''evidence'' and also the use of the word ''solely.'' I believe that it is proper to change government policy to address the concerns of people who have given the president money, as long as nobody can find evidence of this being the sole reason. I believe the president has lived up to his promise to preside over the most ethical administration in American history. I believe that indicted former agriculture secretary Mike Espy did not accept $35,000 in illegal favors from Tyson Foods and other regulated businesses. I believe that indicted former housing secretary Henry Cisneros did not lie to the FBI and tell others to lie to cover up $ 250,000 in blackmail payments to his former mistress.  I believe that convicted former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell was not involved in the obstruction of justice when the president''s minions arranged for Hubbell to receive $ 400,000 in sweetheart consulting deals at a time when he was reneging on his promise to cooperate with Kenneth Starr''s Whitewater investigation. I believe Paula Jones is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Kathleen Willey is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Monica Lewinsky is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Lewinsky was fantasizing in her 20 hours of conversation in which she reportedly detailed her sexual relationship with the president and begged Linda Tripp to join her in lying about the relationship. I believe that any gifts, correspondence, telephone calls and the 37 post-employment White House visits that may have passed between Lewinsky and the president are evidence only of a platonic relationship; such innocent intimate friendships are quite common between middle-aged married men and young single women, and also between presidents of the United States and White House interns. I see nothing suspicious in the report that the president''s intimate, Vernon Jordan, arranged a $ 40,000-per-year job for Lewinsky shortly after she signed but before she filed an affidavit saying she had not had sex with the president. Nor do I read anything into the fact that the ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, visited Lewinsky at the Watergate to offer her a job. I believe the instructions Lewinsky gave Tripp informing her on how to properly perjure herself in the Willey matter simply wrote themselves.I believe that The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News &amp; World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR are all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. Especially NPR.

Good evening my fellow Americans.</p>\n<p>First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New<br /> York and all Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You<br /> can rest assured that anything and everything that can be done<br /> to assure the safety of our country will be done. This is the<br /> greatest country in the world and we will get through this<br /> trying time. Now is the time for all people to set aside our<br /> petty differences and show the world that no one or nothing can<br /> destroy the fortitude of the American people.</p>\n<p>To the people responsible for today''s tragedy, I say this: Are<br /> you fucking kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped<br /> too tight? Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not<br /> know who you are fucking with? Americans are so hungry to kill,<br /> that we shoot at each other every day. We will relish that<br /> opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you<br /> forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started<br /> fucking around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over<br /> in Japan? We slapped them all over the Pacific and roasted about<br /> 2 million of them in their own back yard. That''s what we in<br /> America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen Texas on a map? Ever<br /> wonder why it''s so big? Because we wanted it that way, Mexico<br /> started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our<br /> lawns. England? We sent them packing.</p>\n<p>Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good ''ole USA. The<br /> only reason he got away the first time is because it''s too hard<br /> to shoot someone when you''re doubled over laughing at them. Our<br /> soldiers aren''t trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now<br /> he couldn''t stop a pack of cub scouts from taking over his<br /> shitty little country.</p>\n<p>Trust us, Afghanistan will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go<br /> ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden. There''s not a hole deep enough<br /> or a mountain high enough that''s going to keep your camel riding<br /> asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that harbors<br /> him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he<br /> was there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that<br /> have pissed us off in the past. This is America. We kick ass.<br /> This is what we do. Go ahead and laugh now, but the Tomahawks<br /> are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.</p>\n<p>God bless America!

Why doesn''t George W. Bush eat parrots?<br /> A little thing called cannibalism.
Three little boys went out to play in the snow and make snowmen.<br /> The first boy came in after just a few minutes.  His mother asked him if he<br /> was finished with his snowman already.  He answered that he had made a Superman<br /> snow man and it was easy, because he just had to add a cape.<br /> The second boy came in after about an hour, so his mother asked him why it<br /> took him so long.  He answered that he had made a Harry Potter snowman, and that<br /> it took a while to find a pair of glasses.<br /> The third boy was out in the yard all day; in fact, he missed dinner.  When he<br /> finally came in, it was after dark, and his mother asked why it had taken him so<br /> long.  He answered that he had made a president George W. Bush snowman and that<br /> it had taken a lot longer than he thought to hollow out his head.

When you''re 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: "Just because you''ve reached middle age, that doesn''t mean you shouldn''t take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it." </p>\n<p>This is the voice of Satan. </p>\n<p>I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales. </p>\n<p>I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. "I''ll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets" is a typical breakfast order for me these days. </p>\n<p>This is because I went snowboarding. </p>\n<p>For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough. </p>\n<p>These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, "Cool." </p>\n<p>People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together. </p>\n<p>We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill). </p>\n<p>If anybody asks if you''re OK, you say, "I''m just catching my breath!" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you''re going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you''re planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw. </p>\n<p>At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance. </p>\n<p>So I thought I''d take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing. </p>\n<p>In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range. </p>\n<p>Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can''t stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you. </p>\n<p>Skiers hate snowboarders. It''s a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc. </p>\n<p>Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd. </p>\n<p>I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope. </p>\n<p>Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who''s going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete. </p>\n<p>You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.) </p>\n<p>We learned snowboarding via a two step method: </p>\n<p>STEP ONE: Watching Brad do something. </p>\n<p>STEP TWO: Trying to do it ourselves. </p>\n<p>I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics. </p>\n<p>I''d struggle to my feet, and I''d be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot. </p>\n<p>"Keep your knees bent!" Brad would yell, helpfully. </p>\n<p>Have you noticed that whatever sport you''re trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if THAT would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, "FORGET MY KNEES! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE GRAVITY CHUNKS!" </p>\n<p>Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me. </p>\n<p>If I hadn''t gotten out of there, they''d have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding. </p>\n<p>So I think, when my body heals, I''ll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you''ll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.

Good afternoon all. I''m Al Gore, and I''d like to tell you a<br /> little about myself. </p>\n<p>I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a<br /> poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I<br /> was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands. I taught<br /> myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers<br /> and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi<br /> River steamboat. Frequently we would stop the ship and I would<br /> cut and split five cords of wood for fuel overnight for the<br /> steam engines. </p>\n<p>My mother taught me the value of education, so every day, I<br /> would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a<br /> mischievous, fun loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one<br /> day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for<br /> "Huckleberry Finn." </p>\n<p>Back then, we Jewish black folks in the south were second-class<br /> citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I<br /> asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee<br /> civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an<br /> impression. You see, the minister''s name was Martin Luther King,<br /> Jr. </p>\n<p>My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his<br /> knee and said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama,<br /> someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to<br /> an exclusive prep school." As a young Hindu boy, these were very<br /> valuable lessons. But life of privilege was not for me. </p>\n<p>Being Chinese, after getting my high school diploma, I took a<br /> job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the<br /> treatment of the workers there that I organized a union. Later,<br /> that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my<br /> close friends at the AFL-CIO call me "Norma Rae." </p>\n<p>When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done,<br /> Harvard University called and offered me a scholarship. I<br /> captained the hockey team to four consecutive national<br /> championships, but I also played football and was good enough to<br /> win the Heisman Trophy. </p>\n<p>During my college years, I lived in a housing project and<br /> moonlighted writing songs and playing lead guitar for a little<br /> rock band. You may have heard of us - The Rolling Stones. I''m<br /> the one with the lips. </p>\n<p>But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my<br /> country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I<br /> was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier<br /> and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de<br /> Guerre. My battlefield expertise is current requisite reading<br /> material for Officers Candidates to this very day. My being a<br /> wounded female officer serving in disguise as a journalist was a<br /> full time project, but my military knowledge helped save tens of<br /> thousands of lives. Many cities in Southeast Asia are named<br /> after me to this very day. Statues of me are still commonplace<br /> in many official Government buildings in Viet Nam. </p>\n<p>When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of<br /> ours. I''ve crossed the deserts bare, man, I''ve breathed the<br /> mountain air, man, I''ve traveled, I''ve done my share, man, I''ve<br /> been everywhere. I''ve hunted all the dangerous species of big<br /> game in five continents using only a handmade spear or my<br /> handmade laser sighted compound bow. </p>\n<p>And the people I met at truck stops and campgrounds and homeless<br /> shelters on that journey all said the same thing: "Al, we need<br /> you in Washington." </p>\n<p>I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some<br /> other business---building the World Trade Center, finding a low<br /> cost, more reliable nuclear weapon trigger design, founding the<br /> Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking<br /> caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field''s<br /> chocolate chip cookies. I was, in fact, the third (still silent)<br /> partner of Ben &amp; Jerry with over half of the flavors personally<br /> developed by Tipper and me in our own kitchen.</p>\n<p>My extensive knowledge of Arctic Sea life keeps me busy in the<br /> research laboratory, but those endangered species need love too!<br /> Translating the dead sea scrolls is one of my favorite hobbies,<br /> and my current volume is in print in over 73 languages and is<br /> being studied in Seminaries worldwide. Being Indian, both Native<br /> American and the Mid East kind, this is valuable experience for<br /> me. Have towel and Tee Pee, will travel.</p>\n<p>Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee<br /> and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and<br /> the Senate. And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for<br /> no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once<br /> again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the<br /> United States. </p>\n<p>I also invented the Internet. Since then, I''ve been part of the<br /> most successful administration in American history. My friend,<br /> Bill Gates has asked me many times why I gave him the ideas of<br /> software development and asked for no money. Gosh, it just<br /> wouldn''t be right! </p>\n<p>Many times President Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave<br /> decision and has asked me what to do. And when I would give him<br /> my thoughts, he would invariable say, "Of course. That''s<br /> brilliant. Why didn''t I think of that?" During the darkest days<br /> of the impeachment battles, the President told me he only wished<br /> he had listened when I told him to stay away form that<br /> dark-haired intern with the big hooters. </p>\n<p>So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and<br /> asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my<br /> campaign. And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of<br /> advice-words I''ll never forget. He looked me in the eye and he<br /> said, "Al, just tell the truth, it''s always worked well for me." </p>\n<p>Thanks, I''m Al Gore and I want to be your next President. You<br /> can trust and believe me.

George Bush, Saddam Hussein and General Cosgrove were all walking along a<br /> beach together after a peace talk , when they spotted an empty champagne bottle<br /> lying in the sand .

I also wish I had a fleet of<br /> a million oil tankers, to take his oil supplies when I''m done!"<br /> The Genie granted the Chief Executive his wish.<br /> "Ha!" Saddam retorted. "You won''t defeat me so easily! I wish there was an<br /> impregnable wall around all of Iraq, so no Iranians, Israelis or infidel<br /> Westerners may enter! I also wish to be transported safely back to my palace in<br /> Baghdad!"<br /> And with that, the Genie did his bidding, and Saddam vanished in a puff of<br /> smoke.<br /> This left only General Cosgrove.<br /> "Well, first of all," said the good General,"tell me about this wall."<br /> "Well, it''s higher than any aero plane can fly and thicker than any explosive<br /> can penetrate," replied the Genie. "There are no entrances or exits. Basically,<br /> nothing can get in or out."<br /> "Right," replied Cosgrove. "Fill it with water."

As my elderly aunt and uncle strolled downtown one afternoon they run into their old friends. They spend some time discussing this and that when one friend asks my uncle where they has been. "We just left the office of our memory doctor""Memory doctor? What is that all about?""Well" replies my uncle "As you know we are getting up there in age, and our memory just isn''t as sharp as it once was.""Is the doctor effective?""Oh, yes, he''s wonderful.""Really. You know, my memory is not too sharp these days either. Maybe I''ll pay him a visit. Whats his name?""Oh. Uh. Well." replies my uncle. "Um. You know those things that grow out of the ground?". "You mean trees?""Kind of, but smaller.""You mean a bush?""Yes, a bush or a plant, but ... Um ... You know, more colorful.""A flower?"."Yes. A flower.

During a political debate the politicians were asked to use the word<br /> "fascinate" in a sentence.<br /> The first one, a democrat, came up with an answer right away. He said, "One of<br /> my hobbies is painting, and no matter if I paint with water colors, or oils I<br /> always fascinate people with my work." </p>\n<p>The second politician, the republican, said "My grandfather was a magician,<br /> and when ever he performed a trick be it with cards, or hoops, or magic balls he<br /> would always fascinate us." </p>\n<p>The third politician, an independent, said "I don''t know if I can do that." </p>\n<p>The MC of the debate said, "Go ahead take a couple of minutes then give it<br /> your best." </p>\n<p>The third politician thought for a while then said, "I know this gal, one time<br /> she went to the store to buy a new blouse. The blouse had ten buttons on it, but<br /> when she went to button it her boobs were so big that she could only fasten<br /> eight."

A first grade teacher explains to her class that she is a liberal Democrat.<br /> She asks her students to raise their hands if they were liberal Democrats too.<br /> Not really knowing what a liberal Democrat was but wanting to be like their<br /> teacher, their hands explode into the air like fleshy fireworks.<br /> There is, however, one exception. A girl named Lucy has not gone along with<br /> the crowd. The teacher asks her why she has decided to be different. "Because<br /> I''m not a liberal Democrat."<br /> Then, asks the teacher, what are you?  "Why I''m a proud conservative<br /> Republican.", boasts the little girl.<br /> The teacher is a little perturbed now, her face slightly red. She asks Lucy<br /> why she is a conservative Republican.<br /> "Well, I was brought up to trust in myself instead of relying on an intrusive<br /> government to care for me and do all of my thinking. My Dad and Mom are<br /> conservative Republicans, and I am a conservative Republican too."<br /> The teacher is now angry. "That''s no reason," she says loudly.  "What if your<br /> Mom was a moron, and your dad was a moron. What would you be then?"<br /> A pause, and a smile. "Then," says Lucy, "I''d be a liberal Democrat."

Then grumbled about the impertinence of the woman, and said "Very well, I want to awaken with three white women in my bed in the morning, so just do it and be off with you !"</p>\n<p>The annoyed genie said, "So be it !" and disappeared. </p>\n<p>The next morning Bin Laden woke up in bed with Lorena Bobbitt, Tonya Harding, and Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>His penis was gone, his knee was broken, and he had no health insurance.

Every once in a while each of us experiences a perfect crap. It''s rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects. You sit down expecting the worst, but what you get is the smooth-sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. </p>\n<p>But that''s not the end of it. You use some toilet paper only to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it. </p>\n<p>On the other hand (so to speak) there is:</p>\n<p>The Beer Crap<br /> Talk about nasty craps. Depending on the crapper''s tolerance, the beer crap is the result of too many beers. It could have been two or 22, it doesn''t matter.<br /> What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy crap accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.</p>\n<p>The Chilli Crap<br /> Hot when it goes in and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chilli crap stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a heat shield.</p>\n<p>The Cable Crap<br /> Long, curly and perfectly formed like two feet of telephone coaxial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. You wonder admiringly, ''Did I do that? Where did it come from?'' You leave the toilet pleased with yourself.</p>\n<p>The Latrine Crap<br /> In case you didn''t know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it - where soldiers, boy scouts and flies go to crap. Tip: don''t ever look down the hole.</p>\n<p>The Mona Lisa Crap<br /> This is the masterpiece of craps. It''s as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that would make Da Vinci weep. And just think, you made it yourself. You may even want to break out the Polaroid camera, but maybe that''s going too far.</p>\n<p>The Empty Roll Crap<br /> You''re done... you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins coldly in your throat. You could use the curtains... no, someone would say, ''Where are the curtains?'' Then what would you say. The rug? Too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that every ''empty roll crapper'' must face... pull up your daks, tighten your arse and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.</p>\n<p>A mate about to run the London Marathon lined up outside the dozens of portaloos on Blackheath to unload a nervous one and discovered when the business was done and he was ready to run a world record race, there was no paper. Panic. The only thing available was a pound note - the last he possessed because they were being replaced by the coin - and he used that, being careful not to use the side with the Queen''s head, of course!</p>\n<p>The Splash Back Crap<br /> You send the crap on its way; it drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you''re wet and embarrassed. Tip: blot instead of wipe.</p>\n<p>The Aborted Crap<br /> You are in mid-crap when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off; go for the phone and save the rest for later. It isn''t pretty, but you''ve gotta do what you''ve gotta do.</p>\n<p>The Caesarean Crap<br /> Pain, that''s what this crap and childbirth have in common. It''s simply a case of too much crap trying to go through too small a hole and there''s no obstetrician to help.</p>\n<p>The Alfresco Crap<br /> Everyone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the nature, and a good bush all contribute to the peaceful ambience that our primitive forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of Brownies or a patch of poison ivy.</p>\n<p>The Tijuana Trot Crap (also known as Delhi Belly, Rabat Runs, Seskatchewan Squits, Balsall Heath Balti Bypass)<br /> The phrase ''shit happens'' really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins. For the next 72 hours you''d be better off if you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a fetal position.</p>\n<p>The Machine Gun Crap<br /> You''re just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like machinegun fire. The guy in the next stall hits the floor like a combat veteran - cradling his umbrella like an AK47.</p>\n<p>The Sound Effect Crap<br /> You feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or workmates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects:<br /> 1. Flush the toilet.<br /> 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem.<br /> 3. Drop a handful of change on the floor.</p>\n<p>The Security Crap<br /> You have enough on your mind when you''re in the toilet without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-crap mode. So how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can''t reach to do this... hum loudly.</p>\n<p>The Cling-On Crap<br /> For the most part you''ve completed your crap, but there''s one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You''re getting impatient. Someone else wants to use the toilet. So you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently on the door has scissors.</p>\n<p>The Houdini Crap<br /> You go, then you stand up to flush and the damn thing has disappeared. Where''d it go? Did it creep down the pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it lurking out of sight? Should you wipe... maybe you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You''d better, because if you don''t, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.</p>\n<p>The Hangover Crap<br /> You feel so bad that you don''t know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your intestines like a vice so you sit down again... up down, up down. Don''t you wish Mum was close by.</p>\n<p>The Porta-Pottie Dump<br /> Construction workers and outdoor concertgoers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best description would be, ''It''s like taking a shit in an upright coffin.'' It''s claustrophobic and it smells bad. Best advice: go in a paper cup.</p>\n<p>The Proctologist Crap<br /> In the beginning, the Lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn''t create this dump because there is nothing biblical about it. You run out of gas. That''s right, you run out of propulsion. The crap is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You''ve only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you''re a proctologist and go after it yourself. Not a pretty picture is it?</p>\n<p>The Whole Roll Crap<br /> No matter how much you wipe, it doesn''t seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times too. The whole episode is consumer waste.</p>\n<p>The Graffiti Crap<br /> You flush the crap and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the crap to the porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way down. You flush again but the curly-Q hangs there... love it or leave it, it''s your choice.</p>\n<p>The Encore Crap<br /> ''Ahhh!'' You''re done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the toilet when you feel another crap on its way. You have to return for a curtain call.</p>\n<p>The Born Again Crap<br /> This is a dump that''s going badly. You say, ''Lord, if I live through this, I''ll take up religion.'' You always get through it, but seldom keep the promises you made in desperation, because a born-again crap is like childbirth - you forget the pain quickly.</p>\n<div id="nodevote result">Score: 0.0, votes: 0</div>\n

Fresh off of the Associated Press Wire...<br /> AP - Monica Lewinsky, in a statement released today, countered President<br /> Clinton''s firm denial:<br /> "I have had enough. This whole experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth,<br /> and I can''t stomach any more. I feel as if I am getting the shaft, that this<br /> ugly matter has come to a head and blown up in my face.<br /> "This may be a load to handle, but when things are hard, that is when I am at<br /> my best. I have faced hard things in the past, and I know what is coming. I will<br /> meet this challenge the only way I know how: head on.<br /> "I have licked bigger things than this before, and I will again.

I will work non-stop and fight this, blow by blow, until I am<br /> wiped clean of this dirty affair. I will not be stained by it.<br /> "Thank you."<br /> Monica Lewinsky.

Jesus is on one side of the Jordan River while Al Gore and<br /> George Bush are on the other side. George Bush says "Jesus,how<br /> can we get to the other side so we can praise you?" and Jesus<br /> replys "Walk across the river and you will only sink as far as<br /> the sins you have committed."

It was a special reserve unit made up of lawyers and accountants. When the time came we ordered them to charge--and boy, did they know how to charge."</p>\n<p>A blind rabbit and a blind snake ran into each other on the road one day.

[surprisingly bi-partisan]''TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE IMPEACHMENTDecember 17, 1998''Twas The Night Before Impeachment, When all through the House, All Congress was stirring, Even Conyers, the louse.  The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care, In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair.  The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds, While visions of perjury danced in their heads.  And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap, Had just settled in for a long evening''s nap.When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter.  When what to their wondering eyes should appear But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer.  With a Presidential address, so lively and quick, They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick!More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came, And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:''Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let''s forget The Vixen!On Barney! On Maxine! I''m no Richard Nixon!!!'' ''From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall, Now dash away, dash away, dash away all !!!''And then the Republicans heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  They scratched their heads and were turning around When resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound.  No longer would he eat from his humble pie, While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky.  A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq, It looked once again like Slick Willie was back.His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, His nose like a cherry.  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the hair on his head was as white as the snow.  The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.  He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf, And the Republicans wept, in spite of themselves.  And a wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave them to know they had something to dread.  He spoke the right words and went straight to his work Hard to believe Mon had called him ''The Jerk.''And shaking his finger and thumbing his nose, By ''Wagging The Dog,'' up the polls he rose.  He turned to his spinmeisters and gave them a whistle, Then they cheered-on Slick Willie as he launched another missile.  They all heard him exclaim, with Impeachment out of sight, ''Happy Ramadan to all, and to all a good night.''
A first grade teacher in a small town in Texas explains to her class that<br /> she is a George Bush fan. She asks her students to raise their hands if they<br /> are Bush fans too. Not really knowing what a Bush fan is,<br /> but wanting to be liked by the teacher, their hands fly into the air.<br /> There is, however, one exception. A little boy named Mike has not gone along<br /> with the crowd.<br /> The teacher asks him why he has decided to be different.<br /> "Because I''m not a Bush fan" he retorts. "Then," asks the teacher "what are<br /> you?"<br /> "I''m a proud Al Gore fan!" boasts the little boy. The teacher is a little<br /> perturbed now,<br /> her face slightly red. She asks Mike why he is a Gore fan<br /> "Well, my Dad and Mom are Gore fans, so I''m a Gore fan too" he responds.<br /> The teacher is now angry. "That''s no reason," she says loudly.<br /> "What if your Mom was a moron, and your Dad was an idiot.<br /> What would you be then?" Mike says, "Then I''d be a Bush fan."

Many parents today are concerned that their offspring might somehow be involved in the world of illegal pharmaceuticals, or "drugs".  This is a healthy concern.  Knowing your kids are "high" is the first step toward helping them avoid problems with their health, their grades,  the law, and getting those hard-to-clean vomit stains out of the Oriental rug.</p>\n<p>KNOW THE WARNING SIGNS- select the option which best describes your child.</p>\n<p>1. Your child''s idea of a fun sport to play is: </p>\n<p>A) tossing a pigskin ball around </p>\n<p>B) throwing an orange rubber ball into a netted hole </p>\n<p>C) inserting a pointy needle into a vein and mixing foreign substances into the human bloodstream.</p>\n<p>2. Your child''s idea of a responsible adult is: </p>\n<p>A) Bill Clinton </p>\n<p>B) Tom Hanks </p>\n<p>C) Charles Manson.</p>\n<p>3. Your child''s favorite hobbies include: </p>\n<p>A) Model Rocketry </p>\n<p>B) Baseball </p>\n<p>C) Taking white, powdery substances from a big bag and breaking it down into many smaller bags.</p>\n<p>4. Your child''s pet is: </p>\n<p>A) a puppy dog </p>\n<p>B) a 16'' python </p>\n<p>C) a colony of imaginary bugs and spiders that crawl under their skin.</p>\n<p>5. Your child''s breath smells like: </p>\n<p>A) a fresh, minty mountain top </p>\n<p>B) lunch </p>\n<p>C) an opium den.</p>\n<p>6. When your young ones dress up to go out, they look like: </p>\n<p>A) Fred and Ginger </p>\n<p>B) Regis and Kathy Lee </p>\n<p>C) Sid and Nancy</p>\n<p>7. Your child would identify Tijuana Gold as: </p>\n<p>A) a precious metal </p>\n<p>B) a Mexican theme park </p>\n<p>C) a good deal, but not as potent as the stuff from Thailand.</p>\n<p>8. When you ask your child how their day at school was at the dinner table they answer: </p>\n<p>A) they scored a goal for their soccer team </p>\n<p>B) they got the highest grade in class on a math test </p>\n<p>C) they scored a dime bag and got high.</p>\n<p>Total up the number of times you answered "C" to the questions above, and consult the table below.</p>\n<p>0 "C''s"- Chances are your child is not on drugs.  They probably aren''t that exciting either.  Kick them out of the house and force them to live on the cold streets for a few months to let them really appreciate life in all it''s murkiness.</p>\n<p>1-3 "C''s"- Your child might be on drugs, but you can''t be certain.  Put a flashlight up to their face and flash it in their eyes.  This doesn''t really tell you anything, but it scares the pants off your kids and is kind of fun.</p>\n<p>3-6 "C''s"- You may as well face it, you''ve got a little druggie on your hands.  Your child is a menace to society and must be dealt with accordingly.  We suggest a good flaying to help them kick their nasty habit.  Confiscate all their stash and send it to Ooze.</p>\n<p>7-8 "C''s"- Your child has never used drugs.  No sir. Just smile nicely at them and slink out of the house. Never return.
George W. Bush told Dick Cheney, "I really hate all the stupid jokes people make about me." Cheney reassured him by saying,  "Jokes can''t hurt you.  They are just made up by a bunch of stupid people. In fact, most humans are quite stupid.  Here, I''ll show you what I mean."Cheney goes outside and hails a D.C. cab and says to the driver, "Please take me to 261 M street to see if I''m home," said Cheney. Without a word, the cabbie took them straight to M Street.  Cheney then rang the doorbell, came back to the car and said, "Oh, I guess I''m not there! Take us back to where we started, please."The cabbie did what he was told without a word.  Cheney leaned over and said to Dubya, "You get the idea?  People are idiots wherever you go! Don''t worry about their opinions!"Bush said, "Thanks Dick.  I feel a lot better."  Then he winked and whispered, "Hooboy, was he stupid! He picked us up right in front of a phone booth. He should have realized you could have called instead!
Why did the chicken cross the road?</p>\n<p>MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why?<br /> The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.</p>\n<p>JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn''t anyone ever<br /> think to ask, What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the<br /> place, anyway?"</p>\n<p>FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the<br /> road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.</p>\n<p>BILL GATES: I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000, which will cross<br /> roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your<br /> checkbook.</p>\n<p>OLIVER STONE: The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the<br /> road?" Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we<br /> overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"</p>\n<p>CHARLES DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally<br /> selected in such a way that they are now genetically disposed to cross roads.</p>\n<p>ALBERT EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved<br /> beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.</p>\n<p>BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.</p>\n<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road. It transcended it.</p>\n<p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die. In the rain.</p>\n<p>COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one?</p>\n<p>BILL CLINTON : I did not, and I repeat, did not have sexual relations with<br /> that chicken. </p>\n<p>Pat Buchanan: To steal a job from a decent, hard working American.<br /> L.A. Police Department: Give us five minutes with the chicken and we''ll find<br /> out.<br /> Dr. Seuss: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad?<br /> Yes! The chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I''ve not been told!<br /> Grandpa: In my day, we didn''t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone<br /> told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.<br /> Aristotle: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.<br /> Bill Clinton: I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. However, I did ask<br /> Vernon Jordan to find the chicken a job in New York.
George W. Bush was out walking when he saw Moses.<br /> "Hey, Moses! STOP!!" he yelled. But Moses walked on, ignoring him. After a few<br /> blocks, Bush caught up with him.

Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush meet up in Baghdad for the first round of talks in a new peace process. When George sits down, he notices three buttons on the side of Saddam''s chair. They begin talking. After about five minutes Saddam presses the First button. A boxing glove springs out of a box on the desk and punches Bush in the face.Confused, Bush carries on talking as Saddam laughs. A few minutes later the second button is pressed. This time a big boot comes out and kicks Bush in the shin. Again Saddam laughs, and again Bush carries on talking, not wanting to put off the bigger issue of peace between the two countries. But when the third button is pressed and another boot comes out and kicks Bush in the privates, he''s finally had enough, knowing that he can''t do much without them functioning well."I''m going back home!" he tells the Iraqi."We''ll finish these talks in two weeks!"A fortnight passes and Saddam flies to the United States for talks. As the two men sit down, Hussein notices three buttons on Bush''s chair and prepares himself for the Yank''s revenge. They begin talking and Bush presses the first button. Saddam ducks, but nothing happens. George snickers. A few seconds later he presses the second button. Saddam jumps up, but again nothing happens. Bush roars with laughter. When the third button is pressed, Saddam jumps up again, and again nothing happens. Bush falls on the floor in a fit of hysterics."Forget this," says Saddam."I''m going back to Baghdad!"Dubya says through tears of laughter, "What Baghdad?"
Now that it seems almost a certainty that George W. Bush will become the<br /> Republican nominee for President, attention will soon focus upon whom Governor<br /> Bush will pick for his Vice Presidential running mate. It is rumored that one of<br /> the names on the ''short list'' currently being floated in upper level Republican<br /> circles is former Vice President, Dan Quayle. </p>\n<p>For many, there seems to be some very sound reasoning for picking Quayle. As<br /> was pointed out by one senior official who wished not be identified, Quayle<br /> "already knows how to do the job, will contribute gaffes that will deflect<br /> attention away from Bush''s own, and in a cost saving side benefit will help the<br /> party minimize printing costs for new ''Bush-Quayle'' posters and bumper stickers<br /> (since they can use the leftovers from the 1988 and 1992 campaigns). </p>\n<p>Apparently, part of the overall strategy is the targeting of a key demographic<br /> group that has been virtually ignored in previous presidential campaigns: Senile<br /> and confused voters. One recent survey puts the ''senile and confused'' at<br /> approximately 3.8% of the voting population. The hope is that this group will<br /> mistakenly believe that this is the same Bush-Quayle ticket they voted for in<br /> 1988 and 1992 and will once again cast their votes for another, albeit<br /> different, Bush-Quayle ticket. The dilemma facing Republican strategists however<br /> is determining how best to mount an effective campaign that will get out the<br /> ''senile and confused'' vote. One strategist sighed, "They''re a hard group to<br /> reach, let alone give instructions to." </p>\n<p>Additionally, word has it that the former Vice President is undertaking some<br /> unique preparations for another run at the Vice Presidency. Included in his<br /> training regimen is a comprehensive reading of Webster�酶惟s Dictionary cover to<br /> cover as well as listening to the popular vocabulary-building program on<br /> cassette tapes, "Verbal Advantage." </p>\n<p>For many, the inclusion of former Vice President Quayle on the ticket will<br /> spell ''opportunities''. When one reporter asked Quayle "what do you think about<br /> running on a ticket with a Bush again," the former Vice President expressed that<br /> he was "clearly delighted" about it. However, Quayle did seem somewhat puzzled<br /> and perplexed as to why Bush has now added a "W" to his name when he didn''t seem<br /> to use one before.

One day, Bill Clinton and the Pope died. Bill Clinton was saying,�酶惟 Yes!! No I<br /> get to go to hell and meet the devil!" The Pope was saying,�酶惟 Finally, after all<br /> these years, I get to meet the Virgin marry." Well, while they were waiting to<br /> go to heaven, the office angels accidentally switched their files. So Bill<br /> Clinton ended up going to heaven, and the Pope to hell. Well after about 2<br /> weeks, God realized that the files were switched. So he ordered them to go to<br /> the right places. Well on the way to their places, Bill Clinton and the Pope met<br /> up with each other''s elevator. The pope was excited, "NOW I FINALLY GET TO MEET<br /> THE VIRGIN MARY!!!" Then Bill Clinton replied, "SHE AIN''T NO VIRGIN ANY MORE!"

WASHINGTON D.C. (Rooters) Incredibly, it now appears that over the last five years the White House actually issued these official knee-pads to all female interns between the ages of 18 and 29.''It''s something we haven''t seen since the Kennedy Administration,'' Landford Phlegm, official White House historian, said yesterday. ''What a guy! It only proves he isn''t in it to meet heads of state.''But since the scandal broke, the White House has sought to rid itself of its surplus. ''We had several hundred pair on hand,'' one aide reported. ''Enough to last until the year 2000. Well -- almost enough.''
Bill Clinton is visiting a school. In one class, he asks the students if<br /> anyone can give him an example of a "tragedy". One little boy stands up and<br /> offers that, "If my best friend who lives next door was playing in the street<br /> and a car came along and killed him, that would be a tragedy." </p>\n<p>"No," Clinton says, "That would be an ACCIDENT." </p>\n<p>A girl raises her hand. "If a school bus carrying fifty children drove off a<br /> cliff, killing everyone involved...that would be a tragedy." </p>\n<p>"I''m afraid not," explains Clinton. "That is what we would call a GREAT LOSS." </p>\n<p>The room is silent; none of the other children volunteer. </p>\n<p>"What?" asks Clinton, "Isn''t there any one here who can give me an example of<br /> a tragedy?" </p>\n<p>Finally, a boy in the back raises his hand. In a timid voice, he says: "If an<br /> airplane carrying Bill and Hillary Clinton were blown up by a bomb, that would<br /> be a tragedy." </p>\n<p>"Wonderful!" Clinton beams. "Marvelous! And can you tell me WHY that would be<br /> a tragedy?" </p>\n<p>"Well," says the boy, "because it wouldn''t be an accident, and it certainly<br /> would be no great loss!"

The only thing that the IRS has not yet taxed is the male penis. This is due to the fact that 40% of the time it is hanging around unemlpoyed, 30% of the time it is hard up, 20% of the time it is pissed off and 10% of the time it is in the hole. On top of that, it has two dependents and they are both nuts.</p>\n<p>Effective January 1st, 2004 your penis will be taxed according to size.

REDMOND, Wash. - Oct. 21, 1997 -- In direct response to accusations made by the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today that it will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of America for an undisclosed sum. </p>\n<p>"It''s actually a logical extension of our planned growth", said Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, "It really is going to be a positive arrangement for everyone". Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of the White House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and assured members of the press that changes will be "minimal". </p>\n<p>The United States will be managed as a wholly owned division of Microsoft. An initial public offering is planned for July of next year, and the federal government is expected to be profitable by "Q4 1999 at latest", according to Microsoft president Steve Ballmer. In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had "willingly and enthusiastically" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting directly to Bill Gates. When asked how it felt to give up the mantle of executive authority to Gates, Clinton smiled and referred to it as "a relief". He went on to say that Gates has a "proven track record", and that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their "full support and confidence". Clinton will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he has earned as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft. Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as "silly", though did say that he would make executive decisions for the U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters. Gates went on to say that the House and Senate would "of course" be Abolished. </p>\n<p>"Microsoft isn''t a democracy", he observed, "and look how well we''re doing". When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was proceeding, Gates said, "We don''t deny that discussions are taking place". Microsoft representatives closed the conference by stating that United States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in government services and discounts on all Microsoft products.</p>\n<p>About Microsoft</p>\n<p>Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ "MSFT") is the worldwide leader in software for personal computers, and democratic government. The company offers a wide range of products and services for public, business and personal use, each designed with the mission of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take advantage of the full power of personal computing and free society every day. </p>\n<p>About the United States</p>\n<p>Founded in 1789, the United States of America is the most successful nation in the history of the world, and has been a beacon of democracy and opportunity for over 200 years. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the United States is a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation.

WASHINGTON, DC - President Bush expressed frustration and anger Monday over a<br /> U.N. report stating that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein is now fully complying<br /> with weapons inspections. "Enough is enough," a determined Bush told reporters.<br /> "We are not fooled by Saddam''s devious attempts to sway world opinion by doing<br /> everything the U.N. asked him to do. We will not be intimidated into backing<br /> down and, if we have any say in the matter, neither will Saddam." Bush added<br /> that any further Iraqi attempt to meet the demands of the U.N. or U.S. will be<br /> regarded as "an act of war."

An open letter to the rest of America:</p>\n<p>America has engaged in some finger wagging lately because<br /> California doesn''t have enough electricity to meet its needs.<br /> The rest of the country (including George W. Bush''s energy<br /> secretary Spencer Abraham, who wants Californians to suffer<br /> through blackouts as justification for drilling for oil in<br /> Alaska''s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) seems to be just fine<br /> with letting Californians dangle in the breeze without enough<br /> power to meet their needs. They laugh at Californians''<br /> frivolity. Well, everybody. Here''s how it really is:</p>\n<p>California ranks 48th in the nation in power consumed per<br /> person. California grows more than half the nation''s fruit, nuts<br /> and vegetables. We''re keeping them. We need something to eat<br /> when the power goes out. We grow 99 percent or more of the<br /> nation''s almonds, artichokes, dates, figs, kiwifruit, olives,<br /> persimmons, pistachios, prunes, raisins and walnuts. Hope you<br /> won''t miss them. California is the nation''s number one dairy<br /> state. We''re keeping our dairy products. We''ll need plenty of<br /> fresh ones since our refrigerators can''t be relied upon. Got<br /> milk?</p>\n<p>We Californians are gonna keep all our high-tech software in<br /> state. Silicon Valley is ours, after all. Without enough<br /> electricity, which you''re apparently keeping for yourselves, we<br /> just plain don''t have enough software to spare. We''re keeping<br /> all our airplanes. California builds a good percentage of the<br /> commercial airliners available to fly you people to where you<br /> want to go. When yours wear out, you''d better hope Boeing''s<br /> Washington plant can keep you supplied. There isn''t enough<br /> electricity here to allow us to export any more planes than we<br /> need ourselves. And while we''re at it, we''re keeping all our<br /> high tech aerospace stuff, too, like the sophisticated weapons<br /> systems that let you sleep at night, not worried you might wake<br /> up under the rule of some foreign kook. Oh, yeah, and if you<br /> want to make a long-distance call, remember where the satellite<br /> components and tracking systems come from. Maybe you could get<br /> back in the habit of writing letters. Want to see a blockbuster<br /> movie this weekend? Come to California. We make them here. Since<br /> we''ll now have to make them with our own electricity, we''re<br /> keeping them. Even if we shot them somewhere else, the labs,<br /> printing facilities, editing facilities, and sound facilities<br /> are all here.</p>\n<p>Want some nice domestic wine? We produce over 17 million gallons<br /> per year. We''ll need all of it to drown our sorrows when we<br /> think about the fact that no matter how many California products<br /> we export to make the rest of America''s lives better, America<br /> can''t see its way clear to help us out with a little<br /> electricity. You can no longer have any of our wine. You all<br /> complain that we don''t build enough power plants. Well, you<br /> don''t grow enough food, write enough software, make enough<br /> movies, build enough airplanes and defense systems or make<br /> enough wine. This is your last warning, America. Lighten (us) up<br /> before it''s too late.</p>\n<p>Love,<br /> The Californians</p>\n<p>"I love California - I practically grew up in Phoenix." -Dan<br /> Quayle

It was getting a little crowded in heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have a real bummer of a day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.The next day at 12:01, the first person comes to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly says to the man, ''Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died.''''No problem,'' the man says. ''I came home to my 25th floor apartment in my lunch hour and caught my wife half-naked and appearing to be having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. I immediately began searching for him. My wife was yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. Just as I was about to giveup, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of that guy!''Well, I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But wouldn''t you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn''t die. This ticked me off even more. In a rage, I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him. Oddly enough, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony, and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 storeys and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.''The angel sits back and thinks for a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day. It was a crime of passion. So, the angel announces, ''OK sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,'' and lets him in. A few seconds later the next guy comes up. ''Before I can let you in, I need to hear about what your day was like when you died.''The man says, ''No problem. But you''re not going to believe this. I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side!''Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, starts cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom that broke my fall so I didn''t die right away. As I''m laying there face up on the ground, unable to move, and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator of all things off the balcony. It falls the 25 floors and lands on top of me, killing me instantly.''The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. ''I could get used to this new policy,'' he thinks to himself. ''Very well,'' the angel announces, ''welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,'' and he lets the man enter.A few seconds later, a third man comes up to the gate. The angel is warming up to his task. ''OK, please tell me what it was like the day you died.''The man says, ''OK, picture this. I''m naked inside this refrigerator. . .''

President George W. Bush was getting angry about the public opinion of his<br /> ability to govern, so he arranged a press conference to let the American public<br /> know what was on his mind.<br /> He started strongly, "The American People must know that I am wholly fit,<br /> capable, and prepared to serve this nation as commander-in-chief. And I say to<br /> those people who believe that I don''t have a mind of my own..." Bush said and<br /> froze. He looked over at Cheney and whispered, "Dick, what do I say to them<br /> again...?"
There''s a teacher in a small Texas town. She asks her class how many of them are Bush fans. Not really knowing what a Bush fan is, but wanting to be liked by the teacher, all the kids raise their hands except one boy, little Johnny. The teacher asks little Johnny why he has decided to be different. Johnny says, "I''m not a Bush fan." The teacher says, "Why aren''t you a Bush fan?" Johnny says, "Because I''m a Clinton fan." The teacher asks why he''s a Clinton fan. The boy says, "Well, my mom''s a Clinton fan and my dad''s a Clinton fan, so I''m a Clinton fan!" The teacher is kind of angry, because this is Texas, so she says, "What if you''re mom was a moron and you''re dad was an idiot, what would that make you?" Johnny says, "That would make me a Bush fan!"

He danced with joy and did a flip. </p>\n<p>As Jesus walked toward the Democrat, the Democrat jumped back and exclaimed, "Don''t touch me, I''m drawing disability!"

There are a lot of stupid people out there.

Little David was in his 5th grade class when the teacher asked the children what their fathers did for a living. All the typical answers came up -- fireman, policeman, salesman, doctor, lawyer, etc.</p>\n<p>David was being uncharacteristically quiet and so he teacher asked him about his father. "My father''s an exotic dancer in a gay cabaret and takes off all his clothes in front of other men. Sometimes, if the offer''s really good, he''ll go out to the alley with some guy and do nasty things with him for money."</p>\n<p>The teacher, obviously shaken by this statement, hurriedly set the other children to work on some exercises and took little David aside to ask him, "Is that really true about your father?" "No," said David, "He works for the Bush administration, but I was too embarrassed to say that in front of the other kids."
George W. Bush told Dick Cheney, "I really hate all the stupid jokes people<br /> make about me."<br /> Cheney reassured him by saying, "Jokes can''t hurt you. They are just made up<br /> by a bunch of stupid people. In fact, most humans are quite stupid. Here, I''ll<br /> show you what I mean." </p>\n<p>Cheney goes outside and hails a D.C. cab and says to the driver, "Please take<br /> me to 261 M street to see if I''m home," said Cheney. </p>\n<p>Without a word, the cabbie took them straight to M Street. Cheney then rang<br /> the doorbell, came back to the car and said, "Oh, I guess I''m not there! Take us<br /> back to where we started, please." </p>\n<p>The cabbie did what he was told without a word. Cheney leaned over and said to<br /> Dubya, "You get the idea?

White House staffers were perplexed one morning to see Bill Clinton walk<br /> into the Oval Office with a pair of woman''s panties pinned to his arm. Somewhat<br /> used to the president''s tendencies, they let it go and went about their daily<br /> tasks.<br />     As the day wore on, several VIPs were ushered in and out of the Oval<br /> Office for meetings with Clinton about important affairs of the state.  Each one<br /> left with a puzzled expression on his face, but no one dared ask the President''s<br /> personal business.<br />     Finally, Betty Currie, Clinton''s loyal secretary walked into the office<br /> between appointments and gently closed the door behind her.  "Mr. President,"<br /> she said.<br />     "We''ve come to expect many unusual things from you but we''re all quite<br /> concerned that you seem to be wearing a pair of woman''s panties on your arm.<br /> Please tell me this doesn''t mean more   ''trouble''."<br />     "Oh no," the President grinned, "it''s the patch.  I''m trying to quit."

Bush and Cheney are at a restaurant for lunch. The waitress comes over and<br /> asks what they will be having. Bush says, "I''ll have a quickie." The waitress<br /> steps back in disgust and say, "Mr. President, I thought that kind of piggish<br /> behavior went out with the last administration!" She storms off and Dubai looks<br /> confused. Cheney shakes his head at the president and says, "George, it''s<br /> pronounced QUICHE."

It is said about the US president that before 9-11 he thought that the Taliban<br /> was a Bavarian brass band. Now the president of the world''s most powerful nation<br /> has put his foot in his mouth yet again. It was Condoleezza Rice, his national<br /> security advisor who had to rescue the situation. When talking with Brazilian<br /> president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 71, Bush surprisingly asked: "Do you have<br /> Blacks too?" Ms. Rice noticed how stunned and surprised Cardoso looked and<br /> quickly told Bush that Brazil likely has more blacks than the US and that<br /> outside of Africa it was the place with the highest number of blacks. The<br /> Brazilian president remarked later that Bush was "still in a learning-phase"<br /> when it came to South America."
The following statement has been translated into Ebonics. Good evening. (Yo Yo<br /> Yo, s''up?). This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the<br /> Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury. (Today at my crib these<br /> suckers and playa-haters started grillin'' a brotha). I answered their questions<br /> truthfully, including question about my private life, questions no American<br /> citizen would ever want to answer. (Dey started frontin'' about my game and<br /> asking all kinds of fowl sh-t). Still, I must take complete responsibility for<br /> all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you<br /> tonight. (I''m tired of these haters throwing salt in my game. I''m going to let<br /> yall know my Mackin style tonight). As you know, in a deposition in January, I<br /> was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers<br /> were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. (Awhile back, you nosey<br /> motherfu-ers wanted to know if I was hittin'' hoe-ass Monica''s skins. You ain''t<br /> got any video, so if you want to believe a $10 hoe then oh well).<br /> Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Levwinsky that was not appropriate.<br /> In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a<br /> personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.<br /> (Yeah, I was hittin'' that dime dropping Bit-h! She was only sucking my jammie<br /> though. I was stupid for messing with a young big mouthed skank. My bad, but<br /> don''t hate me because I''m a playa). But I told the grand jury today and I say to<br /> you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence.<br /> (Outside of that hit I told punk-ass AG (Al Gore) to put on gay-ass Star, Monica<br /> and her snitching friend, I was chill the whole time).<br /> I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to<br /> protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. (Check dis, I heard she<br /> was down with what ever, you know a freak ass beiach. She wasn''t all that but I<br /> planned to pimp her around to my boyz in the Senate). The independent counsel<br /> investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life. And<br /> now the investigation itself is under investigation. (Those haters started<br /> sweatin'' my homeys and my peeps. Dey pissed a nugga off when they tried to make<br /> me look like I''m not real or somefin. Matter of fact dey shady asses is on the<br /> take anyway).<br /> This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people.<br /> (Tryin'' to hit me they wasted a lot of Cheddar and pissed off my Crew). Nothing<br /> is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim<br /> my family life for my family. It''s nobody''s business but ours. (I''m a pimp and<br /> playa and I''m going to be one, dey can�酶惟t change a nugga! Get some businesses.<br /> Hillary is chill because I got more than enough White Water dirt on her ass that<br /> will get her sent up before I''m outtied).<br /> It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into<br /> private life and get on with our national life. (Get off my jock because I''m<br /> going to flex regardless. Just in case yall forgot until you chumps ax me I''m<br /> still the sh-t!) Now it is time - in fact, it is past time - to move on. (F-k<br /> all yall, I don''t give an f-k! Peace out!!!)
Jon bought two horses, and could never remember which was which. A neighbor suggested that he cut the tail of one horse  and that worked great until the other horse got his tail caught in  a bush. It tore just right and looked exactly like the other  horse''s tail and our friend was stuck again.The neighbor suggested Jon notch the ear of one horse. That  worked fine until the other horse caught his ear on a barbed  wire fence. Once again our friend couldn''t tell them apart.The neighbor suggested he measure the horses for height.  When he did, he was very pleased to find that the white horse  was 2 inches taller than the black.

I have a moral question for you. This is an imaginary situation, but I think it is fun to decide what one would do.The situation: You are in the Midwest, and there is a huge flood in progress.

A new priest is being given instructions on what to do when he takes confession. The older priest tells the new man, for things like stealing, give 5 hail mary''s, and for sleeping with the neighbours, 10 hail mary''s.</p>\n<p>So the new priest is taking confession one day. The first man in tells the priest he slept with the woman next door. The priest tells him to do 10 hail mary''s and he''s on his way.</p>\n<p>The next man in, confesses to having a wank behind a bush. Somewhat puzzled, the priest steps out of the confessional box and asks two passing alter boys what the "old man" gives for a wank behind a bush.</p>\n<p>The two boys reply, "A can of Coke and a Mars Bar."
President Clinton finishes his time on earth and approaches the Pearly Gates<br /> of Heaven.</p>\n<p>"And who might you be?" inquires St. Peter.</p>\n<p>"It''s me, Bill Clinton, formerly the President of the United States and Leader<br /> of the Free World."</p>\n<p>"Oh... Mr. President! What may I do for you?" asks St. Peter.</p>\n<p>"I''d like to come in," replies Clinton.</p>\n<p>"Sure," says the Saint. "But first you have to confess your sins. What bad<br /> things have you done in your life?"</p>\n<p>Clinton bites his lip and answers, "Well, I tried marijuana, but you can''t<br /> call it ''dope-smoking'' because I didn''t inhale. There were inappropriate<br /> extramarital relationships, but you can''t call it ''adultery'' because I didn''t<br /> have full ''sexual relations.'' And I made some statements that were misleading,<br /> but legally accurate, but you can''t call it ''bearing false witness'' because, as<br /> far as I know, it didn''t meet the legal standard of perjury."</p>\n<p>With that St. Peter consults the Book of Life briefly, and declares, "OK,<br /> here�酶惟s the deal. We''ll send you somewhere hot, but we won''t call it ''Hell.<br /> You''ll be there indefinitely, but we won''t call it ''eternity.'' And when you<br /> enter, you don''t have to "abandon all hope"; just don''t hold your breath<br /> waiting for it to freeze over!
One day, two skunks were walking down the street.One was a momma skunk, and one was a baby skunk. Suddenly, a little baby duck was crying in some bushes. The momma skunk says to the baby duck," why are you crying." The baby duck says," my mommy never told me what I was before she died." The momma skunk said," well, you have flippers, and white fur, you must be a duck. Suddenly, a car passes by and kills the momma skunk. Then the baby skunk starts crying. The baby duck says," why are you crying,". The baby skunk says," my mommy never told me what I was before she died." The baby duck said," well, your black, your white, and you sure do stink, you must be Puertorican.
One day three midgets were sitting around the table drinking tea and having crumpets.<br /> The first midget says to the other two, "You know, I think I have the smallest hands in the world."

I think I''ll go with you and try to get into the record book, too!" </p>\n<p>The third midget joins in with, "I''m going too because I think I have the smallest penis in the world. Let''s go!" </p>\n<p>So the midgets set off to the offices of the Guiness Book of World Records. </p>\n<p>When they arrive, the first midget is called in and is gone for awile. Finally he comes out very excited. "I made it! They measured my hands, and sure enough they are the smallest in the world. I''m in the record book!!" </p>\n<p>The second midget is called in, and soon he comes out very excited. "I made it too! They measured my feet and sure enough, they are the smallest in the world. I''m in the record book, too!!" </p>\n<p>The third midget goes in, is gone a very long time, so long that his friends became concerned. Finally he appears with a rather forlorn look on his face. </p>\n<p>"What''s the matter?", his friends asked. </p>\n<p>The third midget responds with "Who the hell is Bill Clinton?!?!!" </p>\n<p>Note to this joke: You can insert anyone''s (male) name in place of Bill Clinton.

When he does so, she begins to gently caress his beard which is full and bushy. </p>\n<p>"Are you the manager?" she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands." </p>\n<p>"Actually, no" he replies. </p>\n<p>"Can you get him for me - I need to speak to him?" she asks, running her hands up beyond his beard and into his hair. </p>\n<p>"I''m afraid I can''t" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. "Is there anything I can do?" </p>\n<p>"Yes there is. I need you to give him a message" she continues huskily, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently. "Tell him" she says "that there is no toilet paper or hand soap in the ladies room."

Bill Clinton steps out onto the White House lawn in the dead of winter. Right<br /> in front of him, on the White House lawn, he sees "The President Must Go"<br /> written in urine across the snow. Well, old Bill is pretty ticked off. He storms<br /> into his security staff�酶惟s HQ, and yells "Somebody wrote a threat in the snow on<br /> the front damn lawn! And they wrote it in urine! Son-of-a-bitch had to be<br /> standing right on the porch when he did it! Where were you guys?" The security<br /> guys stay silent and stare ashamedly at the floor. Bill hollers "Well dammit,<br /> don�酶惟t just sit there! Get out and FIND OUT WHO DID IT! I want an answer, and I<br /> want it TONIGHT!" The entire staff immediately jumps up and races for the exits.<br /> Later that evening, his chief security officer approaches him and says, "Well<br /> Mr. President, we have some bad news and we have some really bad news. Which do<br /> you want first?" Clinton says "Oh hell, give me the bad news first." The officer<br /> says, "Well, we took a sample of the urine and tested it. The results just came<br /> back, and it was Al Gore�酶惟s urine." Clinton says "Oh my god, I feel so... so...<br /> betrayed! My own Vice President! Damn.... Well, what�酶惟s the really bad news?"

A group of Texans are driving down the road, whooping it up, drinking beer and shooting off their guns when they get into an accident with busload of nuns and orphans, killing everyone. The Texans go straight to Hell. When they arrive the Devil is shocked to see that they are not in agony over the heat and he demands an explanation. </p>\n<p>"Well, sir, we''re from Texas, and we''re used to the heat," says one. This infuriates the Devil and he cranks the thermostat up to its highest setting. The lost souls all over hell start wailing. "I''ll check on them in the morning and see how they like THIS." He snorts and disappears in a ball of fire.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the Devil shows up at the Texans'' camp site, and sure enough they are showing some signs of discomfort. They have taken off their 10 Gallon hats and are fanning themselves. One has even rolled up his sleeves. "Well, sir," explains a Texan, "when you have been on a cattle drive in Lubbock during August, this ain''t hardly nothing." The Devil is now so angry he is seeing red.</p>\n<p>"Those damn Texans seem immune to heat, let ''s see what happens when I turn OFF the heat," he says as he heads to the thermostat. "I''ll check on them tomorrow."</p>\n<p>So in the morning the Devil arrives at the Texans'' campsite, and they are all whoopin'' and hollerin'' and drinkin'' the beers from the ice chest in the back of the pick up, now that they have ice to chill them with. The wail of the lost souls is deafening but the Texans are partyin'' like there is no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>"I don''t get it," the Devil says, completely defeated. "I tried to roast you and it had no effect, and then I tried to freeze you and you are partying. You Texans are made of tough stuff. But why are you celebrating?"</p>\n<p>A Texan takes a swig from a Bud in a longneck and replies, "Look around! Hell is frozen over. That''s just gotta mean George Bush got re-elected."

The Brazilians were who crashed the planes..."</p>\n<p>Entonces, Bush no soporta y despotrica:</p>\n<p>"FUCKING BRAZILIANS! ATTACK THEM! DESTROY THEM! Launch missiles, nuclear bombs, biological weapons, anthrax, hepatitis, gonorrhea, whatever! Start with their principal cities! Destroy their Capital City! I need to know which city is their Capital! Ask him!"</p>\n<p>El int�酶惟rprete puso su mejor voz conciliadora y como si nada pasara, pregunt�酶惟:</p>\n<p>"Disculpen os senhores, pero por gentileza, podriam me decir cual es a sua capital?"</p>\n<p>Era la pregunta que el brasile�酶惟o estaba esperando:</p>\n<p>"Seguro, tudo mundo conhece a nossa capital e...

I walk into our room and surely enough, find her sprawled out nekkid alone on our bed.  Sure that the guy was in the house, I searched frantically to find him... Under the bed, in the closet... Finally I found him hanging from our ledge on our balcony.  Furious, I stepped on his hand and he went plummetting two stories down.  However, he landed in a bush and I wasn''t sure if he was dead yet.  So I lifted the refrigerator and tossed it onto him.  Later, I felt so guilty I committed suicide."</p>\n<p>"Wow," said St. Peter, "that''s a pretty fantastic story."</p>\n<p>So St. Peter calls in the second guy.</p>\n<p>He said, "One day, I was having an argument with my wife.  She gets so mad that she pushes me right out the window of our fourth-story apartment.  So, quickly I grabbed on a ledge of a balcony on the second floor.  Then, suddenly, some nutcase steps on my hand and I go plummeting to the ground.  Luckily I landed on a bush, but then the nutcase drops a fridge on me!"</p>\n<p>Then St. Peter called in the third guy.  He says, "Alright, picture this:  You''re nekkid, and in a refrigerator..."

Reasons Women Should Not Have Freedom of Speech...</p>\n<p>1. She doesn''t need to talk to get me a beer.</p>\n<p>2. If she''s in the kitchen like she should be, no one can hear her anyway.</p>\n<p>3. If she can talk, all she''ll do is complain.</p>\n<p>4. Because she won''t say "I will" instead of "I do."</p>\n<p>5. No man wants to hear "first down" during a basketball game.</p>\n<p>6. Because PMS is no excuse for whining.</p>\n<p>7. No man needs or wants to hear the word "period" unless it has to do with hockey.</p>\n<p>8. Women created tampon and yeast infection commercials during football.</p>\n<p>9. Affirmative action.</p>\n<p>10. When men whistle at them in the street, they should just shut up and obey.</p>\n<p>11. If my dick''s in her mouth, she can''t talk anyway.</p>\n<p>12. Oprah.</p>\n<p>13. Feminists.</p>\n<p>14. Because that stupid look on her face should not be accompanied by an equally stupid statement.</p>\n<p>15. The 2nd and 19th amendments.</p>\n<p>16. I don''t want to be made to lie and say "I love you" after sex.</p>\n<p>17. Highway fatalities would decrease by over 90%.</p>\n<p>18.

If she can''t talk, she can''t bitch when I forget important dates.</p>\n<p>45. There are no speaking parts in pornos anyway.</p>\n<p>46. When she talks she''s not drinking, it''s hard to get her drunk when she talking.</p>\n<p>47. Nothing should come out a woman''s mouth, SWALLOW BITCH!</p>\n<p>48. The Mute button only works on the TV.</p>\n<p>49. Whores get paid by the hour not by the word.</p>\n<p>50. Helen Keller was the ultimate woman.</p>\n<p>51. Equality is for math.</p>\n<p>52. The credit card bill speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>53. If it hurts, I don''t wanna hear it.</p>\n<p>54. Marcia Clark.</p>\n<p>55. Chick-flicks.</p>\n<p>56. You don''t see Victoria''s Secret models talking, do you?</p>\n<p>57. Janet, Mariah, and Whitney.</p>\n<p>58. Michael Jackson.</p>\n<p>59. Silence and sex make a great combination.</p>\n<p>60. N. O.

As the Democratic Party hones its campaign strategy for<br /> next year''s election, it might look to Austin, Texas, where<br /> Democrats are facing off against Republicans using a<br /> strategy experts have dubbed "running like hell."</p>\n<p>Fifty-three legislators from the Texas House of<br /> Representatives bolted for the Oklahoma state line to<br /> prevent a vote that would redraw voting districts to favor<br /> the Republican House Majority.</p>\n<p>Speaker of the house Tom Craddick broke the news,<br /> saying, "we have found 40-plus members located in Ardmore,<br /> Oklahoma, they are staying at the Holiday Inn, at the<br /> present time, five minutes ago they were having dinner at<br /> Denny''s, for those of you who might be interested in that."<br /> Divisions in the Democratic ranks appeared at Denny''s,<br /> where representatives were deadlocked over the issue of<br /> whether or not the "Moons Over My Hammy" is delicious. </p>\n<p>VIOLENT DRILL TEAM </p>\n<p>A nationwide bio-terrorism drill was kicked off in Seattle<br /> last week, as a mock explosion of a dirty bomb tested the<br /> preparedness of firefighters, police, and other emergency<br /> workers. </p>\n<p>The Seattle drill is said to have run smoothly until news<br /> of the wartime re-enactment reached a group of nearby Civil<br /> War buffs, who excitedly set up a basecamp and attempted to<br /> saw off victims'' legs. </p>\n<p>According to Seattle mayor Greg Nickels, such an event is<br /> crucial to national security because, quote, "homeland<br /> security really begins at home." Nickels is actually<br /> speaking literally. Homeland security really does begin at<br /> his home as Tom Ridge is crashing on his couch for a couple<br /> of days. </p>\n<p>BLAIRLY LEGAL </p>\n<p>The New York Times recently printed an exhaustive front-<br /> page story flagellating itself for the deceptions of a<br /> Times reporter, Jayson Blair, while also providing the<br /> first evidence we''ve seen in years that newspapers have any<br /> sense of shame. </p>\n<p>Blair was discovered to have falsified and plagiarized<br /> dozens of stories for the Times. One glaring example of<br /> Blair''s deception were his vivid bedside descriptions of<br /> wounded Marines at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. The<br /> hitch is, he was never there but interviewed them by phone.<br /> This fact should have been more apparent when he relied on<br /> one heavily sedated Marine''s description of the other as "a<br /> quiet purple centaur with TV coming from his mouth." </p>\n<p>Expense reports show Blair was at home in Brooklyn when he<br /> was supposed to be in Maryland covering the sniper story.<br /> One embarrassingly false report that made the front page of<br /> the Times was titled, "Boy, There Sure is a Lot of Sniping<br /> Going on Here Where I Am. Maryland That is... Where I Am at<br /> Presently. Dang. Look Around at Maryland."
Spokesman Shows Footage of President Tumbling from Bike</p>\n<p>In what some political insiders were calling an attempt to lower expectations in the days leading up to the first presidential debate, the White House today announced that President Bush has an I.Q. of 67.</p>\n<p>"The president is far, far less intelligent than is commonly thought," White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.  "Even the simplest tasks remain well beyond his reach."</p>\n<p>Reinforcing the impression that the president will be overmatched in Thursday''s debate with Sen. John Kerry, Mr. McClellan showed reporters never-before-seen footage of Mr. Bush oafishly tumbling from his mountain bike.</p>\n<p>"What a moron," Mr. McClellan said.</p>\n<p>The White House spokesman said that Mr. Bush cannot possibly be expected to do well in a debate with Sen. Kerry, who Mr. McClellan said "has an I.Q. of 193" and "is widely considered the best debater on the planet."</p>\n<p>But within minutes of the White House press conference, Kerry spokesman Joe Lockhart fired back, telling reporters, "John Kerry is much stupider than he looks."</p>\n<p>As evidence of Mr. Kerry''s idiocy, Mr. Lockhart referred to the floral-patterned windsurfing pants the senator wears while enjoying his favorite water sport.</p>\n<p>"His ass looks enormous in those pants," Mr. Lockhart said.  "What kind of a moron would leave the house with his ass looking like that?"</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said today that it was unfair to compare the upcoming Iraqi elections to those held in America, "except for Florida."

While visiting England, George W. Bush is invited to tea with the Queen. He<br /> asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround<br /> herself with intelligent people. He asks how she knows if they''re intelligent. </p>\n<p>"I do so by asking them the right questions," says the Queen. "Allow me to<br /> demonstrate." </p>\n<p>She phones Tony Blair and says, "Mr. Prime Minister. Please answer this<br /> question: Your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child<br /> is not your brother or sister. Who is it?" </p>\n<p>Tony Blair responds, "It''s me, ma''am." </p>\n<p>"Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir," says the Queen. She hangs up and says,<br /> "Did you get that, Mr. Bush?" </p>\n<p>"Yes ma''am. Thanks a lot. I''ll definitely be using that!" </p>\n<p>Upon returning to Washington, he decides he''d better put the Chairman of the<br /> Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the test. He summons Jesse Helms to the<br /> White House and says, "Senator Helms, I wonder if you can answer a question for<br /> me." </p>\n<p>"Why, of course, sir. What''s on your mind?" </p>\n<p>"Uh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is<br /> not your brother or your sister. Who is it?" </p>\n<p>Helms hems and haws and finally asks, "Can I think about it and get back to<br /> you?" Bush agrees, and Helms leaves. He immediately calls a meeting of other<br /> senior senators, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody<br /> can come up with an answer. Finally, in desperation, Helms calls Colin Powell at<br /> the State Department and explains his problem. </p>\n<p>"Now look here Colin Powell, your mother has a child, and your father has a<br /> child, and this child is not your brother, or your sister. Who is it?" Powell<br /> answers immediately, "It''s me, of course, you dumb ass." </p>\n<p>Much relieved, Helms rushes back to the White House and exclaims, "I know the<br /> answer, sir! I know who it is! It''s Colin Powell!" And Bush replies in disgust,<br /> "Wrong, you dumb ass, It''s Tony Blair!"

Two guys were on a long drive back from a fishing trip, when the<br /> blond guy turned to the other and said he needed to go to the<br /> bathroom. So they stopped the truck and he went behind the<br /> bushes. When he came back the other said, "That was fast."</p>\n<p>"Well I need to take a shit but I''ve got nothing to wipe my ass<br /> with."</p>\n<p>The other answers, "That''s easy just go on back, pull out a<br /> dollar, and wipe your ass with it."</p>\n<p>"O.K." he says as he goes back over to the bush.

Not only did I get<br /> shit all over me, I''ve got 4 quarters stuck up my ass!"
One night, a group of gay men were playing truth or dare.   One man is dared  to walk down to the mini market naked and buy condoms and candy.   The man  goes to the store and buys the condom and candy, barely able to stop thinking  about how he will use the condoms when he got back to the house, but on the  way back he sees three nuns approaching.   The man jumped into a bush, but he  fails to conceal his erection.   One of the nuns sees his penis, and says.    "oh, look! a slot machine. ill go first". so the nun yanks down on the mans  penis and waits to see if she one.   The man is pushed against a prickly  bush, and drops the condom.   "oh, look! i got a bendable thimble! now i  won''t poke myself when i sew." "oh, i wonder what i will get?" she pulls on  the "handle", and out falls the candy.   The third nun yanks on the handle,  hoping for something good, and shouts out: "i got hand lotion!"
Paul, a little boy was in church one Sunday with his mother, when he started<br /> feeling sick. "Mommy," he said, "can we leave now?"<br /> "No" the mother replied.<br /> "Well, I think I have to throw up!"<br /> "Then go out the front door and around to the back of the church and throw up<br /> behind a bush."<br /> After about sixty seconds, Paul returned to his seat.<br /> "Did you throw up?" Mom asked.<br /> "Yes."<br /> "How could you have gone all the way to the back of the church and returned so<br /> quickly?"<br /> "I didn''t have to go out of the church, Mommy. They have a box next<br /> to the front door that says, ''For the Sick''."

This is from a contest on Long Island. The requirements were to use the words<br /> Lewinski and Kaczynski in a limerick. Here are the 3 winners. Entry # 1 There<br /> once was a gal named Lewinsky Who played on a flute like Stravinsky ''Twas "Hail<br /> to the Chief" on this flute made of beef that stole the front page from<br /> Kaczynski. Entry # 2 Said Bill Clinton to young Ms. Lewinsky We don''t want to<br /> leave clues like Kaczynski, Since you look such a mess, use the hem of your<br /> dress And wipe that stuff off of your chinsky. Entry # 3 Lewinsky and Clinton<br /> have shown what Kaczynski must surely have known: that an intern is better than<br /> a bomb in a letter given the choice of how to be blown.

Last winter, George W. Bush wanted to go ice fishing, so after gathering up<br /> all of the equipment, he headed toward the nearest frozen lake.  After getting<br /> comfy on his stool, he started to cut a circular hole in the ice.<br /> Then from the heavens, a voice boomed, ''''THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.''''<br /> Startled, George moved further down the ice, poured a thermos of hot chocolate<br /> and started to cut yet another hole in the ice.<br /> The voice boomed, ''''THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.''''<br /> This time, he was quite scared, so George moved to the far end of the ice and<br /> started another hole.<br /> Once again the voice said, ''''THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE.''''<br /> The very scared, very shook up, "leader of the free world" raised his head and<br /> trembled, ''''Is that you, Lord?''''<br /> The voice answered, ''''NO.  IT IS THE MANAGER OF THE ICE RINK.''''

A few years ago, I applied for a job at Kodak.  I made it through all the interviews with flying colours, and the only thing left was the drug test.  I was confident in passing, but there was one slight problem: I have *very* shy kidneys.  I''ve had to sneak out of the doctor''s office on more than one occasion, because I can''t "go" and fill up a cup on command.  Usually, this is a good thing, as I can go to a concert or football game, drink beer all day, and be fine until I get home, while my friends are standing in line in the bathrooms several times during the same time period.So, to prepare, on the morning I had to take the test, I drank my usual 10-cup pot of coffee, and several large glasses of water, and for the 20-minute trip to Kodak, I filled a plastic gallon jug with water, and finished it off on the way.   Now, Kodak has huge parking lots, each containg hundreds and hundreds of cars, and by the time I got there, the visitor''s lots were pretty full, and I had to park way in the back.As soon as I got out of my car, I''m thinking, "Good, it worked, I think I can go!"  By the time I''d finished the 10-minute walk to the entrance, I was thinking, "Boy, no problems now, I can *definitely* go!"To get in, I had to go past a security hut.  I told them why I was there, and they told me where to report, about another 10-minute walk, a little ways into the plant.  I had to pass building after building before I got to the right one, every step of the way, becoming actually painful, and before I was there, I was looking at bushes and doorways and the like, thinking, "Well, if it gets too bad, I could go there, or maybe there, or..."By the time I got to the right building, I was just about in agony. I found the right area, and the receptionist told me to take a seat with about 8 other people.  I sat down, thinking that would help, but 10 seconds later I was up, walking around, trying to read stuff on the wall, anything to keep my mind occuppied, but managing to read 5 or 10 words, and then having to pace again.Finally, I couldn''t take it anymore, and after having asked the girl a couple of times how long, I told her, "look, either you get me in *now*, or I use the bathroom over there, and we reschedule!!" She said she''d see what she could do, and left.  I went back to sit down, and it took all of 5 seconds before I was up pacing again. She came back a few minutes later, and told me to go on in.When I got to the actual room, there were 4 people standing in line.  I hopped up and down a couple of times, before I passed the others, went to the nurses, and told them I have to go **NOW**!!! They asked the others in line if anyone objected, and they said no, so they said as soon as one of the 2 bathrooms come free, I could go.  I snatched the cup out of his hand, and practically raced down the aisle to the bathrooms and just stood waiting.  It couldn''t have been more than 20 seconds or so, but they were some of the most agonizing seconds of my life!!Finally, one of the doors opened, and I nearly flattened some poor girl coming out in my rush to get in.  I closed the door, grabbed my pants, breathed in, and dropped them and then my underwear, and then the world caved in...  I started going.  And going.  And going. I could have knocked down the Berlin wall with the force!   But the problem was, that I couldn''t "grab" it!!  It was whipping around like one of those Water Wiggle things.  I''m trying like heck to reign it it in, but just couldn''t.  I''m dancing around in a circle, with my pants around my ankles, trying to grab it, and it was just about impossible for probably a good 15 seconds.  Finally, I did, and was able to aim in the toilet, just remembering at the end to put a shot or two in the cup to put on the little shelf.   By the time I''d stopped, I was physically spent, and just leaned up against the wall, feeling like I''d just run a marathon...It was then that was able to survey the bathroom.  It was a room, about 7x7, but my god...  I had finished the most intense pee of my life in the john, but before I''d gained control, I''d soaked the entire toilet, the sink, the floor, the walls.  You name it, it was drenched -- including my pants and underwear.  I tried soaking it up with toilet paper (using the whole roll as a sponge), but that was drenched and didn''t work that well.  I''d also soaked the extra rolls on the back of the toilet, the paper towel holder, and the extra roll of paper towels.  I went through the garbage, pulling out half-soaked old towels, just trying to make the place semi-presentable, as in the sink and the mirror, but it didn''t do much good.  I was just ending up pushing the wet around, so I finally gave up.Steeling myself, I pulled up my wet underwear, then my wet pants, and pulled down my semi-wet shirt as much as possible, and went out. I whipped back up the aisle, thanking the nurse, without slowing down, and out the door as fast as my legs would carry me, imagining what the next person to use that bathroom would encounter. The silver lining:  I got the job!!

One night, at the lodge of a hunting club, two new members were being<br /> introduced to other members and shown around. The man leading them around<br /> said, "See that old man asleep in the chair by the fireplace? He is our<br /> oldest member and can tell you some hunting stories you''ll never forget."<br /> They awakened the old man and asked him to tell them a hunting story.<br /> "Well, I remember back in 1944, we went on a lion hunting expedition in<br /> Africa. We were on foot and hunted for three days without seeing a thing.<br /> On the fourth day, I was so tired I had to rest my feet. I found a fallen<br /> tree, so I laid my gun down, propped my head on the tree, and fell asleep.<br /> I don''t know how long I was asleep when I was awakened by a noise in the<br /> bushes. I was reaching for my gun when the biggest lion I ever saw jumped<br /> out of the bushes at me like this, ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!! I<br /> tell you, I just shit in my pants." The young men looked astonished and<br /> one of them said, "I don''t blame you, I would have shit my pants too if a<br /> lion jumped out at me." The old man shook his head and said, "No, no, not<br /> then, just now when I said ROOOAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!

Here''s something everyone should probably know:<br /> You may remember that on July 2, 1947, witnesses claim a spaceship with four<br /> aliens aboard crashed on a sheep-and-cattle ranch outside Roswell, New Mexico.<br /> This is an incident, of course, that many say has been covered up by the<br /> government.<br /> However, you may not know that on March 31,1948, exactly nine months after<br /> that day, Al Gore was born.<br /> Now, that clears up a lot of things.
One day George W. Bush, Al Gore, and Bill Clinton were in a boat. All of a<br /> sudden the boat sprung a leak and they had only one life jacket.

An atheist was walking through the woods one day in Alaska, admiring<br /> all that evolution had created. "What majestic trees! What a powerful<br /> river! What beautiful animals!" he said to himself. As he was<br /> walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind<br /> him. Turning to look, he saw a 13-foot Kodiak brown bear beginning<br /> to charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could down the path. He<br /> looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was rapidly closing<br /> on him. Somehow, he ran even faster, so scared that tears came to his<br /> eyes. He looked again and the bear was even closer. His heart pounding<br /> in his chest, he tried to run faster yet. But alas, he tripped and<br /> fell to the ground. As he rolled over to pick himself up, the bear was<br /> right over him, reaching for him with its left paw and raising its<br /> right paw to strike him.</p>\n<p>"OH MY GOD! ..."</p>\n<p>Time stopped.</p>\n<p>The bear froze.</p>\n<p>The forest was silent.</p>\n<p>Even the river stopped moving ...</p>\n<p>As a brilliant light shone upon the man; a thunderous voice came from<br /> all around...</p>\n<p>"YOU DENY MY EXISTENCE FOR ALL THESE YEARS, TEACH OTHERS THAT I DON''T<br /> EXIST AND EVEN CREDIT CREATION TO SOME COSMIC ACCIDENT. DO YOU EXPECT<br /> ME TO HELP YOU OUT OF THIS PREDICAMENT? AM I TO COUNT YOU AS A<br /> BELIEVER?"</p>\n<p>Difficult as it was, the atheist looked directly into the light and<br /> said, "It would be hypocritical to ask to be a Christian after all<br /> these years, but perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?"</p>\n<p>"VERY WELL." Said God.</p>\n<p>The light went out.</p>\n<p>The river ran.</p>\n<p>The sounds of the forest resumed.</p>\n<p>... And the bear dropped down on his knees, brought both paws<br /> together, bowed his head and spoke: "Lord, thank you for this food<br /> which I am about to receive."

With the upcoming 2000 elections there has been a lot of confusion over the<br /> players crucial to the next election. So I''ve found a way to simplify this topic<br /> very well. </p>\n<p>This is all the Wizard of Oz. Dan Quayle is the scarecrow who needs a brain.<br /> Al Gore is the tinman. Colin Powell is the cowardly lion who never manages to<br /> run for office. Elizabeth Dole is Dorothy who doesn''t know where she is and not<br /> quite sure where she''s going. </p>\n<p>And of course we have to mention Clinton because he''s a factor while all this<br /> is going on. Clinton is of course Toto, because throughout all this he''s trying<br /> to get up into Dorothy''s skirt.

Bush and Cheney went hunting, killed a giant buck, and were dragging it by the legs back to their car, when they were approached by a seasoned old hunter."Hello, Mr. President, and Vice President.  If I may please make a suggestion... it would be much easier for you to drag your deer in the other direction.   Then the antlers won''t dig into the ground." The leaders of the free world thanked the man and tried his suggesion.  A while later Cheney said, "You know, that was good thinking. This is a lot easier!""Yessir," agreed Bush."But durn it!

One day they are walking together past the White House when they hear the voice of a man crying out, "Help, Help." </p>\n<p>Quickly, they respond to the call by leaping over the White House fence, and by following the cries, they eventually come upon Bill Clinton, drowning in the White House swimming pool. In an heroic rush, they pull him from the pool, then give him artificial respiration, clearly saving his life. </p>\n<p>After a few minutes, Clinton says to them, "Well, boys, today you saved my life! And I am willing to give each of you any wish you desire, as long as it is within my power as President!" </p>\n<p>The first fellow thinks for a few seconds then says, "I have always wanted to go to West Point. Can you get me an appointment?" </p>\n<p>"You bet!" said the President, "I''ll sign the papers this afternoon!" </p>\n<p>Then the second fellow said, "I''ve always wanted to go to Annapolis. Can you get me in?" </p>\n<p>"You bet I can," said the President. "I''ll sign the papers for it this afternoon, too." </p>\n<p>After a few moments more, the third fellow said, "I''d like to know, can you get me buried in Arlington National Cemetery?" </p>\n<p>Clinton, a bit startled, thought for a second or two, then said, "Sure, but tell me, aren''t you awfully young to be thinking about such things?" </p>\n<p>"Nope," replied the remaining fellow. "Because when I get home and tell my old man what I did today, he''s going to kill me!"

Today''s headline read: "Clinton Probe Expands".</p>\n<p> It turned out to be a direct quote attributed to Monica Lewinsky.
A young nun joined a church to serve God. She was very religious<br /> and very good. It all happened one day, she suddenly had this<br /> desire to have sex. She knew it''s wrong but she couldn''t help<br /> it. Confused, she consulted with an elder nun for solution.</p>\n<p>The old nun handed her a gun and said, "My young one, in this<br /> sort of situation, you can go somewhere, where nobody can find<br /> you, and fire a blank shot from the gun. It''ll ease your desire."</p>\n<p>The Young Nun didn''t believe it, but she thought, what could be<br /> worse? So she found herself a place and shot the gun.<br /> Mysteriously, the desire had vanished. The young nun thanked the<br /> Old nun.</p>\n<p>Days after days, week after weeks, the desire started to grow<br /> stronger and stronger. The young nun started to fire the gun<br /> more and more. She couldn''t help it. Disturbed, she wondered why<br /> the old nun seemed to have no sexual desire or whatsoever. She<br /> decided to investigate.</p>\n<p>One afternoon after lunch, the young nun followed the old nun<br /> until she went back to her room. After hours of waiting, the old<br /> nun came out with a huge backpack, sneaking out the church. The<br /> curious young nun followed her.</p>\n<p>The old nun stopped at the tip of the hill behind the church.<br /> The young nun hid behind a bush and observed. To her horror, the<br /> old nun grabbed two assault rifles from the pack, and started<br /> firing, with a grenade launcher ready at hand.

You really have tons of confidence in your inner beauty."</p>\n<p>12&gt; "You really make me feel intelligent -- especially when you talk."</p>\n<p>11&gt; "Look at how much weight you''ve lost!  That dress didn''t fit you nearly as well at that last wedding you wore it to."</p>\n<p>10&gt; "Not only do you dance surprisingly well, you *smell* better than most ugly chicks."</p>\n<p>9&gt; "Great sermon, Father!  That loud part at the end was a real wake-up call!"</p>\n<p>8&gt; "Wow!  For a first-time sexual encounter, that was refreshingly speedy!"</p>\n<p>7&gt; "Now, now, it''s just as important to stay behind and guard the women and children."</p>\n<p>6&gt; "It''s nice that you can wear tight jeans without that unsightly bulge in the crotch that most men have."</p>\n<p>5&gt; "I''ve never seen a man chug so many chardonnays."</p>\n<p>4&gt; "No, really -- compared to Grenada, Afghanistan and Somalia, you Iraqi Army guys kick *ass.*"</p>\n<p>3&gt; "What I like about your toupee is it says, ''Hey, I have better things to spend my money on!''"</p>\n<p>2&gt; "You have 10 cats?!?  Wow, it only smells like three or four."</p>\n<p>1&gt; "Okay, let''s try it.

There''s a man named Ralph that goes into a bar, looking very depressed.  A<br /> friend approaches him and asks, ``Why the long face, Ralph?''''</p>\n<p>``Oh, I''m just bored.  I know every person in the entire world now, and<br /> there''s just nothing left to challange me.''''</p>\n<p>His friend says, ``No, you can''t know everyone.  Do you know Frank Sinatra?''''</p>\n<p>He says, ``Sure, Frank''s an old friend of mine.  Here, I''ll show you.''''  He<br /> goes over to a phone, dials a number.  His friend overhears, ``Hey Ralph,<br /> how ya doing?''''</p>\n<p>He talks for a while, but when Ralph hangs up, his friend is not really sure<br /> that it was Frank Sinatra on the other end of the line, so he asks him if he<br /> knows Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p>Ralph says, ``Sure, me and Billy go way back.''''  This time he lets him<br /> listen in as he calls a private number.  It sounds like Bill on the other<br /> end of the line, and they go into a big discussion of the current economic<br /> scene, and Ralph offers a few suggestions.  Drawing the converstation to a<br /> close, Ralph wishes him well and hangs up.</p>\n<p>His friend is a little dumbfounded at this point.  ``Well, there must be<br /> someone that you don''t know.''''  He goes over a few more people in his mind,<br /> and thinks, ``He can''t possibly know the Pope.  After all, he''s a<br /> Protestant.  But Ralph claims to know him, so to convince himself otherwise,<br /> his friend desides to fly both himself and Ralph to the Vatican to get<br /> positive proof of Ralph''s conviction.  </p>\n<p>So they arrive at the Vatican, and Ralph suggests that his friend wait out<br /> in the Papal square until Ralph has cleared things with the Pope.  He''s<br /> standing in the courtyard, when who walks out onto the balcony of the<br /> private residence, arm in arm with the Pope, but Ralph.</p>\n<p>Ralph looks down, sees that his friend has apparently passed out, and runs<br /> down to see what can be done for him.  ``What happened to you?  Couldn''t you<br /> accept the fact that I really do know the Pope?''''</p>\n<p>``No, I''d begun to accept that possibility.  But what really took my breath<br /> away was some stranger standing next to me who said, `Who''s that guy<br /> standing there with Ralph?'' ''''
