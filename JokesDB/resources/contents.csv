"<p>A very successful businessman had a meeting with his new son-in-law. ""I<br /> love my daughter, and now I welcome you into the family,"" said the man. ""To<br /> show you how much we care for you, I'm making you a 50-50 partner in my<br /> business.  All you have to do is go to the factory every day and learn the<br /> operations.""</p>
<p>The son-in-law interrupted.  ""I hate factories. I can't stand the noise.""</p>
<p>""I see,"" replied the father-in-law.  ""Well, then you'll work in the office<br /> and take charge of some of the operations.""</p>
<p>""I hate office work,"" said the son-on-law.  ""I can't stand being stuck<br /> behind a desk all day.""</p>
<p>""Wait a minute,"" said the father-in-law.  ""I just make you half-owner of a<br /> money making organization, but you don't like factories and won't work in<br /> an office.  What am I going to do with you?""</p>
<p>""Easy,"" said the young man.  ""Buy me out.""</p>

"<p>A company, feeling it was time for a shake-up, hires a new CEO.<br /> This new boss is determined to rid the company of all slackers. </p>
<p>On a tour of the facilities, the CEO notices a guy leaning on a wall.<br /> The room is full of workers and he thinks this is his chance to show everyone<br /> he means business! </p>
<p>The CEO, walks up the guy and asks - ""and how much money do you make a week?"" </p>
<p>Undaunted, the young fellow looks at him and replies, ""I make $200.00 a<br /> week. Why?"" </p>
<p>The CEO then hands the guy $200 in cash and screams - ""here's a week's pay,<br /> now GET OUT and don't come back!"" </p>
<p>Feeling pretty good about his first firing, the CEO looks around the room and<br /> asks - ""does anyone want to tell me what that slacker did here?"" </p>
<p>With a sheepish grin, one of the other workers mutters -<br /> ""Pizza delivery guy"".</p>

"<p>""Hello. Tech Support; may I help you?""<br /> ""Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect."" </p>
<p>""What sort of trouble?""<br /> ""Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away.""</p>
<p>""Went away?""<br /> ""They disappeared.""</p>
<p>""Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?""<br /> ""Nothing.""</p>
<p>""Nothing?""<br /> ""It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type.""</p>
<p>""Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?""<br /> ""How do I tell?""</p>
<p>[Uh-oh. Well, let's give it a try anyway.]<br /> ""Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?""<br /> ""What's a sea-prompt?""</p>
<p>[Uh-huh, thought so. Let's try a different tack.]<br /> ""Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?""<br /> ""There isn't any cursor: I told you, it won't accept anything I type.""</p>
<p>[Ah--at least s/he knows what a cursor is. Sounds like a hardware problem. I wonder if s/he's kicked out his/her monitor's power plug?]</p>
<p>""Does your monitor have a power indicator?""<br /> ""What's a monitor?""</p>
<p>""It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on?""<br /> ""I don't know.""</p>
<p>""Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?""<br /> [sound of rustling and jostling] [muffled] ""Yes, I think so.""</p>
<p>""Great! Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into the wall.""<br /> [pause] ""Yes, it is.""</p>
<p>[Hmm. Well, that's interesting. I doubt s/he would have accidentally turned it off, and I don't want to send him/her hunting for the power switch because I don't know what kind of monitor s/he has and it's bound to have more than one switch on it. Maybe the video cable is loose or something.] ""When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?""</p>
<p>""No.""</p>
<p>""Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable.""<br /> [muffled] ""Okay, here it is.""</p>
<p>""Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely into the back of your computer.""<br /> [still muffled] ""I can't reach.""</p>
<p>""Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?""<br /> [clear again] ""No.""</p>
<p>""Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?""<br /> ""Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle--it's because it's dark.""</p>
<p>""Dark?""<br /> ""Yes--the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window.""</p>
<p>""Well, turn on the office light then.""<br /> ""I can't.""</p>
<p>""No? Why not?""<br /> ""Because there's a power outage.""</p>
<p>""A power--!?!"" ...[AAAAAAARGH!]""A power outage? Aha! Okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?""<br /> ""Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.""</p>
<p>""Good! Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.""</p>
<p>""Really? Is it that bad?""<br /> ""Yes, I'm afraid it is.""</p>
<p>""Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?""</p>
<p>""Tell them you're TOO STUPID TO OWN A COMPUTER!""</p>

"<p>A small bottle containing urine sat upon the desk of Sir William Osler, the<br /> eminent professor of medicine at Oxford University. Sitting before him was a<br /> class full of young, wide-eyed medical students, listening to his lecture on the<br /> importance of observing details. To emphasise his point, Sir Osler announced,<br /> ""This bottle contains a sample for analysis. It's often possible by tasting it<br /> to determine the disease from which the patient suffers.""<br /> He then dipped a finger into the fluid and brought it into his mouth. He<br /> continued speaking, ""Now I am going to pass the bottle around. Each of you<br /> please do exactly as I did. Perhaps we can learn the importance of this<br /> techinque and diagnose the case.""</p>
<p>The bottle madeit's way from row to row, each student gingerly poking his<br /> finger in and bravely sampling the contents with a frown.</p>
<p>Dr. Osler then retrieved the bottle and startled his students by saying,<br /> ""Gentlemen, now you will understand what I mean when I speak about details. Had<br /> you been observant, you would have seen that I put my INDEX FINGER in the bottle<br /> but my MIDDLE FINGER into my mouth!""</p>

"<p>A wealthy playboy met a beautiful young girl in an exclusive lounge. He took her to his lavish apartment where he soon discovered she was not a tramp, but was well groomed and apparently very intelligent. Hoping to get her into bed; he began showing her his collection of expensive paintings, first editions by famous authors and offered her a glass of wine. </p>
<p>He asked whether she preferred Port or Sherry and she said, ""Oh, Sherry by all means. To me it's the nectar of the gods. Just looking at it in a crystal-clear decanter fills me with a glorious sense of anticipation. When the stopper is removed and the gorgeous liquid is poured into my glass, I inhale the enchanting aroma and I'm lifted on the wings of ecstasy. It seems as though I'm about to drink a magic potion and my whole being begins to glow. The sound of a thousand violins being softly played fills my ears and I'm transported into another world. On the other hand, Port makes me fart.""</p>

"<p>There was this 8 year old kid who lived with his 82 year old grandma. He had been living with her for some time, and he thought, that with all the work she does, he could at least make her a cup of coffee in the morning.  </p>
<p>So he woke up early one day, and made a cup of coffee and brought it to his grandma. She took one drink of it and died instantly. He called 911, and the paramedics rushed over there.  </p>
<p>While examining the grandma, one of the paramedics pulls out a little plastic green soldier from her throat. After the paramedic learns that the kid made her coffee and put that soldier in there, of course, the first question is ""why"". The kid answered, ""Grandma always said, 'The best part of waking up is soldiers in your cup'!""</p>

"<p>This chain letter was started in hopes of bringing relief to other tired and discouraged men. Unlike most chain letters, this one does not cost anything.<br /> Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are equally tired and discontented. Then bundle up your wife or girlfriend and send her to the man whose name appears at the top of the following list and add your name to the bottom of the list. </p>
<p>When your turn comes, you will receive 15,625 women. One of them is bound to be better than the one you already have. At the writing of this letter, a friend of mine had already received 184 women, of whom 4 were worth keeping. </p>

<li>Unroll a 50 metre roll of duct tape check whether it really is 50 metre. Then find you can't roll it all back because it's stuck on the floor. When a member of staff asks what you are doing tell them you've covered up a large crack in their floor and they ""really ought to take more care of their building"".</li>
<li>Ask for the bits from the middle of your washers so that you can use them for Tiddlywinks.</li>

<li>Go to the Customer Service desk and ask how to connect the plumb line you've just bought to your washing machine.</li>
<li>Take some planks of wood into the store and ask to try their best orbital sander. Afterwards ask them where they keep the wood varnish... you'd like to try that as well.</li>
<li>Order 90 metres of nylon cable with a strain rating of 6 Kg. Once they've measured and cut it produce a piece of paper from your pocket, stare at it and turn it upside down. Apologise and say that you really wanted 9 metres of nylon cable with a strain rating of 60 Kg.</li>
<li>Complain that none of the taps work in the model bathroom. Threaten to sue them on health grounds because they've also forgotten to provide soap or towels.</li>
<li>Try to hold up the cashier with a glue gun. Shout ""Stick 'em up!"" and start sniggering. When the cops come say ""It was only a joke. Geddit? Glue. Stick 'em up. Joke."" Keep protesting your innocence and sue them for not having a sense of humour.</li>
<li>Take a section of bright yellow carpet into the paint department and get people's opinion of which paint matches it best. Then produce some bright yellow curtain material and ask whether the paint still matches. Next get some bright pink cloth (""the color of my sofa"") and ask which paint goes best with all three. You can then produce another patch of material from your cushions, rugs, light-shades...</li>
<li>Join the longest checkout queue when ready to pay for your goods. Then move to the back of another long queue when just about to be served. Start complaining about the slow service - but keep moving to the back of another long queue when just about to be served. Eventually the manager will come out and take you to the front of a queue - just to get rid of you. When this happens turn round and grin at everybody else who you've just jumped in front of.</li>

<li>Go to the Customer Service desk with a tin of paint (for example ""Egg-shell blue"", ""Buttermilk white"" or ""Jasmine yellow"") and ask whether they've got the same color but with a different name; the color's just right but there's no way you're going to paint your wall with something called *that*.</li>
<li>Borrow a volt meter from the electrical section, undo all packs of batteries and test them to find the freshest ones. Then decide to buy rechargeables instead.</li>

Repeat the whole process yet again then remember you wanted the special ""reflector"" spotlight ones.

<p>""One day,"" he begins, ""I was hunting when I got lost in the woods. I heard someone crying for help and finally realized that it was coming from a frog sitting next to a stream. So I picked up the frog and it said, ""Kiss me. Kiss me and I will turn into a genie and grant you 3 wishes"". </p>
<p>So I looked around to make sure I was alone and gave the frog a kiss. </p>
<p>POOF! </p>

<p>I looked hungrily at her beautiful body and replied, ""I want to make sensuous love with you here by this stream."" </p>
<p>She nodded, laid down, and beckoned to me. We then made love for hours! Later, as we lay there next to each other, sweating from our glorious lovemaking, she whispered into my ear, ""You know, you do have one more wish. What will it be?"" </p>

"<p>She spent the first day packing her belongings into boxes, crates and suitcases. </p>
<p>On the second day, she had the movers come and collect her things. </p>
<p>On the third day, she sat down for the last time at their beautiful dining room table by candlelight, put on some soft background music and feasted on a pound of shrimp, a jar of caviar and a bottle of Chardonnay.. </p>
<p>When she had finished, she went into each and every room and deposited a few half-eaten shrimp shells dipped in caviar, into the hollow of the curtain rods. She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. </p>
<p>When the husband returned with his new girlfriend, all was bliss for the first few days. Then slowly, the house began to smell. They tried everything; cleaning, mopping and airing the place out. Vents were checked for dead rodents and carpets were steam cleaned. Air fresheners were hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in to set off gas canisters, during which they had to move out for a few days, and in the end they even paid to replace the expensive wool carpeting. </p>
<p>Nothing worked. People stopped coming over to visit. Repairmen refused to work in the house. The maid quit. </p>
<p>Finally, they could not take the stench any longer and decided to move.  A month later, even though they had cut their price in half, they could not find a buyer for their stinky house. Word got out and eventually even the local realtors refused to return their calls. Finally, they had to borrow a huge sum of money from the bank to purchase a new place. </p>
<p>The ex-wife called the man and asked how things were going. He told her the saga of the rotting house. She listened politely and said that she missed her old home terribly, and would be ! willing to reduce her divorce settlement in exchange for getting the house back. Knowing his ex-wife had no idea how bad the smell was, he agreed on price that was about 1/10th of what the house had been worth, but only if she were to sign the papers that very day. She agreed and within the hour his lawyers delivered the paperwork. </p>
<p>A week later the man and his girlfriend stood smiling as they watched the moving company pack everything to take to their new home, including the curtain rods.</p>

"<p>I never have quite figured out why the sexual urges of men &amp; women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Mars &amp; Venus thing. And, I never have figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart. And, I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene gets thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words ""I do"".</p>
<p>One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""</p>
<p>I said, ""WHAT??"" So she says the words that I and every husband on the planet dreads. She explains that I must not be in tune with her emotional needs as a Woman. I'm thinking, ""What was her first clue?""</p>
<p>I finally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to bed. The very next day we went shopping at a big unnamed department store... I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them.</p>
<p>She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say OK. And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond earrings. Let me tell you ...she was so excited. She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don't think she cared. I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she doesn't even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK.</p>
<p>She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have seen her face when she said, ""I'm ready to go, let's go to the cash register.""</p>
<p>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No, honey. I don't feel like buying all this stuff now."" You should have seen her face ... it went completely blank. I then said, ""Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.""</p>
<p>And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a Man.""</p>
<p>I figure that I should be having sex again sometime during the Spring thaw.</p>

Although he   didn't ask for them, Wife1.0 came with plug-ins such as MotherInLaw   and BrotherInLaw.   Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend4.0...    - A 'Don't remind me again' button    - Minimize button    - Shutdown feature    - An installshield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be completely      uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache and other      objects)    - 'Abort' button     I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still    installed, they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted.

"<p>As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research help from that renowned scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990) - I am pleased to present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus.</p>
<p>1. No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen.</p>
<p>2. There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since Santa doesn't (appear to) handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one good child in each.</p>
<p>3. Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purpose of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household, a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and so forth. This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.</p>
<p>4. The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized Lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that ""flying reindeer"" (see point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>5. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft reentering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.</p>
<p>In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now!</p>

<p>If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough however to spread paint on all four walls of 20 by 20 foot room.</p>
<p>You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. And the glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a<br /> baseball hit by a ceiling fan.</p>
<p>Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four year old.</p>
<p>VCR's do not eject peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, even though TV commercials show they do.</p>

"<p>To the citizens of the United States of America: </p>
<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. </p>
<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. </p>
<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: </p>
<p>1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up ""aluminium"" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. </p>
<p>Look up ""vocabulary"". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"". </p>
<p>2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. </p>
<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. </p>
<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. </p>
<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through. </p>
<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. </p>
<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. </p>
<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for ""shit"" </p>
<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day. </p>
<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. </p>
<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy. </p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

"<p>As I let go of my feelings of guilt, I can get in touch with my Inner<br /> Sociopath.</p>
<p>I have the power to channel my imagination into ever-soaring levels of<br /> suspicion and paranoia.</p>
<p>I assume full responsibility for my actions, except the ones that are<br /> someone else's fault.</p>
<p>I no longer need to punish, deceive or compromise myself. Unless, of<br /> course, I want to stay employed.</p>
<p>In some cultures what I do would be considered normal.</p>
<p>Having control over myself is nearly as good as having control over others.</p>
<p>My intuition nearly makes up for my lack of good judgment.</p>
<p>I honor my personality flaws, for without them I would have no personality<br /> at all.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc heard voices too.</p>
<p>I am grateful that I am not as judgmental as all those censorious,<br /> self-righteous people around me.</p>
<p>I need not suffer in silence while I can still moan, whimper and complain.</p>
<p>As I learn the innermost secrets of the people around me, they reward me<br /> in many ways to keep me quiet.</p>
<p>When someone hurts me, forgiveness is cheaper than a lawsuit. But not<br /> nearly as gratifying.</p>
<p>The first step is to say nice things about myself. The second, to do nice<br /> things for myself. The third, to find someone to buy me nice things.</p>
<p>As I learn to trust the universe, I no longer need to carry a gun.</p>
<p>All of me is beautiful and valuable, even the ugly, stupid, and disgusting<br /> parts.</p>
<p>I am at one with my duality.</p>
<p>Blessed are the flexible, for they can tie themselves into knots.</p>
<p>I will strive to live each day as if it were my 40th birthday.</p>
<p>Only a lack of imagination saves me from immobilizing myself with<br /> imaginary fears.</p>
<p>I honor and express all facets of my being, regardless of state and local<br /> laws.</p>
<p>Today I will gladly share my experience and advice, for there are no<br /> sweeter words than ""I told you so.""</p>
<p>False hope is nicer than no hope at all.</p>
<p>A good scapegoat is nearly as welcome as a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Just for today, I will not sit in my living room all day watching TV.<br /> Instead I will move my TV into the bedroom.</p>
<p>Who can I blame for my own problems? Give me just a minute... I'll find<br /> someone.</p>
<p>Why should I waste my time reliving the past when I can spend it worrying<br /> about the future?</p>
<p>The complete lack of evidence is the surest sign that the conspiracy is<br /> working.</p>
<p>I am learning that criticism is not nearly as effective as sabotage. </p>
<p>Becoming aware of my character defects leads me to the next step --<br /> blaming my parents.</p>
<p>To have a successful relationship I must learn to make it look like I'm<br /> giving as much as I'm getting.</p>
<p>I am willing to make the mistakes if someone else is willing to learn from<br /> them.</p>

I am an<br /> expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.<br /> Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once<br /> single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin<br /> from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I<br /> was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous<br /> documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges<br /> in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after<br /> school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge. I am an<br /> abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie.<br /> Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy<br /> evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I<br /> receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won<br /> the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a<br /> traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft<br /> floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany<br /> circles.</p>
<p>Children trust me. I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving<br /> objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby<br /> Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to<br /> refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact<br /> location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed<br /> several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when<br /> I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I<br /> successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had<br /> seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me. I<br /> balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.<br /> On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact<br /> origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot<br /> to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals<br /> using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning<br /> clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving<br /> competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I<br /> have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I<br /> have spoken with Elvis. But I have not yet gone to college.</p>

"<p>Here's a dilemma for you... With all your honor and dignity what would you do? This test only has one question, but it's a very important one.</p>
<p>Please don't answer it without giving it some serious thought. By giving an honest answer you will be able to test where you stand morally.</p>
<p>The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, where you will have to make a decision one way or the other. Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous. Please scroll down slowly and consider each line - this is important for the test to work accurately.</p>
<p>You're in Florida...In Miami, to be exact. There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods. There are huge masses of water all over you. You are a CNN photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless. You're trying to shoot very impressive photos. There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destructive power and is ripping everything away with it.</p>
<p>Suddenly you see a man in the water, he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.</p>
<p>Suddenly you know who it is -- it's George W. Bush!</p>
<p>At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away, forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the best photo of your life. So you can save the life of George W. Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer prize winning photo, a unique photo displaying the death of one of the world's most powerful men.</p>

"<p>It started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker. I began to think alone - ""to relax,"" I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. </p>
<p>Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself. I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, ""What is it exactly we are doing here?"" </p>
<p>Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's. I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, "" I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job."" This gave me a lot to think about. I came home early after my conversation with the boss. </p>
<p>""Honey,"" I confessed, ""I've been thinking..."" </p>
<p>""I know you've been thinking,"" she said, ""and I want a divorce!"" </p>
<p>""But Honey, surely it's not that serious."" </p>
<p>""It is serious,"" she said, lower lip aquiver. ""You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!"" </p>
<p>""That's a faulty syllogism,"" I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I'd had enough. ""I'm going to the library,"" I snarled as I stomped out the door. </p>
<p>I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed. As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. ""Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?"" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinkers Anonymous poster. Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was ""Porky's."" Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting. </p>
<p>I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.</p>

"<p>Customer: ""Your sound card is defective and I want a new one.""<br /> Tech Support: ""What seems to be the problem?""<br /> Customer: ""The balance is backwards. The left channel is coming out of the right speaker and the right channel is coming out the left.<br /> It's defective!""<br /> Tech Support: ""You can solve the problem by moving the left speaker to the right side of the machine and vice versa.""<br /> Customer: (sputter) (click)<br /> Tech Support: (snicker) </p>
<p>**************** </p>
<p>I had been doing Tech Support for Hewlett-Packard's DeskJet division for about a month when I had a customer call with a problem I just couldn't solve. She could not print yellow. All the other colors would print fine, which truly baffled me because the only true colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. For instance, green is a combination of cyan and yellow, but green printed fine. </p>
<p>Every color of the rainbow printed fine except for yellow. I had the customer change ink cartridges. I had the customer delete and reinstall the drivers. Nothing worked. I asked my co-workers for help; they offered no new ideas. </p>
<p>After over two hours of troubleshooting, I was about to tell the customer to send the printer in to us for repair when she asked quietly, </p>
<p>""Should I try printing on a piece of white paper instead of this ""yellow"" construction paper?"" </p>
<p>******************* </p>
<p>A man attempting to set up his new printer called the printer's tech support number, complaining about the error message: ""Can't find the printer."" </p>
<p>On the phone, the man said he even held the printer up in front of the screen, but the computer still couldn't find it! (YEE-HAW!) </p>
<p>***************** </p>
<p>Customer: ""Hello? I'm trying to dial in. I installed the software okay, and it dialed fine. I could hear that. Then I could hear the two computers connecting. But then the sound all stopped, so I picked up the phone to see if they were still connected, and I got the message, 'No Carrier,' on my screen. What's wrong?"" </p>
<p>***************** </p>
<p>An unfailingly polite lady called to ask for help with a Windows installation that had gone terribly wrong. </p>
<p>Customer: ""I brought my Windows disks from work to install them on my<br /> home computer."" (Training stresses that we are ""not the Soft-ware Police,"" so I let the little act of piracy slide.)<br /> Tech Support: ""Umm-hmm. What happened?""<br /> Customer: ""As I put each disk in it turns out they weren't initialized."" </p>
<p>Tech Support: ""Do you remember the message exactly, ma'am?""<br /> Customer:(proudly) ""I wrote it down. 'This is not a Macintosh disk. Would you like to initialize it'?""<br /> Tech Support: ""Er, what happened next?""<br /> Customer: ""After they were initialized all the disks appeared to be blank. And now I brought them back to work, and I can't read them in the A: drive; the PC wants to format them. And this is our only set of Windows disks for the whole office. Did I do something wrong?"" </p>

<p>For a computer programming class, I sat directly across from someone, and our computers were facing away from each other. </p>
<p>A few minutes into the class, she got up to leave the room. I reached between our computers and switched the inputs for the keyboards. She came back and started typing and immediately got a distressed look on her face. </p>
<p>She called the teacher over and explained that no matter what she typed, nothing would happen. The teacher tried everything. By this time I was hiding behind my monitor and quaking red-faced. </p>
<p>I started to type, ""Leave me alone!"" </p>
<p>They both jumped back, silenced. ""What the . . . "" the teacher said.<br /> I typed, ""I said leave me alone!"" </p>
<p>The kid got real upset. ""I didn't do anything to it, I swear!""<br /> It was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud. The conversation between them and HAL 2000 went on for an amazing five minutes. </p>
<p>Me: ""Don't touch me!"" </p>
<p>Her: ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit your keys that hard."" </p>
<p>Me: ""Who do you think you are anyway?!"" Etc. Finally, I couldn't contain myself any longer and fell out of my chair laughing. </p>
<p>After they had realized what I had done, they both turned beet red. Funny, I never got more than a C- in that class. </p>
<p>*************** </p>
<p>I have a friend who just bought a computer and was instructed to load a program by typing ""A:"" and then the name of the program. My friend told me it would not work because his keyboard was no good. He said he couldn't type the ""dot over dot thingie"" and that every time he tried to type the ""dot over dot thingie"" he kept getting the ""dot over comma thingie"" no matter how careful he was to press only on the very top of<br /> the key.<br /> When I taught him about the shift key, he thought I was a genius. </p>

<p>This guy calls in to complain that he gets an ""Access Denied"" message every time he logs in.

<p>My friend was on duty in the main lab on a quiet afternoon. He noticed a young woman sitting in front of one of the workstations with her arms crossed across her chest and staring at the screen. After about 15 minutes he noticed that she was still in the same position only now she was impatiently tapping her foot. He asked if she needed help and she replied, ""It's about time!

"<p>A commercial traveler was driving through the Scottish Highlands when his car broke down. </p>
<p>There was a cottage nearby so he went up to it and knocked on the door. </p>
<p>The door opened to reveal a burly Highlander. ""My car has conked out,"" said the traveler, ""Where can I spend the night?""</p>
<p>""Why, right here of course!"" said the Scot, ""Come in and avail yourself of our world famous hospitality.""</p>
<p>The traveler duly entered the humble but cozy residence.</p>
<p>""Jeannie,"" shouted the host in the direction of the kitchen, and in response to his call his beautiful daughter appeared. ""Jeannie, make a meal for the gentleman and remember to uphold our great tradition of Highland hospitality.""</p>
<p>The traveler was soon tucking into an appetizing meal, and he saw that the girl had indeed spared no effort to extend Highland hospitality to the guest. </p>
<p>""And now,"" said the Highlander, ""I'm afraid I must go out and milk the cows, but just make yourself at home and take full advantage of our world famous Highland hospitality.""</p>
<p>No sooner had the door closed behind him than the traveler set about seducing the lovely daughter. In no time at all he had her on floor and was on the job. Suddenly the door opened and there stood the Highlander. </p>
<p>He took one look at what was going on and his face turned purple with rage. He dropped his two buckets of milk with a crash and gave verbal vent to his wrath.</p>
<p>""After all I have been saying about the Highland hospitality,"" he roared, ""Arch your back, woman, and take the poor man's balls off the cold floor."" </p>

"<p>One day a man was taking a tour of the Vatican, snapping<br /> pictures with his camera as he went. But suddenly, he had this<br /> urge to go to the washroom, but he held it in because the tour<br /> guide told the group that they were going to see the pope! And<br /> he was excited.</p>
<p>So they met the pope, and the man was very happy having met the<br /> pope. When the pope left, he decided to go to the washroom,<br /> finally, since he really had to go. He followed the signs to the<br /> washrooms, unknowingly following the pope as he went.</p>
<p>He entered the washroom not knowing that the pope had just<br /> entered the washroom. And since we all know that the pope is<br /> horny, as he always is, he is jacking off to a nudie-mag in the<br /> stall.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the man, he enters the same stall as the pope,<br /> who is jerkin' his gerkin. Completely astonished, the man snaps<br /> a picture.</p>
<p>""Whoa, wait"" pleads the pope, ""You can't let that picture get to<br /> the media. It will be spread all over the world, they would tear<br /> me apart! I will be ruined. You have to sell me that camera. I<br /> will give you $1000 for it.""</p>
<p>""Whoa, a thousand bucks!"" exclaims the man, ""That is more than<br /> five times what I paid for it! I will do it! Yeah!""</p>
<p>So he sells his camera to the pope, and leaves happy, but after<br /> he utilizes the facilities. The pope opens up the camera,<br /> exposing the film as to erase the discriminating evidence. While<br /> he was doing this he realizes that his new camera is quite nice,<br /> so he keeps it.</p>
<p>Later, the pope goes on a much needed and wanted vacation. He<br /> visits Amsterdam, and during his many travels, he goes on some<br /> tours.</p>
<p>One day he is snapping photos with his $1000 camera. Another<br /> tourist, not recognizing the pope, remarks: ""That is a really<br /> nice camera. How much did you spend on it?""</p>
<p>""Well, I bought it from this guy for a thousand dollars."" says<br /> the pope.</p>
<p>""Oh boy!"" remarks the other tourist, ""he must have seen you<br /> coming!""</p>

Now Maximus! Now timEd and Squish!<br /> On, Telix! On, X00! On, Bark and WaZoo!<br /> To the top of the memory! To the top of the stack!<br /> Now dash away! Dash away!

<p>A flash of the CRT and a twist of his head<br /> Soon gave me to know I had lost programs to dread;<br /> He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br /> And filled all the RAM; then turned, the big jerk,<br /> And laying a finger aside of his nose,<br /> And giving a nod, in the RS-232 port he goes.<br /> He sprang to the sleigh, his team they all whistled,<br /> And away they all flew like they had sat on a thistle.<br /> But I heard him exclaim, ere he faded out of sight,<br /> ""Bug-free programs to all and to all a good night!""</p>

"<p>Microsoft Corporation today announced its intent to purchase, copyright, and upgrade God Himself. The new product would be named, predictably enough, Microsoft God,"" and would be available to consumers sometime in late 1998. Too many people feel separated from God in today's world,"" said Dave McCavaugh, director of Microsoft's new Religions division. </p>
<p>""Microsoft God will make our Lord more accessible, and will add an easy, intuitive user interface to Him, making Him not only easier to find, but easier to communicate with."" The new Microsoft Religions line will be expanded to include a multitude of add-on products to Microsoft God, including: </p>
<p>Microsoft Crusades: This conversion product will bring all worshipper accounts and prayer files over from previous versions of God, or from competing products like Buddha or Allah. </p>
<p>Microsoft God for the World Wide Web: This product ties Microsoft God with Microsoft Internet Information Server, making our Lord accessible from the World Wide Web using a standard Web browser interface. It introduces several new Web technologies, including Dynamic Salvation and Active Prayer Pages (APP). Donations for the poor can be donated via a Secure Alms Server. </p>
<p>Microsoft Prayers: Using a Windows-based WYSIWYG interface, this product will allow worshippers to construct effective prayers in a minimum of time. A Secure Prayer Channel technology allows guaranteed delivery of the prayer to Microsoft God servers, and Prayer Wizards enable users to construct new types of prayers with a minimum learning curve.</p>
<p>Microsoft Savior: This product will allow worshippers to transfer their sins to its internal Vice Database. After a preset interval, the product will erase itself from the user's system and establish a clear line of secure communications to the user's Microsoft God server. </p>
<p>Additionally, Microsoft is expected to announce a line of complimentary products for the new Religions line, which will enhance the functionality of the Microsoft God server product by providing a customized user interface. These interfaces will be based on popular religious sects, allowing worshippers to interact with the new God product in much the same way as the previous version. This line is expected to include Microsoft Christianity, Microsoft Catholicism, Microsoft Judaism (incompatible with Microsoft Savior), etc. </p>
<p>Competitor Netscape Communications denies rumors that it is planning to release a competing product, Netscape Satanism, that would attempt to render Microsoft God installations inoperable.</p>

<p>Cats aren't clean, they're just covered with cat spit.</p>
<p>Cats don't hunt seals. They would if they knew what they were and where to find them. But they don't, so that's all right.</p>
<p>Cats instinctively know the exact moment their owners will wake up. Then they wake them 10 minutes sooner.</p>
<p>Cats know what we feel. They don't care, but they know.</p>
<p>Cats seem to go on the principle that it never does any harm to ask for what you want.</p>
<p>Dogs have owners. Cats have staff.</p>
<p>Dogs believe they are human. Cats believe they are God.</p>
<p>I had to get rid of my wife. The cat was allergic.</p>
<p>I have studied many philosophers and many cats. The wisdom of cats is infinitely superior.</p>
<p>In a cat's eye, all things belong to cats.</p>
<p>On the Internet, nobody knows you're a cat.</p>
<p>One cat just leads to another.</p>
<p>People that hate cats will come back as mice in their next life.</p>

<p>There are many intelligent species in the universe. They are all owned by cats.</p>

The other organ I have for you is called a penis. It will allow you to reproduce your now intelligent life form and populate this planet. Eve will be very happy that you now have this organ to give her children.""<br /> Adam, very excited, exclaimed, ""These are great gifts you have given to me.

"<p>A local preacher was dissatisfied with the small amount in the collection plates each Sunday. Someone suggested to him that perhaps he might be able to hypnotize the congregation into giving more. 'And just how would I go about doing that?' he asked. 'It is very simple. First you turn up the air conditioner so that the auditorium is warmer than usual. Then you preach in a monotone. Meanwhile, you dangle a watch on a chain and swing it in a slow arc above the lectern and suggest they put 20 dollars in the collection plate.' So the very next Sunday, the reverend did as suggested, and lo and behold the plates were full of 20 dollar bills. Now, the preacher did not want to take advantage of this technique each and every Sunday. So therefore, he waited for a couple of weeks and then tried his mass hypnosis again. Just as the last of the congregation was becoming mesmerized, the chain on the watch broke and the watch hit the lectern with a loud thud and springs and parts flew everywhere. 'Crap!' exclaimed the pastor. It took them a week to clean up the church.</p>

""No. What did that stupid shit do this time?"", says the patron. ""Well, he just swallowed the cue ball off the pool table, whole"", says the bartender. ""Yeah, well I hope it kills the little fucker because he's been driving me nuts"", says the patron. The guy finishes his drink and leaves. Two weeks later he comes back in with the monkey. He orders a drink and the monkey starts running wild around the bar again. While the man is drinking his drink, the monkey finds a grape on the bar. He grabs the grape, sticks it up his ass, then pulls it out and eats it. The bartender is disgusted. ""Did you see what your monkey did now?"", he asks. ""What now?"", responds the patron. ""Well, he stuck a grape up his ass, then pulled it out and ate it"", says the barkeeper. ""Well, what did you expect?"", replied the patron. ""Ever since he ate that damn cue ball he measures everything first!""</p>

"<p>There's this guy who's in the market for a used motorcycle. Always wanted a nice big hog. So he's shopping around, answering ads in the newspaper,and not having much luck. One day he comes across a beautiful classic harley with a ""for sale"" sign on it. Upon inspection, he is amazed to find the bike in mint condition. He inquires about it with the owner: ""This bike is beautiful!! I'll take it. But you gotta tell me how you keep it in such good shape.""<br /> ""Well,"" says the seller, ""it's pretty simple. Just make sure that if the bike is outside and it's going to rain, rub vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain. In fact, since you're buying the bike I won't need my tube of vaseline anymore. Here, you can have it."" and he hands the buyer a tube of vaseline. </p>
<p>So the guy buys the bike and off he goes, a happy biker. He takes the bike over to show his girlfriend. She's ecstatic (being a harley fan). That night, he decides to ride the bike over to his girlfriend's parents house. See, it's the first time he's going to meet them and figures it will make a big impression. When the couple gets to the house, the girlfriend grabs her boyfriend's arm. </p>
<p>""Honey,"" she says,"" I gotta tell you something about my parents before we go in. When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes."" </p>
<p>""No problem,"" he says. And in they go. The boyfriend is astounded. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the family room, a huge stack of dishes. Piled up the stairs, dirty dishes. In fact, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes. </p>
<p>They sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word. As dinner progresses, the boyfriend decides to take advantage of the situation. So he reaches over, grabs his girlfriend, strips her naked, and they make it on the dinner table. Of course no one says a word. </p>
<p>""Her Mom's gotta good bod..."", he thinks. So he grabs his girlfriend's Mom and ravishes her right there on the dinner table. Again, no one says a word. Then, the boyfriend notices it starting to rain, he better take care of the motorcycle. He pulls the vaseline from his pocket. The father stands up and shouts: </p>
<p>""All right, I'll do the f@(#ing dishes!!""</p>

"<p>She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful, brown haired,<br /> freckled-faced image of innocence. Her mom looked like someone<br /> from the Walton's or a moment captured by Norman Rockwell. Not<br /> that she was old-fashioned. Her brown hair was ear length with<br /> enough curl to appear natural. She had on a pair of tan shorts<br /> and light blue knit shirt. Her sneakers were white with a blue<br /> trim. She looked like a mom.</p>
<p>It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the<br /> tops of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has<br /> no time to flow down the spout. Drains in the nearby parking lot<br /> were filled to capacity and some were blocked so that huge<br /> puddles laked around parked cars. We all stood there under the<br /> awning and just inside the door of the Walmart. We waited, some<br /> patiently, others aggravated because nature messed up their<br /> hurried day. </p>
<p>I am always mesmerized by rain fall. I get lost in the sound and<br /> sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the<br /> world. </p>
<p>Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child come<br /> pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day. Her<br /> voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all<br /> caught in. </p>
<p>""Mom, let's run through the rain,"" she said.<br /> ""What?"" Mom asked.<br /> ""Let's run through the rain!"" she repeated.<br /> ""No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit,"" Mom replied.<br /> This young child waited about another minute and repeated her<br /> statement.<br /> ""Mom. Let's run through the rain.""<br /> ""We'll get soaked if we do,"" Mom said.<br /> ""No we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning,"" the<br /> young girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm.<br /> ""This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and<br /> not get wet?""<br /> ""Don't you remember? When you were talking to daddy about his<br /> cancer, you said, ""If God can get us through this, He can get us<br /> through anything!""</p>
<p>The entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear, you couldn't hear<br /> anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or<br /> left in the next few minutes. Mom paused and thought for a<br /> moment about what she would say.</p>
<p>Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some<br /> might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of<br /> affirmation in a young child's life. A time when innocent trust<br /> can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith.</p>
<p>""Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If<br /> God lets us get wet, well maybe we just needed washing,"" Mom<br /> said.</p>
<p>Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing<br /> as they darted past the cars and yes through the puddles. They<br /> held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got<br /> soaked. But they were followed by a few believers who screamed<br /> and laughed like children all the way to their cars.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by their faith and trust. I want to believe<br /> that somewhere down the road in life, mom will find herself<br /> reflecting back on moments they spent together, captured like<br /> pictures in the scrapbook of her cherished memories.</p>
<p>Maybe when she watches proudly as her daughter graduates. Or as<br /> her daddy walks her down the aisle on her wedding day. She will<br /> laugh again. Her heart will beat a little faster. Her smile will<br /> tell the world they love each other.</p>
<p>But only two people will share that precious moment when they<br /> ran through the rain believing that God would get them through.<br /> And, yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing.</p>

El pollo se enfrentaba a importantes retos para crear y desarrollar las competencias necesarias a fin de encarar la competitividad del mercado. Andersen Consulting, en una relaci�n de socio con el cliente, ayud� al pollo redise�ando tanto su estrategia de distribuci�n f�sica como sus procesos de implantaci�n. Empleando el M�todo de Integraci�n Av�cola (MIA), Andersen coadyuv� al pollo a emplear sus habilidades, metodolog�a, conocimiento, capital y experiencias para alinear a la gente, procesos y tecnolog�a del pollo en el apoyo de su estrategia global, dentro de un marco de trabajo de Gesti�n de Programas. Andersen Consulting convoc� un equipo multidisciplinario de analistas de carreteras y a los mejores pollos que, junto con los consultores de Andersen con profundas habilidades en la industria del transporte, llevaron a cabo durante dos d�as una serie de reuniones con el objeto de apalancar su capital personal de conocimiento, tanto expl�cito como impl�cito, y de permitirles obtener sinergias entre s�, para conseguir las metas impl�citas de la entrega y dise�o exitoso, e implementando un marco de valores de empresa a trav�s del flujo de procesos av�colas. Las reuniones se mantuvieron en un entorno que reproduc�a un parque, posibilitando y creando un ambiente de alto impacto que estaba estrat�gicamente situado, centrado en la industria y elaborando un mensaje consistente, claro y �nico frente al mercado, alineado con la misi�n, visi�n y valores principales del pollo. Esto condujo a la creaci�n de una soluci�n integradora de negocio total. Andersen Consulting ayud� a que el cambio del pollo fuese m�s exitoso. El pollo consigui� la certificaci�n de AENOR al cumplir con los requerimientos de la norma ISO 9000. (Realmente, el pollo muri� atropellado por tardar tanto en cruzar).</p>
<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING: Veo un mundo en el que todos los pollos ser�n libres de cruzar la carretera sin que sus motivos se cuestionen.</p>
<p>BILL CLINTON: El pollo no cruz� la carretera. Repito, el pollo no cruz� la carretera.</p>
<p>MAQUIAVELO: La cuesti�n es que el pollo cruz� la carretera. �A qui�n le importa por qu�? El fin de cruzar la carretera justifica cualquier motivo.</p>
<p>FREUD: El hecho de que est�s preocupado porque el pollo cruce o no la carretera revela tu inseguridad sexual.</p>
<p>BILL GATES: Acabo de lanzar el Pollo Office 2000, que no s�lo cruza carreteras sino que, adem�s, pone huevos, archiva tus documentos importantes y cuadra tus cuentas.</p>
<p>DARWIN: A lo largo de grandes periodos de tiempo, los pollos han sido seleccionados naturalmente, de modo que ahora tienen una disposici�n gen�tica a cruzar carreteras.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: La cuesti�n de s� el pollo ha cruzado la carretera o la carretera se ha movido debajo del pollo depende de tu marco de referencia.</p>
<p>BUDA: Preguntar eso niega tu propia naturaleza de pollo.</p>

"<p>A little boy wanted $100 very badly; his mother told him to pray to God for it. </p>
<p>He prayed for two weeks but nothing turned up. Then he decided perhaps he should write God a letter requesting the $100. </p>
<p>When the post office received the letter addressed to God, they opened it and decided to send it to the President. </p>
<p>The President was so impressed, touched and amused that he instructed his secretary to send the little boy $5. He thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy. </p>
<p>The little boy was delighted with the $5 and sat down to write a thank you letter, which read as follows;</p>
<p>Dear God,<br /> Thank you very much for sending me the money. I noticed that you had to send it through Washington. As usual, those thieving scallys deducted $95. </p>

"<p>Two men were out playing golf on a nice Saturday afternoon.<br /> They were getting frustrated, though, because the two women who were playing right in front of them were quite slow, and were holding up the men's game.  </p>
<p>""Don't they know their supposed to let us play through?"" asked the first man.  The other man shook his head. ""I'm going to go ask them if we can play through,"" said the first man, emphatically, ""Enough is enough.""</p>
<p>He started walking over toward the women, but as he got close, he suddenly turned around and came back, white as a ghost.</p>
<p>""Oh God,"" he said to his friend, ""This is awful. You're going to have to ask those women if we can play through. You see, one of them is my wife, and the other is my mistress.""</p>

"<p>Three guys found themselves in Hell: Martin, Joe, and Dave. A<br /> little confused at their present situation, they were startled<br /> to see a door in the wall (which they hadn't noticed before)<br /> open, and behind the door was perhaps the ugliest woman they had<br /> ever seen. She was 3'4"", dirty, and you could smell her even<br /> over the Brimstone.</p>
<p>The voice of the Devil was heard, ""Martin, you have sinned!!!<br /> You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this<br /> woman!"" And Martin was whisked through the door by a group of<br /> lesser demons to his doom.</p>
<p>This understandably shook up the other two, and so they both<br /> jumped when a second door opened, and lo! an even more<br /> disgusting example of womanhood gone wrong. She was over 7',<br /> covered in thick black hair, and flies circled her.</p>
<p>The voice of the Devil was heard, ""Joe, you have sinned!!! You<br /> are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this<br /> woman!!!"" And Joe, like Martin, was whisked off.</p>
<p>Dave, now alone, felt understandably anxious, and feared the<br /> worst when the third door opened. And as the door inched open,<br /> he strained to see the figure of... Cindy Crawford!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Delighted, Dave jumped up, taking in the sight of this beautiful<br /> woman, barely dressed in a shiny metallic NASA-space-age<br /> material bikini. Then he heard the voice of the Devil say:<br /> ""Cindy, you have sinned ........""</p>

"<p>Suppose you're at a party and some hotshot intellectual is expounding on the economy of Peru, a subject you know nothing about. If you're drinking some health fanatic drink like grapefruit juice, you'll hang back, afraid to display your ignorance, while the hotshot entralls your date. But if you drink several large shots of Jack Daniels, you'll discover you have STRONG VIEWS about the Peruvian economy. You'll be a WEALTH of information. You'll argue forcefully, offering searing insights and possibly upsetting furniture. People will be impressed. Some may leave the room. </p>
<p>* Make Things Up </p>
<p>Suppose, in the Peruvian economy argument, you are trying to prove Peruvians are underpaid, a position you base solely on the fact YOU are underpaid, and you're damned if you're going to let a bunch of Peruvians be better off. </p>
<p>DON'T say: ""I think Peruvians are underpaid."" </p>
<p>Say: ""The average Peruvian's salary in 1981 dollars adjusted for the revised tax base is $1,452.81 per annum, which is $836.07 before the mean gross poverty level."" </p>
<p>(NOTE: always make up exact figures.) If an opponent asks where you got your information, make THAT up too. </p>
<p>Say: ""This information comes from Dr. Hovel T. Moon's study for the Buford Commission published May 9, 1982. Didn't you read it?"" </p>
<p>Say this in the same tone of voice you would use to say ""You left your soiled underwear in my bath house"". </p>
<p>* Use Meaningless But Weightly-sounding Words and Phrases</p>
<p>Memorize this list: </p>
<p>Let me put it this way </p>
<p>In terms of </p>
<p>Vis-a-vis </p>
<p>per se </p>
<p>As it were </p>
<p>qua </p>
<p>so to speak</p>
<p>You should also memorize some Latin abbreviations such as q.e.d., e.g., and i.e. These are all short for ""I speak Latin and you do not"". </p>
<p>Here's how to use these words and phrases. Suppose you want to say: ""Peruvians would like to order appetizers more often, but they don't have enough money."" You never win arguments talking like that. But you WILL if you say: ""Let me put it this way. In terms of appetizers vis-a-vis Peruvians, they would like to order them more often, so to speak, but they do not have enough money per se, as it were. Q.E.D.""</p>
<p>Only a fool would challenge that statement. </p>
<p>* Use Snappy and Irrelevant Combacks</p>
<p>You need an arsenal of all purpose irrelevant phrases to fire back at your opponents when they make valid points. </p>
<p>The best are: </p>
<p>You're begging the question </p>
<p>You're being defensive </p>
<p>Don't compare apples and oranges </p>
<p>What are your paramaters? </p>
<p>(This last one is especially valuable. Nobody, other than mathematicians, has the vaguest idea what ""paramaters"" means.)</p>
<p>Here's how to use your comebacks: </p>
<p>You say: Liberians, like most Asians.... </p>
<p>Your opponent says: Liberia is in Africa.</p>
<p>You say: You're being defensive.</p>
<p>* Compare Your Opponent to Adolf Hitler</p>
<p>This is your heavy artillery, for when your opponent is obviously right and you are spectacularly wrong. Bring up Hitler subtly. </p>
<p>Say: ""That sounds suspiciously like something Adolf Hitler might say"" or ""You certainly do remind me of Hitler"". </p>
<p>Now you know how to out-argue anybody. Do not try to pull any of this on people who generally carry weapons.</p>

"<p>A retiring Phys Chem professor was setting his last exam, for a graduate course in statistical thermodynamics. Being a bit bored with it all, and with a well-kept and wry sense of humor, he set a single question on the sheet: ""Is Hell endothermic or exothermic? Support your answer with proof.""<br /> He had little idea what to expect, or how to grade the results, but decided to reward any student who was able to come up with a reasonable and consistent reply to his query. One A was awarded. Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or some variant. The top student however wrote the following: </p>
<p>First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. </p>
<p>Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. There are two possible conditions: </p>
<p>Condition One: if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase exponentially until all hell breaks loose.<br /> Conversely, Condition Two: if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. </p>
<p>We can solve this with the 1990 postulation of Theresa LeClair, the girl who lived across the hall from me during my first year residence. Since I have still not been successful in obtaining sexual relations with her, condition two above has not been met, and thus it can be concluded that condition one is true, and hell is exothermic.</p>

"<p>One night a man decides to visit his local bar. He takes a seat and orders a beer. After polishing off his beer, he beckons the bartender over and says, �Betcha $20 I can bite my eye.� The bartender scoffs and accepts. The man then calmly removes his false eye and bites it. The bartender grudgingly forks over a twenty.  Later that night, after a few more beers, the man wanders back to the bar and says rather drunkenly, �Hey barkeep, betcha another $20 I can bite my other eye.� Wanting to win back his money and seriously doubtful that the man has two false eyes, the bartender accepts. The man calmly removes his false teeth and bites his other eye. Scowling, the bartender hands over another twenty. The man leaves and wanders around the bar as he drinks a few more beers. He strolls back over to the bar, leaning on it, again and calls the bartender, �Hey, barkeep,� he burbles, �I'll give you a chance to win yer money back plus. Betcha $100 if you put a shot glass on that end of the bar, and I stood on this end, I could piss into it and not spill a drop.� The bartender eagerly accepts, knowing the feat to be impossible. The man wobbily climbs atop the bar, zips down his fly and promptly pisses all over the bar. He zips up, sits down, slaps the $100 on the bar and laughs uproarously.  �What's so funny?� says the barkeep, �you just lost everything you won and more!� �Well,� giggles the man, �I just bet those guys over there $200 that I could piss all over your bar and you wouldn't get angry.�</p>

"<p>1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 4:00 and then bring it to me. The challenge of a deadline is refreshing.2. If it's really a rush job, run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to inquire how it's going. That helps. Or even better, hover behind me, advising me at every keystroke.3. Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where you are.4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or supplies, don't open the door for me. I need to learn how to function as a paraplegic and opening doors with no arms is good training in case I should ever be injured and lose all use of my limbs.5. If you give me more than one job to do, don't tell me which is the priority. I am psychic.6. Do your best to keep me late. I adore this office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do. I have no life beyond work.7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. If that gets out, it could mean a promotion.8. If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in conversations. I was born to be whipped.9. If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done. No use confusing me with useful information.10. Never introduce me to the people you're with. I have no right to know anything. In the corporate food chain, I am plankton.

"<p>Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near an abandoned gas station. They approached one of the gas pumps, and one of them said to it, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.' The gas pump, of course, didn't respond. The alien repeated the greeting. There was no response. The alien, annoyed by what he perceived to be the gas pump's haughty attitude, drew his ray gun, and said impatiently, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. How dare you ignore us in this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!' The other alien shouted to his comrade 'No, you mustn't anger him...!', but before he finished his warning, the first alien fired. There was a huge explosion that blew both of them 200 meters into the desert, where they landed in a heap. When they finally regained consciousness, the one who fired turned to the other one and said, 'What a ferocious creature. It nearly killed us! But, how did you know it was so dangerous?' The other alien answered, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my travels through the galaxy, it's that if a guy has a penis he can wrap around himself twice and then stick into his own ear, don't screw with him!'</p>

The fear of getting caught trying to escape was more powerful<br /> than the thought of getting caught in bed with Marge, so he trusted her advice.<br /> Sure enough, Marge's husband came crawling into bed and as he pulled the covers<br /> over him, he pulled the blankets, exposing six feet.</p>
<p>""Honey!"" he yelled. ""What the hell is going on? I see six feet at the end of<br /> the bed!""</p>

"<p>It was another Payday and I was tired of Mr. Good bar. </p>
<p>I saw Miss Hershey standing behind the Powerhouse on the corner of Clark and<br /> Fifth Avenue when I whipped out my Whopper and whispered, �Hey Sweetheart, how'd<br /> you like to Crunch on my big hunk for a Million Dollar Bar?�</p>
<p>Well, she immediately went down on my Tootsie Roll, and it was like pure<br /> Almond Joy!</p>
<p>I couldn't help but grab her delicious Mounds because it was easy to see that<br /> this little Twix had the Red Hoots. </p>
<p>It was all I could do to hold the Snickers and Crackle as my Butterfinger went<br /> up her tight little Kit Kat and she started to scream �Oh Henry, Oh Henry!� </p>
<p>Soon she was fondling my Peter Pan and ZagNut and I knew it wouldn't be long<br /> before I blew my Milk Duds clear to Mars that gave her a taste of the old Milky<br /> Way. </p>
<p>She asked me if I was into M&amp;M, but I said, �Hey Chick let, no kinky stuff.� I<br /> said, �Look you little Reese's Pieces, don't be a Zero, be a Lifesaver. Why<br /> don't you take my Whatchamacallit and slip it up your Bit 'O' Honey?� </p>
<p>(What a piece of Juicy Fruit she was, too!) </p>
<p>She screamed, �Oh Crackerjack, better than the Three Musketeers!� as I rammed<br /> my Ding Dong up her Rocky Road and into her Peanut Butter Cup. </p>
<p>Well, I was giving it to her Good 'N' Plenty, when all the sudden... my<br /> Starburst!</p>

"<p>Adam and Eve</p>
<p>In the Garden of Eden, As everyone knows, Lives Adam and Eve, Without any clothes.</p>
<p>In this garden, Were two little leaves, One covered Adam's, One covered Eve's.</p>
<p>As the story goes on, Never the less to say, The wind came along, And blew the leaves away.</p>
<p>At the sight, Adam did stare, There was Eve's treasure, All covered with hair.</p>
<p>And wonder came, Under Eve's eyes, As Adam's thing, Started to rise.</p>
<p>They found a spot, That suited them best, A nice big tree, Where they began to rest.</p>
<p>Her legs spread wider, And wider apart, While thrill after thrill, Came into her heart.</p>
<p>The head of Adam's thing, Peeked into the hole, And filled her with passion, Beyond her control.</p>
<p>Backward and forward, His thing did slide, And Eve's treasure, Was all wet inside.</p>
<p>The joy was good, She wouldn't let loose, Until Adam's thing, Was all out of juice.</p>
<p>Then down through the years, People did screw, And now it is time, For me and you.</p>
<p>So pull down your pants, And lay in the grass, Cause I'm in the mood, For a piece of that ASS!</p>

<p>An unidentified man, using a shotgun like a club to break a former girlfriend's windshield, accidentally shot himself to death when the gun discharged, blowing a hole in his gut.</p>
<p>Ken Charles Barger, 47, accidentally shot himself to death in December in Newton, N. C., when, awakening to the sound of a ringing telephone beside his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed instead a Smith &amp; Wesson . 38 Special, which discharged when he drew it to his ear.</p>
<p>A terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no mark on his body but autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system.</p>
<p>His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the right combination of foods. It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing from the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed. Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it wouldn't have been fatal. But the man was shut up in his near airtight bedroom. He was a big man with a huge capacity for creating [this deadly gas]. ""Three of the rescuers got sick and one was hospitalized.</p>

<p>Six people drowned Monday while trying to rescue a chicken that had fallen into a well in southern Egypt. An 18-year-old farmer was the first to descend into the 60-foot well. He drowned, apparently after an undercurrent in the water pulled him down, police said. His sister and two brothers, none of whom could swim well, went in one by one to help him, but also drowned.<br /> Two elderly farmers then came to help, but they apparently were pulled by the same undercurrent.  The bodies of the six were later pulled out of the well in the village of Nazlat Imara, 240 miles south of Cairo. The chicken was also pulled out. It survived.</p>
<p>[Times of London] A thief who sneaked into a hospital was scarred for life when he tried to get a suntan. After evading security staff at Odstock Hospital in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and helping himself to doctor's paging devices, the thief spotted a vertical sun bed. He walked into the unit and removed his clothes for a 45-minute tan.  However, the high-voltage UV machine at the hospital, which is renowned for its treatment of burns victims, has a maximum dosage of 10 seconds. After lying on the bed for almost 300 times the recommended maximum time, the man was covered in blisters. Hours later, when the pain of the burns became unbearable, he went to Southampton General Hospital, 20 miles away, in Hampshire.  Staff became suspicious because he was wearing a doctor's coat. After tending his wounds they called the police. Southampton police said:  ""This man broke into Odstock and decided he fancied a quick suntan. Doctors say he is going to be scarred for life.  </p>

Burns' clothes caught on something, however, and the other man found Burns ""wrapped in the drive shaft. "" [Kalamazoo Gazette, 4-1-95]</p>
<p>* Same thing up here in MI. Seems some poor fella thought it would be a good idea to ""move"" a downed wire from his car. Newspaper reports it took a FULL MINUTE of neighbors whacking away at him with a 2x4 to free their freshly fried former friend from the fatal flashing.</p>
<p>* Bowling Green, Ohio, student Robert Ricketts, 19, had his head bloodied when he was struck by a Conrail train. He told police he was trying to see how close to the moving train he could place his head without getting hit.</p>

"<p>There's this fellow with a parrot.  And the parrot swears like a sailor.  I mean he's a pistol.  He can swear for five minutes straight without repeating himself. Trouble is, the guy who owns him is a quiet, polite, conservative type, and this bird's foul mouth is driving him crazy.    One day, it gets to be too much, so the guy grabs the parrot by the throat,shakes him really hard, and yells, 'QUIT IT!'.  This just makes the bird mad and he swears more than ever.  Then the guy gets mad and says 'OK for you' and locks the bird in a kitchen cabinet.  This really   aggravates the bird and he claws and scratches.   When the guy finally lets him out, the bird cuts loose with a stream of vulgarities that would make a veteran sailor blush.  At that point, the guy is so mad that he throws the bird into the freezer.  For the first few   seconds there is a terrible din.  The bird kicks and claws and thrashes and uses words Lenny Bruce   and George Carlin NEVER thought about trying to use in their acts.    Then suddenly, it gets VERY quiet.    At first the guy just waits, but then he starts to think that the bird may be hurt or deeply   chilled.  After a couple of minutes of silence, he's so worried that he opens the freezer door.    The bird calmly climbs onto the man's outstretched arm and says,'Awfully sorry about the trouble I gave you.  I'll do my best to improve my vocabulary from now on.'    The man is astonished.  He can't understand the   transformation that has taken place.    Then the parrot says, 'By the way, what did the chicken do?'</p>

"<p>Below are four (4) questions. You have to answer them instantly. You<br /> can't take your time, answer all of them immediately. OK? Let's find<br /> out just how clever you really are. Ready? GO!!! (scroll down) </p>
<p>First Question:<br /> You are participating in a race. You overtake the second person. </p>
<p>What position are you in? </p>
<p>Answer:<br /> If you answer that you are first, then you are absolutely wrong! If you overtake the second person and you take his place, you are second! </p>
<p>Try not to screw up in the next question. </p>
<p>To answer the second question, don't take as much time as you took for<br /> the first question. </p>
<p>Second Question: </p>
<p>If you overtake the last person, then you are...? </p>
<p>Answer:<br /> If you answered that you are second to last, then you are wrong again.<br /> Tell me, how can you overtake the LAST person?! </p>
<p>You're not very good at this are you? </p>
<p>Third Question:<br /> Very tricky maths! Note: This must be done in your head only. Do NOT<br /> use paper and pencil or<br /> a calculator. Try it. </p>
<p>Take 1000 and add 40 to it.<br /> Now add another 1000.<br /> Now add 30.<br /> Add another 1000.<br /> Now add 20.<br /> Now add another 1000.<br /> Now add 10.<br /> What is the total?<br /> Scroll down for answer.. </p>
<p>Did you get 5000? The correct answer is actually 4100. Don't believe<br /> it? Check with your calculator! </p>
<p>Today is definitely not your day. Maybe you will get the last question<br /> right? </p>

"<p>1. Save all manner of bacon grease. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone eating.2. Just because one can drive on snow and ice does not mean we can't stay home the two days of the year it snows.3. If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four-wheel-drive with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Note: Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way: This is what they live for.4. Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and fishing bait in the same store.5. Remember: ""Y'all"" is singular.6. ""All y'all"" is plural. ""All y'all's"" is plural possessive.7. There is nothing sillier than a northerner imitating a Southern accent, unless it is a Southerner imitating a Boston accent.8. People walk slower here.9. Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't understand you either.10. The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective ""Big ol'"", as in ""big ol' truck"" or ""big ol' boy"". Eighty-five percent begin their new southern influenced dialect with this expression. One hundred percent are in denial about it.11. The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer proper.12. ""He needed killin'"" is a valid defense here.13. If attending a funeral in the South: remember, we stay until the last shovel of dirt is thrown on and the tent is torn down.14. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"" stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say.15. Most Southerners do not use turn signals, and they ignore those who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the car was purchased.16. Northerners can be identified by the spit on the inside of their car's windshield that comes from yelling at other drivers.17. The winter wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until November.18. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the tiniest accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store, it is just something you're supposed to do.19. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase one it is to be positioned directly in front of your trailer. This is logical bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the trailer and should, therefore, be displayed.20. Tornadoes and Southerners going through a divorce have a lot in common. In either case, you know someone is going to lose a trailer.21. Florida is not considered a Southern state (except Gainesville). There are far more Yankees than Southerners living there.22. As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph zone, directly in the middle of the road, remember, many folks learned to drive on a model of vehicle known as John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for the vehicle.23. You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find it yourself.</p>

"<p>""Bach was the most famous composer in the world, and so was Handel. Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English. He was very large. Bach died from 1750 to the present. Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for this.""<br /> ""The sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is in the East and the sun sets in the West.

<p>""That's my metal stomach, codenamed old clanker, adding it to my bloodstream."" Another low humming now. ""That's my cyborg liver, codenamed old trusty, processing the whiskey."" A high pitched whistle came from Roger's lower torso. ""That is my titanium kidney, codenamed old bean."" </p>
<p>Suddenly, a man in a mask with a gun bursts through the door. </p>
<p>""Alright, this is a robbery,"" he shouts, pointing his gun at the bartender, ""all the money, NOW!"" Everyone in the bar is terrified, with the exception of Roger, who turns to face the robber on his stool. All of a sudden, a deep rumbling shakes the bar. Roger's fly bursts open and a yellow geyser rushes forth, throws the robber out the door, across the street, and into a brick wall. </p>
<p>The bartender shouts, awestuck, ""What the hell was that?"" </p>
<p>Roger smiles, ""That was the last implant I got, codenamed old faithful.""</p>

"<p>Little Red Riding Hood was getting ready to go and deliver a<br /> basket of goodies to Grandmother when her mother stopped her,<br /> saying ""Little Red, you had better be careful in the woods<br /> because the Big Bad Wolf is out today. If he catches you, he is<br /> going to lift up your little red dress, pull down your little<br /> red panties and fuck your little red socks off.""</p>
<p>""Oh I'll be all right,"" Little Red answered as she pulled out a<br /> rather large shotgun from the basket she was carrying. Assured<br /> that her daughter would be safe, she allowed Little Red to leave<br /> the house and begin the journey to Grandmother's house.</p>
<p>Along the trail in the woods Little Red came across her friends<br /> the three little pigs (don't ask what they are doing in the<br /> woods, after all it is just a joke) </p>
<p>""Little Red, Little Red,"" they called to her, ""you had better be<br /> careful because the Big Bad Wolf is in the woods today. He said<br /> that if he catches you, he is going to lift up your little red<br /> dress, pull down your little red panties and fuck your little<br /> red socks off.""</p>
<p>After showing them the shotgun and assuring her friends that she<br /> would be all right, Little Red continued her journey to<br /> Grandmother's.</p>
<p>Just then the Big Bad Wolf appeared and he said, ""Little Red at<br /> last I found you. You know what's going to happen now, right? I<br /> am going to lift up your little red dress, pull down your little<br /> red panties and fuck your little red socks off.""</p>
<p>""I don't think so..."" Little Red replied as she leveled the<br /> shotgun at the wolf. She then lifted up her little red dress,<br /> and pulled down her little red panties and said, ""you're going<br /> to eat me just like the book says....""</p>

"<p>The year is 2222 and Mike and Maureen land on Mars after accumulating<br /> enough frequent flier miles. They meet a Martian couple and are talking<br /> about all sorts of things.

"<p>DOS Beer:<br /> Requires you to use your own can opener, and requires you to read the<br /> directions carefully before opening the can. Originally only came in an 8-oz.<br /> can, but now comes in a 16-oz. can. However, the can is divided into 8<br /> compartments of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed separately. Soon to be<br /> discontinued, although a lot of people are going to keep drinking it after it's<br /> no longer available. </p>
<p>Mac Beer:<br /> At first, came only a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz. can. Considered by<br /> many to be a ""light"" beer. All the cans look identical. When you take one from<br /> the fridge, it opens itself. The ingredients list is not on the can. If you call<br /> to ask about the ingredients, you are told that ""you don't need to know."" A<br /> notice on the side reminds you to drag your empties to the trashcan. </p>
<p>Windows 3.1 Beer:<br /> The world's most popular. Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a lot like Mac<br /> Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer. Claims that it allows you to<br /> drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but in reality you can only drink a few<br /> of them, very slowly, especially slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at<br /> the same time. Sometimes, for apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer will<br /> explode when you open it. </p>
<p>OS/2 Beer:<br /> Comes in a 32-oz can. Does allow you to drink several DOS beers<br /> simultaneously. Allows you to drink Windows 3.1 Beer simultaneously too, but<br /> somewhat slower. Advertises that its cans won't explode when you open them, even<br /> if you shake them up. You never really see anyone drinking OS/2 Beer, but the<br /> manufacturer (International Beer Manufacturing) claims that 9 million six-packs<br /> have been sold. </p>
<p>Windows 95 Beer:<br /> The can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but tastes more like Windows 3.1<br /> Beer. It comes in 32-oz. cans, but when you look inside, the cans only have 16<br /> oz. of beer in them. Most people will probably keep drinking Windows 3.1 Beer<br /> until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and say they like it. The ingredients<br /> list, when you look at the small print, has some of the same ingredients that<br /> come in DOS beer, even though the manufacturer claims that this is an entirely<br /> new brew. </p>
<p>Windows 98 Beer<br /> Looks just like Windows 95 beer, but has more fat. Actually has 32 oz. per can<br /> this time even though they claim it has more than Windows 95 beer. Hardly<br /> anybody is drinking it because they just figured out how to open the cans in<br /> Windows 95 beer. Manufacturer claims this is a mnew and improved beer, what they<br /> mean is the caught the brew master pissing in the Windows 95 beer and the<br /> Windows 98 beer is minus these problems. </p>
<p>Windows NT Beer:<br /> Comes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload. This causes<br /> most people to have to go out and buy bigger refrigerators. The can looks just<br /> like Windows 3.1 Beer's, but the company promises to change the can to look just<br /> like Windows 95 Beer's - after Windows 95 beer starts shipping. Touted as an<br /> ""industrial strength"" beer, and suggested only for use in bars. </p>
<p>Unix Beer:<br /> Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. to 64 oz.<br /> Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even though they claim that<br /> all the different brands taste almost identical. Sometimes the pop-tops break<br /> off when you try to open them, so you have to have your own can opener around<br /> for those occasions, in which case you either need a complete set of<br /> instructions, or a friend who has been drinking Unix Beer for several years. </p>
<p>AmigaDOS Beer:<br /> The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked up by<br /> some weird German company, so now this beer will be an import. This beer never<br /> really sold very well because the original manufacturer didn't understand<br /> marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extremely loyal and loud<br /> group. It originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans too.<br /> When this can was originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but<br /> the design hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now. Critics<br /> of this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway. </p>
<p>VMS Beer:<br /> Requires minimal user interaction, except for popping the top and sipping.<br /> However cans have been known on occasion to explode, or contain extremely<br /> un-beer-like contents. Best drunk in high pressure development environments.<br /> When you call the manufacturer for the list of ingredients, you're told that<br /> it's proprietary and referred to an unknown listing in the manuals published by<br /> the FDA. Rumors are that this was once listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference<br /> as a tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have actually seen it.</p>

"<p>Robotic Arm Extends White Flag</p>
<p>The French space program took a significant step backward today as the European  Space Agency announced that a much-heralded French Mars probe surrendered just  moments after landing on the red planet.</p>
<p>The probe, which had been expected to travel extensively across the surface of  Mars to collect and analyze rock samples, stunned the French nation by  surrendering only eight seconds into its mission.</p>
<p>As millions of astonished Frenchmen watched on national TV, the probe extended  a robotic arm -- designed to scoop up rocks from the surface of Mars - and  raised a white flag aloft, waving it back and forth.</p>
<p>The probe then used a robotic shovel to dig a hole in the Martian surface  before disappearing into the hole, apparently hiding.</p>
<p>At a press conference in Paris, French President Jacques Chirac denied that the  probe had surrendered, arguing, ""This mission was always intended to be eight  seconds long.  The probe has performed courageously and superbly.""</p>

"<p>There were two evil brothers. They were rich and used their money to keep their ways from the public eye. They even attended the same church and looked to be perfect Christians. Then, their pastor retired and a new one was hired. Not only could he see right through the brothers' deception, but he also spoke well and true, and the church started to swell in numbers.

The remaining brother sought out the new pastor the day before the funeral and handed him a check for the amount needed to finish paying for the new building. 'I have only one condition,' he said.

<p>PROJECTRA - Men given this experimental new drug were far more likely to actually finish a household repair project before starting a new one.</p>
<p>CHILDAGRA - Men taking this drug reported a sudden, over-whelming urge to perform more child-care tasks - especially cleaning up spills and ""little"" accidents.</p>
<p>COMPLIMENTRA - In clinical trials, 82 percent of middle-aged men administered this drug noticed that their wives had a new hairstyle. Currently being tested to see if its effects extend to noticing new clothing.</p>
<p>BUYAGRA - Married and otherwise attached men reported a sudden urge to buy their sweeties expensive jewelry and gifts after taking this drug for only two days. Still to be seen: whether the drug can be continued for a period longer than your favorite store's return limit.</p>
<p>NEGA-VIAGRA - Has the exact opposite effect of Viagra. Currently undergoing clinical trials on sitting U.S. presidents.</p>
<p>NEGA-SPORTAGRA - This drug had the strange effect of making men want to turn off televised sports and actually converse with other family members.</p>
<p>FLATULAGRA - This complex drug converts men's noxious intestinal gases back into food solids. Special bonus: Dosage can be doubled for long car rides.</p>
<p>FLYAGRA - This drug has been showing great promise in treating men with O.F.D. (Open Fly Disorder). Especially useful for men on Viagra.</p>
<p>PRYAGRA - About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men in the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal affairs of other people. Note: Apparent overdose turned three test subjects into ""special prosecutors.""</p>
<p>LIAGRA - This drug causes men to be less than truthful when being asked about their sexual affairs. Will be available in Regular, Grand Jury and Presidential Strength versions.<br /> ----------------------------------------</p>
<p>The National Organzation For Women is lobbying congress and the FDA to make these new drugs available for sale over the counter, as well as available in men's rooms everywhere.</p>
<p>In order to appeal to a boader customer base, Pfizer is also developing the following drugs intended primarily for women:</p>
<p>NagAgra -  Causes Women not to nag their spouse.</p>
<p>HonydewAgra - Causes women to actually do house hold maintenance instead of just writing things down.</p>
<p>InformAgra - Causes women to tell their spouses about plans they have made that involve said spouse.</p>
<p>Butt-outAgra - Causes women not to pry into the personal lives of others and mind their own business.</p>
<p>PersonalAgra - Causes women not to discuss their sex lives with aquaintances of their spouse</p>
<p>SportAgra - Makes women understand the male need for consuming large quantities of fermented beverages while watching contact sports.</p>

"<p>A rogue guide dog has been destroyed after leading four of its blind owners<br /> to their deaths.</p>
<p>Charity workers were last night facing an investigation into how<br /> four-year-old Labrador Gamer was allowed to continue his murderous spree.<br /> Officials have admitted how: </p>
<ul>
<li>Victim Nunmber 1 was dragged under the wheels of a bus. </li>
<li>Victim Nunmber 2 drowned when she was led off the end of a pier. </li>
<li>Victim Nunmber 3 was shoved into the path of a speeding train. </li>
<li>Victim Nunmber 4 was left stranded as a truck mowed him down. </li>
</ul>
<p>Trainer Rudi Jones, 48, told newsmen in South Africa:<br /> ""He was basically a good dog who needed brushing up on his skills.It's so<br /> sad that he had to be put down.""</p>
<p>Gamer's terror trail began with the death of 43-year-old Selmer Draznower<br /> from Johannesburg. Witnesses told how Gamer dragged his master under the<br /> wheels of an approaching bus before scampering off.</p>
<p>Amazingly, Gamer was then given to 68-year-old Wilma Hassamore who survived<br /> just three months after his arrival.  Gamer decided to cut short her<br /> seaside holiday by leading her off the end of a pier. The dog pulled back<br /> at the last second but Wilma plunged into the sea and drowned.</p>
<p>Next was Marvin Wurtenheim, 28, who thought his prayers had been answered<br /> when Gamer arrived. But the misguided mutt butted Marvin off a railway<br /> platform.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, the dog was then given to retired Clarence MacDuff, 67, also<br /> from Johannesburg. As Gamer was guiding the unlucky Clarence to his doctor,<br /> the hapless hound dragged him under the wheels of a delivery truck.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Guide Dogs For The Blind Association, in Durban, South<br /> Africa, said: ""We had no choice but to have him put down.""</p>
<p>Last night, the chief trainer for Britain's Guide Dogs For The Blind<br /> Association, Bob Steele, said: ""This could never happen here. If there are<br /> any doubts about the animal, it is dropped from our training programme at<br /> once.""</p>

<p>The Warden said ""Did ya have any luck?""<br /> He said ""Got 3.""</p>

<p>The Warden picked up the 2nd duck did the same thing and said ""Kentuky duck, got a stamp?""<br /> The man gave him the stamp.</p>

"<p>Last year I upgraded Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure. </p>
<p>In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization where it monitors all other system activity. </p>
<p>Applications such as Pokernight 10.3 and Beerbash 2.5 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected. I cannot seem to purge Wife 1.0 from my system. </p>
<p>I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 1.0 but un-install does not work on this program. Can you help me? </p>
<p>- Mr I N Distress </p>
<p>Dear I N Distress, </p>
<p>This is a very common problem men complain about but is mostly due to a primary misconception. </p>
<p>Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a ""UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT"" program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by its creator to run everything. </p>
<p>WARNING DO NOT TRY TO un-install, delete, or purge the program from the system once installed. Trying to un-install Wife 1.0 can be disastrous. </p>
<p>You can not go back to Girlfriend 1.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this. Some have tried to install Girlfriend 2.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than the original system. </p>
<p>Look in your manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. Others have tried to run Girlfriend 2.0 in the background, while Wife 1.0 is running. Eventually Wife 1.0 detects the presence of Girlfriend 2.0 and a system conflict occurs, this can lead to a non-recoverable system crash. </p>
<p>Some users have tried to download similar products such as Fling and 1NiteStand. Often their systems have become infected with a virus. </p>
<p>I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and just deal with the situation. Having Wife 1.0 installed myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding General Protection Faults (GPFs). </p>
<p>You must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur. The best course of action will be to push the apologize button then reset button as soon as lock-up occurs. </p>
<p>The system will run smooth as long as you take the blame for all GPFs. Wife 1.0 is a great program but is very high maintenance. </p>
<p>Suggestions for improved operation of Wife 1.0 </p>
<p>-Monthly use utilities such as TLC and FTD<br /> -Frequently use Communicator 5.0 </p>
<p>With best wishes,<br /> Tech Support. </p>

She had 14 kids, but she doesn't care.They keep telling us to get in touch with our bodies.  Mine isn't all that communicative, but I heard from it the other day after I said, 'Body, how'd you like to go to the six o'clock class in vigorous toning?'  Clear as a bell my body said, 'listen wench...do it and die.'The trouble with some women is that they get all excited about nothing (and then they marry him).I read this article that said the typical symptoms of stress are eating too much, smoking too much, impulse buying and driving too fast.  Are they kidding?  That's my idea of a perfect day.I know what Victoria's Secret is.

"<p>Dear [insert screen name here] (if that is your real name),</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that, under a plan for the periodic removal of<br /> unpleasantness from my life, I must terminate our online affair. This<br /> termination takes effect immediately, but only because I could not make it<br /> retroactive. Below, you will find the reasons for this action:</p>
<p>_____ While our cybersex sessions were, for the most part,competent, your<br />       constant use of ""brb gotta pee"" took some of the romance out of it.</p>
<p>_____ Your use of the term ""the ol' cyber ball and chain"" to refer to me<br />        has hurt my feelings.</p>
<p>_____ I've found another lover, one who knows the importance of<br />        punctuation.</p>
<p>_____ Certain errors during cyber sessions indicate that you were less<br />        than honest:</p>
<p>_____ You typed: ""I remove my bra"" when you claimed to be a man.</p>
<p>_____ You typed: ""I enter you"" when you claimed to be a woman.</p>
<p>_____ You typed your own name at the end.</p>
<p>_____ Your supposedly original scenario, it turns out, is simply page 56<br />        of a Jackie Collins novel.</p>
<p>_____ Your repeated references to animals suggest that you are hiding<br />       something from me.</p>
<p>_____ Your refusal to cyber until I submitted a recent AIDS test suggests<br />       a degree of paranoia that is, simply put, unhealthy.</p>
<p>_____ I finally opened the file with your __ gif __ jpg __ police record.</p>
<p>_____ I have no choice but to comply with the court orders unless I wish<br />       to face stalking charges.</p>
<p>_____ Mommie says I need to spend less time on the computer.</p>
<p>_____ Your mommie called me and yelled at me because of all the time<br />       you're spending on the computer.</p>
<p>_____ I have established a more personal relationship with the Lord, and I<br />       would like to talk to you in great detail about what you can do to<br />       ensure a place in Heaven when the endtimes come. They are closer than<br />       you think.</p>
<p>_____ The fact that you BCC all your love letters to me leaves me feeling<br />       less than special. As in cyber cheating.</p>
<p>_____ I finally read your profile, and the fact that you are only 14<br />       violates the terms of my parole.</p>
<p>_____ I am entering the witness protection program.</p>
<p>Please understand, __ [screen name] and/or __ you misbegotten son of a<br /> bitch__ sir/madam __ mom/dad [for use in West Virginia], that there is<br /> nothing personal in this. We've simply grown apart.</p>
<p>Any additional correspondence you may direct to my attorney,</p>
<p>__ Sincerely,</p>
<p>__ Gleefully,</p>
<p>__ I have to go before the warden calls ""lights out,""</p>

<p>On the train I sat next to a really hot guy. He started talking<br /> to me so I didn't go to the bathroom. Then he invited me to go<br /> over his house. I had to say yes.</p>
<p>Once inside his house I gasped, it was HUGE! Then he said he had<br /> to change. Finally, I had a chance to go crap. I looked and<br /> looked for a bathroom but I couldn't find it. Then I turned<br /> around and saw that there was a bathroom about 10 feet away! </p>
<p>I felt so week but I walked and walked to bathroom. When I was 3<br /> feet away from it I saw a dog. It was a big dalmatian showing<br /> off it's fangs. I could't reach the bathroom, so I had to thing<br /> of another idea. </p>
<p>That's when I got the perfect idea! I decided to crap on the<br /> floor and the guy would think the dog did it. So that's exactly<br /> what I did.</p>
<p>2 minutes later the guy came back. He asked me what smelled. I<br /> said that I didn't know (although I did) So we looked around to<br /> see what smelled. We passed the hallway that the dog was by. So<br /> I said ""Look! Your dog pooped! That's what smells!"" He looked at<br /> me strangely. ""That can't be!"" ""Why?"" I asked. ""That's a stuffed<br /> animal..."" he replied.</p>

"<p>It seems a man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of America,<br /> walked into the branch and wrote, ""This iz a stikkup. Put all<br /> your muny in this bag."" While standing in line, waiting to give<br /> his note to the teller, he began to worry that someone had seen<br /> him write the note and might call the police before he reached<br /> the teller window. So he left the Bank of America and crossed<br /> the street to Wells Fargo. After waiting a few minutes in line,<br /> he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller. She read it and,<br /> surmising from his spelling errors that he was not the brightest<br /> light in the harbour, told him that she could not accept his<br /> stick up note because it was written on a Bank of America<br /> deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells<br /> Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America. Looking<br /> somewhat defeated, the man said ""OK"" and left. The Wells Fargo<br /> teller then called the police who arrested the man a few minutes<br /> later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of America.</p>

<p>Clever drug traffickers used a propane tanker truck entering El<br /> Paso from Mexico.

Newton<br /> jumped up, accused the woman of lying and then said, ""I should<br /> of blown your fucking head off."" The defendant paused, then<br /> quickly added, "" - if I'd been the one that was there."" The jury<br /> took 20 minutes to convict Newton and recommended a 30 year<br /> sentence.</p>

<p>She was not familiar with the lake so she rowed out, anchored the boat, and started reading her book. Along comes the sheriff in his boat, pulls up alongside and says, ""Good morning, Ma'am.  What are you doing?""</p>
<p>""Reading my book,"" she replies as she thinks to herself, ""Is this guy blind or what?"" </p>
<p>  ""You're in a restricted fishing area,"" he informs her.</p>
<p>  ""But, Officer, I'm not fishing.  Can't you see that?"" </p>
<p>""But you have all this equipment, Ma'am.  I'll have to take you in and write you up.""</p>
<p> ""If you do that, I will charge you with rape,"" snaps the irate woman.</p>
<p> ""I didn't even touch you,"" growls the sheriff. </p>
<p> ""Yes, that's true ...  but you have all the equipment ..."" </p>
<p>  Moral:  Never argue with a woman who knows how to read!</p>

<p>""Aye lad, that ya did, but your wishes won't come true until tomorrow<br /> morning"". </p>
<p>The trucker was confused by this, ""Why not? You're a leprechaun, I caught ya,<br /> so you are supposed to grant me 3 wishes."" </p>
<p>""Well"", began the leprechaun, ""you don't know anything about us leprechauns.<br /> We get a day of the year off and it happens to be St. Patrick's Day."" Well, the<br /> trucker understanding this made his 3 wishes. He wanted to own his trucking<br /> company, he wanted every woman he saw to desire his body and he wanted 10<br /> million dollars in the bank, tax free. The leprechaun said it would be done in<br /> the morning. On his way out of the restroom, the leprechaun says, ""Lad, would<br /> you like to have your wishes come true tonight?"" </p>
<p>""Well yeah, but what's the catch?"", came the reply. ""Well, you gotta let a<br /> leprechaun corn-hole ya."" The trucker, at first protested, but then the<br /> leprechaun reminded him of all that he would be gaining in few precious moments.<br /> Thinking about the money, the company becoming his and ALL those women, he<br /> agreed but told the leprechaun not to tell anyone. When it was all over, the<br /> leprechaun was getting ready to leave, turned to the trucker and said, ""Laddy,<br /> can I ask ya a question?"" </p>

The man had swallowed several nitroglycerin pills and a fifth of vodka. When asked about the bruises about his head and chest he said that they were from him ramming himself into the wall in an attempt to make the nitroglycerin explode. </p>
<p>- A woman with shortness on breath and who weighted approximately 500 lbs was dragged into the ER on a tarp by six firemen. While trying to undress the lady, an asthma inhaler fell out of one of the folds under her arm. After an X-ray showed a round mass on the left side of her chest her massive left breast was lifted to find a shiny new dime. And last, but not least-- during a pelvic exam a TV remote control was discovered in one of the folds of her crotch. She became known as ""The Human Couch"". </p>
<p>- The most nonemergent ER visit: A male adolescent came in at 2 a.m. with a complaint of belly button lint. </p>
<p>- A 92-year old woman had a full cardiac arrest at home and was rushed to the hospital. After 30 minutes of unsuccessful resuscitation attempts the old lady was pronounced dead. The doctor went to tell the lady's 78-year old daughter that her mother didn't make it. ""Didn't make it? Where could they be? She left in the ambulance forty-five minutes ago!"" </p>
<p>- A 15-year old boy was laying on a stretcher with his mother sitting next to him. The boy was coming down from ""crank"" (methamphetamine) that he had injected into his veins with needles he had been sharing with his friends. Concerned about this the doctor asked the boy if there was anything he might have been doing that put him at risk for AIDS. The boy thought for a while then said questioningly ""You mean like having sex with our dog?"" </p>
<p>- A 19-year old female was asked why she was in the ER. She said that she and her boyfriend were having sex and the condom came off and she wasn't able to retrieve it with her fingers. She went to the bathroom and ""gagged myself to vomit but couldn't vomit it up either.""</p>

"<p>After just a few years of marriage filled with constant arguments, a young man and his wife decided the only way to save their marriage was to try counseling. They had been at each other's throats for some time and felt that this was their last straw. When they arrived at the counselor's office, the counselor jumped right in and opened the floor for discussion. ''What seems to be the problem?'' Immediately, the husband held his long face down without anything to say. In contrast, the wife began talking 90 miles an hour, describing all the wrongs within their marriage. After 15 minutes of listening to the wife, the counselor went over to her, picked her up by her shoulders, kissed her passionately and sat her back down. Afterwards, the wife sat speechless. The marriage counselor looked over at the husband, who stared in disbelief. The counselor said to the husband, ''Your wife NEEDS that at least twice a week!'' The husband scratched his head and replied, ''I can have her here on Tuesdays and Thursdays.''</p>

He was in a six-man ward rather than a private room, his meals were too cold or not served to suit his taste, the light needed to be adjusted to his demands, the nighttime activities interfered with his rest... and on, and on.</p>
<p>One afternoon an orderly entered the room. ""Time to take your temperature, General.""</p>
<p>After growling at the orderly, the general opened his mouth to accept the thermometer.</p>
<p>""Sorry, General, but for this test we need your temperature from the other end.""</p>
<p>A whole new barrage of verbal abuse followed, but the orderly was insistent that a rectal temperature was what the test called for.</p>
<p>The general at last rolled over, bared his rear, and allowed the orderly to proceed. The orderly then told the general, ""Stay exactly like that and don't move. I'll be back in five minutes to check up on you"" and withdrew.</p>
<p>An hour later, the head nurse entered the room, saw the general with his bare rear in the air and gasped, ""What's going on here?""</p>
<p>""Haven't you ever seen someone having their temperature taken?"" the general barked.</p>
<p>""Yes I have, General, but with a daffodil?""</p>

"<p>A blind man went to a lumber yard for a job. The boss didn't want to just tell him no, so he told him that if he could pass a test, he'd hire him. He had one of his employees take him out back to identify some lumber. He brought the man to a pile of pine paneling, the man walked around the pile and sniffed, correctly identifying it as pine paneling.The employee thought, ""How did he do that?"" Next he took him to a pile of 2x4's. These he also correctly identified after sniffing around a bit. Now they were all amazed. They decided it was time to trick him. They brought out the receptionist and laid her buck naked on her back. The blind man walked around and sniffed.Obviously puzzled he walked around and sniffed and walked around and sniffed some more.Scratching his head, he told them to flip it over. They did so and the sniffing continued. Suddenly he started laughing and said ""You think you've got me, don't you? Well I know what that is. That's the shit house door off of a tuna boat!</p>

<p>I found lots of people who loved Jesus. </p>
<p>I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. </p>
<p>He must REALLY love Jesus because pretty soon he leaned out of his window and yelled ""JESUS CHRIST!"" as loud as he could. </p>
<p>It was like a football game with him shouting, ""GO!...JESUS CHRIST!...GO!"" Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out the window and smiled and waved to all those loving people. </p>
<p>There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I heard him yell something about a sunny beach and saw him waving with only his middle finger. </p>
<p>I asked my kids what he meant by that and they laughed and said it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So I leaned out of the window and gave him the good luck sign back. </p>
<p>A couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started running towards me! </p>
<p>I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed so I stepped on the gas. </p>
<p>It's a good thing that I did because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. </p>
<p>I looked back and everyone was still standing there so I leaned way out the window and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away. </p>

"<p>The five toughest questions women ask - and their answers:<br /> 1. `What are you thinking?'<br /> 2. `Do you love me?'<br /> 3. `Do I look fat?'<br /> 4. `Do you think she's prettier than me?'<br /> 5. `What would you do if I died?'</p>
<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example:</p>
<p>1. `What are you thinking?'<br /> The proper answer to this question, of course, is: 'I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you.' Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things:<br /> a - football.<br /> b - baseball.<br /> c - How fat you are.<br /> d - How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>The best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married with Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. His answer: 'If I wanted you to know I'd be talking instead of thinking'</p>
<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers:</p>
<p>2. 'Do you love me?'<br /> The correct answer to this question is, 'Yes.'<br /> For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer. 'Yes dear.' </p>
<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I suppose so.<br /> b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> c - That depends on what you mean by 'love'.<br /> d - Does it matter?<br /> e - Who, me?</p>
<p>3. 'Do I look fat?'<br /> The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state,<br /> 'No, of course not' and then quickly leave the room. </p>
<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I wouldn't call you fat, but I wouldn't call you thin either.<br /> b - Compared to what?<br /> c - A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d - I've seen fatter.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>
<p>4. 'Do you think she's prettier than me?'<br /> The 'she' in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passerby you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw.<br /> In any case, the correct response is: 'No, you are much prettier.' </p>
<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.<br /> b - I don't know how one goes about rating such things.<br /> c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.<br /> d - Only in the sense that she's younger and thinner.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>
<p>5. 'What would you do if I died?' </p>
<p>Correct answer: 'Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first truck that came my way.'</p>
<p>This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke:</p>
<p>'Dear,' said the wife, `what would you do if I died?' </p>
<p>'why, dear, I would be extremely upset,' said the husband. 'Why do you ask such a question?' </p>
<p>'Would you remarry?' persevered the wife. </p>
<p>'No, of course not, dear,' said the husband. </p>
<p>'Don't you like being married?' said the wife. </p>
<p>'Of course I do, dear,' he said. </p>
<p>'Then why wouldn't you remarry?' </p>
<p>'All right,' said the husband, 'I'd remarry.' </p>
<p>'You would?' said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>
<p>'Yes,' said the husband. </p>
<p>`Would you sleep with her in our bed?' said the wife after a long pause. </p>
<p>'Well yes, I suppose I would,' replied the husband. </p>
<p>'I see,' said the wife indignantly. 'And would you let her wear my old clothes?' </p>
<p>'I suppose, if she wanted to,' said the husband. </p>
<p>'Really,' said the wife icily. `And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?' </p>
<p>'Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do.' </p>
<p>'Is that so?' said the wife, leaping to her feet. 'And I suppose you'd let her play with my golf clubs, too.' </p>
<p>'Of course not, dear,' said the husband. 'She's left-handed.'</p>
