Well, when the man sat down in the examination room, he noticed that there were three items on a stand next to the doctor's desk: a tube of K-Y jelly, a rubber glove, and a beer.When the doctor came in, the man said, ""Look Doc, this is my first exam... I know what the K-Y is for... and I know what the glove is for...but what's the BEER for?""At this instant, the doctor became noticeably outraged and stormed over to the door.

The man should be here soon''. Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer rang the doorbell, hoping to make a sale. ''Good morning madam. You don't know me but I've come to....'' ''Oh, no need to explain. I've been expecting you,'' Mrs. Smith cut in. ''Really?'' the photographer asked. ''Well, good! I've made a specialty of babies.'' ''That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat. Just where do we start?'' asked Mrs. Smith, blushing. ''Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun too; you can really spread out.'' ''Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me.'' ''Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'' ''I hope we can get this over with quickly,'' gasped Mrs. Smith. ''Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.'' ''Don't I know!!'', Mrs. Smith exclaimed. The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. ''This was done on the top of a bus in downtown London.'' ''Oh my god!!'', Mrs. Smith exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief.''And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'' The photographer handed Mrs. Smith the picture. ''She was difficult?'' asked Mrs. Smith. ''Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get a good look.'' ''Four and five deep?'' asked Mrs. Smith, eyes widened in amazement. ''Yes'', the photographer said. ''And for more than three hours too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in.'' Mrs. Smith leaned forward. ''You mean they actually chewed on your, eh...equipment?'' ''That's right. Well madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work.'' ''Tripod??'', Mrs. Smith looked extremely worried now. ''Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action. Madam? Madam?..... Good Lord, she's fainted!!''</p>

<p>Joe thinks, ""Hmm...never been in an Irish bar before and I am bored and lonely. I'll go check it out.""</p>
<p>In he walks, amidst hoots of laughter. He looks up at a stage in the center of the room and sees a man going to the microphone.</p>
<p>He taps the microphone twice and says ""42"". Everyone bursts out laughing and he walks off the stage.</p>
<p>Another man comes up and yells ""68!"" The crowd laughs louder still!</p>
<p>A third man walks up and shouts ""12!!""</p>
<p>Joe is quite confused by now so he finds the manager and asks, ""Why does everyone laugh when they are only calling out numbers?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" says the Manager, ""we got tired of saying the same jokes over and over again so we assigned them numbers so each number called out is a joke.""</p>
<p>""Ohh,"" said Joe. ""Am I allowed a go then?""</p>
<p>""Sure!"" the manager exclaimed, So up on to the stage went Joe and yelled at the top of his voice ""168"".</p>
<p>The patrons laughed so loudly the room shook. They carried him off the stage and bought him a few drinks.</p>
<p>After that, he went to the manager and asked, ""Why was my joke so funny?""</p>
<p>The manager was still chuckling but he said, ""Well, they haven't heard that one before!!""</p>

<p>Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hall started up and cuckooed 3 times.</p>
<p>Quickly, realizing he'd probably wake up, I cuckooed another 9 times. I was really proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution especially since I was smashed, in order to avoid a conflict with him.</p>
<p>The next morning my husband asked me what time I got in, and I told him 12 o'clock. He didn't seem disturbed at all. Whew! Got away with that one!</p>
<p>Then he said, ""We need a new cuckoo clock.""</p>
<p>When I asked him why, he said, ""Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said, ""Oh crap!"", cuckooed 4 more times, cleared it's throat, cuckooed another 3 times,giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then farted.""</p>

She told the Lord that it was awful -- she had to sleep in cold back alleys, where there was no food and life was hard.  God told her that he was sorry it had had turned out that way -- but here, in heaven, she would be happy and He would give her the most comfortable, warm pillow to sleep on.  The cat laid down upon the pillow and was happy.  A few days later, about a dozen mice that came to heaven together and God asked them how they had liked earth.  The earth was no better for them than it was the cat.  They explained to God that it was tough and exhausting and their feet were worn out from always running from cats and dogs and people.  God felt bad for the mice and decided to give them rollerskates.   One day God sees the cat again and asked her how she was liking heaven.  She explained that it was absolutely wonderful.  The pillow he gave her was the most comfortable place that she had ever slept on, but even better than the pillow were the meals on wheels.</p>

52082,"<p>A dying man gathered his Lawyer, Doctor and Clergyman at his bed side and<br /> handed each of them an envelope containing $25,000 in cash. He made them each<br /> promise that after his death and during his repose, they would place the three<br /> envelops in his coffin. He told them that he wanted to have enough money to<br /> enjoy the next life. A week later the man died. At the Wake, the Lawyer and<br /> Doctor and Clergyman, each concealed an envelop in the coffin and bid their old<br /> client and friend farewell.<br /> By chance, these three met several months later. Soon the Clergyman, feeling<br /> guilty, blurted out a confession saying that there was only $10,000 in the<br /> envelop he placed in the coffin. He felt, rather than waste all the money, he<br /> would send it to a Mission in South America. He asked for their forgiveness. The<br /> Doctor, moved by the gentle Clergymans sincerity, confessed that he too had kept<br /> some of the money for a worthy medical charity. The envelop, he admitted, had<br /> only $8000 in it. He said, he too could not bring himself to waste the money so<br /> frivolously when it could be used to benefit others. By this time the Lawyer was<br /> seething with self-righteous outrage. He expressed his deep disappointment in<br /> the lonious behavior of two of his oldest and most trusted friends. I am the<br /> only one who kept his promise to our dying friend. I want you both to know that<br /> the envelop I placed in the coffin contained the full amount. Indeed, my<br /> envelope contained my personal check for<br /> the entire $25,000.</p>

Offer $2. Keep asking until someone agrees.

Type by hitting<br /> the keys with the straw.<br /> If you're sitting in a swivel chair, spin around singing 'The Lion Sleeps<br /> Tonight' whenever there is processing time required.<br /> Draw a picture of a woman (or man) on a piece of paper, and tape it to your<br /> monitor.

Shake your head, and resume hitting the space bar on your keyboard. Keep<br /> doing this until you've deleted about a page of your neighbor's document. Then,<br /> suddenly exclaim: 'well, what do ya know? I've been hitting the space bar this<br /> whole time. No wonder it wasn't deleting! Ha!' Print out your document and<br /> leave.<br /> Remove your disk from the drive and hide it. Go to the lab monitor and<br /> complain that your computer ate your disk.

Complain that the lead doesn't<br /> work.<br /> Come into the computer lab wearing several endangered species of flowers in<br /> your hair. Smile incessantly. Type a sentence, then laugh happily, exclaim<br /> 'You're such a marvel!' and kiss the screen. Repeat this after every sentence.<br /> As your ecstasy mounts, also hug the keyboard. Finally, hug your neighbor, then<br /> the computer assistant, and walk out.<br /> Run into the computer lab, shout 'Armageddon is here!' then calmly sit down<br /> and begin to type.<br /> Quietly walk into the computer lab with a Black and Decker chainsaw, rev that<br /> baby up, and then walk up to the nearest person and say, 'Give me that computer<br /> or you'll be feeding my pet crocodile for the next week.'<br /> Two words: Tesla Coil.

<p>Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br /> Not a creature was stirring, except Papa's mouse.<br /> The computer was humming, the icons were hopping,<br /> As Papa did last-minute Internet shopping.<br /> The stockings were hung by the modem with care<br /> In hope that St. Nicholas would bring new software.<br /> The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br /> While visions of computer games danced in their heads.<br /> PageMaker for Billy, and Quicken for Dan,<br /> And Carmen Sandiego for Pamela Ann.<br /> The letters to Santa had been sent out by Mom,<br /> To santaclaus@toyshop.northpole.com<br /> Which has now been re-routed to Washington State<br /> Because Santa's workshop has been bought by Bill Gates.<br /> All the elves and reindeer have had to skedaddle<br /> To flashy new quarters in suburban Seattle.<br /> After centuries of a life that was simple and spare,<br /> St. Nicholas is suddenly a new billionaire,<br /> With a shiny red Porsche in the place of his sleigh,<br /> And a house on Lake Washington that's just down the way<br /> From where Bill has his mansion. The old fellow preens<br /> In black Gucci boots and red Calvin Klein jeans.<br /> The elves have stock options and desks with a view,<br /> Where they write computer code for Johnny and Sue.<br /> No more dolls or tin soldiers or little toy drums<br /> Will be under the tree, only compact disk ROMS<br /> With the Microsoft label. So spin up your drive,<br /> From now on Christmas runs only on Win95.<br /> More rapid than eagles the competitors came,<br /> And Bill whistled, and shouted, and called them by name.<br /> ''Now, ADOBE! now, CLARIS! now, INTUIT! too,<br /> Now, APPLE! and NETSCAPE! you are all of you through,<br /> It is Microsoft's SANTA that the kids can't resist,<br /> It's the ultimate software with a traditional twist<br /> Recommended by no less than the jolly old elf,<br /> And on the package, a picture of Santa himself.<br /> Get 'em young, keep 'em long, is Microsoft's scheme,<br /> And a merger with Santa is a marketer's dream.<br /> To the top of the NASDAQ! to the top of the Dow!<br /> Now dash away! dash away! dash away - wow!''<br /> And Mama in her 'kerchief and I in my cap,<br /> Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,<br /> When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br /> The whir and the hum of our satellite platter,<br /> As it turned toward that new Christmas star in the sky,<br /> The SANTALITE owned by the Microsoft guy.<br /> As I sprang from my bed and was turning around,<br /> My computer turned on with a Jingle-Bells sound.<br /> And there on the screen was a smiling Bill Gates<br /> Next to jolly old Santa, two arm-in-arm mates.<br /> And I heard them exclaim in voice so bright,<br /> Have a MICROSOFT CHRISTMAS, and TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.</p>

52125,"<p>One day this big, nasty, sweaty woman wearing a raggedy sleeveless sundress<br /> walks into a bar. </p>
<p>She raises her right arm, revealing a big hairy armpit as she points to all<br /> the people sitting at the bar and asks, 'What man Out there will buy a lady a<br /> drink?'</p>
<p>The whole bar goes dead silent as the patrons try to ignore her. </p>
<p>At the end of the bar, a skinny little piss head slams his hand on the bar and<br /> says, 'Barman, I want to buy that ballerina a Drink.'</p>
<p>The barman pours the drink and the woman chugs it down. </p>
<p>After she's completed the drink, she turns again to the throng and points<br /> around at all of them, again revealing the hairy Armpit, saying,</p>
<p>'What man out there will buy a lady a drink?'</p>
<p>Once again, the little drunk slaps his hand down on the bar and slurs to the<br /> barman, 'Sir, I would like to buy the ballerina another drink.'</p>
<p>After serving the lady her second drink, the barman approaches the little<br /> drunkard and says, 'It's your business if you want to buy the lady a drink, but<br /> why do you keep calling her a ballerina?'</p>
<p>To which, the drunken replies, 'Sir, in my eyes, any woman who can lift her<br /> leg up that high has got to be a ballerina.</p>

52127,"<p>Two Italians and a Pollock go into a bar. The Pollock doesn't have a<br /> girlfriend and the Italians feel sorry for him. They explain to him<br /> that if he studies their moves, he'll be able to pick up women.</p>
<p>So the first Italian walks up to this blonde chick and goes,""Hey<br /> baby, ya' wanna' leave here?""</p>
<p>She goes,""I'd love to-but we can't go to my house. My parents will<br /> kill me if they see me with you.""</p>
<p>He goes,""That's okay. We'll go to my house,"" and they leave.</p>
<p>The second Italian says,""That's nothing. Watch me in action and<br /> learn!""</p>
<p>So he walks up to some blonde and says,""Hey baby, ya' wanna' leave<br /> here?""</p>
<p>She replies,""I'd love to-but we can't go to my house. My husband<br /> will kill me if he sees me with you.""</p>
<p>He says,""That's okay. We'll go to my house,"" and they leave.</p>
<p>Now the Pollock's alone and he says to himself,""I think this looks<br /> pretty easy. I think I'll try it.""</p>
<p>So the Pollock walks up to this brunette and says,""Hey baby, how do<br /> ya' wanna' leave here?""</p>
<p>She goes,""I'd love to-but I can't. I'm on my menstrual cycle.""</p>
<p>He says, ""That's okay. We'll go on my moped.""</p>

52131,"<p>This memo is to announce the development of a new software system which will<br /> be Year 2000 compliant. This program is known as 'Millennia Year Application<br /> Software System' (MYASS). </p>
<p>Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to everyone. We<br /> will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an<br /> opportunity to get a good look at MYASS. We have not addressed networking<br /> aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This<br /> restriction will be removed after MYASS expands. </p>
<p>Some employees have begun using the program already. This morning I walked<br /> into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose<br /> buried in MYASS. Some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of<br /> MYASS. Last week my secretary said to me, 'I'm a little nervous, I never put<br /> anything in MYASS before.' I helped her through the first time and afterward she<br /> admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to<br /> doing it again, and was even ready to kiss MYASS. </p>
<p>There have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial<br /> installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS.<br /> In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS.<br /> This database will encompass all information associated with the business. </p>
<p>As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in MYASS.<br /> As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a<br /> supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, 'here, stick this in MYASS.' It<br /> will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond,<br /> 'Here it is, I just pulled it out of MYASS.'</p>

52134,"<p>One late evening while the family was at church, a man was breaking into<br /> their home, he went into the bedroom stealing everything he could get his<br /> hands on. As soon as he entered the living room he heard a voice ""God is<br /> going to get you!"" ""God is going to get you!"" He pulled out his flashlight<br /> and shined it on this big bird. Well the man did not pay any mind to the<br /> bird and kept on loading up his bag.</p>
<p>He was loading that bag from left to right. Again he heard that voice ""God<br /> is going to get you!"" ""God is going to get you!"" He walked over to the<br /> cage and told the bird to shut up! As soon as he put his hand on the door<br /> knob of the backdoor he heard a different noise. It was not the bird but a<br /> growing sort of noise, He shined the flashlight up and saw this GREAT BIG<br /> DOG! And the bird yelled ""GET HIM GOD!""</p>

52135,"<p>A teacher tells her class the new word for the day is Contagious, she asks the class if they could explain what the word means. She asks Joe if he can explain what the word means and he says, ""My Mom says to stay away from kids with chicken pox because they are contagious."" The teacher says, ""That is very good Joe."" Then she picks Suzie, who says, ""The atmosphere was Contagious."" And the teacher says, ""Excellent Suzie."" Then she notices that little Johnny has his hand up at the back of the class, ""Yes Johnny,"" she says. Johnny says, ""The other day me and my Dad were sitting around and we saw our blonde neighbor painting her fence. She had a tiny little brush you use to paint model cars, and she was going in tiny little stokes up and down the fence."" My Dad says to me, ""Jesus, its gonna take that cunt ages to finish that fence.""</p>
