I'll give you a lift. Climb in the truck"".The happy priest climbed into the passenger seat and the truck driver continued down the road. Suddenly the truck driver saw a lawyer walking down the road and instinctively he swerved to hit him. But then he remembered there was a priest in the truck with him, so at the last minute he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the lawyer. However even though he was certain he missed the lawyer, he still heard a loud ""THUD"". Not understanding where the noise came from he glanced in his mirrors and when he didn't see anything, he turned to the priest and said, ""I'm sorry Father. I almost hit that lawyer"".""That's okay"", replied the priest.""I got him with the door!</p>

30059,"<p>After having their 11th child, a Kentucky couple decided that was enough(they could not afford a larger double wide).</p>
<p>So, the husband went to his doctor (who also treated mules) and told him that he and his wife/cousin didn't want to have any more children.</p>
<p>The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. The doctor instructed him to go home, get a cherry bomb (fireworks are legal in Kentucky), light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.</p>
<p>The Kentuckian said to the doctor, ""I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me."" So, the couple drove to Ohio to get a second opinion.</p>
<p>The Ohio physician was just about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed that they were from Kentucky. This doctor instead told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it, place it in a beer can, hold it to his ear and count to 10.</p>
<p>Figuring that both learned physicians couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count. ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . . . "", at which point he paused, placed the beer can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand....</p>

30086,"<p>I recently tried some of these new 'flavoured' condoms. I bought one of each flavour they had, and tried each one in turn every time i got a shag. My girlfriend likes to lick each one before i insert it in her, just to see what flavour i was wearing.</p>
<p>The first night she said ""Mmmmm, Cherry flavour"",</p>
<p>The second night she said ""Mmmmm, Mint flavour"",</p>
<p>The third night she said ""Mmmmm, Strawberry flavour"",</p>
<p>and so on, until we had reached the final flavour, and she said ""Mmmmm, Cheese flavour""</p>
<p>""Cheese flavour ??"" i said ""I haven't put one on yet!""</p>

30095,"<p>Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer came to him and said, ""Now don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. </p>
<p>He's never lost a match because of this ""pretzel"" hold he has. Whatever you do, don't let him get you in this hold! If he does, you're finished!""</p>
<p>The wrestler nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Now, to the match: The American and the Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold!</p>
<p>A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the ending.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. </p>
<p>The Russian's back hit the mat with a thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him, getting the pin and winning the match.</p>
<p>The trainer was astounded! When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asked, ""How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!""</p>
<p>The wrestler answered, ""Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. </p>
<p>I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could. You'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls!""</p>

30099,"<p>Abraham is an old Jewish man who is a yarn merchant. He lives next door to the biggest anti-Semite in town. One day the anti-Semite calls up Abraham and says, 'Hey Jew!!!... I need a piece of orange yarn. The length must be from the tip of your nose to the tip of your penis, and I want it delivered tomorrow.'   Abe says, 'OK.'   The next morning the Anti-Semite is awakened at 7 AM by the sound of running engines. He runs outside to see a row trucks lined up one after the other, dumping truckful after truckful of orange yarn in his front yard. Soon his yard is a 5-foot deep sea of orange yarn. Abe then presents a bill for $18,000 to the anti-Semite.   The guy starts yelling and screaming at Abe. 'What is this? This is not what I asked for! I told you I needed a piece of yarn from the end of your nose to the tip of your penis. Look at this place! What do you have to say for yourself?'   Straightfaced, Abe replies 'I'm very careful when I deal with people like you, that's why I got a few witnesses here with me. I may be off by a few miles, so I gave you a 2% discount; but the tip of my penis is in Poland.'</p>

<p>""OK,"" replies the Angel. ""Sounds good, but I must give you an entrance<br /> examination before you can enter."" The Christian promptly agrees and the Angel<br /> asks him: ""How do you spell God?"" It is an easy question, and the Christian<br /> passes through the Gate.</p>
<p>Next came the Muslim, who says, ""I had not done any good or evil things during<br /> my life but I was very devout. I prayed to God five times a day. So, I too<br /> should enter Heaven."" The Angel replies, ""It sounds OK to me, but I have to give<br /> you a test also. How do you spell Allah?"" The Muslim passed the test.</p>
<p>Finally, it is the Buddhist's turn, who tells the Angel, ""I had done all the<br /> good things in my life and I followed Buddha's five precepts: I never killed, I<br /> donated to charities, I meditated every day, and I never cheated my boss or my<br /> customers.""

<p>""$10 for 3 minutes,"" replied the pilot. ""That's too much,"" said the farmer.</p>
<p>The pilot thought for a second and then said, ""I'll make you a deal. If you<br /> and your wife ride for 3 minutes without uttering a sound, the ride will be<br /> free. But if you make a sound, you'll have to pay $10."" </p>
<p>The farmer and his wife agreed and went for a wild ride. After they landed,<br /> the pilot said to the farmer, ""I want to congratulate you for not making a<br /> sound. You are a brave man."" </p>
<p>""Maybe so,"" said the farmer, ""But I gotta tell ya, I almost screamed when my<br /> wife fell out.""</p>

30135,"<p>A medical student was in the morgue one day after classes, getting a little practice in before the final exams. He went over to a table where a body was lying face down. He removed the sheet over the body and to his surprise he found a cork in the corpse's rectum. Figuring this was fairly unusual, he pulled the cork out, and to his surprise, music began playing ""On the road again... Just can't wait to get on the road again...""The student was amazed, and placed the cork back in the rectum. The music stopped. Totally freaked out, the student called the Medical Examiner over to the corpse.""Look at this. This is really something!"" the student told the examiner as he pulled the cork back out again.""On the road again... Just can't wait to get on the road again...""""So what?"", the Medical Examiner replied, obviously unimpressed with the student's discovery.""But isn't that the most amazing thing you've ever seen?"" asked the student.""Are you kidding?"" replied the Examiner, ""Any asshole can sing country music.""</p>

30136,"<p>One day little Johnny's teacher walked up to her class and she<br /> asks them to think of a sentence with the word Ozenal in it. So<br /> after a few minutes she asks ""Who wants to read their sentence<br /> out loud?""</p>
<p>She sees Johnny's hand but she doesn't want to ask him because<br /> Johnny has a bad mouth so she looks at around some more.</p>
<p>""Sally, why don't you tell us your sentence?"" the teacher asks.<br /> So Sally stands up and says: ""Mommy made lunch and cut her<br /> finger and she put ozenal on it to make it feel better."" ""That's<br /> very good Sally,"" the teacher says, she looks over and sees<br /> Billy waving his hand in the air. </p>
<p>""Billy, what is your sentence?"" she asks. Billy says: ""I was<br /> skateboarding in the park when I fell and my Mom put ozenal on<br /> my knee to make it better."" ""That's very good Billy.""</p>
<p>Finally the teacher gives in and asks little Johnny what his<br /> sentence is... ""My dad had a headache and my mom was vacuuming<br /> the floor and my dad shouted 'IF YOU DONT STOP THAT DAMN THING<br /> I'LL SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS---HOSE 'N ALL!!""</p>

30154,"<p>Multi-national personnel at North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters near Paris found English to be an easy language ... until they tried to pronounce it. To help them discard an array of accents, the verses below were devised. After trying them, a Frenchman said he'd prefer six months at hard labor to reading six lines aloud. Try them yourself. </p>
<p>ENGLISH IS TOUGH STUFF </p>
<p>====================== </p>
<p>Dearest creature in creation, </p>
<p>Study English pronunciation. </p>
<p>I will teach you in my verse </p>
<p>Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse. </p>
<p>I will keep you, Suzy, busy, </p>
<p>Make your head with heat grow dizzy. </p>
<p>Tear in eye, your dress will tear. </p>
<p>So shall I! Oh hear my prayer. </p>
<p>Just compare heart, beard, and heard, </p>
<p>Dies and diet, lord and word, </p>
<p>Sword and sward, retain and Britain. </p>
<p>(Mind the latter, how it's written.) </p>
<p>Now I surely will not plague you </p>
<p>With such words as plaque and ague. </p>
<p>But be careful how you speak: </p>
<p>Say break and steak, but bleak and streak; </p>
<p>Cloven, oven, how and low, </p>
<p>Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe. </p>
<p>Hear me say, devoid of trickery, </p>
<p>Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore, </p>
<p>Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles, </p>
<p>Exiles, similes, and reviles; </p>
<p>Scholar, vicar, and cigar, </p>
<p>Solar, mica, war and far; </p>
<p>One, anemone, Balmoral, </p>
<p>Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel; </p>
<p>Gertrude, German, wind and mind, </p>
<p>Scene, Melpomene, mankind. </p>
<p>Billet does not rhyme with ballet, </p>
<p>Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet. </p>
<p>Blood and flood are not like food, </p>
<p>Nor is mould like should and would. </p>
<p>Viscous, viscount, load and broad, </p>
<p>Toward, to forward, to reward. </p>
<p>And your pronunciation's OK </p>
<p>When you correctly say croquet, </p>
<p>Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve, </p>
<p>Friend and fiend, alive and live. </p>
<p>Ivy, privy, famous; clamour </p>
<p>And enamour rhyme with hammer. </p>
<p>River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb, </p>
<p>Doll and roll and some and home. </p>
<p>Stranger does not rhyme with anger, </p>
<p>Neither does devour with clangour. </p>
<p>Souls but foul, haunt but aunt, </p>
<p>Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant, </p>
<p>Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger, </p>
<p>And then singer, ginger, linger, </p>
<p>Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge, </p>
<p>Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age. </p>
<p>Query does not rhyme with very, </p>
<p>Nor does fury sound like bury. </p>
<p>Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth. </p>
<p>Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath. </p>
<p>Though the differences seem little, </p>
<p>We say actual but victual. </p>
<p>Refer does not rhyme with deafer. </p>
<p>Foeffer does, and zephyr, heifer. </p>
<p>Mint, pint, senate and sedate; </p>
<p>Dull, bull, and George ate late. </p>
<p>Scenic, Arabic, Pacific, </p>
<p>Science, conscience, scientific. </p>
<p>Liberty, library, heave and heaven, </p>
<p>Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven. </p>
<p>We say hallowed, but allowed, </p>
<p>People, leopard, towed, but vowed. </p>
<p>Mark the differences, moreover, </p>
<p>Between mover, cover, clover; </p>
<p>Leeches, breeches, wise, precise, </p>
<p>Chalice, but police and lice; </p>
<p>Camel, constable, unstable, </p>
<p>Principle, disciple, label. </p>
<p>Petal, panel, and canal, </p>
<p>Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal. </p>
<p>Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair, </p>
<p>Senator, spectator, mayor. </p>
<p>Tour, but our and succour, four. </p>
<p>Gas, alas, and Arkansas. </p>
<p>Sea, idea, Korea, area, </p>
<p>Psalm, Maria, but malaria. </p>
<p>Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean. </p>
<p>Doctrine, turpentine, marine. </p>
<p>Compare alien with Italian, </p>
<p>Dandelion and battalion. </p>
<p>Sally with ally, yea, ye, </p>
<p>Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key. </p>
<p>Say aver, but ever, fever, </p>
<p>Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver. </p>
<p>Heron, granary, canary. </p>
<p>Crevice and device and aerie. </p>
<p>Face, but preface, not efface. </p>
<p>Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass. </p>
<p>Large, but target, gin, give, verging, </p>
<p>Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging. </p>
<p>Ear, but earn and wear and tear </p>
<p>Do not rhyme with here but ere. </p>
<p>Seven is right, but so is even, </p>
<p>Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen, </p>
<p>Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk, </p>
<p>Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work. </p>
<p>Pronunciation -- think of Psyche! </p>
<p>Is a paling stout and spikey? </p>
<p>Won't it make you lose your wits, </p>
<p>Writing groats and saying grits? </p>
<p>It's a dark abyss or tunnel: </p>
<p>Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale, </p>
<p>Islington and Isle of Wight, </p>
<p>Housewife, verdict and indict. </p>
<p>Finally, which rhymes with enough -- </p>
<p>Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough? </p>
<p>Hiccough has the sound of cup. </p>
<p>My advice is to give up!!!</p>

<p>In order to assure the highest levels of quality work and productivity from employees, it will be our policy to keep all employees well-trained through out program of SPECIAL HIGH INTENSY TRAINING (S.H.I.T.). We are trying to give out employees more S.H.I.T. than anyone else.</p>
<p>If you feel that you do not receive your share of S.H.I.T. on the job, please see your manager. You will be immediately placed at the top of the S.H.I.T. list, and out managers are especially skilled at seeing that you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.</p>
<p>DEPARTMENTAL EMPLOYEE EVALUATION PROGRAMS (D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T.). Those who fail to  take D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go to EMPLOYEE ATTITUDE TRAINING (E.A.T.  S.H.I.T.). Since our managers took S.H.I.T. before they were promoted, they don't have to take S.H.I.T. anymore, and are full of S.H.I.T. already.</p>
<p>If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be interested in a job training others. We can add your name to our BASIC UNDERSTANDING LECTURE LIST (B.U.L.L.S.H.I.T.). Those who are full of B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T. will get the S.H.I.T. jobs, and can apply for promotion to the DIRECTOR OF EXTRA EMPLOYEE PROGRAMMING (D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T.).</p>

30162,"<p>Once upon a time, there was a river. The Nile River, to be exact. On one side of the river lived the rabbit, and on the other side lived the bear.    One fine day, the bear was sitting on a stump, enjoying his breakfest of berries. Then he heard someone yelling at him. It was the rabbit.    ''Hey! Hey, Teddy, get your butt over here. I've got something to show you!''   ''Not now! I'm eating.''    ''Oh come on!'' said the rabbit. ''It's really important.''    ''No way.''    ''Please. It's urgent.''    So the bear decided to go all the way over the wide river.  It took him all day and all night to get over to the other side. He nearly drowned. And when he finally got there he was groaning and panting, and wheezing for air.     ''Well, rabbit,'' he panted. ''What did you want to tell me?''     ''Hey, Teddy,'' the rabbit began, ''look how many berries are on the other side of the river.''</p>

He takes it out for a spin and, while doing so, stops for a red light.  An old man on a moped, both looking about 90 years old, pulls up next to him.The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the car and asks ""What kind of car ya got there, sonny?"".The dude replies ""A 2001 Turbo BeepBeep.  They cost $500,000.""""That's a lotta money!""  says the old man, shocked. ""Why does it cost so much?""""Cause this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!"" states the cool dude proudly.The old man asks ""Can I take a look inside?""""Sure"" replies the owner.So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.  Leaning back on his moped, the old man says ""That's a pretty nice car, alright!""Just then the light changes, so the guy decides to show the old man what his car can do.  He floors it, and within 30 seconds the speedometer reads 320.  Suddenly, the guy notices a dot in his rear view mirror.  It seems to be getting closer!Whhhoooooooooossssshhhhhh! Something whips by him!  Going maybe three times as fast!The guy wonders ""what on earth could be going faster than my Turbo BeepBeeP?""  Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot coming toward him.Whooooooooooosh!  Goes by again!  And, it almost looked like the old man on the moped!  Couldn't be thinks the guy. How could a moped outrun a Turbo BeepBeep?  Again, he sees a dot in his rearview mirror!WhoooooooshhhhhhhhKa-BbbbblaMMMMM!  It plows into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end.The guy jumps out and discovers it is the old man!  Of course, the moped and the old man are hurting for certain.

30169,"<p>One misty Scottish morning a man was driving through the hills to Inverness.</p>
<p>Suddenly out of the mist, a huge red-haired highlander steps into the middle of the road. He's built like a wardrobe and despite the wind and near-freezing temperatures, is only wearing a kilt and a tweed shirt. </p>
<p>At the roadside there also stands a beautiful young woman, slim, shapely, a heart stopper. </p>
<p>The driver's attention is drawn from the woman when the highlander opens the car door and drags the man onto the road.</p>
<p>""Right, you,"" shouts the highlander, ""I want you to masturbate."" </p>
<p>""But...."" stammers the driver. ""Now.... or I'll bloody kill you."" </p>
<p>So the driver turns his back on the girl, drops his trousers and starts to masturbate. Thinking of the girl on the roadside, this only takes a few seconds. </p>
<p>""Right,"" says the highlander, ""Do it again!"" </p>
<p>""But...."" stammers the driver. </p>
<p>""Now! yells the highlander. </p>
<p>So the driver pulls himself off again. </p>
<p>""Right, do it again,"" demands the highlander. This goes on for nearly two hours. </p>
<p>The poor man has cramps in both arms, he has rubbed himself raw and despite the icy wind, has collapsed in a sweating, gibbering heap on the ground.</p>
<p>""Do it again,"" says the highlander. </p>
<p>""I can't,"" whimpers the driver. ""You'll just have to kill me.""</p>
<p>The highlander looks down at this pathetic wreck of a man slumped at his feet. </p>
<p>""All right,"" he says, ""NOW you can give my daughter a lift into Inverness"" </p>

<p>""No, no matter you must die or take the Three Indian Tepee Test."" </p>
<p>""What's the Three Indian Tepee Test?"" </p>
<p>""You must go into first Tepee and drink whole keg beer, then you must go into second tepee and remove sore tooth from lions mouth, then you go to third tepee and make Fat Indian Squaw sexually happy."" </p>
<p>Well neither option is sounding real great to the guy, but he figures anything is better then death, and agrees. So he walks into the first tepee and drinks the whole keg of beer, comes out stumbling and is led to the second tepee. He goes in and immediately there is growling, but a short while later the sound is followed by purring. </p>
<p>Then the man walks out pants half down and slurs, ""Now where is that squaw with the bad tooth?</p>

30210,"<p>Everybody on earth dies and goes to heaven. God comes and says ""I want the men to make two lines. One line for the men that dominated their women on earth and the other line for the men that were whipped by their women. Also, I want all the women to go with St Peter."" Said and done, the next time God looks the women are gone and there are two lines. The line of the men that were whipped was 100 miles long, on the line of men that dominated women there was only one man. God got mad and said. ""You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created you in my image, and you were all whipped by your mates. Look at the only one of my sons that stood up and made me proud, Learn from him!"" Tell them my son how did you manage to be the only one on that line? The man said, ""I don't know. My wife told me to stand here.""</p>

<p>The doctor says, ""Well, I'm not exactly sure what it is, but take these pills for a week, and see if that takes care of it. If not, come back and we'll try something else."" </p>
<p>Bill takes the pills for the week, but unfortunately, the red ring is still there after 7 days. He goes back to his doctor and tells him the pills didn't help. </p>
<p>So the doctor prescribes another medication, capsules this time, and gives him the same instructions. Take them for a week, and come back if it's not improved. Bill takes the capsules for a week, and damn, the red ring is still there. </p>
<p>So he goes back to his doctor and asks, ""What next?"" </p>
<p>The doctor gives him a cream in a tube this time. Rub this on every day for a week, and let me know. </p>

30217,"<p>A man visited his doctor because he had a severe stuttering problem. After a thorough examination, the doctor consulted with the patient.</p>
<p>Doctor: ""It appears that the reason for your stuttering is that your penis is about six inches too long and it is pulling on your vocal cords, thereby causing you this annoying problem of stuttering.""</p>
<p>Patient: ""Ddddd octttor. Whhaaat cccan I dddo?""</p>
<p>The doctor scratches his forehead, thinks for a minute and states that there is a procedure where we can free up the strain on the vocal cords by removing that six inches from the penis, freeing him from this horrible problem.</p>
<p>The patient stuttering badly states that this problem has caused him so much embarrassment, as well as, loss of employment and that anything would be worth it. The doctor plans for the procedure. The operation is a success and six months later the patient comes in for his follow up.</p>
<p>Patient: ""Doctor, the operation was a success. I have not stuttered since the operation. I have a great new job and my self esteem is fantastic. However, there is one problem My wife says that she sort of misses the great sex we used to have before the extra six inches were removed. So I was wondering if it is possible to reattach those six inches?""</p>
<p>The doctor scratched his forehead, thought for a minute and said, ""I dddoonnn't ttthhhinkkkk thatttt wooould bbbbee possssssibbble.""</p>

30225,"<p>Aug. 12 Moved to our new home in Montana. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can hardly wait to see the snow covering them.</p>
<p>Oct. 14 Montana is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves have turned all colors and shades of red and orange. Went for a ride through the beautiful mountains and saw some deer. They are so graceful. Certainly they are the most wonderful animals on earth. This must be paradise! I love it here.</p>
<p>Nov. 11 Deer season will start soon. I can't imagine anyone wanting to kill such a gorgeous creature. Hope it will snow soon. I love it here.</p>
<p>Dec. 2 It snowed last night. Woke up to find everything blanketed with white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleared the snow off the steps and shoveled the driveway. We had a snowball fight, I won. Than the snowplow came by. We had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place! I love Montana!!</p>
<p>Dec. 12 More snow last night. I love it. The snowplow did it's trick again to the driveway. I love it here.</p>
<p>Dec. 19 More snow last night. Couldn't get out of the driveway to get to work. I am exhausted from shoveling. Fucking snowplow.</p>
<p>Dec. 21 More of that fucking white shit fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling snow. I think the snowplow hides around the corner and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. ASSHOLE!!</p>
<p>Dec. 25 Merry Fucking Christmas. More fucking snow!! If I ever get my hands on the son-of-a-bitch who drives the snowplow, I swear I'll kill the bastard. Don't know why they don't use more salt on the roads to melt the fucking ice.</p>
<p>Dec. 27 More of the white shit last night. Been inside for three days except to shovel the driveway each time the fucking snowplow goes by. Can't go anywhere. Car's stuck in a mountain of that shit. The weatherman says to expect another 10"" again tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow 10"" is??</p>
<p>Dec. 28 The fucking weatherman was wrong. We got 34"" of that white shit this time. At this rate it won't melt before summer. The snowplow got stuck down the road and the ASSHOLE came to my door and asked to borrow my shovel. I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all that fucking white shit he had pushed into the driveway. I broke the seventh one over his fucking head.</p>
<p>Jan. 4 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get groceries. On the way back, a fucking deer ran in front of the car and I hit it. About $3,000 damage to the car. Those fucking beasts should all be killed. Wish the bunters had killed them all last November.</p>
<p>May 3 Took the car to the garage in town. Would you believe, the son-of-a-bitch is rusting out from all the salt they put on the roads??</p>
<p>May 10 Moved to Florida. Can't imagine why anyone in their right minds would ever want to live in that fucking state of Montana!!!!</p>

30226,"<p>The Americans and Japanese decided to engage in a boat race. Both teams practiced hard and long to reach their peak performance levels. On the big day they felt ready. The Japanese won by a mile.</p>
<p>The American team was discouraged by the loss. Morale sagged. Corporate management decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found, so a consulting firm was hired to investigate the problem and recommend corrective action.</p>
<p>The consultant's finding: The Japanese team had eight people rowing and one person steering: the American team had one person rowing and eight people steering.</p>
<p>After a year of study and millions spent analyzing the problem, the consultant firm concluded that too many people were steering and not enough were rowing on the American team. So as race day neared again the following year, the American's team management structure was completely reorganized. The new structure: four steering managers, three area steering managers, and a new performance review system for the person rowing the boat to provide work incentive. The next year, the Japanese won by TWO miles!</p>
<p>Humiliated, the American corporation laid off the rower for poor performance and gave the managers a bonus for discovering the problem.</p>

30228,"<p>Subject: MOUSE BALLS<br /> &gt; How To Replace Mouse Balls<br /> I don't know how they wrote this with a straight face. This was a real memo sent out by a computer company (IBM) to its employees in all seriousness.  It went to all field engineers about a computer peripheral problem. The author of this memo was quite genuine. The engineers rolled on the floor! Especially note the last couple of sentences.</p>
<p>Re: Replacement of Mouse Balls.<br /> If a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Mouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Units). </p>
<p>Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel. Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls.</p>
<p>Ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist-off method.</p>
<p>Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge. Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used immediately.</p>
<p>It is recommended that each person have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.  Any customer missing his balls should contact the local personnel in charge of removing and replacing these necessary items.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that a customer without properly working balls is an unhappy customer.</p>

30234,"<p>A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have<br /> dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the<br /> girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would<br /> like to go out and make love for the first time. </p>
<p>Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so<br /> he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The<br /> pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy<br /> everything there is to know about condoms and sex. </p>
<p>At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms<br /> he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy<br /> insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather<br /> busy, it being his first time and all. </p>
<p>That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and<br /> meets his girlfriend at the door. ""Oh, I'm so excited for you to<br /> meet my parents, come on in!"" </p>
<p>The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the<br /> girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace<br /> and bows his head. </p>
<p>A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his<br /> head down. </p>
<p>10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. </p>
<p>Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend<br /> leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, ""I had no idea you<br /> were this religious."" </p>
<p>The boy turns, and whispers back, ""I had no idea your father was<br /> a pharmacist.""</p>

30236,"<p>A blonde goes for a job interview in an office. The interviewer decides to start with the basics. ""So, miss, can you tell us your age, please?""<br /> The blonde counts carefully on her fingers for about 30 seconds before replying ""Ehhhh .. 22!"".<br /> The interviewer tries another straightforward one to break the ice. ""And can you tell us your height, please?"".<br /> The young lady stands up and produces a measuring tape from her handbag. She then traps one end under her foot and extends the tape to the top of her head. She checks the measurement and announces ""Five foot two!"".<br /> This isn't looking good so the interviewer goes for the real basics. ""And ehh, just to confirm for our records, your name please?""<br /> The blonde bobs her head from side to side for about twenty seconds, mouthing something silently to herself, before replying ""Mandy!"".<br /> The interviewer is completely baffled at this stage, so he asks ""Just out of curiosity, miss. We can understand your counting on your fingers to work out your age, and the measuring tape for your height is obvious, but what were you doing when we asked you your name?""<br /> ""Ohh that!"", replies the blonde, ""That's just me running through 'Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you....' ""</p>

30267,"<p>A blonde went to a flight school insisting she wanted to learn to fly that day. As all the planes were currently in use, the owner agreed to instruct her on how to pilot the helicopter solo by radio. He took her out, showed her how to start it and gave her the basics, and sent her on her way. After she climbed 1000 feet, she radioed in. ""I'm doing great! I love it!

The instructor watched her climb over 3000 feet, and was beginning to worry that she hadn't radioed in. A few minutes later, he watched in horror as she crashed about half a mile away. He ran over and pulled her from the wreckage. When he asked what happened, she said: ""I don't know! Everything was going fine, but as I got higher, I was starting to get cold. I can't remember anything after I turned off the big fan.""</p>

<p>"" ow is that so? Well, if your not drunk, what time is it?"" </p>
<p>The drunk man raised his arm, as if to point at something,<br /> and raised the other arm to cross the first arm over and<br /> said, "" It's 12:43!""</p>
<p>""Amazing!"" said the policeman. It was indeed 12:43! ""How<br /> did you do that?""</p>
<p>""Hee, hee, hee, magic!"" he said in a drunk voice. This<br /> happened for 2 more times and the drunk man got it right<br /> every time. The policeman puzzled that for a moment and<br /> left only to come back to ask the drunk man how he did it.</p>
<p>""Oh ok! Don't push me!"" he said. "" I'll tell you how I did<br /> it only if you sit with me in this puddle."" </p>
<p>"" What? No, I'm not sitting in that puddle."" said the<br /> policeman.</p>

<p>"" Well,ok, but only if you promise to tell me your trick.""</p>
<p>""Ya, ya I will.""</p>
<p>So the policeman stepped in the puddle, and sat down near<br /> the drunk man. "" Ok, I'm in the puddle, now what?""</p>

It was either there or in the vanilla shake 6. Turns out the rumors about Grimace and Mayor     McCheese are true 5. We're experimenting with a new even happier Happy     Meal 4. So what - a regular Big Mac is 60% latex anyway 3. Employees too embarrassed to say ''Would you like     condoms with that'' 2. Drive-thru speaker broken-''Coke with lots of ice''      sounded like ''Prophylactic device'' 1. When you're serving billions and billions, you can't     be too careful.</p>

30294,"<p>One of the great joys of modern American English is the enthusiasm we have for new words and word usages.  It drives the folk for whom English is a Second (or fourth or tenth) Language, absolutely nuts I hear...   You've heard the slang phrase 'Going Postal'.   Here are some more examples, from the book  'Jargon Watch', just published by Wired magazine:     -------------------------  Going Postal - Euphemism for being totally  stressed out, for losing it.  Makes reference to  the unfortunate track record of postal employees  who have snapped and gone on shooting rampages.      -------------------------Alpha Geek - The most knowledgeable, technically  proficient person in an office or work group.   'Ask Larry, he's the alpha geek around here.'Assmosis - The process by which some people seem  to absorb success and advancement by kissing up  to the boss rather than working hard.Beepilepsy - The brief seizure people sometimes  have when their beeper goes off (especially in  vibrator mode).  Characterized by physical  spasms, goofy facial expressions, and  interruption of speech in midsentence.Chips and Salsa - Chips = hardware, salsa =  software.  'Well, first we gotta figure out if  the problem's in your chips or your salsa.'Crapplet - A badly written or profoundly useless  Java or Active-X applet.  'I just wasted 30  minutes downloading this stinkin' crapplet!'Dancing Baloney - Little animated GIFs and other  Web F/X that are useless and serve simply to  impress clients.  'This page is kinda dull.   Maybe a little dancing baloney will help.'Depotphobia - Fear associated with entering a  Home Depot because of how much money one might  spend.  Electronics geeks experience  Shackophobia.Flight Risk - Used to describe employees who are  suspected of planning to leave a company or  department soon.404 - Someone who's clueless.  From the World  Wide Web error message '404 Not Found,' meaning  that the requested document could not be  located.  'Don't bother asking him  . . . he's 404, man.'Generica - Features of the American landscape  - both urban and rural - which is  indistinguishable from anywhere else.  'We were  so lost in generica, I actually forgot what city  we were in.'GOOD Job - A 'Get-Out-Of-Debt' job.  A  well-paying job people take in order to pay off  their debts, one that they will quit as soon as  they are solvent again.Irritainment - Entertainment and media spectacles  that are annoying, but you find yourself unable  to stop watching them.  The O.J. trials were a  prime example.Keyboard Plaque - The disgusting buildup of dirt  and crud found on computer keyboards.Midair Passenger Exchange - Grim  air-traffic-controller-speak for a head-on  collision.  Midair passenger exchanges are  quickly followed by 'aluminum rain.'Nyetscape - Nickname for AOL's  less-than-full-featured Web browser.Ohnosecond - That miniscule fraction of time in  which you realize that you've just made a BIG  mistake.  Seen in Elizabeth P. Crowe's book The  Electronic Traveller.PEBCAK - Tech support shorthand for 'Problem  Exists Between Chair and Keyboard.' (Techies are  a frustrated, often arrogant lot.  They've  submitted numerous acronyms and terms that poke  fun at the clueless users who call them up with  frighteningly stupid questions.  Another  variation on the above is ID10T: 'This guy has  an ID-Ten-T on his system.')Percussive Maintenance - The fine art of whacking  the crap out of an electronic device to get it  to work again.Prairie Dogging - When someone yells or drops  something loudly in a 'cube farm' (an office  full of cubicles) and everyone's heads pop up  over the walls to see what's going on.Seagull Manager - A manager who flies in, makes a  lot of noise, sh-ts over everything and then  leaves.Square-headed Girlfriend - Another word for a  computer.  The victim of a square-headed  girlfriend is a 'computer widow.'Telephone Number Salary - A salary (or project  budget) that has seven digits.Tourists - People who take training classes just  to get a vacation from their jobs.  'We had  about three serious students in the class; the  rest were tourists.'Umfriend - A sexual relation of dubious standing.   'This is Dale, my...um...friend...'Uninstalled - Euphemism for being fired.  Heard  on the voicemail of a vice president at a  downsizing computer firm: 'You have reached the  number of an uninstalled vice president.  Please  dial our main number and ask the operator for  assistance.' See also Decruitment.Vulcan Nerve Pinch - The taxing hand position  required to reach all of the appropriate keys  for certain commands.  For instance, the warm  boot for a Mac II involves simultaneously  pressing the Control key, the Command key, the  Return key and the Power On key.Yuppie Food Coupons  - The ubiquitous $20 bills  spewed out of ATMs everywhere.  Often used when  trying to split the bill after a meal: 'We all  owe $8 each, but all anybody's got is yuppie  food coupons.' (Also called: 'Yuppie Food  Stamps.')</p>

30329,"<p>A newly discovered chapter in the Book of Genesis has provided the answer to 'Where do pets come from?'</p>
<p>Adam said, 'Lord, when I was in the garden, you walked with me every day. Now I do not see you any more. I am lonesome here and it is difficult for me to remember how much you love me.'</p>
<p>And God said 'No problem. I will create a companion for you that will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you so that you will love me even when you cannot see me. Regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as I do, in spite of yourself.'</p>
<p>And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam. And it was a good animal. And God was pleased. And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and it wagged its tail. </p>
<p>And Adam said,<br /> 'Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom and I cannot think of a name for this new animal.' </p>
<p>And God said,<br /> 'No problem. Because I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you his name will be a reflection of my own name, and you will call him Dog.'</p>
<p>And Dog lived with Adam and was a companion to him and loved him. And Adam was comforted. And God was pleased. And Dog was content and wagged his tail.</p>
<p>After a while, it came to pass that Adam's guardian angel came to the Lord and said,<br /> 'Lord, Adam has become filled with pride. He struts and preens like a peacock and he believes he is worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed taught him that he is loved, but perhaps too well.'</p>
<p>And the Lord said, 'No problem. I will create for him a companion who will be with him forever and who will see him as he is. The companion will remind him of his limitations, so he will know that he is not always worthy of adoration.'</p>
<p>And God created Cat to be a companion to Adam. And Cat would not obey Adam. And when Adam gazed into Cat's eyes, he was reminded that he was not the Supreme Being. And Adam learned humility.</p>
<p>And God was pleased. And Adam was greatly improved. And Dog was happy. </p>

<li>JUST PLAIN BAD LUCK A fierce gust of wind blew 45-year-old Vittorio Luise's car into a river near Naples, Italy, in 1983. He managed to break a window, climb out and swim to shore -- where a tree blew over and killed him.</li>

<li>ALWAYS LOOK BOTH WAYS Mike Stewart, 31, of Dallas was filming a movie in 1983 on the dangers of low-level bridges when the truck he was standing on passed under a low-level bridge -- killing him.</li>

<li>TAKE NOVOCAINE Walter Hallas, a 26-year-old store clerk in Leeds, England, was so afraid of dentists that in 1979 he asked a fellow worker to try to cure his toothache by punching him in the jaw. The punch caused Hallas to fall down, hitting his head, and he died of a fractured skull.</li>

<ul>
<li>NEVER RETURN TO THE SCENE George Schwartz, owner of a factory in Providence, R.I., narrowly escaped death when a 1983 blast flattened his factory except for one wall. After treatment for minor injuries, he returned to the scene to search for files. The remaining wall then collapsed on him, killing him.</li>

<li>POOR SUCKER Depressed since he could not find a job, 42-year-old Romolo Ribolla sat in his kitchen near Pisa, Italy, with a gun in his hand threatening to kill himself in 1981.

30346,"<p>The following appeared in a computer magazine in Mr. Dvorak's<br /> column: </p>
<p>Dear Mr. Dvorak: </p>
<p>Ann Landers wouldn't print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I<br /> have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling<br /> on. Let me try and explain. It's about my son, Billy. He's<br /> always been a good, normal ten year old boy. Well, last spring<br /> we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy. We<br /> sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps<br /> with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire--you<br /> know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight<br /> reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in<br /> Tibetan knot tying. </p>
<p>I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It's where he went<br /> last year. (He made an adorable picture out of painted pinto<br /> beans and macaroni). Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a<br /> brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We<br /> should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known.<br /> He left three weeks ago. I don't know what's happened. He's<br /> changed. I can't explain it. See for yourself. These are some of<br /> my little Billy's letters. </p>
<p>**********<br /> Dear Mom,<br /> The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the<br /> only good part. We're learning how to program. Late at night is<br /> the best time to program, so they let us stay up.<br /> Love, Billy.</p>
<p>**********<br /> Dear Mom,<br /> Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night.<br /> We all get to choose what we want to drink. I drink Classic<br /> Coke. By the way, can you make Szechuan food? I'm getting used<br /> to it now. Gotta go, it's time for the flowchart class.<br /> Love, Billy.<br /> P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh?<br /> It's spell checked too.</p>
<p>**********<br /> Dear Mom,<br /> Don't worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by<br /> the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I<br /> don't have much of a tan 'cause we don't go outside very often.<br /> You can't see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That<br /> wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off,<br /> Mom. I'm okay, really.<br /> Love, Billy.</p>
<p>**********<br /> Dear Mom,<br /> I'm fine. I'm sleeping enough. I'm eating enough. This is the<br /> best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm<br /> code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Frederick says<br /> it's okay. Can you send more money? I spent mine on a pocket<br /> protector and a box of blank diskettes. I've got to chip in on<br /> the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a<br /> computer? Give my regards to Dad.<br /> Love, Billy.</p>
<p>**********<br /> Dear Mother,<br /> Forget the money for the telephone. We've got a way to not pay.<br /> Sorry I haven't written. I've been learning a lot. I'm real good<br /> at getting onto any computer in the country. It's really easy! I<br /> got into the university's in less than fifteen minutes.<br /> Frederick did it in five, he's going to show me how. Frederick<br /> is my bunk partner. He's really smart. He says that I shouldn't<br /> call myself Billy anymore. So, I'm not.<br /> Signed, William.</p>
<p>**********<br /> Dear Mother,<br /> How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why'd you get so<br /> upset? I haven't gained that much weight. The glasses aren't<br /> real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me,<br /> the tape on them is cool. I thought that you'd be proud of my<br /> program. After all, I've made some money on it. A publisher is<br /> sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I've paid for the next six<br /> weeks of camp. I won't be home until late August.<br /> Regards, William.</p>
<p>**********<br /> Mother,<br /> Stop treating me like a child. True--physically I am only ten<br /> years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try<br /> again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the<br /> bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not<br /> kidding. O.K.? I won't write again and this is your only<br /> warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain<br /> me.<br /> Sincerely, William.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>See what I mean? It's been two weeks since I've heard from my<br /> little boy. What can I do, Mr. Dvorak? I know that it's probably<br /> too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these<br /> letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming,<br /> please, I beg of you to do so. Thank you very much. </p>

30355,"<p>Put THIS in your toaster...Veteran Pillsbury spokesman Pop N. Fresh died yesterday.   A severe yeast infection is blamed for shortening his life.  He was 71.Fresh was buried in one of the largest funeral ceremonies in recent years. Dozens of celebrities turned out, including Mrs. Butterworth,  the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty Crocker, and the Hostess Twinkies. The graveside was piled high with flours as longtime friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who  'never knew how much he was kneaded.'Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with many turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes, and loafing around. Still, even as a crusty old man, he was a roll model for millions.Fresh is survived by his second wife, a real tart. They have two children and one in the oven.  The funeral will be tomorrow, at 350 for about 20 minutes.</p>

"
30357,"<p>This is a VERY simple way to understand the tax laws. Read on -- it does make you think!!</p>
<p>Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand. Suppose that every day, ten men go out for dinner. The bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:</p>
<p>The first four men -- the poorest -- would pay nothing; the fifth would pay $1, the sixth would pay $3, the seventh $7, the eighth $12, the ninth $18, and the tenth man -- the richest -- would pay $59.</p>
<p>That's what they decided to do. The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement -- until one day, the owner threw them a curve (in tax language a tax cut).</p>
<p>""Since you are all such good customers,"" he said, ""I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20."" So now dinner for the ten only cost $80.00.</p>
<p>The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. But what about the other six -- the paying customers? How could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his ""fair share?""</p>
<p>The six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, Then the fifth man and the sixth man would end up being PAID to eat their meal. So the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.</p>
<p>And so the fifth man paid nothing, the sixth pitched in $2, the seventh paid $5, the eighth paid $9, the ninth paid $12, leaving the tenth man with a bill of $52 instead of his earlier $59. Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free.</p>
<p>But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings. ""I only got a dollar out of the $20,"" declared the sixth man who pointed to the tenth. ""But he got $7!""</p>
<p>""Yeah, that's right,"" exclaimed the fifth man, ""I only saved a dollar, too... It's unfair that he got seven times more than me!"".</p>
<p>""That's true!"" shouted the seventh man, ""why should he get $7 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!""</p>
<p>""Wait a minute,"" yelled the first four men in unison, ""We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!""</p>
<p>The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up. The next night he didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered, a little late what was very important. They were FIFTY-TWO DOLLARS short of paying the bill! Imagine that!</p>
<p>And that, boys and girls, journalists and college instructors, is how the tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up at the table any more.</p>
<p>Where would that leave the rest? Unfortunately, most taxing authorities anywhere cannot seem to grasp this rather straightforward logic!</p>

The next day the racing sheets carried this headline:</p>

30404,"<p>I told my wife that a husband is like a fine wine; he gets better with age. The next day, she locked me in the cellar.</p>
<p>I tried a mail order bride, once, but she was damaged in the mail, and I had to return the unused part for my full refund.</p>
<p>I want a husband who is decent, God-fearing, well-educated, smart, sincere, respectful, treats me as an equal, has a great body, and has the same interests in life as me. Now I don't think that's too much to ask of a billionaire, do you?</p>
<p>I was engaged myself once. To a contortionist. But she broke it off.</p>
<p>If you want your spouse to listen and pay strict attention to every word you say, talk in your sleep.</p>
<p>John, you know I can't marry you. You are an accountant. I prefer a man who builds things, who makes things, like an engineer who...makes half-a-million dollars a year...</p>
<p>Keep thy eyes wide open before marriage, and half shut afterward.</p>
<p>Life's a bitch, and then you marry one.</p>
<p>Life sucks...and then you marry someone who doesn't!</p>
<p>Look the bride in the eye and ask, ""If I'm the best man, how come you're marrying HIM???""</p>
<p>Losing a wife can be hard. In my case, it was almost impossible.</p>
<p>Love is a thousand miles long, but comes in six inch installments.</p>
<p>Love is a word composed of two vowels, two consonants, and two fools.</p>
<p>Love is the dawn of marriage, and marriage is the sunset of love.</p>
<p>Love may conquer everything, but it needs Time as its Field General.</p>
<p>Love thy neighbor, but make sure her husband is away first.</p>
<p>Make love, not war, or do both: get married.</p>
<p>Man and wife make one fool.</p>
<p>Many a wife thinks her husband is the world's greatest lover. But she can never catch him at it.</p>
<p>Marital Logic: 1) Marriage is an institution. 2) Marriage is love. 3) Love is blind. Therefore, marriage is an institution for the blind.</p>
<p>Marry not a tennis player. For love means nothing to them.</p>
<p>May the bluebird of happiness crap all over your wedding cake.</p>
<p>May you be blessed with a wife so healthy and strong, she can pull the plow when your horse drops dead.</p>
<p>May you be too good for the world and not good enough for your wife.</p>
<p>May you grow so rich your widow's second husband never has to worry about a living, God forbid.</p>
<p>May you learn to perform miracles: earn a living and marry off your daughters.</p>
<p>May you live as long as long as you want to, and may you want to as long as you live!</p>
<p>May you live happily ever after with a poor, ugly, shrewish wife.</p>
<p>May you never leave your marriage alive.</p>
<p>May your clock run slow, your heart fast, your bile over, your wife away, your nose always.</p>
<p>May your daughters marry men of substance: gypsies with two bears.</p>
<p>May your wife be a witch who takes after her mother, and may you all live together in a one-room house.</p>

30423,"<p>===============================A letter from the Smithsonian Institute:No matter what you might have read, this is parody.  IT ISN'T REAL.===============================Paleoanthropology Division Smithsonian Institute 207 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20078Dear Sir:Thank you for your latest submission to the Institute, labeled '211-D, layer seven, next to the clothesline post. Hominid skull.' We have given this specimen a careful and detailed examination, and regret to inform you that we disagree with your theory that it represents 'conclusive proof of the presence of Early Man in Charleston County two million years ago.' Rather, it appears that what you have found is the head of a Barbie doll, of the variety one of our staff, who has small children, believes to be the 'Malibu Barbie'. It is evident that you have given a great deal of thought to the analysis of this specimen, and you may be quite certain that those of us who are familiar with your prior work in the field were loathe to come to contradiction with your findings.However, we do feel that there are a number of physical attributes of the specimen which might have tipped you off to it's modern origin: 1. The material is molded plastic. Ancient hominid remains are typically fossilized bone.  2. The cranial capacity of the specimen is approximately 9 cubic centimeters, well below the threshold of even the earliest identified proto-hominids.  3. The dentition pattern evident on the 'skull' is more consistent with the common domesticated canine (dog) than it is with the 'ravenous man-eating Pliocene clams' you speculate roamed the wetlands during that time. This latter finding is certainly one of the most intriguing hypotheses you have submitted in your history with this institution, but the evidence seems to weigh rather heavily against it.Without going into too much detail, let us say that: A. The specimen looks like the head of a Barbie doll that a dog has chewed on.  B. Clams don't have teeth.It is with feelings tinged with melancholy that we must deny your request to have the specimen carbon dated. This is partially due to the heavy load our lab must bear in its normal operation, and partly due to carbon dating's notorious inaccuracy in fossils of recent geologic record. To the best of our knowledge, no Barbie dolls were produced prior to 1956 AD, and carbon dating is likely to produce wildly inaccurate results.    Sadly, we must also deny your request that we approach the National Science Foundation's Phylogeny Department with the concept of assigning your specimen the scientific name 'Australopithecus spiff-arino.' Speaking personally, I, for one, fought tenaciously for the acceptance of your proposed taxonomy, but was ultimately voted     down because the species name you selected was hyphenated, and didn't really sound like it might be Latin.However, we gladly accept your generous donation of this fascinating specimen to the museum. While it is undoubtedly not a hominid fossil it is, nonetheless, yet another riveting example of      the great body of work you seem to accumulate here so effortlessly. You should know that our Director has reserved a special shelf in his own office for the display of the specimens you have previously submitted to the Institution, and the entire staff speculates daily on what you will happen upon next in your digs at the site you have discovered in your back yard.We eagerly anticipate your trip to our nation's capital that you proposed in your last letter, and several of us are pressing the Director to pay for it. We are particularly interested in hearing you expand on your theories surrounding the 'trans-positating fillifitation of ferrous ions in a structural matrix' that makes the excellent juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex femur you recently discovered take on the deceptive appearance of a rusty 9-mm Sears Craftsman  automotive crescent wrench.Yours in Science,Harvey Rowe Curator, Antiquities</p>

This city is a beehive of industry and activity, a monument to free enterprise and commerce, but behind these shops and warehouses, hidden from public view, is the sordid story of a condiment gone terribly wrong.      ""I'm talking about duck sauce.  You've probably seen or tried it before, those little orange packets tossed in with your Chinese take-out meals.  But look closely at them...those little floating bits aren't apricot...they're real duck.

We went to the office of its manager, Mr. Chum Lee, to get some answers.""      *knock* *knock*     ""Hello?  Mr. Lee?  It's Mike Walrus, of 60 Seconds, I'd like to ask you a few questions.""

While walking toward the subway for their return trip to the suburbs, they passed a bar. The alcoholic, hearing the loud music and seeing the lights, could not stop himself. His buddies accompanied him into the bar, where he had a shot of whiskey. No sooner had he replaced the shot glass on the bar, he fell off his stool, stone cold dead. His companions, somewhat shaken, left the bar, realising how seriously they must take the doctor's words. As they walked along, they came upon a cigarette butt lying on the ground, still burning. The homosexual looked at the chain smoker and said, ""If you bend over to pick that up, we're both dead.""</p>

<p> Ladies - Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your forehead. The throbbing will go away.</p>
<p>Real Women - Take a lime, mix it with tequila, chill and drink. You might still have the headache, but who cares?</p>
<p> Ladies - Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to prevent ice cream drips.</p>

30519,"<p>This is a bricklayer's accident report that was printed in the newsletter of<br /> the English equivalent of the Workers' Compensation Board.<br /> Dear Sir;<br /> I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block<br /> #3 of the accident reporting form. I put ""Poor Planning"" as the cause of my<br /> accident. You asked for a more complete explanation and I trust the following<br /> details will be sufficient.<br /> I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on<br /> the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I found I had<br /> some bricks left over which, when weighed later, were found to weigh 240 lbs.<br /> Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel<br /> by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building at the sixth<br /> floor.<br /> Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the<br /> barrel out, and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope,<br /> holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240 lbs of bricks. You will<br /> note on the accident reporting form that my weight is 135 lbs. Due to my<br /> surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind<br /> and forgot to let go of the rope.<br /> Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In<br /> the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding<br /> downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the fractured skull,<br /> minor abrasions, and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3, accident<br /> reporting form.<br /> Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the<br /> fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley which I<br /> mentioned in Paragraph 2 of this correspondence. Fortunately, by this time I had<br /> regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite<br /> of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.<br /> At approximately the same time however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground<br /> and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks,<br /> the barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight.<br /> As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the building.<br /> In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts<br /> for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and<br /> lower body.<br /> Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to<br /> slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and<br /> fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.<br /> I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain,<br /> unable to move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again lost<br /> my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope.</p>

I cut my hand on broken glass.  A broken glass did cause that gash.         I have nothing, nothing to hide.  My friend, he took me for a ride.         Did you take this person's life?  Did you do it with a knife?         I did not do it with a knife.  I did not, could not kill my wife.  I did not do this awful crime.  I could not, would not anytime.         Did you hit her from above?  Did you drop this bloody glove?         I did not hit her from above.  I cannot even wear that glove.  I did not do it with a knife.  I did not, could not kill my wife.         I did not do this awful crime.  I could not, would not, not anytime.         And now I'm free, I can return  To my house for which I yearn.  And to my family whom I love.  Hey now I'm free -- Give back my glove!!</p>

<p>With a great deal of embarrassment, the young redneck explained<br /> their situation. The doctor took out his charts and books for<br /> adolescents and carefully explained the birds and the bees. The<br /> two looked bewilderedly at each other, then at the doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor attempted to explain in various ways and terms the<br /> ins and outs of human reproduction. The same result.</p>
<p>Finally, exasperated, the doctor laid the bride on the<br /> examination table, removed all her clothing, and had 2 hours of<br /> wild sex with her, all while she squeeled with delight, orgasm<br /> after orgasm.</p>
<p>Finally finished, he then turned to the young hillbilly and<br /> asked, ""NOW do you understand?""</p>
<p>""Yes, doctor,"" the hillbilly responded, ""but just one question.""</p>
<p>Slapping his forehead in total disbelief, the doctor squawked,<br /> ""Yes, WHAT is it now?""</p>

30571,"<p>How To Drive Them Crazy!Here are some ideas to drive men/women crazy. Now, this is only a joke, so don't try this at home!!  ;-)To make the MEN crazy:1.  Take the batteries out of all the remotes in the house. (Hide them well.)2.  Organize his workshop, bedroom, or other special place.3.  Bribe his faithful dog away from him with a steady diet of Ring Dings.4.  Shrink his underwear in the dryer and when he complains, innocently suggest that he's gained a few pounds.5.  Stare at his forehead and when he notices, casually ask if there is any history of male pattern baldness on his mother's side.6.  'Accidentally' fill the gas tank of his new Porsche with diesel.7.  Repeatedly misplace the cordless phone, preferably in a different room each time.8.  Repeatedly lose his cellular phone in restaurants around town.9.  Loan his precious cellular phone to a pregnant girlfriend who 'needs it more than he does.'10.  Insist upon a lot of 'meaningful conversations.'11.  If you live together, have your mother fly in for a month-long visit unannounced.12.  Reverse his contact lenses in their case.13.  Snip a small hole in his fishing waders, then follow him with a camera to capture his 'sinking' on film.14.  Superglue the pages of his Little Black Book together.15.  Give the secret stash of dirty magazines that he thinks you don't know about to his younger brother, who he hates. To make the WOMEN crazy: 1.  Call her by the dog's name and then deny it.2.  Answer all her questions with a question, preferably one on a totally different subject.3.  Superglue the commode seat in the up position.4.  Shrink her jeans and when she overreacts because she thinks that she's gaining weight, give her a condescending smile and say that you prefer her with some meat on her bones.5.  Firmly refuse to ever ask for directions even if you find yourself in Georgia when your original destination was California.6.  Call her by your mother's name and then deny it.7.  Start a conversation with the dog in the middle of one with her.8.  Buy her power tools for Valentine's Day.9.  Never give her a straight answer.10.  Take up yodeling and practice a lot.11.  Quote Tim Allen to validate your position during arguments. (Argh! Argh! Argh!)12.  Leave the newspaper open to an ad for plastic surgery.13.  Pretend you forgot how to speak English.14.  Answer every question with 'Yes, dear.' (Use with caution as PMS is a valid murder defense in many states.)</p>

30605,"<p>It was spring in the old west. The cowboys rode the still snow-choked trails looking for cattle that survived the winter. As one cowboy's horse went around the narrow trail, it came upon a rattlesnake warming itself in the spring sunshine. The horse reared and the cowboy drew his six-gun to shoot the snake.""Hold on there, partner,"" said the snake, ""don't shoot - I'm an enchanted rattlesnake, and if you don't shoot me, I'll give you any three wishes you want.""The cowboy decided to take a chance. He knew he was safely out of the snake's striking range. He said, ""OK, first, I'd like to have a face like Clark Gable, then, I'd like a body like Arnold Schwarzenagger, and finally, I'd like sexual equipment like this horse I'm, riding.""The rattlesnake said, ""All right, when you get back to the bunk house you'll have all three wishes.""The cowboy turned his horse around and galloped at full speed all the way to the bunk house. He dismounted on the run and went straight inside to the mirror. Staring back at him in the mirror was the face of Clark Gable. He ripped the shirt off his back and revealed bulging, rippling muscles, just like Arnold Schwarzenagger's.Really excited now, he tore down his jeans, looked at his crotch and shouted, ""My God, I forgot I was riding the Mare!"".</p>

30607,"<p>A traveling salesman checked into a futuristic motel. Realizing he needed a haircut before his next day's meeting, he called down to ""I'm afraid not, sir,"" the clerk told him, ""but down the hall is a special machine that should serve your purposes.""</p>
<p>Skeptical but intrigued, the salesman located the appropriate machine, inserted fifty cents, and stuck his head in the opening, at which time the machine started to buzz and whirl. Fifteen seconds later the salesman pulled out his head and surveyed his head in the mirror, which reflected the best haircut he ever received in his life.</p>
<p>Down the hall was another machine with a sign that read, ""Manicures 25 cents."" ""Why not?"" thought the salesman. He paid the money, inserted his hands into the slot, and pulled them out perfectly manicured.</p>
<p>The next machine had a huge sign that read, ""This Machine Provides What Men Need Most When Away from Their Wives - cost 50 cents."" The salesman was embarrassed and looked both ways. Seeing nobody around he put in fifty cents, then unzipped his pants and stuck his ""thing"" into the opening -  with great anticipation, since he had been away from his wife for two weeks.</p>
<p>When the machine started buzzing, the guy let out a shriek of agony. Fifteen seconds later it shut off and, with trembling hands, the salesman was able to withdraw his ""thingy""...</p>

<p>His mother made no reply, and the guy was about to repeat it, when she turned to him and said calmly, ""You're gay? Doesn't that mean you put other men's penises in your mouth?"" </p>
<p>Nervously, the guy said, ""Uh, yeah, Mom, well I guess so."" </p>

30616,"<p>After a long life, dutifully serving his parishioners, the elderly priest<br /> died. He found himself in Heaven, where he was warmly greeted by St. Peter.<br /> ""Welcome,"" St. Peter said, ""You have lived a good life. Let me take you to your<br /> quarters, and then I'll show you around Heaven.""</p>
<p>St. Peter took the man to a rather plain building, and escorted him to a small<br /> room. The room was humbly furnished, but was functional. The priest was a bit<br /> surprised, having expected Heaven to be a bit more extravagent, but he was happy<br /> to be there.</p>
<p>They then began their tour of Heaven, and it was absolutely beautiful. The<br /> priest felt silly for his initial resentment over his room.</p>
<p>Finally, they came upon an enormous mansion. A butler opened the door to the<br /> mansion and a man came out, dressed to the nines, and proceeded down a long<br /> walkway to the front gate, as servants rolled a red carpet before him. When he<br /> reached the gate, a chauffeured limousine pulled up, and the man got in. It<br /> drove off.</p>
<p>""Was that God,"" the priest asked, stunned by the display.</p>
<p>""Oh heavens no,"" replied St. Peter. ""That was a lawyer.""</p>
<p>""I don't want to seem ungrateful, but can you answer a question for me?"" The<br /> priest continued, ""I spent my entire life devoted to my parishioners, and<br /> teaching the gospel, and I have very humble quarters in Heaven. I just don't<br /> understand what that lawyer did, which would merit such a beautiful mansion.""</p>
<p>""It isn't what he did,"" St. Peter replied. ""You see, we have thousands upon<br /> thousands of priests up here. But he's our first lawyer.""</p>

30638,"<p>The Heavy Thinker</p>
<p>It started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker.</p>
<p>I began to think alone - ""to relax,"" I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time.</p>
<p>I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.</p>
<p>I began to avoid friends at lunch time so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, ""What is it exactly we are doing here?"".</p>
<p>Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's.</p>
<p>I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, ""Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job."" This gave me a lot to think about.</p>
<p>I came home early after my conversation with the boss.<br /> ""Honey,"" I confessed, ""I've been thinking...""</p>
<p>""I know you've been thinking,"" she said, ""and I want a divorce!""</p>
<p>""But Honey, surely it's not that serious.""</p>
<p>""It is serious,"" she said, lower lip aquiver. ""You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!""</p>
<p>""That's a faulty syllogism,"" I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I'd had enough. ""I'm going to the library,"" I snarled as I stomped out the door.</p>
<p>I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with a PBS station on the radio. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed.</p>
<p>To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night.</p>
<p>As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. ""Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?"" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.</p>
<p>Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was ""Porky's."" Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting.</p>
<p>I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home.<br /> Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.</p>

<p>When the second young woman came back, she was very happy, too.  ""I'm going to have a girl!  The doctor said that if I was on top, I would have a girl.""</p>

The nurses walked the patient in the hall<br /> as ordered, and after the third day the nurse told how he complained bitterly<br /> each time they did. The surgeon told them to keep walking him.<br /> After a week, the patient was ready to go. His family came to pick him up and<br /> thanked the surgeon profusely for what he had done for their father. The surgeon<br /> was pleased and appreciated the thanks, but told them that it was really a<br /> simple operation and we had been lucky to get him in time.

"
30649,"<p>Are you a wealthy and successful suit-and-tie yuppie businessman who has always had a secret dream that you would one day become a redneck? </p>
<p>Have you always wanted to be a Bubba, but didn�t know how? </p>
<p>Is there an inner Cletus inside just hollering to get out?</p>
<p>Well, now you CAN be a redneck! </p>
<p>You will only have to purchase the following: one pair of overalls, one pack of chewing tobacco and six cases of beer. That�s all you will need to start! </p>
<p>Caution: These instructions MUST be followed in your BUSINESS OFFICE. </p>
<p>1) You are a dignified, well-groomed yuppie executive with an important professional job; therefore, as you read this, it is assumed you are wearing a pair of well-polished $800 Brooks Brothers black dress shoes and silk socks, a $2,000 pinstriped Armani business suit tailored for you, a $150 silk necktie with matching pocket square and suspenders, a starched white shirt, monogrammed cufflinks, silver tiepin and a Rolex.</p>
<p>FIRST, untie and remove high-and-mighty mirror-shined leather shoes. Peel off fancy socks. </p>
<p>DO THIS NOW! It is NOT optional!</p>
<p>Be warned: these shoes and socks have been vital to your identity until now, so don�t deceive yourself - this will be a challenge. They MUST be removed to move forward into the wonderful new world that awaits you. </p>
<p>Note: This will also work with Johnston &amp; Murphy wingtips or those Italian loafers with those little tassels on them.</p>
<p>2) Stuff silk socks in shiny shoes and drop in garbage can. </p>
<p>3) *URGENT* Do not, under any circumstances, put shoes back on. </p>
<p>You MUST remain barefoot. </p>
<p>If you fail, return to step one. This will take discipline! This is where most would-be bubbas fail! You will be tempted to put them back on - resist this! </p>
<p>Note: You may feel embarrassed or concerned about your dignity. At any time, you may call our hotline and we will provide support from bona fide bubba counselors.  Your dignity will soon disappear � do not worry!</p>
<p>4) This will be your greatest challenge: Prop bare feet on polished office desk, with soles facing open office door. Do NOT remove feet from desk, even when co-workers, clients and/or boss enter office. </p>
<p>Remove cufflinks and scratch soles of feet with them when others enter office and during office conference. Put cufflinks back on. </p>
<p>Use necktie to wipe nose. </p>
<p>Use tiepin and/or collar stud to clean toenails. Put tiepin or collar stud back in tie or shirt. </p>
<p>Eat lunch with knife only. Wipe dirty knife on otherwise impeccable business suit. Belch. Let out a boisterous laugh.</p>
<p>5) Open can of beer. Drink rapidly and belch loudly. Dribble on business suit. Discarded dress socks may be used to wipe mouth. Repeat. Pile cans on expensive office carpet.</p>
<p>6) Place tobacco in mouth. Practice spitting stream of tobacco juice on to computer screen or on polished office floor or on important presentation or in the cuffs of the trousers of your pinstriped suit or those Brooks Brothers shoes. </p>
<p>Note: This is the ONLY time when you may retrieve shoes from garbage! See step #3 </p>
<p>7) Remove natty necktie, cufflinks, pocket square, tiepin, suspenders and Rolex. Drop all items in garbage can. </p>
<p>8) Strip off expensive Armani business suit, starched shirt and designer underwear. Toss in garbage can. Add briefcase, cell phone and daytimer. Cut up credit cards and throw away wallet. Rip up Ivy League diploma.</p>
<p>Note: Removal of suit will be traumatic for uppity businessmen. Be prepared for shock to system.</p>
<p>9) Put on overalls. </p>
<p>10) Cancel subscriptions to Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Have cable disconnected. </p>
<p>11) If you have not already been fired, quit high-paying, prestigious, white-collar job and stop working altogether. </p>
<p>Alternative: become a garbageman or janitor or sling hash in a diner. </p>
<p>12) Make appointment with dentist. Have front teeth removed. </p>
<p>13) Make appointment with surgeon. Have all hair on top of head removed through electrolysis. Let hair grow on sides and back. </p>
<p>14) Shave ONLY twice a week. Be careful to leave stubble at all times. </p>
<p>15) Bathe ONLY twice a week. </p>
<p>16) Begin intensive redneck language course. Do not use more than five words in a sentence. Drop all �NG� endings from words - �havin� instead of �having�. Learn to yelp and woop and holler. </p>
<p>17) Sell Porsche. </p>
<p>18) Buy used pickup. </p>
<p>19) Sell condo and furniture. </p>
<p>20) Buy backwoods shack and shotgun rack. </p>
<p>21) Give or throw away all remaining business suits, ties, shoes, socks, shirts and accessories.  </p>
<p>Exception: Give tuxedo and patent leather pumps worn to corporate black-tie events to the homeless man you used to ignore.</p>
<p>22) Sell stocks and bonds and give all proceeds from these and sale of car and home to redneck charity. You will not need money. </p>
<p>23) Watch NASCAR and pro-wrestling every day. Do NOT miss episodes. Also, be prepared to defend the position that professional wrasslin' is real and not scripted entertainment.</p>
<p>24) Find wrecked car and leave in front of shack. If possible, make use of cinder blocks where tires should be.</p>
<p>25) Have name changed legally from �Mark�, �Andrew�, or �Kevin� to �Cletus�, �Bubba�, �Rufus�, or anything ending in ""-bob"", such as ""Jim-bob""or ""Billy-bob"".</p>
<p>Congratulations! You, sir are now the Redneck you have dreamed of becoming! Satisfaction Guaranteed!</p>

30659,"<p>Ed finally decides to take a vacation. He books himself on a Caribbean cruise and proceeds to have the time of his life- until the boat sank. </p>
<p>He found himself swept up on the shore of an island with no other people, no supplies... Nothing. Only bananas and coconuts. </p>
<p>After about four months, he is lying on the beach one day when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to him. In disbelief, he asks her, ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?"" </p>
<p>""I rowed from the other side of the island,"" she says. ""I landed here when my cruise ship sank."" </p>
<p>""Amazing,"" he says. ""You were really lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you."" </p>
<p>""O, this?"" replies the woman. ""I made the rowboat out of raw material I found on the island; the oars were whittled from gum tree branches; I wove the bottom from palm branches; and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree."" </p>
<p>""But-but, that's impossible,"" stutters Ed. ""You had no tools or hardware. How did you manage?"" </p>
<p>""Oh, that was no problem,"" replies the woman. ""On the south side of the island, there is a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed. I found if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools and used the tools to make the hardware."" </p>
<p>Ed is stunned. ""Let's row over to my place,"" she says. After a few minutes of rowing, she docks the boat at a small wharf. As Ed looks onto shore, he nearly falls out of the boat. Before him is a stone walk leading to an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white. </p>
<p>While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, he could only stare ahead, dumbstruck. As they walk into the house, she says casually, ""It's not much, but I call it home. Sit down please; would you like to have a drink?"" </p>
<p>""No, no thank you,"" he says, still dazed. ""Can't take any more coconut juice."" </p>
<p>""It's not coconut juice,"" the woman replies. ""I have a still. How about a Pina Colada?"" Trying to hide his continued amazement, he accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk. </p>
<p>After they have exchanged their stories, the woman announces, ""I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave? There is a razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom."" </p>
<p>No longer questioning anything, Ed goes into the bathroom. There, in the cabinet, is a razor made from a bone handle. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside of a swivel mechanism. </p>
<p>""WOW! This woman is amazing,"" he muses, ""What next?"" When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but vines-strategically positioned-and smelling faintly of gardenias. She beckons for him to sit down next to her. </p>
<p>""Tell me,"" she begins suggestively, slithering closer to him, ""We've been out here for a really long time. You've been lonely. There's something I'm sure you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing for all these months. You know..."" She stares into his eyes. </p>
<p>He can't believe what he's hearing: ""You mean---"", he swallows excitedly, ""I can check my e-mail from here....?""</p>

30677,"<p>A woman meets a gorgeous man in a bar. They talk, they connect, they end up leaving together. They get back to his place, and as he shows her around his flat, she notices that his bedroom is completely packed with teddy bears. Hundreds of small bears on a shelf all the way along the floor, medium sized ones on a shelf a little higher, and hug bears on the top shelf along the wall. The woman is kind of surprised that this guy would have a collection of teddy bears, especially one that's so extensive, but she decides not to mention this to him.She turns to him... they kiss... and then they rip each others clothes off and have rampant nookie.After an intense night of passion, as they are lying there together in the afterglow, the woman rolls over and asks, smiling, ""Well, how was it?""The bloke says, ""You can have any prize from the bottom shelf.""</p>

When they walked to the green, they discovered one about three feet from the cup, while the other somehow had gone directly in.

Unable to decide, they returned to the Club House and asked the golf pro for a ruling.After hearing their story and congratulating them both on their superb shots under such adverse conditions he asked, 'OK, so who was playing the yellow ball ?'</p>

30719,"<p>An old preacher was dying. He sent a message for his banker and his lawyer, both church members, to come to his home.When they arrived, they were ushered up to his bedroom. As they entered the room, the preacher held out his hands and motioned for them to sit on each side of the bed. The preacher grasped their hands, sighed contentedly, smiled, and stared at the ceiling. For a time, no one said anything.Both the banker and lawyer were touched and flattered that the preacher would ask them to be with him during his final moments. They were also puzzled; the preacher had never given them any indication that he particularly liked either of them. They both remembered his many long, uncomfortable sermons about greed, covetousness, and avaricious behavior that made them squirm in their seats.Finally, the banker said, ""Preacher, why did you ask us to come?""The old preacher mustered up his strength and then said weakly, ""Jesus died between two thieves, and that's how I want to go.""</p>

At the end of the cavern you will find a red, sticky ball which is the egg. Address it and say, ""I'm a Sperm."" She will answer, ""I'm the Egg."" From that moment on you will work together to create the embryo. Do you understand?""The sperm nodded affirmatively and the instructor said, ""Then, good luck!""Two days later, the sperm is taking a nap when he hears the siren. He wakes up immediately and runs to the tunnel. A multitude of sperm swim behind him. He knows he has to arrive first.

30740,"<p>Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day. Apparently it had<br /> been a pretty busy day, though, so St. Peter had to tell the first one,<br /> ""Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only<br /> people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?"" </p>
<p>The first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been<br /> cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I<br /> came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my<br /> searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding.<br /> Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging<br /> off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started<br /> beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off.<br /> So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering<br /> on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and<br /> fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I<br /> couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge, and<br /> threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all<br /> the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the<br /> balcony."" </p>
<p>""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. </p>
<p>The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and<br /> again asks for his story. </p>
<p>""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my<br /> apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well,<br /> this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But<br /> I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew<br /> I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the<br /> balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and<br /> kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and<br /> grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but<br /> again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just<br /> when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out<br /> of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" </p>
<p>Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible<br /> death. </p>
<p>The third man came to the front of the line, and St. Peter asked for his<br /> story. </p>
<p>""Picture this,"" says the third man, ""I'm hiding naked inside a<br /> refrigerator...""</p>

The tense man sitting in the pilot's seat swung the plane into the wind and soon they were in the air, though flying erratically. ''Fly over the north side of the fire,'' said the photographer, ''and make several low-level passes.'' ''Why?'' asked the nervous pilot. ''Because I'm going to take pictures!'' yelled the photographer. ''I'm a photographer, and photographers take pictures.'' The pilot replied, ''You mean you're not the flight instructor?''</p>

30759,"<p>A group of Aussie gangsters are sitting around deliberating over methods they will employ in robbing a bank. After a lot of thought, they all agree on the way to go about it.In the wee hours of the following morning they meet and embark on their plans to get rich.Once inside the bank, efforts at disabling the internal security system get under way immediately. The robbers, expecting to find one or two huge safes filled with cash and valuables, are more than surprised to see hundreds of smaller safes scattered strategically throughout the bank.The first safe's combination is cracked and inside the robbers find only a bowl of vanilla pudding.'Well,' says one robber to another, 'at least we get a bit to eat.'They open up the second safe and it also contains nothing but vanilla pudding and the process continues until all the safes are opened and there is not one dollar, a diamond, or an ounce of gold to be found. Instead, all the safes contain containers of pudding.Disappointed, each of the mobsters makes a quiet exit, leaving with nothing more than queasy, uncomfortably full stomachs.The following morning, a Sydney newspaper headline reads, 'Australia's largest sperm bank robbed early this morning.'</p>

30774,"<p>One day Saint Peter came down with a terrible cold and had to call Jesus and say that he couldn't make it to work at the Pearly Gates. Jesus, being short on help, decided he would guard the Pearly Gates himself. It turned out to be a very uneventful day at the gate, with hardly a soul coming by to call. Then, late in the afternoon, Jesus saw a bent, white-haired old man slowly making his way up the path with the aid of a gnarled cane. As the man neared, he said, ""Good afternoon. I was hoping to enter the Gates of Heaven."" ""Well,"" said Jesus, ""tell me, what have you done to deserve such an honor?""""Actually, I have done nothing so wonderful myself,"" said the man, ""but my son, now he was special! I raised him to be a carpenter and did my best to teach him right from wrong. And when he grew older, an amazing transformation overcame him and to this day he's known throughout the world and loved by all alike.""As Jesus listened to the story, a sense of recognition came to him. With a lump in his throat and a tear in his eye, he threw open his arms and cried, ""Father!"" Emotional at this outburst, the old man threw open his arms and said, ""Pinochio!""</p>

A neighbor suggested that she cut the tail of one horse and that worked great until the other horse got his tail caught in a bush. It tore just right and looked exactly like the other horse's tail and our friend was stuck again. The neighbor suggested she notch the ear off one horse. That worked fine until the other horse caught his ear on a barbed wire fence. Once again our friend couldn't tell them apart. The neighbor suggested she measure the horses for height. When she did, she was very pleased to find that the white horse was 2 inches taller than the black.</p>

<p>""When did you do use this awful language?"" said the priest.</p>

<p>""No, Father."" Said the man. ""After that, a squirrel ran out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in his mouth and began to run away.""</p>
<p>""Is THAT when you swore?"" asked the priest again.</p>
<p>""Well, no,"" said the man, ""You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!""</p>
<p>""Is THAT when you swore?"" asked the amazed priest.</p>
<p>""No, not yet."" The man replied. ""As the eagle carried the squirrel away in his claws, it flew towards the green. And as it passed over a bit of forest near the green, the squirrel dropped my ball.""</p>
<p>""Did you swear THEN?"" asked the now impatient priest.</p>
<p>""No, because as the ball fell it struck a tree, bounced through some bushes, careened off a big rock, and rolled through a sand trap onto the green and stopped within six inches of the hole.""</p>
<p>""You missed the damn putt, didn't you?"" sighed the priest. </p>

30786,"<p>The other day I went to the local religious book store where I saw a ""HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS"" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on my back bumper and I'm glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed. That bumper sticker really worked!!I found lots of people who loved Jesus. I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love Jesus because pretty soon he leaned out of his window and yelled ""JESUS CHRIST!"" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, ""GO!...JESUS CHRIST!...GO!"" Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out the window and smiled and waved to all those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I heard him yell something about a sunny beach and saw him waving with only his middle finger. I asked my kids what he meant by that and they laughed and said it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So I leaned out of the window and gave him the good luck sign back. A couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started running towards me! I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed so I stepped on the gas. It's a good thing that I did because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back and everyone was still standing there so I leaned way out the window and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful people!</p>

Again, the bartender offers to call a cab for him.The drunk looks at the bartender for a moment angrily, curses, and shows himself out the side door, all the while grumbling and shaking his head.A few minutes later, the same drunk bursts in through the back door of the bar. He plops himself up on a bar stool, gathers his wits, and belligerently orders a drink.The bartender comes over and emphatically reminds the man that he is clearly drunk, will be served no drinks, and either a cab or the police will be called immediately.The surprised drunk looks at the bartender and in hopeless anguish, cries ""Man! How many bars do you work at?""</p>

<p>He made up a sign and posted it in the field. The next day, the kids show up and they saw the sign which read, ""Warning! One of the watermelons in this field has been injected with cyanide.""</p>
<p>The kids ran off, made up their own sign and posted it next to the farmer's sign.</p>
<p>When the farmer returned, he surveyed the field. He noticed that no watermelons are missing, but the sign next to his read, ""Now there are two!""</p>

30870,"<p>A man had been drinking at the bar for hours when he mentioned something about his girlfriend being out in the car. The bartender, concerned because it was so cold, went to check on her. When he looked inside the car, he saw the man's buddy, Pete, and his girlfriend going at it in the backseat. The bartender shook his head and walked back inside. He told the drunk that he thought it might be a good idea to check on his girlfriend. The fellow staggered outside to the car, saw his buddy and his girlfriend entwined, then walked back into the bar laughing. ''What's so funny?'' the bartender asked. ''That stupid Pete!'' the fellow chortled, ''He's so drunk, he thinks he's me!''</p>

30873,"<p>A Programmer and an Engineer are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY. The Programmer leans over to the Engineer and asks if he would like to play a fun game. The Engineer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. </p>
<p>The Programmer persists and explains that the game is real easy and a lot of fun. He explains ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5. Then you ask me a question, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $5."" </p>
<p>Again, the Engineer politely declines and tries to get to sleep. The Programmer, now somewhat agitated, says, ""OK, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $50!"" </p>
<p>This catches the Engineer's attention, and he sees no end to this torment unless he plays, so he agrees to the game. The Programmer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" </p>
<p>The Engineer doesn't say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the Programmer. </p>
<p>Now, it's the Engineer's turn. He asks the Programmer ""What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down on four?"" </p>
<p>The Programmer looks up at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all of his references. He taps into the Aerophone with his modem and searches the net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to his co-workers -- all to no avail. After about an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $50. </p>
<p>The Engineer politely takes the $50 and turns away to try to get back to sleep. The Programmer, more than a little miffed, shakes the Engineer and asks ""Well, so what's the answer?"" </p>
<p>Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the Programmer $5, and turns away and goes back to sleep.</p>

30882,"<p>December 8:<br /> 6:00 PM. It started to snow. The first snow of the season and<br /> the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the<br /> window, watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven. It<br /> looked like a Grandma Moses Print. So romantic we felt like<br /> newlyweds again. I love snow!</p>
<p>December 9:<br /> We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering<br /> ever inch of landscape. What a fantastic sight! Can there be a<br /> more lovely place in the Whole World? Moving here was the best<br /> idea I had. Shoveled for the first time in years and felt like a<br /> boy again. I did both our driveway and the sidewalks. This<br /> afternoon the snow plow came along and covered up the sidewalks<br /> and closed in the driveway, so i got to shovel again. What a<br /> perfect life!</p>
<p>December 12:<br /> The sun has melted all our lovely snow. Such a disappointment.<br /> My neighbor tells me not to worry, we'll definitely have a white<br /> Christmas. No snow on Christmas would be awful! Bob says we'll<br /> have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to<br /> see snow again. I don't think that's possible. Bob is such a<br /> nice man. I'm glad he's our neighbor.</p>
<p>December 14:<br /> Snow , lovely snow! 8"" last night. The temperature dropped to<br /> *20 . The cold makes everything sparkle so. The wind took my<br /> breath away, but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway and<br /> sidewalks. This is the life! the snow plow came back this<br /> afternoon and buried everything again. I didn't realize that I<br /> would have to do quite this much shoveling, but I'll certainly<br /> get back in shape this way. I wish I wouldn't huff and puff so.</p>
<p>December 15:<br /> 20 inches forecast. Sold my van and bought a 4x4 Blazer. Bought<br /> snow tires for the wife's car and 2 extra shovels. Stocked the<br /> freezer. The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity<br /> goes out. I think that's silly. We aren't in Alaska, after all. </p>
<p>December 16:<br /> Ice storm this morning. Fell on my ass on the ice in the<br /> driveway putting down salt. Hurt like hell. The wife laughed for<br /> an hour, which I thought was very cruel.</p>
<p>December 17:<br /> Still way below freezing. Roads are too icy to go anywhere.<br /> Electricity was off for 5 hours. I had to pile the blankets on<br /> to stay warm. Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to<br /> irritate her. Guess I should've bought a wood stove, but won't<br /> admit it to her. God I hate it when she's right. I can't believe<br /> I'm freezing to death in my own living room.</p>
<p>December 20:<br /> Electricity's back on, but had another 14"" of the damn stuff<br /> last night. More shoveling. Took all day. Freakin' snowplow came<br /> by twice. Tried to find a neighbor kid to shovel, but they said<br /> they're too busy playing hockey. I think they're lying. Called<br /> the only hardware store around to see about buying a snow blower<br /> and they're out. Might have another shipment in March. I think<br /> they're lying. Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have<br /> it done and bill me. I think he's lying. </p>
<p>December 22:<br /> Bob was right about the white Christmas because 13 more inches<br /> of the white shit fell today, and its so cold it probably wont<br /> melt till August. Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up and<br /> go to out to shovel then I had to piss. By the time I got<br /> undressed, pissed and dressed again, I was too tired to shovel.<br /> Tried to hire Bob who has a plow on his truck for the rest of<br /> the winter; but he says he's too busy. I think the asshole is<br /> lying.</p>
<p>December 23:<br /> Only 2"" of snow today. And it warmed up to 0. The wife wanted me<br /> to decorate the front of the house this morning. What is<br /> she...... NUTS?!?! Why didn't she tell me to do that a month<br /> ago? She says she did but I think she's damn well lying.</p>
<p>December 24:<br /> 6"". Snow packed so hard today by snowplow, I broke the shovel.<br /> Thought I was having a heart attack. If I ever catch the Son of<br /> a Bitch who drives the snowplow, I'll drag him though the snow<br /> by his balls. I know he hides around the corner and waits for me<br /> to finish shoveling and then he comes down the street at a</p>
<p>Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols with her and<br /> open our presents, but I was busy watching for the freakin'<br /> snowplow.</p>
<p>December 25:<br /> Merry Christmas. 20 more inches of the @#$%^&amp; slop tonight.<br /> Snowed in. The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil. God I hate<br /> snow! Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and<br /> I hit him over the head with my shovel. The Wife says I have a<br /> bad attitude. I think she's an idiot. If I have to watch ""It's a<br /> Wonderful Life"" one more time. I'm going to kill her.</p>
<p>December 26:<br /> Still snowed in. Why the hell did I ever move here? It was all<br /> HER idea. She's really getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>December 27:<br /> Temperature dropped to -30 and the pipes froze.</p>
<p>December 28:<br /> Warmed up to above -50. Still snowed in. THE BITCH is driving me<br /> crazy!!!</p>
<p>December 29:<br /> 10 more inches. Bob says I have to shovel the roof or it could<br /> cave in. That's the silliest thing I ever heard. How dumb does<br /> he think I am?</p>
<p>December 30:<br /> Roof caved in. The snowplow driver is suing me for a million<br /> dollars for the bump on his head. The wife went home to her<br /> mother. 9"" predicted.</p>
<p>December 31:<br /> Set fire to what's left of the house. No more Shoveling!!</p>
<p>January 8:<br /> I feel so good. I just love those little white pills they keep<br /> giving me. Why am I tied to the bed?</p>

"
30891,"<p>Q. What does HMO stand for?<br /> A. This is actually a variation of the phrase, ""Hey, Moe!"" Its roots go back to a concept pioneered by Doctor Moe Howard, who discovered that a patient could be made to forget about the pain in his foot if he was poked hard enough in the eyes. Modern practice replaces the physical finger poke with hi-tech equivalents such as voice mail and referral slips, but the result remains the same.</p>
<p>Q. Do all diagnostic procedures require pre-certification?<br /> A. No. Only those you need.</p>
<p>Q. I just joined a new HMO. How difficult will it be to choose the doctor I want?<br /> A. Just slightly more difficult than choosing your parents. Your insurer will provide you with a book listing all the doctors who were participating in the plan at the time the information was gathered. These doctors basically fall into two categories -- those who are no longer accepting new patients, and those who will see you but are no longer part of the plan. But don't worry -- the remaining doctor who is still in the plan and accepting new patients has an office just a half day's drive away!</p>
<p>Q. What are pre-existing conditions?<br /> A. This is a phrase used by the grammatically challenged when they want to talk about existing conditions. Unfortunately, we appear to be pre-stuck with it.</p>
<p>Q. Well, can I get coverage for my pre-existing conditions?<br /> A. Certainly, as long as they don't require any treatment.</p>
<p>Q. What happens if I want to try alternative forms of medicine?<br /> A. You'll need to find alternative forms of payment.</p>
<p>Q. My pharmacy plan only covers generic drugs, but I need the name brand. I tried the generic medication, but it gave me a stomach ache. What should I do?<br /> A. Poke yourself in the eye.</p>
<p>Q. I have an 80/20 plan with a $200 deductible and a $2,000 yearly cap. My insurer reimbursed the doctor for my out-patient surgery, but I'd already paid my bill. What should I do?<br /> A. You have two choices. Your doctor can sign the reimbursement check over to you, or you can ask him to invest the money for you in one of those great offers that only doctors and dentists hear about, like windmill farms or frog hatcheries.</p>
<p>Q. What should I do if I get sick while traveling?<br /> A. Try sitting in a different part of the bus.</p>
<p>Q. No, I mean what if I'm away from home and I get sick?<br /> A. You really shouldn't do that. You'll have a hard time seeing your primary care physician. It's best to wait until you return, and then get sick.</p>
<p>Q. I think I need to see a specialist, but my doctor insists he can handle my problem. Can a general practitioner really perform a heart transplant right in his office?<br /> A. Hard to say, but considering that all you're risking is the $10<br /> co-payment, there's no harm giving him a shot at it.</p>
<p>Q. What accounts for the largest portion of health care costs?<br /> A. Doctors trying to recoup their investment losses.</p>
<p>Q. Will health care be any different in the next century?<br /> A. No, but if you call right now, you might get an appointment by then.</p>

30939,"<p>Bill Clinton and Bill Gates, one day in 1999, were having an, up until the  time,intelligent conversation about how to assert power onto others.  Being  who they are, however, their conversation quickly changed from discussing  politics to discussing which of the two had the bigger penis.Clinton  strongly forced his view upon Gates by saying Well look at what me and  Monica did. Gates however won back the argument by stating.  ""Well, look  what I do to my customers every single day of every single week."" The  friendly argument swiftly devolved into a shouting match between the two.  I have the biggest penis of any man in the world! Clinton forcefully  bellowed  I�ll show you! Clinton then unzipped his pants and revealed his  monstrous phallus to Gates.  ""That�s nothing compared to my titanic sabre!"" exclaimed Gates.  Gates showed his hulk-ish beast to Clinton.  It was  clearly much greater than Clinton could ever imagine.  Mr. Clinton was both infuriated and envious at the same time.  He could never let anyone else see how great of a scepter Mr. Gates carried.  In a fit of rage, Clinton pulled  out his .45 caliber pistol, pointed it at Gates� head, and demanded he never displayed his monster for anyone else�s eyes to see.  Gates, having an ego much larger than his giant, forcefully denied Clinton�s envious request.Clinton then called his team of advisors into the room and discussed what  they could do to stop Gates from showing his amazing girth to the rest of  the world.  After minutes of arguing, debating, and eating pizza, they  decided to take a knife to Mr. Gates� woodrow and cut it equally in two  pieces. The severed half would be given to one of Bill Gates� most trusted  employees.Gates would have no part of losing his most prized treasure; he  therefore called his army of lawyers to fend off Clinton for just a small  time, so Gates could hide his penis.  Alas, his minions could only stop  Clinton�s superior army for a short while; not nearly long enough for Gates  to conceal his cannon. In the end, Clinton was able to cut Gates� pedro in  two. Nothing really happened afterwards. Gates remained the greatest dick  in the world and Clinton still was the second gun.</p>

She's 97 now &amp; we don't know where the heck she is.2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so that I could hear heavy breathing again.3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400 bucks. Haven't lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain figures out what I'm doing.5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch our toes, he would have put them further up our body.6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them.8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier.9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing, start with a small country.10) I don't jog.

30946,"<p>A couple had two little boys ages 8 and 10, who were excessively mischievous.<br /> They were always getting into trouble and their parents knew that if any<br /> mischief occurred in their town, their sons were probably involved.</p>
<p>The boys' mother heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in<br /> disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys. The<br /> clergyman agreed but asked to see them individually. So the mother sent her<br /> 8-year-old first, in the morning, with the older boy to see the clergyman in the<br /> afternoon.</p>
<p>The clergyman, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger<br /> boy down and asked him sternly, ""Where is God?""</p>
<p>They boy's mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there with his<br /> mouth hanging open, wide-eyed. So the clergyman repeated the question in an even<br /> sterner tone, ""Where is God!!?"" Again the boy made no attempt to answer. So the<br /> clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and<br /> bellowed, ""WHERE IS GOD!?""</p>
<p>The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his<br /> closet, slamming the door behind him. When his older brother found him in the<br /> closet, he asked, ""What happened?""</p>
<p>The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, ""We are in BIG trouble this<br /> time, dude. God is missing - and they think WE did it!""</p>

30948,"<p>A guy named Joe receives a free ticket to the SuperBowl from his<br /> company. Unfortunately, when Joe arrives at the stadium, he<br /> realizes the seat is in the last row in the corner of the<br /> stadium--he's closer to the Goodyear Blimp than the field. About<br /> halfway through the first quarter, Joe sees through his<br /> binoculars an empty seat 10 rows off the field right on the 50<br /> yardline.</p>
<p>He decides to take a chance and makes his way through the<br /> stadium and around the security guards to the empty seat. As he<br /> sits down, Joe asks the gentleman sitting next to him, ""Excuse<br /> me, is anyone sitting here?"" The man says, ""No.""</p>
<p>Now, very excited to be in such a great seat for the game, Joe<br /> again inquires of the man next to him, ""This is incredible! Who<br /> in their right mind would have a seat like this at the SuperBowl<br /> and not use it?!"" The man replies, ""Well, actually, the seat<br /> belongs to me. I was supposed to come with my wife, but she<br /> passed away. This is the first SuperBowl we haven't been<br /> together at since we got married in 1967.""</p>

30956,"<p>Two hunters went moose hunting every winter without  success. Finally, they came up with a foolproof plan.  They got a very authentic female moose costume and  learned the mating call of a female moose.The plan was to hide in the costume, lure the bull,  then come out of the costume and shoot the bull.  They set themselves up on the edge of a clearing,  donned their costume and began to give the moose  love call.Before long, their call was answered as a bull came  crashing out of the forest and into the clearing.  When the bull was close enough, the guy in front  said, ""Okay, lets get out and get him.""After a moment that seemed like an eternity, the guy  in the back shouted, ""The zipper is stuck!

30970,"<p>My uncle was in the fertilized egg business when I was young. He had several hundred young layers, called pullets, and 8 or 10 roosters whose job was to fertilize the eggs. My uncle kept records and any rooster or pullet that didn't perform well went into the pot and was replaced. Now this took an awful lot of time. So when my uncle saw a set of eight tiny bells that each rang a different tone he promptly bought them.<br /> He glued a piece of foam rubber to each clapper shaft so the bell wouldn't ring except when violently shaken. He hung a bell on each rooster's neck and went and mixed a Mint Julep. Now he could sit on the porch and sip while filling out an efficiency report on the roosters by listening to the different tones of the bells and marking down each encounter. </p>
<p>My uncle's favorite rooster was old Brewster. Brewster was a fine specimen, but his bell didn't ring all morning. Uncle went to investigate. </p>
<p>Several roosters were chasing pullets, bells a-ringing. Brewster had his bell in his beak so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one. Chagrined at first, Uncle was soon so proud of Brewster he entered him in the county fair. </p>
<p>Brewster was an overnight sensation. They not only awarded him the No Bell prize but also the Pullet Surprise.</p>

"
30995,"<p>Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable because no matter how legitimate my illness, because I always sense my boss thinks I am lying. </p>
<p>On one occasion, I had a valid reason but lied anyway because the truth was to humiliating to reveal. I simply mentioned that I had sustained a head injury and I hoped I would feel up to coming in the next day. By then, I could think up a doozy to explain the bandage on my crown. </p>
<p>In this case, the truth hurt. I mean it really hurt in the place men feel the most pain. The accident occurred mainly because I conceded to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute little kitty </p>
<p>As the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower after breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen. ""Ed!"" she harkened. ""The garbage disposal is dead. Come reset it."" ""You know where the button is."" I protested through the shower (pitter-patter). </p>
<p>""Reset it yourself!"" </p>
<p>""I am scared!"" She pleaded. ""What if it starts going and sucks me in?"" </p>
<p>Pause. ""C'mon, it'll only take a second."" No logical assurance about how a disposal can't start itself will calm the fears of a person who suffers from ""Big-ol-scary-machine-phobia,"" a condition brought on by watching too many Stephen King movies. </p>
<p>It is futile to argue or explain, kind of like telling Lloyd Bentsen Americans are over-taxed. And if a poltergeist did, in fact, possess the disposal, and she was ground into round, I'd have to live with that the rest of my life. </p>
<p>So out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to make a statement about how her cowardly behavior was, not without consequence, but it was I who would suffer. I crouched down and stuck my head under the sink to find the button. </p>
<p>It is the last action I remember performing. It struck without warning, without respect to my circumstances. Nay, it wasn't a hexed disposal, drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth. It was our new kitty, clawing playfully at the dangling objects she spied between my legs. She (""Buttons"" aka ""the Grater"") had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I took the bait under the sink. At precisely the second I was most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged them with her needle-like claws. </p>
<p>Now when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close to their masculine region, they lose all rational thought to control orderly bodily movements. Instinctively, their nerves compel the body to contort inwardly, while rising upwardly at a violent rate of speed. Not even a well trained monk could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full weight of a kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure. Wild animals are sometimes faced with a ""fight or flight"" syndrome; men, in this predicament, choose only the ""flight"" option. </p>
<p>Fleeing straight up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels when it is alarmed. It was a dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek great heights to escape, I never made it that far. The sink and cabinet bluntly impeded my ascent; the impact knocked me out cold. </p>
<p>When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me. Having been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics snorted as they tried to conduct their work while suppressing their hysterical laughter. My wife told me I should be flattered. </p>
<p>At the office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me. I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk. ""What's the matter, cat got your tongue?"" </p>
<p>If they had only known.</p>

<p>""I can't get any water from that water hole, Grandma,"" exclaimed Johnny.<br /> ""There's a big ol' alligator down there!""</p>
<p>""Now don't you mind that ol' alligator, Johnny. He's been there for a few years now, and he's never hurt no one. Why, he's probably as scared of you as you are of him!""</p>
