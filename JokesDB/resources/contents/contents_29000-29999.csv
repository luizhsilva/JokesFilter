After many failed efforts, Johnny one day (after school) called the teacher a hypocrite.""Why do you say that, Johnny,"" she asked.""Because you are.""Again she asked, ""why.""He said, ""Because you're not a true blonde.""She demanded to know how much money Johnny had. It came to about $50. She bet him $50 dollars she was a true blonde. She went behind her desk and removed her panties. Then she stood with her back to the door and pulled her dress up showing her radiantly blonde pubic hair. Afterwards she called the father and told him what she had done ""in Johnny's best interest.""The father moaned and groaned and cried, ""Oh, no,"" numerous times.The teacher said, ""Look, I did this for Johnny. Do you think it was easy for me to pull up my dress and show Johnny my pussy? I'd think you'd be understanding instead of critical!""The father replied, ""Oh, I'm not so upset that you showed Johnny your pussy, it's just that...""""Just that what?"" the embarrassed teacher asked.The father replied, ""It's just that I decided to break Johnny of betting myself, and this morning I bet him that he was wrong when he boasted that before the day was over, he'd have you lifting your skirt and showing him your pussy.""</p>

<p>Then he decided to write God a letter requesting the $100.  When the postal<br /> authorities received the letter addressed to God, they opened it up, and decided<br /> to send it to President Clinton. </p>
<p>President Clinton was so impressed, touched and amused that he instructed his<br /> secretary to send the little boy $5.  He thought this would appear to be a lot<br /> of money to a little boy. </p>
<p>The little boy was delighted with the $5 and sat down to write a thank-you<br /> letter to God which reads as follows: ""Dear God, Thank you so very much for<br /> sending me the money.  Inoticed you sent it through Washington.  As usual those<br /> bastards deducted $95 as tax.""</p>

29005,"<p>After dinner and a movie, Carl drove his date to a quiet country road and made his move. When Mary responded enthusiastically to his kissing, he tried sliding his hand up her blouse. Suddenly she jerked away, got out of the car and walked home. That night she wrote in her diary, ""A girl's best friends are her own two legs.""On their next date, Carl returned to the country road. As they were necking, he slid his hand up Mary's skirt. Once again she pulled away, got out of the car and walked home. That night she wrote in her diary, ""I repeat, a girl's best friends are her own two legs.""On the third date, the pair returned to the country road. This time Mary didn't get home until very late. That night she wrote, ""Dear diary: There comes a time when even the best of friends must part.""</p>

29006,"<p>by Scott Adams </p>
<p>I work in tech support. An end-user called and reported, ""My computer is making a strange noise."" We visited the site and identified the problem: a pager (set on vibrate) in his drawer. [Editor's note: Later that day he called the Men's Wearhouse 800 number to report that his pants were making a strange noise.]</p>
<p>I work on the help desk here, and have just gotten off the phone with a customer who was asking us about her network connection. She insisted that the 3com card in her PC was not powerful enough for her needs and that she had ""looked into it"" and had decided she wanted a 4com card instead as they were obviously better.</p>
<p>Our soda machine had an out-of-order sign taped over the money slot. The Induhvidual walked up, lifted the piece of paper, and inserted his dollar. He was still cursing the machine for stealing his money as I walked back to my office.</p>
<p>This one's a double sighting: I stopped off at the gas station to fill up my car. I pumped in $18.50 worth of gas and went to pay. In front of me in line was a guy (obviously from out of town) asking for directions and signing a VISA slip. When that guy left, the fun began: </p>
<p>CLERK: ""Can I help you?"" </p>
<p>ME: ""I'm the $18.50 charge."" </p>
<p>CLERK (confused): ""Sorry, there's no charges on the computer. But I just charged that last guy $18.50."" </p>
<p>ME (very pleased): ""You mean that guy paid for my gas?"" </p>
<p>CLERK: ""No, he was just in here asking for directions."" </p>
<p>ME: ""Then why did you charge him $18.50."" </p>
<p>CLERK: ""Ummmm... excuse me!"" </p>
<p>Then he ran out of the booth, but alas the other Induhvidual had left. I wonder if the other Induhvidual thinks people in my city always charge $18.50 for directions. [Editor's Note: The lesson here is that if someone asks you for directions, ask for their credit card and charge them. You might get lucky. In fact, it's a safe bet that the Induhvidual in the story is still lost, and that's easy money for whoever runs into that person next.]</p>
<p>I am at a fast order restaurant at one of our local universities. I order a BLT. The Induhvidual behind the counter asked if I would like lettuce and tomato with that. I suppose I could have just wanted a B.</p>
<p>My wife was reading your latest newsletter and said, ""individual"" is spelled wrong all over this document. [Editor's Note: It's okay to marry Induhviduals as long as you're only doing it for the laughs.]</p>
<p>The sign on the front of the Taco Bell in my town says: ""We have tacos."" I went in to verify this fact for myself. It turns out that they do sell tacos, never bells. The sign was very helpful.</p>
<p>Here's a true story: The receptionist's intercom buzzes, and an Induhvidual's voice comes through, calling out, ""hello, hello?"" But the receptionist had stepped away from her desk. Two seconds later, the buzzer sounds again, and it's the same guy, calling ""hello, hello?"" Still no answer. Next thing you know, the guy comes all the way down the hall from his office, bumps into the receptionist, and tells her her intercom doesn't work. He runs back to his office to prove it to her. ""Hello, hello?"" She responds, and he excitedly comes all the way back down the hall to her desk to tell her it works now, it must be fixed! She looks at him funny, and he goes all the way back to his office, then buzzes her again, ""Hello, hello?"" ""Yes?"" she replies. ""Can you bring me that file from your desk?""</p>
<p>Just when you think the educational system is in decay, along comes an inspirational story like this one: Dear Scott, Just a quick report about the success of the joke I played on the faculty of Los Gatos High School (SF Bay Area). The idea came from your newsletter which suggested ""converting"" a copier to voice activation. The faculty copiers already have electronic boxes which require a password to be entered. I decided to convert one to voice activation. On 4/1/97 I attached to the copier in the faculty workroom a cheap microphone and a label with the following instructions: This copier control is now voice activated. Please state your name and department in a loud, clear voice into the microphone. Almost every teacher that used the copier fell for it. Some even returned later in the day to see if it was working yet. It will be hard to top this one in the future, thanks for the great idea.</p>

<p>She yells, ""No, I won't sleep with you tonight!"" </p>
<p>Everyone in the bar is now staring at them. Naturally, the guy is hopelessly and completely embarrassed and he slinks back to his table. </p>
<p>After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes. She smiles at him and says, ""I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. You see, I'm a graduate student in psychology and I'm studying how people respond to embarrassing situations."" </p>
<p>To which he responds, at the top of his lungs, ""What do you mean $200!?</p>

<p>�Oh, my God,� the man cries, but then remembers what the policeman had said. �So what�s the good news?�</p>
<p>�Well,� says the policeman, �when we pulled her up, she had two five-pound lobsters and a dozen good sized Dungeness crabs on her.�</p>

He looked up to see where it came from<br /> in time to see a girl looking down. ""Is this yours?"" he asked.<br /> She said, ""Yes, could you bring it up?"" and the man agreed. On<br /> arrival she was profuse in her thanks and offered the man a<br /> drink.</p>
<p>As she was very attractive he agreed. Shortly afterwards she<br /> said, ""I'm about to have dinner. There's plenty; would you like<br /> to join me?"" He readily accepted her offer and both enjoyed a<br /> lovely meal. As the evening was drawing to a close the girl<br /> said, ""I have had a marvelous evening, would you like to stay<br /> the night?"" The man hesitated then said, ""Do you act like this<br /> with every man you meet?"" ""No,"" she replied, ""Only those who<br /> catch my eye!""</p>

<p>The nun thanked the man by asking him if he'd like to have sex<br /> with her. He agreed and the nun said, ""only under one condition,<br /> you mustn't be married, you mustn't have kids, and it must be<br /> anal sex!"" So the two people got out and had anal sex for hours<br /> and did not stop for anything (once you pop the fun don't<br /> stop... til one of you gets tired!) After they were sweaty<br /> enough, they got in the cab and continued driving! </p>

<p>The dealer tells him, ""Look, I have a lot of models, but why don't you save yourself a lot of time and aggrevation and get the top-of-the-line model. This chainsaw will cut a hundred cords of wood for you in one day.""</p>
<p>So the Polak takes the chainsaw home and begins working on the trees. After cutting for several hours and only cutting two cords, he decides to quit. He thinks there is something wrong with the chainsaw. ""How can I cut for hours and only cut two cords?"", the Polak asks himself. ""I will begin first thing in the morning and cut all day"", the Polak tells himself.</p>
<p>So, the next morning the Polak gets up at 4 in the morning and cuts, and cuts, and cuts till nightfall, and he only manages to cut five cords.</p>
<p>The Polak is convinced this is a bad saw. ""The dealer told me it would cut one hundred cords of wood in a day, no problem. I will take this saw back to the dealer"", the Polak says to himself.</p>
<p>The very next day the Polak brings the saw back to the dealer and explains the problem. The dealer, baffled by the Polak's claim, removes the chainsaw from the case. The dealer says, ""Huh, it looks fine."" </p>
<p>Then the dealer starts the chainsaw, to which the Polak responds, ""What's that noise?""</p>

29035,"<p>A passenger plane traveling to California is suddenly hit<br /> with a severe engine problem and plummets into the Pacific<br /> Ocean. The impact is such that the plane is ripped apart<br /> leaving only one man alive. After hours of swimming he spies<br /> an island and drags himself up onto the sandy shores. Though<br /> he is half drowned and aware that he is thousands of miles<br /> from home he cannot but admire the beauty of the island he<br /> has found himself on.</p>
<p>Looking down the beach he sees a figure lying on the beach,<br /> another survivor from the crash. He runs over and sees that<br /> she is not breathing so quickly he gives her the kiss of life.<br /> After several attempts she coughs into life. As she wipes<br /> the hair from her face he now can see who it is.</p>
<p>It's Jennifer Lopez.</p>
<p>Forever grateful to him for saving her life they strike up<br /> an immediate bond, and over the following weeks while stranded<br /> on the island, they fall madly in love.</p>
<p>One day Jennifer is walking down the beach and notices her<br /> new found love sitting on the rocks by the beach staring<br /> out to sea with a look of sorrow on his face.</p>
<p>Feeling there's something wrong, she wanders over to him<br /> and asks what is wrong.</p>
<p>""Jennifer. The last few weeks have been the greatest of my<br /> life. We've found this island paradise. We have all the food<br /> and water we could require and I have you, but still I can't<br /> help feel there's something missing.""</p>
<p>Jennifer replies, ""What my darling? What is it that you need.<br /> I'll do anything.""</p>
<p>""Well there is one thing. Would you mind putting on my shirt?""</p>
<p>""OK.""</p>
<p>""And my trousers?""</p>
<p>""OK.""</p>
<p>At this point he gets up and grabs some charcoal from the<br /> ground, and draws a neat moustache on her lips.</p>
<p>""OK.... Can you start to walk around the island and I'll set<br /> off the other way and meet you half way.""</p>
<p>""OK dear, whatever will make you happy.""</p>
<p>So off they set. After half an hour walking he eventually<br /> sees her heading towards him along the beach, at which point<br /> he breaks into a sprint, running up to her and grabbing her<br /> by the shoulders he shouts, ""Mate, you won't believe who I'm<br /> shagging!""</p>

29042,"<p>Twas the night before Christmas and throughout the White House, </p>
<p>Al Gore was eyeing Hillary, peering into her blouse. </p>
<p>The Secret Service were guarding the premises with care, </p>
<p>for a whole host of Democrats were vacationing there. </p>
<p>Chelsea was nestled all snug in her bed, </p>
<p>Dirty thoughts swam around Mr. Kennedy's head. </p>
<p>And Bill in his sportcoat; a heavy gray tweed, </p>
<p>Had just fried his brain with some Mexican weed. </p>
<p>When out in the garden came a plethora of noise, </p>
<p>All drunken and rowdy: 'twas Newt and the boys! </p>
<p>Bill jumped to the window, and tore open the sash, </p>
<p>It's a raid boys! he cried, Quick go hide my stash! </p>
<p>The pot in his blood and the moon on the snow, </p>
<p>Gave a psychedelic haze to the the objects below.</p>
<p>When what to Bill's frantic eyes should appear,</p>
<p>But a slew of Republicans and a keg of beer. </p>
<p>With a big House leader, a lively and fat:</p>
<p>He knew it was Newt, the proponent of GATT!</p>
<p>A viscous as vipers, the Republicans came, </p>
<p>And Bill recognized them and called them by name. </p>
<p>Hey Helms, hey Thurmond! hey Packwood and Hatch! </p>
<p>Hey Dole and Pataki, it's time for a bash!</p>
<p>A collective cheer rose out from the crowd, </p>
<p>Let's listen to Nugent, and turn it up loud! </p>
<p>Together Dems and Republicans danced and sang out in cheer </p>
<p>Screw health care and Haiti, it's time to drink beer! </p>
<p>When from the chimney, came a big black cloud of soot, </p>
<p>As Limbaugh danced from the fireplace in a red Santa suit. </p>
<p>He moved through the crowd, then held up his hand, </p>
<p>And when all was silent, he did a keg stand. </p>
<p>And the crowd raised their cups, as Newt bowed down it prayer, </p>
<p>And champagne flowed freely, just like welfare. </p>
<p>As Kennedy and Reno romped in the Green Room, </p>
<p>the rest of the crooks outlined their plan of doom. </p>
<p>We'll pray in the schools, shove it down their throats! </p>
<p>More welfare, more taxes, we'll still get the votes! </p>
<p>And they drank, hugged and danced, they crossed party lines. </p>
<p>They cheered, It doesn't matter, we're all bastard swines! </p>
<p>So they threw out allegiance and partisan crap, </p>
<p>And they took turns sitting on the Presidnet's lap. </p>
<p>And Gephardt and Dole passed out on the lawn, </p>
<p>And awoke in the morning without their pants on. </p>
<p>And Packwood gave Tipper a pat on the rear, </p>
<p>While Judge Thomas and Miss Hill went out for more beer. </p>
<p>Then the party-ers discovered a sight so touching and cute, </p>
<p>President Clinton fast asleep, snuggled up to Newt. </p>

29052,"<p>There was this man who was in a horrible accident, and was injured. But the only permanent damage he suffered was the amputation of both of his ears. As a result of this ""unusual"" handicap, he was very self-conscious about his having no ears.</p>
<p>Because of the accident, he received a large sum of money from the insurance company. It was always his dream to own his own business, so he decided with all this money he had, he now had the means to own a business. So he went out and purchased a small, but expanding computer firm. But he realized that he had no business knowledge at all, so he decided that he would have to hire someone to run the business.</p>
<p>He picked out three top candidates, and interviewed each of them.</p>
<p>The first interview went really well. He really liked this guy. His last question for this first candidate was ""Do you notice anything unusual about me?"" The guy said, ""Now that you mention it, you have no ears."" The man got really upset and threw the guy out.</p>
<p>The second interview went even better than the first. This candidate was much better than the first. Again, to conclude the interview, the man asked the same question again, ""Do you notice anything unusual about me?""</p>
<p>The guy also noticed, ""Yes, you have no ears."" The man was really upset again, and threw this second candidate out.</p>
<p>Then he had the third interview. The third candidate was even better than the second, the best out of all of them. Almost certain that he wanted to hire this guy, the man once again asked, ""Do you notice anything unusual about me?""</p>

29084,"<p>The Star: Eddie Gaedel, a 3'7"" midget.</p>
<p>The Headline: ""Small Man in Big Leagues: A Veeck Stunt.""</p>
<p>What Happened: It was a Sunday doubleheader with the Detroit Tigers on<br /> August 19, 1951, and the St. Louis Browns were celebrating the 50th<br /> anniversary of the American League. Between games, Brown owner Bill Veeck<br /> wheeled a huge cake out onto the field, and out popped Eddie Gaedel,<br /> wearing a Browns uniform with the number 1/8 on it. During the first<br /> inning of the next game, Gaedel popped out of the dugout and informed the<br /> umpire he was pitch hitting.</p>
<p>Challenged, Veeck produced a valid contract. Pitching is difficult as it<br /> is, but a 3'7"" person has a strike zone of about 18 inches. Gaedel walked<br /> on four straight pitches. He then left for a pitch runner.</p>
<p>Aftermath: Gaedel made a quick 100 dollars for his appearance, and<br /> American League president Will Harridge issued a solemn declaration<br /> barring midgets from baseball, and warning Veeck not to try any similar<br /> stunts.</p>

29109,"<p>This middle-aged guy wakes up one morning and notices that his eyes are bulging and his ears are protruding.  He becomes very concerned.  So he goes to his doctor and asks him what is wrong with him.  The doctor told him that he has a rare disease that will require him to take this medication for several months to clear up the disease, however the medication will make his hair fall out permanently.   Several months later the guy's eyes are still bulging and his ears are still protruding -- moreso now that his hair is gone.  So this time he goes to a different doctor who informs him that he has a prostrate problem and that they will have to remove his testicles.  So the guy has the surgery only to find out months later, his eyes are still bulging and his ears are still protruding.  Determined to find out what is wrong with him he goes to another doctor who tells him that the nerves in his hands are pinching the nerve endings in his ears and his eyes and the only way to resolve the problem is to have his hands amputated.  Sadly, the guy lets his hands be amputated.  On a followup visit to this doctor the doctor informs him that while they were doing the surgery on his hands, they found that the man has a terminal cancer and that he only has months to live.  The guy is hysterical at this point and resolves that if he only has months to live he is going to live it up.  So he goes out to buy a brand new sportscar, new furniture, and a new wardrobe.  However, when he went to order  some custom shirts, the tailor told him he took a 17-inch neck.

After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before in your case; I'm going to let you decide where you want to go."" </p>
<p>Bill replied, ""well, what's the difference between the two?"" </p>
<p>St. Peter said, ""I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision."" </p>
<p>""Fine, but where should I go first?"" </p>
<p>""I'll leave that up to you."" </p>
<p>""Okay then,"" said Bill, ""Let's try Hell first."" </p>
<p>So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of bikini-clad women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about.The sun was shining; the temperature perfect. He was very pleased. </p>
<p>""This is great!"" he told St. Peter. ""If this is hell, I REALLY want to see heaven!"" </p>
<p>""Fine,"" said St. Peter, and off they went. </p>

29141,"<p>There one was a heavyset guy who had tried every diet in the world in an<br /> attempt to lose weight? He tried the Scarsdale diet, the Navy diet, Weight<br /> Watchers, and many more. None worked. One day, he was reading the Washington<br /> Post when he noticed a small ad that read: </p>
<p>Lose weight: Only $1.00 a pound  Call (202) 555-0238<br /> the man decided to give it a try and called the number. A voice on the other<br /> end asked, ""How much weight do you want to lose?""<br /> The man responded, ""Ten pounds.""<br /> The voice replied, ""Very well, give me your credit card<br /> number and we'll have a representative over to your house in the morning.""<br /> About 9:00 am the next morning the man gets a knock on the door. There stood a<br /> beautiful redhead, completely naked except for a sign around her neck stating,<br /> ""If you catch me, you can have me.""<br /> Well, the hefty fellow chased her upstairs, downstairs, over sofas, through<br /> the kitchen, all around the house. Finally, panting and wheezing like a dog, he<br /> did catch her. When he was through enjoying himself, she said, ""Quick, go into<br /> the bathroom and weigh yourself."" He did just that and was amazed to find that<br /> he had lost ten pounds, right to the ounce!<br /> That evening he called the number again. The voice on the other end asked,<br /> ""How much weight do you want to lose?""--to which the somewhat-less-overweight<br /> man replied, ""Twenty pounds."" ""Very well,"" the voice on the phone told him,<br /> ""Give me your credit card number and we'll have a representative over to your<br /> house in the morning.""<br /> ""At about 8:00 am the next morning the man receives a knock on the door. When<br /> he opens the door he sees a beautiful blonde dressed only in track shoes and a<br /> sign around her neck stating, ""If you catch me, you can have me."" The chase took<br /> a good while longer this time and the man nearly passed out, but he finally did<br /> catch her. When he was through she told him, ""Quick, run into the bathroom and<br /> weigh yourself."" He ran to the bathroom and found he had lost another 20<br /> pounds!<br /> ""This is fantastic!"" he thought to himself.<br /> Later that evening he called the number again and the voice at the other end<br /> asked, ""How much weight do you want to lose?"" ""Fifty pounds!"" the man exclaimed.<br /> ""Fifty pounds?"" the voice asked, ""That's an awful lot of weight to lose at one<br /> time."" The man replied, ""Listen buddy, here's my credit card number, you just<br /> have your representative over here in the morning!"" and he hung up the phone.<br /> About 6:00 am the next morning the man gets out of bed,<br /> splashes on some cologne and gets all ready for the next representative. At<br /> about 7:00 am he gets a knock on the door. When he opens the door, he sees this<br /> large gorilla with a sign around his neck stating, ""If I catch you, I am going<br /> to have you.""</p>

After wandering<br /> around for a while he finds what appears to be the only parrot<br /> in the store. He picks it up without a second thought and buys<br /> it. As he is driving home the parrot is squawking and yelling<br /> insults at him the whole way home. He gets home and trys<br /> everything he can to get it to be quiet, he plays soft music,<br /> talks nicely to it, reads stories, everything he can possibly<br /> think of. The parrot is still cursing and squawking and being a<br /> nuisance when the man finally loses his temper. He picks up the<br /> bird and throws it into the freezer, where it lands among his<br /> dinner and slams the door behind it. The bird is still making<br /> noise and squawking around but after a few minutes it stops. The<br /> man, worried that he has hurt it or killed it, quickly opens the<br /> freezer and the parrot walks out onto his arm. The first thing<br /> it says is, ""Thank you so very much for letting me out of the<br /> freezer."" The man, very puzzled, begins to ask the parrot why it<br /> was being so polite when the parrot says, ""May I ask what the<br /> chicken did?""</p>

29148,"<p>Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him, but was moved by Arthur's youthful happiness. So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer; if, after a year, he still had no answer, he would be killed.The Question: What do women really want?Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and, to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query.Well, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess, the prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester. In all, he spoke with everyone but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What most people did tell him was to consult the old witch, as only she would know the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept her price first: The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! Young Arthur as horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage water and often made obscene noises. He had never run across such a repugnant creature. He refused to force his friend to marry her and have to endure such a burden.Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He told him that nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table.Hence, their wedding was proclaimed, and the witch answered Arthur's question:What a woman really wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life.Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it went. The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total freedom.What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief and anguish.Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old witch put her worst manners on display. She ate with her hands, belched and farted, and made everyone uncomfortable. The wedding night approached.Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific night, entered the bedroom. What a sight awaited! The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him! Gawain was astounded and asked what had happened.The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her (when she'd been a witch), half the time she would be her horrible, deformed self, and the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self. Which would he want her to be during the day and which during the night?What a cruel question! Gawain began to think of his predicament:During the day a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch? Or would he prefer having by day a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful woman to enjoy many intimate moments?What would you do?What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read until you've made your own choice................................................................Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself!Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time, because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own life.Isn't that beautiful?But really now, what is the moral of this story?If you don't respect women, things are gonna get ugly!</p>

<p>The color green: Your sex life is suffering</p>
<p>Wilting ivy: Someone important to you is near death</p>
<p>Having a twin: You have two personalities that you display<br /> around completely different groups of people</p>
<p>A man being killed from behind: Your conscience is eating away<br /> at you for turning your back on a friend in need</p>
<p>Divorce: A split from an important object will change the way<br /> you live your life</p>

29162,"<p><strong>If IBM made toasters...</strong> They would want one big toaster where people bring bread to be submitted for overnight toasting. IBM would claim a worldwide market for five, maybe six toasters. </p>
<p><strong>If Microsoft made toasters...</strong> Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have to buy a toaster. You wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'd still have to pay for it anyway. Toaster'95 would weigh 15000 pounds (hence requiring a reinforced steel countertop), draw enough electricity to power a small city, take up 95% of the space in your kitchen, would claim to be the first toaster that let's you control how light or dark you want your toast to be, and would secretly interrogate your other appliances to find out who made them. Everyone would hate Microsoft toasters, but nonetheless would buy them since most of the good bread only works with their toasters. </p>
<p><strong>If Apple made toasters...</strong> It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does, but 5 years earlier. The toast would make a little smiley face at you when it popped up, or else it would get stuck and there would be a little picture of a bomb burned onto it. If they break, these toasters would require a special set of MacToaster Tools to even open up. Worldwide market share would only be 5%, but all the bread in school lunches would be exclusively toasted on the MacToaster. </p>
<p><strong>If The NeXT Corporation made toasters...</strong> It would be a large, perfectly smooth and seamless black cube. Every morning there would be a piece of toast on top of it. Their service department would have an unlisted phone number, and the blueprints for the box would be highly classified government documents. The X-Files would have an episode about it. </p>
<p><strong>If the NSA made toasters...</strong> Your toaster would have a secret trap door that only the NSA could access in case they needed to get at your toast for reasons of national security.</p>
<p><strong>Does DEC still make toasters?...</strong> They made good toasters in the '70s, didn't they?</p>

The crews camped and worked in the woods and he made his rounds to<br /> visit each pair every few days. One particular crew, Sarah and Jim, were not<br /> getting nearly as much work accomplished as the others, so he suspected that<br /> they might be up to some funny business. The following day, he paid them a<br /> visit.<br /> �Is anything funny going on here�? He asked.<br /> �What do you mean by that?� the pair asked back.<br /> ""I mean, you�re not getting much fieldwork done. Are you two, you know, maybe<br /> doing something you�re not supposed to do?�<br /> �Absolutely not!� the Jim replied. � We are strictly co-workers�<br /> �Oh yes,� the Sarah replied, � We hike all day, record our data, return back,<br /> and fall asleep exhausted.<br /> �That�s right!� Jim replied, �And me in my tent, and she in hers!�<br /> The crew supervisor spent the remainder of the day in the field with the pair.<br /> He left the field early, returned to camp, retrieved his Jeep and left the<br /> area.<br /> The following day, the biologist pair had lost their $1000 GPS unit. They<br /> searched high and low, but could not find it. It had simply disappeared from<br /> their camp.  After a few frantic days, they suspected that the crew leader had<br /> taken it. It was the only plausible explanation. That evening, they called him<br /> on the 2-way radio, and politely asked weather he may have inadvertently taken<br /> the unit.<br /> �As a matter of fact, I did take it the day I came up to see if you two were<br /> sleeping together. After realizing I had accidentally taken it with me from the<br /> field, I placed it in Sarah�s sleeping bag where she would be sure to find it!�</p>

29231,"<p>Dear Friend, </p>
<p>We have the distinguished honor of being on the committee for raising five<br /> million dollars for placing a statue of Bill Clinton in the hall of fame in<br /> Washington, D. C. The committee was in a quandary as to where to place the<br /> statue. It was not wise to place it beside the statue of George Washington,who<br /> never told a lie, nor beside Jesse Jackson, who never told the truth, since Bill<br /> Clinton could never tell the difference. </p>
<p>We finally decided to place it beside Christopher Columbus, the greatest<br /> democrat of all. He left not knowing where he was going, did not know where he<br /> was, returned not knowing where he had been, and did it all on borrowed money. </p>
<p>Over 5,000 years ago, Moses said to the people of Israel, ""Pick up your<br /> shovels, mount your asses and camels, and I will lead you to the promised land.""<br /> Nearly 5,000 years later, Roosevelt said, "" Lay down your shovels, sit on your<br /> asses, and light up a camel, this is the promised land."" </p>
<p>Now, Bill Clinton is going to steal your shovel, kick your asses, raise the<br /> price of camels, and mortgage the promised land. If you are one of the fortunate<br /> people who has anything left after paying taxes, we expect a generous<br /> contribution to this worthwhile project. Fraternally,<br /> Bill Clinton Statue Committee</p>

When I asked why, she<br /> explained that it was necessary to compare the signature on the<br /> credit card with the signature I just signed on the receipt.

So what does your screen look like now?''Nothing.''Nothing?''It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type.''Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?''How do I tell?'[Uh-oh. Well, let's give it a try anyway.]  'Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?''What's a sea-prompt?'[Uh-huh, thought so. Let's try a different tack.] 'Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on  the screen?''There isn't any cursor: I told you, it  won't accept anything I type.'[Ah--at least s/he knows what a cursor is. Sounds  like a hardware problem. I wonder if s/he's kicked out his/her monitor's power plug.] 'Does your monitor have a power indicator?''What's a monitor?'[SIGH]  'It's the thing with the screen on it  that looks like a TV. Does it have a little  light that tells you when it's on?''I don't know.''Well, then look on the back of the monitor  and find where the power cord goes into it.  Can you see that?'[sound of rustling and jostling] [muffled]  'Yes, I think so.''Great! Follow the cord to the plug, and tell  me if it's plugged into the wall.'[pause] 'Yes, it is.'[Hmm. Well, that's interesting. I doubt s/he  would have accidentally turned it off, and I  don't want to send him/her hunting for the power switch because I don't know what kind of monitor  s/he has and it's bound to have more than one  switch on it. Maybe the video cable is loose or something.]'When you were behind the monitor, did you  notice that there were two cables plugged  into the back of it, not just one?''No.''Well, there are. I need you to look back  there again and find the other cable.'[muffled] 'Okay, here it is.''Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged  securely into the back of your computer.'[still muffled] 'I can't reach.''Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?'[clear again] 'No.''Even if you maybe put your knee on something  and lean way over?''Oh, it's not because I don't have the right  angle--it's because it's dark.''Dark?''Yes--the office light is off, and the only  light I have is coming in from the window.''Well, turn on the office light then.''I can't.''No? Why not?''Because there's a power outage.''A power--!?!' ...[AAAAAAARGH!]'A power outage? Aha! Okay, we've got it  licked now. Do you still have the boxes  and manuals and packing stuff your  computer came in?''Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.''Good! Go get them, and unplug your system  and pack it up just like it was when you  got it. Then take it back to the store you  bought it from.''Really? Is it that bad?''Yes, I'm afraid it is.''Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?''Tell them you're TOO STUPID TO OWN A COMPUTER!' [slam]</p>

<p>The two American men are contemplating suicide because the American woman keeps on complaining about sand in everything, insisting she can do everything they can do, expressing the need to equally divide and organize the household chores, maintaining that her last boyfriend respected her opinion and treated her nicer than they do, speculating about whether all this means her relationship with her mother will improve and asking if the sand and palm trees make her look fat.</p>

29261,"<p>A guy from Tyson Foods arranged a visit with the Pope. After receiving the papal blessing he whispered, ""Your Eminence, we have a deal for you.

<p>The Pope responds saying, ""That is impossible. The Prayer is the Word of the Lord and it must not be changed.""</p>
<p>""Well,"" says the Tyson man, ""We are prepared to donate one billion dollars to the Church if you change the Lord's Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread...' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken...""</p>

29268,"<p>There was a father and his young son who lived in a secluded village somewhere in central Australia. The boy's mother had left the father under difficult circumstances, and he had had bad experiences with women ever since. So he took his boy aside one day and told him, ""Listen son, don't go messing around with women, because, you know, down there, they've got teeth down there.""</p>
<p>The boy listened intently to his father's advice. Years passed, the boy has grown up and his father has died, leaving him alone. So, one day, the boy ventures to the closest large town, where he goes to a club in search of companionship. He strikes up a conversation with a beautiful young girl. Things are going well, and they end up back at her place. </p>
<p>They are about to get into bed when the boy remembers his father's advice and shys away.</p>
<p>""What's wrong?"" she asks. ""Well, my father told me that women have teeth down there"" replied the young man. </p>
<p>""Of course we haven't got teeth down there!! Have a look if you like."" </p>
<p>So he takes her up on the offer. He takes off her panties, and he's poking around, examining the lady's most private parts. ""Hmmmm. I don't see any teeth down here, but you should see the state of your gums.""</p>

29272,"<p>I. Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding -glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.)II. Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey face-mask, and a long-sleeved flak jacket.III.  Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule.)IV. . Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life.V. Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more than two or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring free and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national record for cats is three latherings, so don't expect toomuch.)IV.  Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this part will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple compared with what you have just been through. That's because by now the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After all the water is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat. In a few days the cat will relaxenough to be removed from your leg. He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine. You will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to give him a bath. But at least now he smells a lot better</p>

She finally remembered her daddy's advice that if she got caught in a blizzard she should wait for a snow plow to come by and follow it. That way she would not get stuck in the snow drift. This made her feel much better and sure enough in a little while a snow plow went by and she started to follow it.<br /> As she followed the snow plow she was feeling very smug as they continued and she was not having any problem with the blizzard conditions. After quite some time had passed she was somewhat surprise when the snow plow stopped and the driver got out and came back to her car and signaled for her to roll down her window. The snow plow driver wanted to know if she was all right as she had been following him for a long time. </p>

29325,"<p>A fat lady rides the bus to work every day. Today she's in some<br /> discomfort because she has a pain in her lower abdomen. She<br /> finally realizes that its just a tremendous build up of gas from<br /> something she ate. The bus is quite crowded and she doesn't know<br /> what to do. Then she remembers that pretty soon the bus will run<br /> across some railroad tracks and it will rattle and bang and make<br /> lots of noise. She will be able to pass this gas and nobody will<br /> know.</p>
<p>What she doesn't know is that the bus driver has grown tired of<br /> all the noise the bus makes when it rattles and bangs across the<br /> railroad tracks. So last night he stayed after work and had the<br /> maintenance crew tighten up all the loose bolts and lubricate<br /> all the moving parts to quiet down the old bus.</p>

<p>Well, a year goes past (as they often do in jokes like this) and the same<br /> golfer is out golfing on the same course at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits<br /> one into the same woods and goes off looking for his ball. </p>
<p>When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and asks how he is doing.<br /> The leprechaun says, ""I'm fine, and might I ask how's your golf game?"" The<br /> golfer says, ""It's great! I hit under par every time."" ""I did that for you,""<br /> responds the leprechaun, ""And might I ask how your money is holding out?"" </p>
<p>""Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull<br /> out a hundred dollar bill"" he replied. The leprechaun smiles and says, ""I did<br /> that for you. And might I ask how is your sex life?"" </p>
<p>Now the golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, ""Well, maybe once or<br /> twice a week."" Floored the leprechaun stammers, ""Once or twice a week?"" </p>
<p>The golfer looks at him sheepishly and says, ""Well, that's not too bad for a<br /> Catholic priest in a small parish.""</p>

""Dad, she said, 'Yes!' also!""His dad told him, ""There you go.""His son looked at him, puzzled.

29330,"<p>One day a cat dies of natural causes and goes to heaven. There he     meets the Lord Himself. The Lord says to the cat, ""You lived a     good life and if there is any way I can make your stay in Heaven     more comfortable, please let Me know."" The cat thinks for a     moment and says, ""Lord, all my life I have lived with a poor     family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor."" The Lord stops     the cat and says, ""Say no more,"" and a wonderful fluffy pillow     appears.    A few days later, six mice are killed in a tragic farming     accident and go to heaven. Again, there is the Lord there to     great them with the same offer. The mice answer, ""All of our     lives we have been chased. We have had to run from cats, dogs and     even women with brooms. Running, running, running; we're tired of     running. Do you think we could have roller skates so we don't     have to run anymore?"" The Lord says, ""Say no more,"" and fits each     mouse with beautiful new roller skates.    About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him     snoozing on the pillow. The Lord gently wakes the cat and asks     him, ""How are things since you got here?""    The cat stretches and yawns and replies, ""It is wonderful here.     Better than I could have ever expected. And those 'Meals On     Wheels' you've been sending by are the best!""</p>

29341,"<p>An aquarium is just interactive television for cats.</p>
<p>Anything on the ground is a cat toy. Anything not there yet, will be.</p>
<p>At least dogs do what you tell them to do. Cats take a message and get back to you.</p>
<p>Buy a dog a toy and it will play with it for ever. Buy a cat a present and it will play with the wrapper for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Cat's motto: No matter what you've done wrong, always try to make it look like the dog did it.</p>
<p>Cat rule #2: Bite the hand that won't feed you fast enough.</p>
<p>Cats are rather delicate creatures and they are subject to a good many ailments, but I never heard of one who suffered from insomnia.</p>
<p>Cats are smarter than dogs. You can't get eight cats to pull a sled through snow.</p>
<p>Cats aren't clean, they're just covered with cat spit.</p>
<p>Cats don't hunt seals. They would if they knew what they were and where to find them. But they don't, so that's all right.</p>
<p>Cats instinctively know the exact moment their owners will wake up. Then they wake them 10 minutes sooner.</p>
<p>Cats know what we feel. They don't care, but they know.</p>
<p>Cats seem to go on the principle that it never does any harm to ask for what you want.</p>
<p>Dogs have owners. Cats have staff.</p>
<p>Dogs believe they are human. Cats believe they are God.</p>
<p>I had to get rid of my wife. The cat was allergic.</p>
<p>I have studied many philosophers and many cats. The wisdom of cats is infinitely superior.</p>
<p>In a cat's eye, all things belong to cats.</p>
<p>On the Internet, nobody knows you're a cat.</p>
<p>One cat just leads to another.</p>
<p>People that hate cats will come back as mice in their next life.</p>
<p>Some people say that cats are sneaky, evil, and cruel. True, and they have many other fine qualities as well.</p>

"
29375,"<p>Q: Why aren't there many blonde gymnasts?</p>
<p>A: Because when they do the splits, they stick to the floor.</p>
"
29376,"<p>Q: I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this true?</p>
<p>A: Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want to live longer? Take a nap.</p>
<p>Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?</p>
<p>A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily allowance of vegetable slop.</p>
<p>Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?</p>
<p>A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories: animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables.</p>
<p>Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?</p>
<p>A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.</p>
<p>Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to ""spot"" for him while he did the bench press. What did he mean?</p>
<p>A: ""Spotting"" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you find that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought to re-evaluate your exercise program.</p>
<p>Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise program?</p>
<p>A: Can't think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No Pain-No Pain.</p>
<p>Q: If I stop smoking, will I live longer?</p>
<p>A: Nope. Smoking is a sign of individual expression and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.</p>
<p>Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?</p>
<p>A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for you?</p>
<p>Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?</p>
<p>A: Thicker gravy.</p>
<p>Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle?</p>
<p>A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You should only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.</p>
<p>I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about trying to live a longer and healthier life...</p>

<p>Losing his presence of mind, he jumped up, gathered up the bed<br /> sheets, and threw them out the hospital window. A drunk was<br /> walking by the hospital when the sheets landed on him.

29407,"<p>By Terry Jones (of Monty Python)<br /> February 20, 2002<br /> Times Observer</p>
<p>To prevent terrorism by dropping bombs on Iraq is such an obvious idea that I can't think why no one has thought of it before. It's so simple. If only the UK had done something similar in Northern Ireland, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in today. The moment the IRA blew up the Horseguards' bandstand, the Government should have declared its own War on Terrorism. It should have immediately demanded that the Irish government hand over Gerry Adams. If they refused to do so - or quibbled about needing proof of his guilt - we could have told them that this was no time for prevarication and that they must hand over not only Adams but all IRA terrorists in the Republic. If they tried to stall by claiming that it was hard to tell who were IRA terrorists and who weren't, because they don't go around wearing identity badges, we would have been free to send in the bombers. </p>
<p>It is well known that the best way of picking out terrorists is to fly 30,000ft above the capital city of any state that harbours them and drop bombs - preferably cluster bombs. It is conceivable that the bombing of Dublin might have provoked some sort of protest, even if just from James Joyce fans, and there is at least some likelihood of increased anti-British sentiment in what remained of the city and thus a rise in the numbers of potential terrorists. But this, in itself, would have justified the tactic of bombing them in the first place. We would have nipped them in the bud, so to speak. I hope you follow the argument. </p>
<p>Having bombed Dublin and, perhaps, a few IRA training bogs in Tipperary, we could not have afforded to be complacent. We would have had to turn our attention to those states which had supported and funded the IRA terrorists through all these years. The main provider of funds was, of course, the USA, and this would have posed us with a bit of a problem. Where to bomb in America? It's a big place and it's by no means certain that a small country like the UK could afford enough bombs to do the whole job. It's going to cost the US billions to bomb Iraq and a lot of that is empty countryside. America, on the other hand, provides a bewildering number of targets. </p>
<p>Should we have bombed Washington, where the policies were formed? Or should we have concentrated on places where Irishmen are known to lurk, like New York, Boston and Philadelphia? We could have bombed any police station and fire station in most major urban centres, secure in the knowledge that we would be taking out significant numbers of IRA sympathisers. On St Patrick's Day, we could have bombed Fifth Avenue and scored a bull's-eye. </p>
<p>In those American cities we couldn't afford to bomb, we could have rounded up American citizens with Irish names, put bags over their heads and flown them in chains to Guernsey or Rockall, where we could have given them food packets marked 'My Kind of Meal' and exposed them to the elements with a clear conscience. </p>
<p>The same goes for Australia. There are thousands of people in Sydney and Melbourne alone who have actively supported Irish republicanism by sending money and good wishes back to people in the Republic, many of whom are known to be IRA members and sympathisers. A well-placed bomb or two Down Under could have taken out the ringleaders and left the world a safer place. Of course, it goes without saying that we would also have had to bomb various parts of London such as Camden Town, Lewisham and bits of Hammersmith and we should certainly have had to obliterate, if not the whole of Liverpool, at least the Scotland Road area. </p>
<p>And that would be it really, as far as exterminating the IRA and its supporters. Easy. The War on Terrorism provides a solution so uncomplicated, so straightforward and so gloriously simple that it baffles me why it has taken a man with the brains of George W. Bush to think of it. </p>
<p>So, sock it to Iraq, George. Let's make the world a safer place.</p>

29417,"<p>IT'S OFFICIAL : CHEMISTRY LECTURES ARE A YAWN.October 9, 1995A scientist has come up with proof of something students have known for years -- chemistry lectures are boring. In an article published in the current issue of Chemistry in Britain, a university chemistry lecturer introduced a guest lecturer to a class of 50 doctoral candidates.Then, he and his colleagues studied variations in what he calls the HTFDR -- ""head-to-floor distance reduction."" After about an hour , the average HTFDR dropped from 135cm to 121cm, said the author of the study, who preferred to remain anonymous.The HTFDR immediately bounced back to normal when the speaker uttered the magic words: ""And in conclusion . . .""</p>

29422,"<p>Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch. Unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull so that they can breed their own stock. </p>
<p>The brunette balances their chequebook, then takes their last $600 dollars out west to another ranch, where a man has a prize bull for sale. Upon leaving, she tells her sister, ''When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home.'' </p>
<p>The brunette arrives at the man's ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599, no less. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. </p>
<p>She walks into the telegraph office, and says, ''I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pick-up truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.''   </p>
<p>The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, '' It's just 99 cents a word.'' Well, with only $1 left after paying for the bull, the brunette realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word. </p>
<p>After thinking for a few minutes, she nods, and says, ''I want you to send her the word, 'comfortable.''' The telegraph operator shakes his head. ''How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pick-up truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her the word, 'comfortable?'""  </p>
<p>The brunette explains, ''My sister's blonde. She'll read it slow.''</p>

<p>Well, they talked about it for a while but no one could decide a fair way of choosing who should jump.</p>
<p>Finally, the brunette, exasperated by the indecisiveness of the blondes, could see that if nobody acted soon the rope was going to snap.</p>
<p>To save the others she bravely decided that it must be her who made the sacrifice.</p>

29437,"<p>A quick narrative. I always wanted a hopped up muscle car when I was younger. I couldn't afford one. Now I can, and I have one. It's a '70 Mustang, and her name is Bessie. Bessie is the proto-typical juvenile, male-caveman, scratch yourself and drink cheap beer car. Chromed engine, dual exhaust, 250 horsepower, big tires. </p>
<p>I'm driving Bessie on Beach Boulevard behind an ancient guy in a beat up truck. He decides to turn in front of me without a blinker. I accelerate to swerve and avoid him, and this crazy, over aerobicized woman jumps in front of my car with her hand up. Meet Ethel, the neighborhood busybody/nuisance. </p>
<p>She proceeds to yell in my window, ""Hey, slow down you idiot."" I'm a well-bred, mellow guy by nature, so I ignore this. As I drive away, she yells, ""Jerk"" at me again. Twice? I turn around and drive up next to her. </p>
<p>""Do you have a problem?"" I ask. </p>
<p>""Yeah, why are you driving like an idiot?"" </p>
<p>""I was driving like an idiot? How, exactly?"" </p>
<p>""You were speeding. I watched you."" </p>
<p>""You were? I see. How did you measure my speed?"" (Ever the interrogator) </p>
<p>""I heard you."" </p>
<p>""So, you measured my speed by ear?""</p>
<p>""I can hear."" </p>
<p>""How fast did you HEAR me going?"" </p>
<p>""Look,"" she says, ""I don't have to take this. Here comes a cop. I'll wave him down."" </p>
<p>THE POLICE? This woman is a trip. She waves him down, and proceeds to tell him that she observed me speeding. ""What happened?"" he asks. I told him the story, and told him that I accelerated to an indicated 33 mph (the speed limit is 35) to avoid a collision. ""Are those mufflers legal?"" Ethel asks. She's pushing it. I reply, ""I have a C.A.R.B. exemption for them."" I give the paperwork to the cop. She tries to find another thing to screw me with. She says, ""What about those big tires? They CAN'T be legal."" </p>
<p>I began feeling little overheated gears in the back of my head start to turn. ""These tires were available on the 1970 Boss 429,"" I told the cop, ""Which makes them street legal as a replacement."" Ethel gets angry. She whines, ""So you're not going to give out any tickets to this jerk?"" The cop says, ""No, I am not."" </p>
<p>I've about had it. So I say, ""Sir, this woman told you that she left the street at the corner, and then she met up with my car here. According to Title 39, pedestrians have to cross the street at a right angle. This woman admitted she crossed at a 45-degree angle, which is a ticketable offense."" </p>
<p>""What?"" The cop looks confused. </p>
<p>""Also, she told you that she walked in front of my car to stop me. A citizen can't detain someone without probable cause, under Terry v. Ohio (My new favorite case). Since she couldn't measure my speed, she had no probable cause to detain me. That is an indictable offense."" </p>
<p>The cop says, ""But, I didn't see any of this."" </p>
<p>""But,"" I said, ""I did, and, as an officer of the Court, I can demand her arrest. I'll agree to dismiss the Illegal Detention charge, but I want her cited for not crossing at a right angle and Hazardous Conduct on a Public Street."" </p>
<p>The cop called his Lieutenant, and after the cop told the story, he authorized the summonses. She went home with $215.00 worth of traffic tickets, and they are worth a total of four points against her license, as well as the appropriate insurance surcharge! Of course, if she demands a trial I won't prosecute. But the look on her face as she walked away was more than enough satisfaction for me. </p>
<p>Yeah, I've got a law degree, and I'm not afraid to use it.</p>

After dinner, he drove to a little mountain about 5 miles away from the city, and told her: ""I want you right here and now. Do it or get out and go home!"" Without saying a word, she got out and walked home.</p>

29448,"<p>It was Saturday morning and Jake, an avid hunter, woke up ready to go bag the<br /> first deer of the season. He walks down to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee,<br /> and to his surprise he finds his wife, Alice, sitting there, fully dressed in<br /> camouflage. Jake asks her, �What are you up to?� Alice smiles, �I'm going<br /> hunting with you!� Jake, though he has many reservations, reluctantly decides to<br /> take her along.<br /> They arrive at the hunting site. Jake sets his wife safely up in the tree<br /> stand and tells her: �If you see a deer, take careful aim on it and I'll come<br /> running back as soon as I hear the shot.� Jake walks away with a smile on his<br /> face knowing that Alice couldn't bag an elephant -- much less a deer. </p>
<p>But not 10 minutes pass when he is startled as he hears an array of gunshots.<br /> Quickly, Jake starts running back. As Jake gets closer to her stand, he hears<br /> Alice screaming, �Get away from my deer!� Confused, Jake races faster towards<br /> his screaming wife. And again he hears her yell, �Get away from my deer!�<br /> followed by another volley of gunfire. </p>
<p>Now within sight of where he had left his wife, Jake is surprised to see a<br /> cowboy, with his hands high in the air. The cowboy, obviously distraught, says,<br /> �Okay, lady, okay!You can have your deer! Just let me get my saddle off it!�</p>

29453,"<p>I had eighteen bottles of whiskey in the cellar and my wife insisted I empty<br /> the contents of each bottle down the sink, or else... After careful<br /> consideration, I reluctantly agreed and finally proceeded with the unpleasant<br /> task. I withdrew the cork from the first bottle and poured the contents down the<br /> sink with the exception of one glass, which I drank. Then, I withdrew the cork<br /> from the second bottle and did likewise with it, with the exception of one<br /> glass, which I drank. I then withdrew the cork from the third bottle and poured<br /> the whiskey down the sink which I drank. I pulled the cork from the fourth<br /> bottle down the sink and poured the bottle down the glass, which I drank. I<br /> pulled the bottle from the cork of the next and drank one sink out of it, and<br /> threw the rest down the glass. I pulled the sink out of the next glass and<br /> poured the cork down the bottle. Then, I corked the sink with the glass, bottled<br /> the drink, and drank the pour. When I had everything emptied, I steadied the<br /> house with one hand, counted the glasses, corks, bottles, and sinks with the<br /> other, which were twenty-nine, and as the houses came by I counted them again,<br /> and finally I had all the houses in one bottle, which I drank. I'm not under the<br /> affluence of alcohol as some tinkle peep I am. I'm not half as think as you<br /> might drink.

29480,"<p>1. What are you thinking about?<br /> 2. Do you love me?<br /> 3. Do I look fat in this?<br /> 4. Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5. What would you do if I died? </p>
<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one<br /> is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man<br /> answers incorrectly (i.e., tells the truth). Therefore, as<br /> a public service, each question is analyzed below, along<br /> with possible responses. </p>
<p>Question # 1: What are you thinking about? The proper<br /> answer to this, of course, is: "" I'm sorry if I've been<br /> pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm,<br /> wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are,<br /> and how lucky I am to have met you."" This response<br /> obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which<br /> most likely is one of the following: a. Football. b. Golf.<br /> c. How fat you are. d. How much prettier she is than you e.<br /> How I would spend the insurance money if you died.<br /> Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by<br /> Al Bundy, who once told Peg, ""If I wanted you to know what<br /> I was thinking, I would be talking to you!"" </p>
<p>Question # 2: Do you love me? The proper response<br /> is: ""YES!"" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in<br /> order, ""Yes, dear.""<br /> Inappropriate responses include: a. Oh Yeah, sh@*-loads. b.<br /> Would it make you feel better if I said yes? c. That<br /> depends on what you mean by love. d. Does it matter? e.<br /> Who, me? </p>
<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat? The correct answer is an<br /> emphatic: ""Of course not!""<br /> Incorrect answers are: a. Compared to what? b. I wouldn't<br /> call you fat, but you're not exactly thin. c. A little<br /> extra weight looks good on you. d. I've seen fatter. e.<br /> Sorry what did you say? I was just thinking about how I<br /> would spend the insurance money if you died. </p>
<p>Question # 4: Do you think she's prettier than me? Once<br /> again, the proper response is an emphatic: ""Of course not!""<br /> Incorrect responses include: a. Yes, but you have a better<br /> personality b. Not prettier, but definitely thinner c. Not<br /> as pretty as you when you were her age d. Define pretty e.<br /> Sorry what did you say ? I was just thinking about how I<br /> would spend the insurance money if you died. </p>
<p>Question # 5: What would you do if I died? A definite no-<br /> win question.(The real answer, of course, is ""Buy a Lotus<br /> and a Boat"").<br /> No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an<br /> hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:<br /> WOMAN: Would you get married again? MAN: Definitely not!<br /> WOMAN: Why not - don't you like being married? MAN: Of<br /> course I do. WOMAN: Then why wouldn't you remarry? MAN:<br /> Okay, I'd get married again. WOMAN: You would? (with a<br /> hurtful look on her face) MAN: (makes audible groan) WOMAN:<br /> Would you sleep with her in our bed? MAN: Where else would<br /> we sleep? WOMAN: Would you put away my pictures, and<br /> replace them with pictures of her? MAN: That would seem<br /> like the proper thing to do. WOMAN: And would you let her<br /> use my golf clubs? MAN: She can't use them; she's left-<br /> handed. WOMAN: - - - silence - - .</p>

29483,"<p>A little old lady goes into the Chase Manhattan Bank, tells the teller that she has $5,000,000.00 in cash to be used to open an account. However, before she just hands over that much money, she would like to meet the man who runs things.<br /> The teller calls the bank president, and arranges the meeting. The lady goes into his office, and after introductions are made, the bank president asks the lady how she came to have so much cash on hand. </p>
<p>The lady tells him that she's an avid gambler. The bank president says ""You must be the luckiest person that I've ever met, to win so much!"" ""No"" replies the lady, ""I will only bet on a sure thing, and since I am somewhat gifted with the ability to see the future, ALL of my bets are sure things."" </p>
<p>The bank president smiles and says ""No, it must be luck madam. There is no such thing as a sure thing"". ""I'll prove it!"" says the lady. She then closes her eyes and starts to hum softly for about 30 seconds. ""O.K...I have looked into your future and I'm afraid there's bad news. By 8:00 a.m tomorrow, your testicles will have changed shape and will be perfectly square."" </p>
<p>The bank president is starting to think this lady is nuts, so he tells her that he has no more time for this malarky and he would like for her to leave. The lady refuses, and proposes a wager. The man declines until the old lady says ""Look, I'll bet you $5,000.00 that by 8:00 tomorrow morning, your testicles will be square! What have you got to lose? You claim I can't win - there's no such thing as A sure thing...right?"" By this the bank pres. is really starting to dislike this old broad, and not only would he enjoy teaching her a lesson, he could use the $5K. ""O.K fine!"" he yells ""You got a bet!"". </p>
<p>""Wonderful!"" proclaims the lady, ""I'll see you 1st thing tomorrow. Do you mind if my attorney accompanies me? I always have him present for wagers over $500.00."" The man replies ""Lady, I don't care who you bring, as long as you bring the money!"" </p>
<p>That night the bank president has some strange dreams, and what the lady said is really starting to get to him. The next morning, he's greatly releaved to see that everything is the same shape as always. He dresses, and goes to the bank where he finds the lady and a man waiting for him. </p>
<p>""Well"" says the lady, ""Do you want to have the money deposited into my new account, or do you have cash?"" </p>
<p>The bank pres. smiles and replies ""I feel bad doing this, but nutty old dames like you need to be taught a lesson sometimes, and I know that you can afford it, so it is you that must pay. You see, my testicles are the same shape they've always been. Not the slightest bit square."" ""What!"" cries the lady, ""That can't be!! I never imagined that it would come to this, but I won't pay one cent until I've examined the testicles myself!"" </p>
<p>The bank pres. blushes with embarrassment, but finally replies ""Under the circumstances, I suppose that's not unreasonable"" and with that he drops his pants. The lady gets on her knees to grasp him, and her attorney screams ""DAMMIT YOU OLD BAT!! YOU'VE DONE IT TO ME AGAIN!!"" and he hands her $15,000.00 in cash. </p>
<p>At this point the bank president is completely lost. ""What in the hell was that all about?"" he asks. ""Oh,"" says the lady as she carefully puts the money into her bag ""I bet him that I would literally have the president of the Chase Manhattan Bank by the balls before 9:00 this morning. So here's the $5,000.00 that I lost to you, and please add the other $10,000.00 to my new account""</p>

29484,"<p>Once upon a time, there were 3 little pigs. The straw pig, the stick pig, and the brick pig. One day this nasty old wolf came up to the straw pig's house and said, ""I'm gonna huff and puff, and blow your house down.""And he did!The straw pig went running over to the stick pig's house and said ""Let me in, please, the wolf just blew down my house!""The stick pig let the straw pig in. Then the wolf showed up and said, ""I'm gonna huff and puff, and blow your house down!""And he did!So, the straw pig and the stick pig went running over to the brick pig's house and said ""Let us in! ""The wolf just blew down our houses and we're scared!""So the brick pig let them in. The wolf caught up with them and said ""I'm gonna huff and puff, and blow your house down.""While he was huffing and puffing, the straw pig and the stick pig were so scared! But the brick pig picked up the phone and made a call. A few minutes passed and all of a sudden this big, black stretch limousine drove up. Out came two massive pigs in pinstriped suits and fedoras.They went over to the wolf and grabbed him by the neck and proceeded to beat the shit out of him. Then they got back into their limo and drove off, leaving the wolf bleeding on the street.The straw pig and the stick pig were amazed! They asked the brick pig, ""Who the hell were those guys?""And the brick pig said, ""Oh, those are my cousins, the Guinea Pigs.""</p>

The two French men and the French woman are living happily together having loads of sex. The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of when they alternate with the German woman. The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them. The two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman. The two Polish men took a long look at the endless ocean and one look at the Polish woman and they started swimming. The two American men are contemplating the virtues of suicide, while the American woman keeps on bitching about her body being her own, the true nature of feminism, how she can do everything that they can do, about the necessity of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how her last boyfriendrespected her opinion and treated her much nicer and how her relationship with her mother is improving - but at least the taxes are low and it's not raining. The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are waiting for further instructions. The two Australian men beat each other senseless for the Australian woman, who is checking out all the other men after calling them both 'bloody wankers'. Both the New Zealand men are searching the island for sheep. The Irish began by dividing the island into North and South and by setting up a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture because it gets sort of foggy after the first few bottles of coconut whisky, but they are satisfied in that at least the English are not getting any.</p>

29488,"<p>When Bill and Hillary first got married, Bill said, ""I am putting a box under<br /> the bed. You must promise never to look in it."" In all their 30 years of<br /> marriage Hillary never looked. However on the afternoon of their 30th<br /> anniversary curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked<br /> inside.<br /> In the box were 3 empty beer cans and $1,874.25 in cash. She closed the box<br /> and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was<br /> doubly curious as to why.<br /> That evening they were out for a special dinner. After dinner Hillary could no<br /> longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, ""I am so sorry. For all<br /> these years I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed.<br /> However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know<br /> why do you keep the cans in the box?""<br /> Bill thought for a while and said, ""I guess after all these years you deserve<br /> to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in<br /> the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.""<br /> Hillary was shocked, but said, ""I am very disappointed and saddened but guess<br /> after all those years away from home on the road, temptation does happen and I<br /> guess that 3 times is not that bad considering the years.""<br /> They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, ""So<br /> why do you have all that money in the box?""<br /> Bill answered, ""Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them<br /> to the recycling center and redeemed them for cash...""</p>

29497,"<p>A Shorter, Harsher Titanic   (Scene 1)KATE WINSLET: Why, this is a fancy boat, isn't it?KATE'S WEASELLY FIANCE: Yes it certainly is. Here is the art you asked for. It is by an artist named 'Picasso.' I am certain he will amount to nothing.KATE: Ha ha ha. That is very funny to our 90's  audience, because they know this priceless paintings  will sink with the boat.LEONARDO DICAPRIO: Hello, I'm Leonardo DiCaprio. Perhaps you have seen the many Internet sites dedicated to the worship of me. You are very pretty.KATE: Thank you. So are you.LEONARDO: I know. Prettier than you, in fact. I am going to put on my 'brooding' face now, to ensure that women will keep coming back again and again to see this movie. Later, my white shirt will be soaking wet.KATE: While you're doing that, I will concentrate on standing here and looking pretty, to keep the men in the audience interested until the boat sinks and people start dying.WEASELLY FIANCE: Excuse me. I do not like you, Leonardo, even though you saved my fiancee's life. I am going to sneer at you and treat you like dirt because you're poor, and then I'll probably be physically abusive to my fiancee, and then, just to make sure the audience really hates me, and to make sure my character is entirely one dimensional, perhaps I'll throw an elderly person into the water.AUDIENCE: Boo! We hate you! Even though all real people  have at least a few admirable qualities, we have not  been shown any of yours, and plus, you're trying to  come between Leonardo and Kate, and so therefore we  hate you! Boo! (Even though technically it is Leonardo  who is coming between you and Kate. But Leonardo is  handsomer than you, even though he is only 13, so we  are on his side. Boo!)   ***   (Scene 2)LEONARDO: I'm glad we snuck away like this so that you could cheat on your fiance.KATE: So am I. Even though I am engaged to him and have made a commitment to marry him, that is no reason why you and I cannot climb into the backseat of a car and steam up the windows together. The fact that I am the heroine of the movie will no doubt help the cattle-like audience forgive me of this, though they would probably be VERY angry indeed if my fiance were to do the samething to me.AUDIENCE: Darn straight we would! Moo! We mean, Boo!LEONARDO: I agree. First, I would like to draw you, though, so of course you have to take off your clothes.KATE:But can a movie with five minutes of continuous nudity be at all successful in say, Provo, Utah, where the audiences might not stand for that sort of thing?LEONARDO: I would be willing to bet that for the first three  weeks the film is in release, every single showing at Wynnsong Theater in Provo will sell out.NARRATOR: According to Wynnsong manager Matt Palmer, that is exactly what happened.KATE: Well all right, then. (sound of clothes hitting the floor)  ***   (Scene 3)FIRST MATE: Captain, we're about to hit an iceberg.CAPTAIN: Great, I could use some ice for my drink. (sound of drinking)ICEBERG: (hits boat)FIRST MATE: That can't be good.CAPTAIN: Bottoms up!AUDIENCE: (silence)FIRST MATE: That was irony, you fools.AUDIENCE: Baa! Moo! Where's Leonardo? *** (Scene 4)LEONARDO: I have been informed that this boat is sinkingKATE: That is terribleLEONARDO: Would you like to engage in some more immoral-but-justified behavior?KATE: Certainly.WEASELLY FIANCE: (aside) I'm getting the raw end of the deal here: (to Leonardo) Listen, Leonardo, to cement my morally-dubious-yet somehow-less- annoying-than-you personality, I am going to handcuff you to this  pipe, here in a room that will soon be filling with water, due to the fact that we are sinking, which I believe has been mentioned previously.LEONARDO: Why don't you just shoot me?WEASELLY FIANCE: Because then you wouldn't be able to escape and save Kate from me. Of course, you're going to die anyway-AUDIENCE: Don't spoil it for us! Boo!LEONARDO: He's right, though. I am doomed.AUDIENCE: Aww, look how cute he is when he's doomed.WEASELLY FIANCE: I hate you people.  ***   (Scene 5)150-YEAR-OLD-KATE: And that's when Leonardo rescued me from my  evil fiance and helped me float on a board in the water. Of course, if it hadn't been for having to rescue HIM, I could have gotten on an actual lifeboat, and not frozen my legs nearly off. Anyway, he's pretty much dead now, and I'm well over a thousand years old, and who's making my supper? I need a bath. Turn down that Enya music, it's making my ears hurt. You kids today,with your loud music. Why, when I was - hey! Don't you walk away from me, Mr. Snooty- Patootie! I'd turn you over my kneee, if I had one. I'll beat you in the head with this huge diamond! Come back here! (Fade to black; roll credits; play annoying Celine Dion song.)</p>

"
29501,"<p>Dear Alcohol, </p>
<p>First and foremost, let me tell you that I'm a huge fan of yours. Your many  dimensions are mind boggling (different than beer goggling, which I'll  touch upon shortly). Yes, my friend, you always seem to be there when  needed. The perfect post-work cocktail, a beer with the game, and you're even around in the holidays hidden inside chocolates as you warm us when  we're stuck in the midst of endless family gatherings. Yet lately I've been  wondering about your intentions. </p>
<p>While I want to believe that you have my best interests at heart, I feel that your influence has led to some unwise consequences, briefed below for  your review. </p>
<p>1. Phone calls: While I agree with you that communication is important, I  question the suggestion that any conversation of  substance or necessity takes place after 2am. </p>
<p>2. Eating: Now, you know I love a good meal and, though cooking is far from  my specialty, why you suggested that I eat a kabob with chili sauce,  coupled with pot noodles and some stale chips (washed down with chocolate  Nesquik and topped off with a Kit Kat all after a few cheese curls and  chili cheese fries) is beyond me. Eclectic eater I am, but I think you  went too far this time. </p>
<p>3. Clumsiness: Unless you're subtly trying to tell me that I need to do  more yoga to improve my balance, I see NO need to  hammer the issue home by causing me to fall down. Completely unnecessary.  Similarly, it should never take me more than 45 seconds to get the front  door key into the lock. </p>
<p>4. Pictures: This can be a blessing in disguise, as it can often clarify  the last point below, but the following costumes are banned from ever being  placed on my head in public again: Indian wigs, sombreros, bows, ties,  boxes, upside-down cups,  inflatable balloon animals, traffic cones, or bras. </p>
<p>5. Beer Goggles: If I think I may know him/her from somewhere, I most  likely do not. Please do not request that I go over  and see if in fact, I do actually know that person. The phrase 'let's  F***'is illegal from now on. While I may be thinking this, please  reinstate the brain-to-mouth-block that would stop this thought from  becoming a statement, especially in public. </p>
<p>6. Furthermore, the hangovers have GOT to stop. Now, I know a little  penance for our previous evenings debauchery may be in  order, but the 2pm-hangover immobility is completely unacceptable. I ask  that, if the proper precautions are taken (water, vitamin B, bread  products, aspirin) prior to going to bed/passing out facedown on the  kitchen floor with a bag of popcorn, the hangover should be minimal and in  no way interfere with my daily Saturday or Sunday (or any day for that  matter)activities. </p>
<p>Come on now, it's only fair -- you do your part, I'll do mine. Alcohol, I  have enjoyed our friendship for some years  now and would like to ensure that we remain on good terms. You've been the  invoker of great stories, the provocation for much laughter, and the needed  companion when I just don't know what to do with the extra money in my  pockets. In order to continue this friendship, I ask that you carefully  review my grievances above and address them immediately. I will look for an  answer no later than Thursday 3pm (pre-happy hour) on your possible  solutions and hopefully we can continue this fruitful partnership. </p>
<p>Thank you,<br /> Your biggest fan</p>

29505,"<p>One day, Pete complained to his friend, ""My elbow really hurts. I guess I should see a doctor."" </p>
<p>His friend said, ""Don't do that. There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. </p>
<p>Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about and it will only costs you $10.00.""</p>
<p>Pete figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. </p>
<p>The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read:</p>
<p>1. You have tennis elbow.<br /> 2. Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor.<br /> 3. It will be better in two weeks.......</p>
<p>That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this computer could be fooled. </p>
<p>He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.</p>
<p>He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The machine again made the usual noises, flashed its alights, and printed out the following analysis:</p>
<p>1. Your tap water is too hard.<br /> 2. Get a water softener.<br /> 3. Your dog has ringworm.<br /> 4. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.<br /> 5. Your daughter is using cocaine.<br /> 6. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> 7. Your wife is pregnant ....... twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.<br /> 8.

29517,"<p>A  priest decides to take a walk to the pier near his church.  He looks  around and finally stops to watch a fisherman load his boat.  The fisherman  notices, and asks the priest if he would like to join him for a couple of hours.The priest agrees.  The fisherman asks if the priest has ever fished before, to which the priest says no.  He baits the hook for him and says, 'Give it a shot father'.  After a few minutes, the priest hooks a big fish and struggles  to get it in the boat.  The fisherman says 'Whoa, what a big sonofabitch!' The Priest says, 'Uh, please sir, can you mind your language?'The Fisherman responds (THINKING QUICKLY), 'I'm sorry father, but that's what this fish is called - a sonofabitch!''Oh, I'm sorry', replied the Priest.  'I didn't know.' After the trip, the priest brings the fish to the church and spots the bishop.'Eminence, look at this big sonofabitch!' 'Please Father', said the Bishop.  'Mind your language, this is a house of God.'   'No, you don't understand', said the Priest.  'That's what this fish is called,  and I caught it.  I caught this sonofabitch!'   'Hmmm', said the Bishop.  'You know, I could clean this sonofabitch and we could have it for dinner.'  So the Bishop takes the fish and cleans it, and  brings it to Mother Superior at the convent.   'Mother Superior could you cook this sonofabitch for dinner tonight?'   'My lord, what language!', said the Mother Superior. 'No, Sister', said the Bishop.  'That's what the fish is called - a sonofabitch! Father caught it, I cleaned it, and we'd like you to cook it.'   'Hmmm', replied Mother Superior.  'Yes, I'll cook that sonofabitch tonight.'   Well, the Pope stops by for dinner with the three of them, and they all think the fish is great.  He asks where they got it.    'I caught the sonofabitch!', said the Priest.'And I cleaned the sonofabitch!', said the Bishop.'And I cooked the sonofabitch!', said the Mother Superior.The Pope stares at them for a minute with a steely gaze, but then takes off his hat, puts his feet up on the table, and says, 'You know, you fuckers are alright'.</p>

And God populated the earth With broccoli and cauliflower and spinach and green and yellow vegetables of all kinds, So Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.And so the Devil created McDonald's. And McDonald's brought forth the 79-cent double cheeseburger. And the Devil said to Man, ""You want fries with that?""And Man said, ""Super size them."" And Man gained five pounds.And so God created the healthful yogurt, That Woman might keep her figure. But the Devil brought forth chocolate.

I have sent thee heart-healthy vegetables And olive oil with which to cook them.""But the Devil brought forth chicken fried steak So big it needed its own platter. And Man gained 10 pounds And his bad cholesterol went through the roof.And so God brought forth running shoes. And Man resolved to lose those extra pounds.And the Devil brought forth cable TV with remote control So Man would not have to toil to change channels between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man gained another 20 pounds.And so God brought forth the potato, A vegetable naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition.And the Devil peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fat fried them. And the Devil created sour cream dip.And Man clutched his remote control And ate the potato chips swaddled in cholesterol.And the Devil saw this and said, ""It is good.""And Man went into cardiac arrest. And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.And the Devil cancelled Man's health insurance.So God showed Woman how to peel the skin off chicken. And cook the nourishing whole grain brown rice. And the Devil created light beer So Man could poison his body, While feeling righteous because he had to drink twice as much of the now-insipid brew to get the same buzz. And Man gained another 10 pounds.And Woman ventured forth Into the land of Godiva chocolate, And upon returning asked Man, ""Do I look fat?""And the Devil said, ""Always tell the truth.""And Man did.And Woman went out from the presence of Man And dwelt in the land of the divorce lawyer, East of the marriage counselor.And the Devil said, ""It doesn't get any better than this!""</p>

29550,"<p>Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable.  No matter how legitimate my excuse, I always get the feeling that my boss thinks I�m lying.  On one recent occasion, I had a valid reason but lied anyway, because the truth was just too darned humiliating.  I simply mentioned that I had sustained a head injury, and I hope I would feel up to coming in the next day.  By then, I reasoned, I could think up something to explain the bandage on the top of my head.<br /> The accident occurred mainly because I had given in to my wife�s wishes to adopt a cute little kitty.  Initially, the new acquisition was not problem.  Then one morning, I was taking my shower after breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen.<br /> �Honey, the garbage disposal is dead again.  Please come reset it.� </p>
<p>�You know where the button is,� I protested through the shower pitter-patter and steam.<br /> �Reset it yourself!�</p>
<p>�But I�m scared!� she persisted.  �What if it starts going and sucks me in?�</p>
<p>There was a meaningful pause and then, �C�mon, it�ll only take you a second.�<br /> So out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping that my silent outraged nudity would make a statement about how I perceived her behavior as extremely cowardly.<br /> Sighing loudly, I squatted down and stuck my head under the sink to find the button.</p>
<p>It is the last action I remember performing.</p>
<p>It struck without warning, and without any respect to my circumstances.</p>
<p>No, it wasn�t the hexed disposal, drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth.<br /> It was our new kitty, which discovered the fascinating dangling objects she spied hanging between my legs.</p>
<p>She had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I reached under the sink.  And, at the precise moment when I was most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged them with her needle-like claws.  I lost all rational thought to control orderly bodily movement, blindly rising at a violent rate of speed, with the full weight of a kitten hanging from �Harry and the Twins�</p>
<p>Wild animals are sometimes faced with a fight or flight syndrome.  Men, in this predicament, choose only the �flight� option.  I know this from experience.  I was fleeing straight up into the air when the sink and cabinet bluntly and forcefully impede my ascent.  The impact knocked me out cold.</p>
<p>When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me.  Now there are not many things in this life worse than finding oneself lying on the kitchen floor buck naked in front of a group of �been-here, done-that� paramedics.  Even worse, having been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics were all snorting loudly as they tried to conduct their work, all the while trying to suppress their hysterical laughter� and not succeeding.</p>
<p>Somehow I lived through it all.</p>
<p>A few days later I finally made it back into the office, where colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me about my head injury.  I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk about � which it was.</p>
<p>�What�s the matter?� They all asked, �Cat got your tongue?�</p>
<p>Close, but not exactly.</p>

29612,"<p>After a Christmas break, a teacher asked her young pupils how they spent their<br /> holidays. One small boy wrote the following...<br /> "" We always used to spend Christmas with Grandpa and Grandma. They used to<br /> live here in a big brick home, but Grandpa got retarded and they moved to<br /> Florida. Now they live in a place with a lot of other retarded people. They all<br /> live in little tin boxes. They ride on big three-wheeled tricycles and they all<br /> wear nametags because they don't know whom they are. They go to a big building<br /> called a wrecking hall; but if it was wrecked, they got it fixed because it's<br /> all right now. They play games and do exercises there, but they don't do them<br /> very good."" </p>
<p>""There is a swimming pool there. They go into it and just stand there with<br /> their hats on. I guess they don't know how to swim."" </p>
<p>As you go into their park, there is a dollhouse with a little man sitting in<br /> it. He watches all day so they can't get out without him seeing them. When they<br /> can sneak out they go to the beach and pick up shells that they think are<br /> dollars."" </p>
<p>""My Grandma used to bake cookies and stuff, but I guess she forgot how. Nobody<br /> cooks, they just eat out. They eat the same thing every night, Early Birds. Some<br /> of the people are so retarded that they don't know how to cook at all, so my<br /> Grandma and Grandpa bring food into the wrecked hall and they call it 'pot<br /> luck'."" </p>
<p>""My Grandma says Grandpa worked hard all his life and earned his retardment. I<br /> wish they would move back up here, but I guess the little man in the dollhouse<br /> won't let them out.</p>

Simply put in a sample of your urine<br /> and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you<br /> can do about it.  It only cost $10.""</p>
<p>Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a<br /> urine sample and went to the drug store.  Finding the computer, he<br /> poured in the sample and deposited the $10.  The computer started<br /> making some noise and various lights started flashing.  After a brief pause<br /> out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:</p>
<p>     You have tennis elbow. Soak your arms in warm water.<br />      Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.</p>
<p>Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and<br /> how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this<br /> machine could be fooled.  He decided to give it a try.  He mixed together<br /> some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples<br /> from his wife and daughter.  To top it off, he masturbated into<br /> the concoction.  He went back to the drug store, located the<br /> machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10.   The computer again<br /> made the usual noise and printed out the following message:</p>
<p>     Your tap water is too hard.<br />      Get a water softener.</p>
<p>     Your dog has worms.<br />      Get him vitamins.</p>
<p>     Your daughter is using cocaine.<br />      Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.</p>
<p>     Your wife is pregnant with twin girls.<br />      They aren't yours.<br />      Get a lawyer.</p>

29650,"<p>A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him.   When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls.</p>
<p>He then asked the students if the jar was full.  They agreed that it was.</p>
<p>So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar.  He shook the jar lightly.  The pebbles rolled into the open areas between golf balls.</p>
<p>He then asked the students again if the jar was full.  They agreed it was.</p>
<p>The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else.</p>
<p>He asked once more if the jar was full.  The students responded with a unanimous ""yes.""</p>
<p>The professor then produced two cans of beer from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand.  The students laughed.</p>
<p>""Now,"" said the professor, as the laughter subsided, ""I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.  The golf balls are the important things--your family, your children, your health, your friends, your favorite passions--things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.</p>
<p>""The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car.</p>
<p>The sand is everything else--the small stuff.</p>
<p>""If you put the sand into the jar first,"" he continued, ""there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.  The same goes for life.  If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.  Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.  Play with your children.  Take time to get medical checkups.  Take your partner out to dinner.  Play another 18.  There will always be time to clean the house, and fix the disposal.</p>
<p>""Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your  priorities.  The rest is just sand.""</p>
<p>One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the beer represented.</p>
<p>The professor smiled.  ""I'm glad you asked.  It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of beers.""</p>

29669,"<p>Three couples were married and stayed at the same hotel for their honeymoons,<br /> where they were all taken care of by Dave the Bellboy. </p>
<p>The first man married a nurse. </p>
<p>Dave showed them to their room and thought to himself, ""What a lucky guy.<br /> Nurses are known to be hot to trot"".</p>
<p>The second man married a telephone operator. </p>
<p>Dave showed them to their room and thought to himself,� Wow, he's a lucky one.<br /> Telephone operators have sexy voices and once you pop that top<br /> button...A-bomb.�</p>
<p>The third man married a school teacher. </p>
<p>Dave showed them to their room and thought to himself, ""Poor guy, she's pretty<br /> but teachers are just too frigid"".</p>
<p>The next morning, Dave reported to work at 5:30 in the morning. He expected<br /> only the teacher's husband to call for breakfast any minute and the other two<br /> would call much later in the day.</p>
<p>At 6:00 a.m. the phone rang. It was the nurse's husband wanting breakfast. The<br /> nurse's husband opened the door and Dave stepped back in shock. The man's<br /> pajamas were still pressed and his hair nicely combed. </p>
<p>Dave asked, ""What happened sir? You married a nurse.</p>
<p>The man sourly replies, ""Son, don't ever marry a nurse. All I heard last night<br /> was her nagging voice saying, �You�re not sanitary, and you�re not sanitary.""</p>
<p>At 6:30 a.m., the phone rang again.</p>
<p>The telephone operator's husband called for breakfast. Dave brought it as fast<br /> as possible hoping for the best. The man opened the door and Dave stepped back<br /> in shock. The man's hair and pajamas were properly combed and pressed.</p>
<p>Dave asked,"" What happened? Telephone operators are supposed to be as sexy as<br /> their voices."" </p>
<p>The man sourly replies ""Son, don't ever marry a telephone operator. All I<br /> heard last night was her nasal voice saying, ""You're three minutes are up, your<br /> three minutes are up."" </p>
<p>Dave went back down to the desk, just knowing the teacher�s husband would be<br /> calling any minute.</p>
<p>Finally at 4:30 p.m., the teacher's husband called for breakfast.</p>
<p>Dave can't believe it but quickly took the breakfast to the couple�s room. The<br /> man opened the door and Dave took a step back in shock. The man was wearing only<br /> his boxers, his hair was a mess, and he had scratch marks on his chest, arms and<br /> legs.</p>
<p>Joe fearing the worst asked �What happened to you? Did you have a<br /> fight?"" </p>
<p>The man smiled and happily replied, ""No. Son, when you marry, be sure to marry<br /> a school teacher. All I heard last night was her sexy smooth voice saying ""We<br /> are going to do this over and over, until we get right.""</p>

"
29677,"<p>When you occasionally have a really bad day, and you just need to take it out on someone, don't take it out on someone you know, take it out on someone you don't know.</p>
<p>It all started one day when I was sitting at my desk and remembered a phone call I had forgotten to make. I found the number and dialed it.</p>
<p>A man answered, saying, ""Hello."" I politely said, ""This is Chris. May I please speak with Robin Carter?"" Suddenly, the phone was slammed down on me.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude.</p>
<p>I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. I had transposed the last two digits of her phone number.</p>
<p>After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, ""You're an @$$hole!"" and hung up.</p>
<p>I wrote his number down with the word '@$$hole' next to it, and put it in my desk drawer.</p>
<p>Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell, ""You're an @$$hole!"" It always cheered me up.</p>
<p>When Caller ID came to our area, I thought my  therapeutic '@$$hole' calling would have to stop. </p>
<p>So, I called his number and said, Hi, this is John Smith from the Telephone Company. I'm just calling to see if you're interested in the Caller ID program?"" </p>
<p>He yelled, ""NO!"" and slammed the phone down.</p>
<p>I quickly called him back and said, ""That's because you're an @$$hole!""</p>
<p>One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for.</p>
<p>I hit the horn and yelled that I had been waiting for the spot. The idiot ignored me. I noticed a ""For Sale"" sign in his car window, so I wrote down his number.</p>
<p>A couple of days later, right after calling the first @$$hole, ( I had his number on speed dial ), I thought I had better call the BMW @$$hole, too.</p>
<p>I said, ""Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?""</p>
<p>""Yes, it is.""</p>
<p>""Can you tell me where I can see it?""</p>
<p>""Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house, and the car's parked right out in front.""</p>
<p>""What's your name?"" I asked.</p>
<p>""My name is Don Hansen,"" he said.</p>
<p>""When's a good time to catch you, Don?""</p>
<p>""I'm home every evening after five.""</p>
<p>""Listen, Don, can I tell you something?""</p>
<p>""Yes?""</p>
<p>""Don, you're an @$$hole."" Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.</p>
<p>Now, when I had a problem, I had two @$$holes to call. But after several months of calling them, it wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be So, I came up with an idea.</p>
<p>I called @$$hole #1.</p>
<p>""Hello.""</p>
<p>""You're an @$$hole!"" (But I didn't hang up.)</p>
<p>""Are you still there?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""Yeah,"" I said.</p>
<p>""Stop calling me,"" he screamed.</p>
<p>""Make me,"" I said.</p>
<p>""Who are you?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""My name is Don Hansen.""</p>
<p>""Yeah? Where do you live?""</p>
<p>""@$$hole, I live at 1802 West 34th Street, a yellow house, with my black Beamer parked in front.""</p>
<p>He said, ""I'm coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers.""</p>
<p>I said, ""Yeah, like I'm really scared, @$$hole.""</p>
<p>Then I called @$$hole #2.</p>
<p>""Hello?"" he said.</p>
<p>""Hello, @$$hole,"" I said.</p>
<p>He yelled, ""If I ever find out who you are!""</p>
<p>""You'll what?"" I said.</p>
<p>""I'll kick your @$$,"" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>I answered, ""Well, @$$hole, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now.""</p>
<p>Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I lived at 1802 West 34th Street, and that I was on my way over there to kill my gay lover.</p>
<p>Then I called Channel 4 News about the gang war going down on West 34th Street.</p>
<p>I quickly got into my car and headed over to 34th street.</p>
<p>There I saw two @$$holes beating the crap out of each other in front of six squad cars, a police helicopter, and a news crew.</p>
<p>NOW, I feel better. Anger management really works. </p>

He says he tries to avoid the pompousness often associated with politicians.""I had so many people telling me I was stupid for running for mayor because it's such a pain, that when I was elected to a second term, I decided this was the right email address for me,"" he said. Mr Williams added: ""A lot of times, you see politicians putting themselves up on a pedestal. Why? We're no higher than anyone else, and many times we're lower.

<p>After securing a promise that the dog will behave, and warning him that he and the dog will be thrown out if there's any trouble, the bartender relents and allows them to stay in the bar and watch the game. The game begins with the Jets receiving the kickoff. They march downfield, get stopped at about the 30, and kick a field goal. With that the dog jumps up on the bar, and begins walking up and down the bar giving a high-five to everyone. </p>
<p>The bartender says, ""Wow, that is the most amazing thing I've ever seen! What does the dog do if they score a touchdown?"" </p>

So the doctors decide to go down to the<br /> ward to investigate the cause of the incidents. So on the next Sunday morning<br /> few minutes before 11 a.m., all doctors and nurses nervously wait outside the<br /> ward to see for themselves what the terrible phenomenon was all about. Some were<br /> holding wooden crosses, prayer books and other holy objects to ward off the<br /> evil........ Just when the clock struck 11.... </p>

29719,"<p>I never have quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much. </p>
<p>And I never have figured out the whole Mars and Venus thing. </p>
<p>And, I never have figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart. </p>
<p>And, I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene gets thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words ""I do"".</p>
<p>One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""</p>
<p>I said, ""WHAT??"" So she says the words that I and every husband on the planet dreads. She explains that I must not be in tune with her emotional needs as a woman. I'm thinking, ""What was her first clue?""</p>
<p>I finally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to sleep. </p>
<p>The very next day we went shopping at a big unnamed department store. </p>
<p>I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. </p>
<p>She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them.</p>
<p>She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say OK. </p>
<p>And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond earrings. Let me tell you, she was so excited. </p>
<p>She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don't think she cared. </p>
<p>I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet, because she doesn't even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK.</p>
<p>She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have seen her face when she said, ""I'm ready to go, let's go to the cash register.""</p>
<p>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No, honey. I don't feel like buying all this stuff now."" </p>

29725,"<p>In a village a long time ago there lived a people called Nids, they were midgets. Every day the Nids went into the fields to farm. But every day a giant would wander though the fields kicking the Nids. So, one day the Nids finally got fed up and went to the town Rabbi for advice. The Rabbi said not to worry and that he'd handle it. So, one day the Rabbi went into the fields dressed as a Nid. Eventually, the giant showed up for his usual routine of kicking the Nids. But when the giant reached the Rabbi he just stepped over him and continued along his way. The Rabbi wondered about this and chased after the giant and yelled, ""Hey! I'm a Nid! Why didn't you kick me?"" The giant simply replied, ""Silly Rabbi! Kicks are for Nids!""</p>

29728,"<p>The widow takes a look at her dear departed one right before the funeral and, to her horror, finds that he's in his brown suit. She'd specifically said to the undertaker that she wanted him buried in his blue suit; she'd brought it especially for that occasion, and she was distressed that the mortician had left him in the same brown suit he'd been wearing when the lightning bolt hit him.</p>
<p>She demanded that the corpse be changed into the blue suit she'd brought especially for that purpose.</p>
<p>The undertaker said, ""But madam! It's only a minute or two until the funeral is scheduled to begin! We can't possibly take him out and get him changed in that amount of time.""</p>
<p>The lady said, ""Who's paying for this?""</p>
<p>Seeing the logic to this argument, a very reluctant mortician wheeled the coffin out, but then wheeled it right back in a moment later.  Miraculously, the corpse was in a blue suit.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, a well-satisfied widow complimented the undertaker on the smooth and speedy service. She especially wanted to know how he'd been able to get her husband into a blue suit so fast.</p>
<p>The funeral director said, ""Oh, it was easy. It happens that there was another body in the back room and he was already dressed in a blue suit. All we had to do was switch heads!""</p>

When he gets there, Satan greets him and tells him that he will be there for all eternity, but, because of the way he behaved on earth while living, he gets to choose the type of punishment he will receive.Satan escorts him around and they come to a room where Newt Gingrich is stretched out on a rack, screaming in agony as the wheel is turned. Clinton says, ""Nope, I don't think I'd like that kind of punishment."" So they go on to the next room.There was Bob Dole, tied to a long pole and suspended over a large tub of raw sewage. He is lowered into the tank until completely submerged. After a few minutes he is lifted out of the tank, gasping and fighting for breath. As soon as he gets his breath back, he's lowered again. ""uh-uh!"" says Clinton. ""That's not for me.""Finally they come to a room where Kenneth Starr is hanging from the wall by his thumbs. His pants are down around his ankles, and Monica Lewinsky is performing oral sex on him. Clinton says ""OK, if I have to be punished forever, I'll go for that way.""Satan says, ""Fine. . . that will be your punishment for the next billion years. Monica! Your replacement is here!""</p>

Remembering the tale of Aladdin (and the role of magic lamps in jokes) he rubbed it. </p>
<p>POOF! A Genie appeared. A Jewish Genie. "" Oy Vey!"" he said. ""Am I glad to be outta there. Three hundred years I bin in that thing, my life and soul! What can I do for you my boy?"" </p>
<p>The Jamaican asked if the Genie granted wishes. </p>
<p>""Wishes, Schmishes! Course I do. I'll grant you two wishes, used to be three but I gotta think about my margins.""</p>
<p>""Well,"" said the Jamaican after some consideration, ""I'd like to be white and surrounded by women.""</p>
<p>""No problem"" said the Genie, POOF! - the Jamaican was transformed into a tampon. </p>
<p>Moral: Never do business with a Jewish Genie - there's always a string attached.</p>

<p>The diver went below another 20 ft, but the guy joined him a few minutes later. </p>

29788,"<p>An Australian travel writer at the beginning of a 6-month tour<br /> of Canada was checking out of the Vancouver Hilton, and as he<br /> paid his bill said to the manager, ""By the way, what's with the<br /> Indian chief sitting in the lobby? He's been there ever since I<br /> arrived.""</p>
<p>""Oh that's 'Big Chief Forget-me Not'."" said the manager. ""The<br /> hotel is built on an Indian reservation, and part of the<br /> agreement is to allow the chief free use of the premises for the<br /> rest of his life. He is known as 'Big Chief Forget-me Not'<br /> because of his phenomenal memory. He is 92 and can remember the<br /> slightest detail of his life.""</p>
<p>The travel writer took this in, and as he was waiting for his<br /> cab decided to put the chief's memory to the test.</p>
<p>""'g'day, mate!"" said the Aussie, receiving only a slight nod in<br /> return. ""What did you have for breakfast on your 21st birthday?""</p>
<p>""Eggs,"" was the chief's instant reply, without even looking up,<br /> and indeed the Aussie was impressed.</p>
<p>He went off on his travel writing itinerary, right across to the<br /> east coast and back, telling others of Big Chief Forget-me Not's<br /> great memory. (One local noted to him that 'How' was a more<br /> appropriate greeting for an Indian chief than ''ello mate.') On<br /> his return to the Vancouver Hilton six months later was<br /> surprised to see 'Big Chief Forget-me Not' still sitting in the<br /> lobby, fully occupied with whittling away on a stick.</p>

""No,"" said the genie<br /> ""I'm afraid that due to constant down sizing, world stock market<br /> volatility, fierce global competition, deflation and low wages<br /> in Asian countries, I can only grant you but one wish sir. So<br /> please, what will it be?""</p>
<p>George didn't hesitate. He said, ""There is something near and<br /> dear to my heart; I would like to see peace in the Middle East.<br /> Here, see this map? I want all these countries to stop fighting<br /> and make peace among them."" </p>
<p>The Genie looked at the map and exclaimed, ""Gadzooks, man! These<br /> countries have been at war for thousands of years. The hatred<br /> among them runs deep. Many have tried and failed at what you<br /> ask. I'm good but not THAT good. I just don't think it can be<br /> done. Please, could you make another wish?"" </p>
<p>George thought for a minute, and then said, ""Well you know,<br /> people just don't like my wife Barbara. They think she's bad<br /> tempered, has a big butt, and pushes me around too much. I wish<br /> for her to be the most beautiful woman in the world and have<br /> everybody really like her. OK, that's what I want."" </p>

<p>Might offend someone with no faith at all. </p>

<p>And pierce our noses, tongues &amp; cheeks. </p>

<p>We can get our condoms, &amp; birth controls, </p>

29911,"<p>Two Arabs boarded a shuttle out of Washington for New York. One sat in the window seat, the other in the middle seat. </p>
<p>Just before take-off a fat, little Jewish guy got on and took the aisle seat next to the Arabs. He kicked off his shoes, wiggled his toes and was settling in when the arab in the window seat said, ""I think I'll go up and get a Coke.""  (Shuttle flights do not have cabin attendants, but you probably knew that.)</p>
<p>""No problem,"" said the Jew. ""I'll get it for you.""</p>
<p>While he was gone the Arab picked up the Jew's shoe and spit in it. The Jew brought back the coke, when the other Arab said ""That looks<br /> good. Think I'll have one too.""</p>
<p>Again, the Jew obligingly goes to fetch it, and while he is gone the Arab picks up the other shoe and spits in it. The Jew returns with the coke, and they all sit back and enjoy the short flight.  When the plane was landing the Jew slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened.</p>
<p>""How long must this go on?"" he asked.  ""This enmity between our peoples ....this hatred... your spitting in my shoes and me pissing in your Coke?""</p>

<p>Make the Pie Higher</p>

<p>Rarely is the question asked<br /> Is our children learning?<br /> Will the highways of the internet<br /> Become more few?<br /> How many hands have I shaked?</p>
<p>They misunderestimate me.<br /> I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity.<br /> I know that the human being and the fish<br /> Can coexist.</p>
<p>Families is where our nation finds hope<br /> Where our wings take dream.<br /> Put food on your family!<br /> Knock down the tollbooth!<br /> Vulcanize society!<br /> Make the pie higher!<br /> Make the pie higher!</p>

<p>When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during the game, she'd<br /> appear in a little box in the corner of the screen<br /> during a time-out.</p>
<p>Breaking up would be a lot easier.  A smack to the ass and a ""Nice hustle,<br /> you'll get 'em next time"" would pretty much do it.</p>
<p>Birth control would come in ale or lager.</p>
<p>You'd be expected to fill your resume with gag names of people you'd worked<br /> for, like ""Heywood J'Blowme.""</p>
<p>Each year, your raise would be pegged to the fortunes of the NFL team of<br /> your choice.</p>

<p>It'd be considered harmless fun to gather 30 friends, put on horned helmets,<br /> and go pillage a nearby town.</p>
<p>Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating the ""public<br /> ugliness"" ordinance.</p>
<p>Tanks would be far easier to rent.</p>
<p>Garbage would take itself out.</p>
<p>Instead of beer belly, you'd get ""beer biceps.""</p>
<p>Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could present your wife-to-be<br /> with a giant foam hand that said, ""You're #1!""</p>
<p>Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would only<br /> occur in leap years.</p>
<p>On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you'd get the day off to<br /> go drinking. Mother's Day, too. St. Patrick's Day, however, would<br /> remain exactly the same. But it would be celebrated every month.</p>
<p>COPS would be broadcast live, and you could phone in advice to the<br /> pursuing cops.</p>
<p>Two words: Ally McNaked.</p>
<p>Regis and Kathie Lee would be chained to a cement mixer and pushed<br /> off the Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative pay-per-view event<br /> in world history.</p>
<p>The victors in any athletic competition would get to kill and eat<br /> the losers.</p>
<p>The only show opposite Monday Night Football would be Monday Night<br /> Football from a Different Camera Angle.</p>

<p>Every man would get four real Get Out of Jail Free cards per year.</p>
<p>When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you responded<br /> with would actually reduce your fine. As in:<br />  Cop: ""You know how fast you were going?""<br />  You: ""All I know is, I was spilling my beer all over the place.""<br />  Cop: ""Nice one. That's $10 off.""</p>
<p>Faucets would run ""Hot,"" ""Cold,"" and ""100 proof.""</p>
<p>The Statue of Liberty would get a bright red, 40-foot thong.</p>
<p>People would never talk about how fresh they felt.</p>
<p>Daisy Duke shorts would never again go out of style.</p>

<p>The father thought some and said, ""OK, son, the best way I can describe politics is to use an analogy.</p>
<p>Let's say that I'm a capitalist because I'm the breadwinner.<br /> Your mother will be the government because she controls everything, our maid will be the working class because she works for us, you will be the people because you answer to us, and your baby brother will be the future. Does that help any?""</p>
<p>The little boy said, ""Well, Dad, I don't know, but I'll think about what you said.""</p>
<p>Later that night, after everyone had gone to bed, the little boy was awaken by his baby brother's crying. Upon further investigation, he found a dirty diaper. So, he went down the hall to his parent's bedroom and found his father's side of the bed empty and his mother wouldn't wake up. Then he saw a light on in the guest room down the hall, and when he reached the door, he saw through the crack that his father was in bed with the maid. The son then turned and went back to bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, he said to his father at the breakfast table, ""Dad, I think I understand politics much better now.""</p>
<p>""Excellent, my boy,"" he answered, ""What have you learned?""</p>
<p>The little boy thought for a minute and said, ""I learned that capitalism is screwing the working class, government is sound asleep ignoring the people, and the future's full of crap.""</p>

29932,"<p>A school teacher injured his back and had to wear a plaster cast<br /> around the upper part of his body. It fit under his shirt and<br /> was not noticeable at all. On the first day of the term, still<br /> with the cast under his shirt, he found himself assigned to the<br /> toughest students in school.</p>
<p>Walking confidently into the rowdy classroom, he opened the<br /> window as wide as possible and then busied himself with desk<br /> work. The classroom became a bit unruly and he admonished them.<br /> This happened several times. When he could do work at his desk,<br /> the strong breeze from the window made his tie flap annoyingly.<br /> He kept rearranging and rearranging the tie as the class raised<br /> its level of unruliness. Finally, becoming disgusted with the<br /> wayward tie, he stood up and took a big stapler off his desk and<br /> stapled the tie to his chest in several places. </p>
<p>Discipline was not a problem from that day forth.</p>

29933,"<p>A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.  After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.</p>
<p>The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""</p>
<p>So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice.  At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.</p>
<p>Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:</p>
<p>1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.<br /> 2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.<br /> 3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.<br /> 4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.<br /> 5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.<br /> 6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C.<br /> 7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred  to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook.<br /> 8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the crap out of him.<br /> 9.

29952,"<p>A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house.<br /> He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long,<br /> grey beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?""<br /> ""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as<br /> lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese<br /> tortures known to man."" </p>
<p>""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and<br /> entered the house. </p>
<p>Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young,beautiful, and<br /> had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she<br /> couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's<br /> warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could<br /> bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was<br /> careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he<br /> crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. </p>
<p>He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock<br /> on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on<br /> chest."" ""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old<br /> man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up,<br /> walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed<br /> another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.""<br /> In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to<br /> the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped<br /> out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large<br /> sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to<br /> bedpost.""</p>

As soon as he touches the stairs, spray all of the apes with cold water.After a while, another ape makes an attempt with the same result - all the apes are sprayed with cold water. This continues through several more attempts. Pretty soon, when another ape tries to climb the stairs, the other apes all try to prevent it. Now, turn off the cold water. Remove one ape from the cage and replace it with a new one. The new ape sees the banana and wants to climb the stairs. To his horror, all of the other apes attack him. After another attempt and attack, he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be assaulted.Next, remove another of the original five apes and replace it with a new one. The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked. The previous newcomer takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm. Again, replace a third original ape with a new one. The new one makes it to the stairs and is attacked as well. Two of the four apes that beat him have no idea why they were not permitted to climb the stairs, or why they are participating in the beating of the newest ape.After replacing the fourth and fifth original apes, all the apes, which have been sprayed with cold water, have been replaced. Nevertheless, no ape ever again approaches the stairs. Why not?Because that's the way they've always done it and that's the way it's always been around here.And that's how company policy begins....</p>

This man was very tired, so he knocked on<br /> the door and an old Chineese man answered it.  The man asked if<br /> he could stay the night, and the Chineese guy said he could<br /> under one condition: the man kept away from his daughter.  The<br /> guy figured that this would be easy, because the daughter should<br /> be considerably older than him, so he agreed.  The man came<br /> inside, and while the Chineese guy was showing him to his room,<br /> he caught a glimpse of his daughter.  She was beautiful and<br /> young with long hair and sparkling eyes.  The guy got to his<br /> room and tried to go to sleep, but his mind kept on focusing on<br /> them man's daughter.  So, he crept down to her room for a night<br /> of romance.  The guy woke up the next morning in his room with a<br /> heavy feeling on his chest.  He looked up, and saw a massive<br /> rock on him with a note attached to it.  The note said: ""Since<br /> you have disobeyed my rules, you must feel the wrath of the<br /> three worst Chineese tortures"".  Below it said: ""Chineese<br /> torture #1: large rock on chest.""  The guy figured that if this<br /> was the first torture, how bad could the other ones be?  So, he<br /> heaved the rock out of the window.  He soon realized that the<br /> rock was attached to a rope. On the rope was a note with a<br /> message: ""Chineese torture #2: Rope attached to left testicle.""<br /> Thinking he would rather break a few bones then be causterated,<br /> the guy jumped out the window after the rock.  He looked down at<br /> the ground and saw a message spray-painted on it.  It read:<br /> ""Chineese torture #3: Right testicle attached to bedpost""</p>

29973,"<p>Computer novices may feel like they're alone these days, but some of the following calls to IBM's help center show there are plenty of people out there who still are inching onto the information superhighway.After a caller gave a technician her PC's serial number, he scanned a database of registered users and responded, ""I see you have an Aptiva"" desktop unit. Before he could say another word, the caller shrieked and said she'd be right back. When the customer returned, the technician asked if she was all right. The caller responded: ""Had I realized you could see me, I never would have telephoned in my bathrobe.""A customer who had just received a laptop computer asked about the power-saving feature known as ""hibernate."" Would this hibernate device work in the spring and summer, the caller asked.Another caller explained she had received a gift of software on 5.25-inch diskettes, but she had only a 3.5-inch disk drive on her computer. The technician said she had two options: Get a second disk drive, or use 3.5-inch diskettes. The customer called back later, now complaining that her disk drive was making a terrible noise. And this despite the fact that she was using a 3.5-inch diskette, she said. After a bunch of questions, the technician determined the caller had used a pair of scissors to trim the 5.25-inch diskettes to fit the 3.5-inch drive.A caller, perplexed that his new desktop computer--the one that was supposed to do everything short of bringing on world peace - was doing nothing, cried out for help. No problem, the IBM technician said. First, open a ""window"" to launch a specific program. The conversation continued, and the caller asked a few moments later if it might be all right to close the window. Why, the IBM technician asked. Because, the caller responded, it was getting very chilly.</p>
