31014,"<p>One day at the end of class little Gunner's teacher had the<br /> class go home and think of a story and then conclude with the<br /> moral of that story.</p>
<p>The following day the teacher asked for the first volunteer to<br /> tell a story; little Suzy raised her hand. ""My dad owns a farm<br /> and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive<br /> into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a<br /> big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the<br /> road."" The teacher asked for the moral of the story. Suzy<br /> replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.""</p>
<p>Next was little Lucy. ""Well my dad owns a farm, too, and every<br /> weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator.<br /> Last weekend only 8 of the 12 eggs hatched."" The teacher asked<br /> for the moral of the story. Lucy replied, ""Don't count your<br /> chickens before they're hatched.""</p>
<p>Last was little Gunner. ""My uncle Steve was a Marine in Vietnam;<br /> the helicopter he was in was shot down over enemy territory. As<br /> the only survivor, all he had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine<br /> gun and a machete. First he drank the whiskey so the VC couldn't<br /> enjoy it. Unfortunately, he was quickly surrounded by a 100<br /> Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but ran<br /> out of bullets, so he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more.<br /> The blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with<br /> his bare hands."" Teacher looked in shock at Gunner and asked if<br /> there was any possible moral to his story. ""Yes sir"", Gunner<br /> replied, ""Don't fuck with Uncle Steve when he's been drinking.""</p>

31020,"<p>This truck driver hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers stops for a beer. As he approaches the bar, he sees a big sign on the door saying ''Nerds Not Allowed -- Enter At Your Own Risk!'' He goes in and sits down. The bartender comes over to him. ''You smell kind of nerdy. What do you do for a living?''  ''I drive a truck, and the smell is just from the computers I'm hauling.''  ''Okay, truck drivers are not nerds,'' he says and serves him a beer. As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in with tape around his glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver is totally shocked. ''Why did you do that?''  ''Not to worry, the nerds are overpopulating Silicon Valley and are in season now. You don't even need a license.'' The truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads back onto the freeway. Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, grabbing up the computers.They are all engineers, accountants, and programmers wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen. He can't let them steal his whole load. So, remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, felling several of them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop.  ''What's wrong? I thought nerds were in season,"" says the truck driver. ''Well, sure,'' says the patrolman. ''But you can't bait 'em.''</p>

31046,"<p>An armless man walked into a bar, which is empty except for the bartender. He<br /> ordered a drink and when he was served, asked the bartender if he would get the<br /> money from his wallet in his pocket, since he has no arms. </p>
<p>The bartender obliged him. He then asked if the bartender would tip the glass<br /> to his lips. The bartender did this until the man finished his drink. He then<br /> asked if the bartender would get a hanky from his pocket and wipe the foam from<br /> his lips. The bartender did it and commented it must be very difficult not to<br /> have arms and have to ask someone to do nearly everything for him. </p>
<p>The man said, ""Yes, it is a bit embarrassing at times. By the way, where is<br /> your restroom?"" </p>

31047,"<p>A wife and her husband were having a dinner party for some<br /> important guests. The wife was very excited about this and<br /> wanted everything to be perfect. </p>
<p>At the very last minute, she realized that she didn't have any<br /> snails for the dinner party, so she asked her husband to run<br /> down to the beach with the bucket to gather some snails. </p>
<p>Very grudgingly he agreed. He took the bucket, walked out the<br /> door, down the steps, and out to the beach. </p>
<p>As he was collecting the snails, he noticed a beautiful woman<br /> strolling alongside the water just a little further down the<br /> beach. </p>
<p>He kept thinking to himself, ""Wouldn't it be great if she would<br /> even just come down and talk to me?"" He went back to gathering<br /> the snails. </p>
<p>All of a sudden he looked up, and the beautiful woman was<br /> standing right over him. They started talking and she invited<br /> him back to her place. They ended up spending the night<br /> together. </p>
<p>At seven o'clock the next morning he woke up and exclaimed, ""Oh<br /> no!!! My wife's dinner party!!!"" </p>
<p>He gathered all his clothes, put them on real fast, grabbed his<br /> bucket, and ran out the door. He ran down the beach all the way<br /> to his apartment. He ran up the stairs of his apartment. He was<br /> in such a hurry that when he got to the top of the stairs, he<br /> dropped the bucket of snails. </p>
<p>There were snails all down the stairs. The door opened just<br /> then, with a very angry wife standing in the door way wondering<br /> where he's been all this time. </p>
<p>He looked at the snails all down the steps, then he looked at<br /> her, then back at the snails and said, ""Come on guys, we're<br /> almost there!!""</p>

<p>So the farmer took Henry back to the farm. Before setting him loose in the hen house though, he gave Henry a little pep talk. ""Henry"", he said, ""I'm counting on you to do your stuff."" And without a word, Henry then strutted into the hen house.</p>
<p>Henry was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a thunderbolt. There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Henry had finished having his way with each hen. But Henry didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one and still at the same frantic pace. Then he went to the pig house where he did the same. </p>
<p>The farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out, ""Stop, Henry, you'll kill yourself."" But Henry continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.</p>
<p>Well the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Henry lying there on his lawn. His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue hanging out. A buzzard was already circling above Henry.</p>
<p>The farmer walked up to Henry saying, ""Oh you poor thing, look what you did, you've gone and killed yourself. I warned you big buddy.""</p>

And sinks the<br /> putt. </p>
<p>Two holes later he mumbles to himself: ""Boy, if I could only get an eagle on<br /> this hole."" The same stranger moves to his side and says, ""Would it be worth<br /> another fourth of your sex life?"" The golfer shrugs and says, ""Sure."" And he<br /> makes an eagle. </p>
<p>Down to the final hole. The golfer needs yet another eagle to win. Though he<br /> says nothing, the stranger moves to his side and says, ""Would you be willing to<br /> give up the rest of your sex life to win this match?"" The golfer says,<br /> ""Certainly."" And makes the eagle. As the golfer walks to the clubhouse, the<br /> stranger walks alongside and says, ""You know, I've really not been fair with you<br /> because you don't know who I am. I'm the Devil, and from now on you will have no<br /> sex life."" ""Nice to meet you,"" says the golfer. ""My name's Father O'Malley!""</p>

The attack is not usually fatal. However, it has been known to attack men in the rear lower abdomen, which may result in an incurable disease and possible death. </p>
<p>HABITAT: </p>
<p>Usually found in bedrooms, but has been known to appear in the most unusual places.</p>
<p>ANTIDOTE: </p>
<p>Various types of vaccine available for women. However, once the venom is injected into the body, only drastic measures will ensure complete recovery. There is no known antidote for men. </p>
<p>WHAT TO DO WHEN ATTACKED: TORNIQUET: </p>
<p>Do not apply a torniquet, as the venom is too deep in the body to be affected. </p>
<p>CUTTING THE WOUND: </p>
<p>This would be completely unnecessary and ineffective as the bleeding will stop after a few weeks anyhow. </p>
<p>SUCKING THE WOUND: </p>
<p>This method is the most popular with the victim, but so far has not been reported to have led to any success. </p>
<p>MILKING THE SNAKE: </p>
<p>1. Place 4 fingers of the right hand around the neck of the reptile, with the thumb in the front. </p>
<p>2. Grip firmly and move the hand in an upwards and downwards motion. </p>
<p>3. This will result in the snake becoming highly aggressive and start spitting. </p>
<p>4. The time taken for this milking process depends entirely on the milker and the last time the snake attacked. </p>
<p>5. Once milked, the snake should be harmless for about 20 minutes. </p>
<p>CONCLUSION: </p>
<p>This snake, although it is very aggressive and active, is not necessarily a vermin and treated with the right respect, makes a wonderful pet.</p>

31092,"<p>WHAT I'VE  LEARNED......   I've learned that I like my teacher because she cries when we sing 'Silent Night.'  Age 6I've learned that you can't hide a piece of broccoli in a glass of  milk.  Age 7I've learned that when I wave to people in the country, they stop what they are doing and wave back.  Age 9   I've learned that just when I get my room the way I like it, Mom makes me clean it up.  Age 13   I've learned that if you want to cheer yourself up, you should try cheering someone else up.  Age 14I've learned that although it's hard to admit it, I'm secretly glad my parents are strict with me.  Age 15    I've learned that silent company is often more healing than words of advice.  Age 24   I've learned that brushing my child's hair is one of life's great pleasures.  Age 26I've learned that wherever I go, the world's worst drivers have followed me there.Age 29   I've learned that if someone says something unkind about me, I must live so that no one will believe it.  Age 39I've learned that there are people who love you dearly but just don't know how to show it.Age 41I've learned that you can make someone's day by simply sending them a little card.Age 44    I've learned that the greater a person's sense of guilt, the greater his need to cast blame on others.Age 46   I've learned that children and grandparents are natural allies.  Age 47   I've learned that singing 'Amazing Grace' can lift my spirits for hours.   Age 49I've learned that motel mattresses are better on the side away from from the phone.  Age 50I've learned that you can tell a lot about a man by the way he handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights.  Age 52   I've learned that keeping a vegetable garden is worth a medicine cabinet full of pills.  Age 52I've learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents, you miss them terribly after they die.  Age 53    I've learned that making a living is not the same thing as making a life.  Age 58I've learned that if you want to do something positive for your children, try to improve your marriage.Age 61   I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance.Age 62I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both hands.  You need to be able to throw something back.Age 64I've learned that if you pursue happiness, it will elude you.  But if you focus on your family, the needs of others, your work, meeting new people, and doing the very best you can, happiness will find you.  Age 65I've learned that whenever I decide something with kindness, I usually make the right decision. Age 66   I've learned that everyone can use a prayer.Age 72   I've learned that it pays to believe in miracles.  And to tell the truth, I've seen several.Age 73 I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one.Age 82I've learned that every day you should reach out and touch someone.  People love that human touch --- holding hands, a warm hug, or just a friendly pat on the butt.Age 85I've learned that I still have a lot to learn.Age 92</p>

Keep doing this so that we'll get an idea about the severity of her deafness''.      Sure enough, the husband goes home and does exactly as instructed.   He starts off about 15 feet from his wife in the kitchen as she is chopping some vegetables and says, ''Honey, what's for dinner?'' He hears no response.   He moves about five feet closer and asks again. No reply. He moves five feet closer.   Still no reply. He gets fed up and moves right behind her, about an inch away, and asks again, ''Honey, what's for dinner?''    She replies, ''For the fourth time, vegetable stew!''</p>

<p>After several weeks, the company writes back explaining that under the present<br /> law they are unable to supply the materials and do not wish to be prosecuted.

<p>Georgie Boy: Thank you. I live in the White House. You bet I want to win an oil well. </p>
<p>Host: Aha, that is quite a job, living in the White House. Well, Georgie Boy, lets get down with the show.</p>

<p>Host: You got it, Georgie Boy. You�ve won $100.00.</p>
<p>Question #2: What is George Washington�s last name?</p>
<p>Answers: a) George, b) WMD, c) Washington, D) George Washington.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: I�ll like to ask the audience on this one. </p>
<p>Host: OK, audience, please help Georgie Boy on this one. Well, Georgie Boy, 95% of the audience says the answer is Washington.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: I�m glad your audience is around to help. I was thinking the answer is (d), George Washington. Oh yes, I�ll go with the audience and say, Washington, final answer.</p>
<p>Host: Washington it is, Georgie Boy. You�ve won $200.00.</p>

<p>Host: That�s a tough question, Georgie Boy. Computer, randomly remove two of the wrong answers.</p>
<p>Host: Well, Georgie Boy, b and c have been removed.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: In that case I�ll like to guess 9, final answer.</p>

<p>Question #4: How many senators are there in the US Senate?</p>
<p>Answers: a) 25, b) 13, c) 50 d) 100</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: Well, I guess I�ll have to use my last life line. I like to phone a friend, Dick Chaney.</p>
<p>Host: Who is Dick Chaney?</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: Oh, Dick is my Vice President, and he sits in the Senate all the time. He should have counted those senators right by now. Some folks refer to Dick Chaney as my boss, and I do not appreciate that. Yes, my dad instructed Chaney to take care of me, but he sure isn�t my boss. Others also claim that I am Chaney�s poodle. </p>
<p>Host: OK. Lets get Dick Chaney on the phone now.</p>
<p>Voice at the other end: Hello?</p>
<p>Host: Is this Dick Chaney? </p>
<p>Voice at the other end: Yes it is.</p>
<p>Host: Mr. Chaney, I have here with me, Georgie Boy, on Who Wants To Win An Oil Well. He has won $400.00 so far, and needs a correct answer to win $800.00 before continuing on to win an oil well in Iraq. He needs your help to correctly answer a question. </p>
<p>Dick Chaney: OK. But I never gave him permission to get on your show. I�ll help him all the same. </p>
<p>Host: Georgie Boy, you may ask Mr. Chaney.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: Dick, how many senators are there in the US Senate? 25, 13, 50., or 100. You have 10 seconds to answer. Don�t sit on the question like the United Nations sat on our WMD the last time.</p>
<p>Dick Chaney: You must be referring to our Words of Mass Deception. Georgie Boy, the answer is 100.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: Yippie, Dick, Words of Mass Deception, indeed. As long as the majority of Americans have lenses made of dollar bills, the longer we�ll keep getting away with misleading them with our WMDs. How sweet it is! </p>
<p>Georgie Boy: My answer is 100, and that is final.</p>
<p>Host: You got it, Georgie Boy, and you�ve now won $800.00. You�re now on your way to winning an oil well. However, because you�ve used up all of your life lines, you�re now on your own. Lets proceed to the next question.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: Fine, bring it on.</p>
<p>Question #5. What is the capital city of Iraq? </p>
<p>Answers: a) Baghdad, b) Fallujah, c) Houston, d) Iran.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: Oh boy, all those answers look good to me.</p>
<p>Host: But you can only pick one of them for a chance to win $5,000.00 and advance to the next stage of the contest.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: Can I call Dick Chaney again?</p>
<p>Host: No, Georgie Boy, you�ve used up all of your life lines. You�re on you own now.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: A higher being tells me the right answer is Iran. So I�ll say Iran, final answer.</p>
<p>Host: Oh, Georgie Boy, Iran is not the correct answer. The correct answer is Baghdad. I�m afraid you�ve got to run. </p>
<p>Georgie Boy: Oh no, I�m going to stay the course. </p>
<p>Host: Georgie Boy, may be on a golf course. Good bye.</p>
<p>Georgie Boy: I wish you had given me these questions ahead of time, like the rest of the media does when dealing with me. Since I can�t win an Iraqi oil well on your contest, I guess I just have to get with Dick Chaney and we�ll march into Iraq and do oil well grabs our war.</p>

<p>""Nosotros no, s�lo comemos la migaja de adentro del pan y la parte de afuera la ponemos en un 'container', la reciclamos, la transformamos en harina y la exportamos a M�xico"".</p>
<p>El mexicano escucha en silencio, imperturbable. El americano sigue mascando chicle e insiste:</p>
<p>�Ustedes se comen la mermelada con el pan?""</p>

<p>""Nosotros no. Nosotros en el desayuno comemos fruta fresca, la c�scara y las semillas, las ponemos en otro 'container', las reciclamos, la transformamos en mermelada y la exportamos a M�xico"".</p>

31129,"<p>Statistically 100% of all divorces started with marriage!</p>
<p>I married Miss Right. I just didn't know her first name was Always.</p>
<p>Marriage is a 3-ring circus: Engagement ring, wedding ring, and suffering.</p>
<p>The last fight was my fault. My wife asked, ""What's on the TV?"" </p>
<p>I said, ""Dust!""</p>
<p>In the beginning, God created earth and rested.</p>
<p>Then God created man and rested. Then God created woman.</p>

<p>A man inserted an 'ad' in the classified: ""Wife wanted"".</p>
<p>Next day he received a hundred letters. They all said the same thing: ""You can have mine.""</p>
<p>The most effective way to remember your wife's birthday is to forget it once.</p>
<p>First guy (proudly): ""My wife's an angel!""</p>
<p>Second guy: ""You're lucky; mine's still alive.""</p>
<p>How do most men define marriage? </p>
<p>An expensive way to get laundry done for free.</p>
<p>Just think, if it weren't for marriage, men would go through life thinking they had no faults at all.</p>
<p>If you want your wife to listen and pay undivided attention to every word you say, talk in your sleep.</p>
<p>Then there was a man who said, ""I never knew what real happiness was until I got married; and then it was too late.""</p>

<p>He was gone about two hours and returned and handed them two checks, one for $25,000 and another for $50,000.</p>
<p>""How in the world did you do that?"" they asked.<br /> ""I told you I'm the worlds best salesman, I can sell anyone anything, anytime!""</p>
<p>""Did you get a urine sample?"" they asked him.<br /> ""What's that?"" he asked.<br /> ""Well, if you sell a policy over $20,000 the company requires a urine sample. Now take these two bottles and go back and get urine samples.""</p>
<p>He was gone about 8 hours and the office was about to close, when in he walks in with two five gallon buckets, one in each hand. He sets the buckets down and reaches in his shirt pocket and produces two bottles of urine and sets them on the desk and says, ""Here's Mr. Jone's and this one is Mrs. Johnson's.""</p>

<p>The client out of the blue asks her to marry him. Naturally, the<br /> secretary is quite taken aback. However, she remembers what her<br /> boss told her...don't reject the guy outright. So, she tries to<br /> think of a way to dissuade the king from wanting to marry her.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the woman says to the man, ""I will only<br /> marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement<br /> ring to be a 75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat<br /> diamond tiara.""</p>
<p>The African king pauses for a while. Then, he nods his head and<br /> says, ""No problem! I have. I have.""</p>

<p>The African king pauses for a while. He whips out his cellular<br /> phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks<br /> at the woman, nods his head and says, ""Okay, okay. I build. I<br /> build.""</p>
<p>Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary<br /> knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time<br /> to think and finally she gets an idea, a sure-to-work condition.<br /> She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly,<br /> ""Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch<br /> penis."" The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his<br /> hands and rests his elbows on the table, all the while muttering<br /> in African dialect.</p>

""You better have my<br /> ark completed or learn to swim for a long, long time!""<br /> Six months passed, the sky began to cloud up, and the rain began to fall in<br /> torrents. The Lord looked down and saw Noah sitting in his yard, weeping, and<br /> there was no ark.<br /> ""Noah!"" shouted the Lord, ""where is my ark?"" A lightning bolt crashed into the<br /> ground right beside Noah.<br /> ""Lord, please forgive me!"" begged Noah. ""I did my best, but there were some<br /> problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the ark's construction, but<br /> your plans did not meet their code. So, I had to hire an engineer to redo the<br /> plans, only to get into a long argument with him about whether to include a<br /> fire-sprinkler system.<br /> ""My neighbors objected, claiming that I was violating zoning ordinances by<br /> building the ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city<br /> planning board.<br /> ""Then, I had a big problem getting enough wood for the ark, because there was<br /> a ban on cutting trees to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince the<br /> environmentalists and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that I needed the wood<br /> to save the owls, but they wouldn't let me catch them, so no owls.<br /> ""Next, I started gathering up the animals but got sued by an animal rights<br /> group that objected to me taking along only two of each kind.<br /> ""Just when the suit got dismissed, the EPA notified me that I couldn't<br /> complete the ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your<br /> proposed flood. They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no<br /> jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being.<br /> ""Then, the Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed flood plan. I sent<br /> them a globe!<br /> ""Right now, I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Equal<br /> Opportunities Commission over how many minorities I'm supposed to hire.<br /> ""The IRS has seized all my assets claiming that I am trying to leave the<br /> country, and I just got a notice from the state that I owe some kind of use tax.<br /> Really, I don't think I can finish the ark in less than five years.""<br /> With that, the sky cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow arched<br /> across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled. ""You mean you are not going to<br /> destroy the world?"" he asked hopefully.<br /> ""No,"" said the Lord, ""the government already has.""</p>

31149,"<p>A game warden came upon a duck hunter who had bagged 3 ducks and decided to 'enforce the laws pending.' He stopped the hunter, flashed his badge and said, 'Looks like you've had a pretty good day. Mind if I inspect your kill?'The hunter shrugged and handed the ducks to the warden. The warden took one of the ducks, inserted his finger into the duck's rectum, pulled it out, sniffed it, and said, 'This here's a Washington state duck. Do you have a Washington state hunting license?'The hunter pulled out his wallet and calmly showed the warden a Washington state hunting license. The warden took a second duck, inserted his finger in the bird's rectum, pulled it out, sniffed it, and said, 'This here's an Idaho duck. Do you have an Idaho state hunting license?'The hunter, a bit put out, produced an Idaho state hunting license. The warden took a third duck, conducted the same finger test, and said, 'This here's an Oregon state duck. Do you have an Oregon state hunting license?'Once again, only this time more aggravated, the hunter produced the appropriate license. The warden, a little miffed at having struck out, handed the ducks back to the hunter and said, 'You've got all of these licenses, just where the hell are you from?'The hunter dropped his pants, bent over, and said  'You're so smart, YOU tell ME!'</p>

<p>The man stood perfectly still and continued to stare at the ceiling, saying nothing. Again, George W. asked, a little louder this time, ""Excuse me sir, aren't you Moses?"" Again, the old man stared at the ceiling motionless without saying a word. George W. tried a third time, louder yet. ""Excuse me sir, aren't you Moses?"" Again, no movement or words from the old man. He continued to stare at the ceiling.</p>
<p>One of George W's aides asked him if there was a problem, and George W. said, ""Either this man is deaf or extremely rude. I have asked him three times if he was Moses, and he has not answered me yet."" To which the man, still staring at the ceiling finally replied to the aide, ""I can hear him and yes, I am Moses, but the last time I spoke to a bush, I spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness.""</p>

The American was afraid of needles and did'nt want to be hanged. The American chose the electric chair. He sat in the chair and they pulled the switch and nothing happened. The executioner said that if this happens a second time that he could go free.

<p>BUSH SUES SANTA</p>
<p>AUSTIN, TX - Dec.15 - Attorneys for Texas Governor George W. Bush filed suit in federal court today, seeking to prevent Santa Claus from making his list and then checking it twice. The complaint seeks an immediate injunction against the beloved Christmas icon, asking the court to effectively ban his traditional practice of checking the list of good boys and girls one additional time before packing his sleigh.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in the Federal District Court of Austin, Texas, asks a federal judge to ""hereby order Mr. Claus to cease and desist all repetitive and duplicative list-checking activity, and certify the original list as submitted, without amendment, alteration, deletion, or other unnecessary modification.""</p>
<p>""There are no standards for deciding who is naughty, and who is nice. It's totally arbitrary and capricious. How many more times does he need to check? This checking, checking, and re-checking over and over again must stop now,"" said former Secretary James Baker.</p>
<p>Baker further claimed that unnamed GOP observers witnessed an elf remove all boys named Brad from the ""nice"" list, filing them under ""naughty"" instead because ""everyone knows all boys named Brad are brats.""</p>
<p>Gov. Bush cited the potential for unauthorized list tampering, and blasted what he called the ""fuzzy math up there at the North Pole.""</p>
<p>""Their security is really awful, really bad,"" said Bush. ""My mother just walked right in, told 'em she was Mrs. Claus. They didn't check her ID or nothing.""</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dick Cheney, Gov. Bush's running mate, issued a direct plea to St. Nick himself. ""Mr. Claus, I call on you to do the honorable thing, and quit checking your list. The children of the world have had enough. They demand closure now,"" Cheney said, adding that his granddaughter has already selected a name for the pony that she's asked for.</p>
<p>Santa Claus could not be reached for comment, but a spokes-elf said he was ""deeply distressed"" by news of the pending legal action against him. ""He's losing weight, and he hasn't said 'Ho Ho Ho' for days,"" said the spokes-elf. ""He's just not feeling jolly.""</p>

The teacher looked at the little girl with surprise, and asked: ""Mary, why didn't you raise your hand?""</p>
<p>Mary replied: ""Because I'm not a Lakers fan!""</p>
<p>The teacher felt a little competitive and asked: ""Well, if you're not a Lakers fan, then whom do you support?""</p>
<p>""I'm a Sonics fan, and proud of it!"" Mary replied, folding her little arms across her chest.</p>
<p>""Mary, why are you a Sonics fan?""</p>
<p>""Because my Mom and dad are from Seattle and my Mom is a Sonics fan and my dad is a Sonics fan, so I'm a Sonics fan too!""</p>
<p>""Well,"" said the teacher, knowing she was loosing it, ""that's still no reason for you to be a Sonics fan. You don't have to be just like your parents all of the time. What if your Mom was a prostitute and your dad was a drug addict and a car thief, what would you be then?""  As the words left he mouth, the teacher realized that if her new principal wasn't also a HUGE Lakers fan, that she may have ended her career right then and there.  Trying to hide her shock at her own words, she stared at little Mary who stared back coldly.</p>

My name is Alan.  Would you please read me the serial number printed on the battery cover under Barney's tail?''Thank you.  Could you please describe your problem?''I see.  Have you tried removing the batteries and reinstalling them?''Have you used the ActiMates Barney PC Pack to connect Barney to your computer?''OK, what version of the PC Pack are you using?  It's printed on the CD.''Kids do the darndest things.  Well in that case, would you please cover Barney's right eye with your hand, squeeze his left hand three times, and tell me what he says.''I'll repeat that: 'LOVE PLAY HAPPY.'  Is that correct?''Thank you.  That error code indicates that there may be an incompatibility between the Barney's firmware and the PC Pack.  Normally, I'd tell you to upgrade the PC Pack, but without the serial number on the CD I'm afraid you'd have to buy a whole new copy.  Can you possibly send in your Barney for a firmware upgrade?''Eight to twelve weeks.''Please don't yell, ma'am.  Under the circumstances, the best I can suggest is that you try a firmware reset.  Do you know how to place Barney in Maintenance Mode?''Yes I can, ma'am, but I have to read you this warning first: 'Using Maintenance Mode incorrectly can cause serious problems that may render Barney completely unusable.  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Maintenance Mode can be solved.  You use this mode at your own risk.' Do you agree to these terms?''Please state your full name slowly and clearly for the tape.''Thank you.  Is the child in the room?''That's good, this could be rather traumatic.  I'd like you to reach way back into Barney's mouth with your finger.  You should feel a small round button under the fabric.  Press the uvula -- excuse me, ma'am, I meant the button -- and hold it for at least three seconds, then tell me what Barney says.'''LOVE LOVE HAPPY LOVE FRIEND,' is that correct?''That means your Barney was made in Singapore, so you should twist Barney's head to the right about 120 degrees, until you hear a click.''Now press both of Barney's feet with one hand while you suqeeze his right hand three times.  He should say 'LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE'.''What was that, ma'am?''He's not supposed to have *that* in his vocabulary!  One moment, please...''Thank you for holding, ma'am.  I'm sorry, but apparently your Barney has the VERMIN virus.  Do you have a copy of Norton Playmate for Barney, or McAfee's Barney Gets His Shots?''I'd recommend you purchase one of those products at your local toy or computer store and use it to remove the virus.  If that doesn't help, please call back, and reference case number 022161-DDL.''Thank you, and have a good day.'</p>

31180,"<p>A computer was something on TV from a science fiction show of note. A window was something you hated to clean and ram was the cousin of a goat.</p>
<p>Meg was the name of my girlfriend and gig was a job for the nights. Now they all mean different things and that really mega bytes.</p>
<p>An application was for employment. A program was a TV show. A cursor used profanity. A keyboard was a piano.</p>
<p>Memory was something that you lost with age. A CD was a bank account. And if you had a 3 inch floppy, you hoped nobody found out.</p>
<p>Compress was something you did to the garbage, not something you did to a file and if you unzipped anything in public, you'd be in jail for a while.</p>
<p>Log on was adding wood to the fire. Hard drive was a long trip on the road. A mouse pad was where a mouse lived and a backup happened to your commode.</p>
<p>Cut you did, with a pocket knife. Paste you did with glue. A web was a spider's home and a virus was the flu.</p>
<p>I guess I'll stick to my pen and paper and the memory in my head. I hear nobody's been killed in a computer crash but when it happens they wish they were dead!</p>

31227,"<p>There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long<br /> business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he<br /> thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while<br /> he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her<br /> screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys<br /> and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex<br /> doll, but that was too close to another man for him.</p>
<p>He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something<br /> special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man<br /> behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man<br /> said, ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the<br /> trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on,<br /> but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for<br /> weeks, except -- "" and he stopped.</p>
<p>""Except what?"" the man asked.</p>
<p>""Nothing, nothing.""</p>
<p>""C'mon, tell me! I need something!""</p>
<p>""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the<br /> 'voodoo dick.'""</p>
<p>""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" he asked.</p>
<p>The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old<br /> wooden box, carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there<br /> lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and<br /> said ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this<br /> shop!""</p>
<p>The old man replied, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.""<br /> He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The<br /> voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and<br /> started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the<br /> vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the<br /> door could split, the old man said ""Voodoo dick, get back in<br /> your box!"" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and<br /> lay there, quiescent once more.</p>
<p>""I'll take it!"" said the businessman.</p>
<p>The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally<br /> surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife,<br /> told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had<br /> to do was say ""Voodoo dick, my pussy."" He left for his trip<br /> satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.</p>
<p>After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny.<br /> She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her,<br /> but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and<br /> said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch<br /> and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever<br /> experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had<br /> enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still<br /> thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing<br /> worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off.<br /> So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.<br /> She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to<br /> the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the<br /> way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she<br /> was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and<br /> then asked how much she'd had to drink.</p>
<p>Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been<br /> drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and<br /> wouldn't stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second,<br /> and then said ""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!""</p>

31246,"<p>There was an older man who'd married a younger woman. All was going well...<br /> except in the bedroom. He couldn't last long enough to satisfy her. She said it<br /> didn't matter but he knew it was getting her down. So he went to the doctor and<br /> asked for help.<br /> The doctor recommended that he satisfy himself before they have sex -- that<br /> way, he'd last longer. The next day, the man planned on ravishing his wife when<br /> he came home, and decided to please himself on the way. So he pulled over onto a<br /> quiet road. But he couldn't just sit there in his car having a wank, so he<br /> decided to lie under the car and pretend that he was fixing he car. He crawled<br /> under the car, closed his eyes, imagined his wife naked, and started wanking.<br /> After a while he felt something tugging at his jeans. </p>
<p>""Sir, this is the police. Would you mind telling us what you're doing?"" </p>
<p>Not wanting to lose this wonderful image of his wife he kept his eyes closed. </p>

<p>""Name's Enoch...your neighbor from four miles over the ridge...havin' a party Saturday...thought you'd like to come.""</p>
<p>""Great,"" Sam says, ""after six months of this I'm ready to meet some local folks. Thank you.""</p>

<p>""Not a problem...after 25 years of Harley riding, I can do that with the best of them.""</p>

<p>""Now that is not a problem,"" says Sam, ""remember, I've been alone for six months. I'll definitely be there! By the way...what should I wear to the party?""</p>

31257,"<p>A man with a 25 inch long penis goes to his doctor to complain that he is having a problem with this cumbersome instrument and has had more than one complaint. ""Doctor,"" he asked, in total frustration, ""is there anything you can do for me?"" The doctor replies, ""Medically son, there is nothing I can do. But, I do know this witch who may be able to help you."" So the doctor gives him directions to the witch. </p>
<p>The man calls upon the witch and relays his story. ""Witch, my penis is 25 inches long and I need help. Can anything be done to help me? You are my only hope."" The witch stares in amazement, scratches her head, and then replies, ""I think I may be able to help you with your problem. Do this. Go deep into the forest. You will find a pond.

<p>The frog looked at him dejectedly and replied, ""NO."" </p>
<p>The man looked down and suddenly his penis was 5 inches shorter. ""WOW,"" he screamed out loud, ""this is great!"" But it was still too long at 20 inches, so he decided to ask the frog to marry him again. ""Frog, will you marry me?"" the guy shouted. </p>
<p>The frog rolled its eyes back in its head and screamed back, ""NO!"" The man felt another twitch in his penis, looked down, and it was another 5 inches shorter. The man laughed, ""This is fantastic."" He looked down at his penis again, 15 inches long, and reflected for a moment. Fifteen inches is still a monster, just a little less would be ideal. Grinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, ""Frog will you marry me?"" </p>

31264,"<p>Juanita y Pepe estaban por comprometerse en matrimonio. Pero antes de aceptar, ella pens� que ser�a prudente confesarle que, debido a una enfermedad infantil, sus senos no se hab�an desarrollado normalmente y, debido a eso, se le hab�an quedado de un tama�o equivalente a los de una ni�a de doce a�os.</p>
<p>Al enterarse de su secreto, Pepe le asegur� que no ten�a de que preocuparse, que el amor que sent�a por ella estaba por encima de esa contrariedad. Y ya que estaban en eso de las confesiones, pens� que tambi�n ser�a propicio contarle un secreto que escond�a por muchos a�os. La miro a los ojos y le dijo:</p>
<p>""Mi amor, tengo que decirte que tengo el pene del tama�o de un reci�n nacido. Espero que esto no sea problema"".</p>
<p>Ella le contest� que el tama�o de su pene no ser�a ning�n problema, porque lo amaba tanto que buscar�a la manera de solucionar ese 'peque�o' problema.</p>
<p>Se casaron, y al llegar al hotel donde pasar�an su luna de miel, inmediatamente comenzaron con los manoseos y caricias. En eso, al introducir Juanita su mano en los calzoncillos de Pepe, solt� un grito ensordecedor y sali� corriendo de la habitaci�n. Alcanz�ndola, Pepe, asombrado, le pregunt� qu� era lo que le hab�a pasado. Todav�a agitada, la chica le contest�:</p>
<p>""�Me mentiste, me dijiste que ten�as el pene del tama�o de un reci�n nacido!""</p>
<p>""Es verdad, cari�o, lo tengo del tama�o de un reci�n nacido: pesa tres kilogramos y mide 48 cent�metros de largo"".</p>

<p>Feeling better, Mr. Jones goes in to the doctor when called. He explains his problem, drops his trousers, and lets the doctor have a look. ""It's serious I'm afraid Mr. Jones, It will have to be amputated. I can schedule surgery for three days time."" </p>

The teacher dropped her panties, lifted her skirt, squatted down and farted but when she was done, and there was not a trace of chalk dust left on the paper.Harley was astonished and asked if he could see her do it again. She was willing and as she repeated the process,  Harley peeked up underneath her skirt.""No wonder you won!"" he exclaimed indignantly, ""you've got a Double-Barrel!""</p>

""But I want<br /> something sheerer, infact bring me the sheerest you've got."" the<br /> man replies. The lady again goes into the back and comes back<br /> with another pair of underwear. She says, ""Sir, this is the<br /> sheerest underwear we sell, it costs $300."" The man says,""Well I<br /> guess I'll have to buy it then."" He buys the underwear and<br /> leaves.<br />     Christmas rolls around, and he gives her the present. She<br /> opens it up and says,""It's perfect."" He tells her to go try it<br /> on and he says,""I'll be waiting on the bed for you."" She<br /> disappears into the bathroom and try's it on. She looks at it in<br /> the mirror and says in her head, I cant even see the underwear<br /> so might as well not even wear it.<br />     So she walks out and see's her husband on the bed bare ass.<br /> He looks at her and says,""Geez you could of at least ironed it.""</p>

31307,"<p>An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are trying to set up a fenced-in area for some sheep, but they have a limited amount of building material. The engineer gets up first and makes a square fence with the material, reasoning that it's a pretty good working solution. ""No no,"" says the physicist, ""there's a better way."" He takes the fence and makes a circular pen, showing how it encompasses the maximum possible space with the given material.Then the mathematician speaks up: ""No, no, there's an even better way."" To the others' amusement he proceeds to construct a little tiny fence around himself, then declares:""I define myself to be on the outside.""</p>

31311,"<p>Idiocy in the Computer World </p>
<p>When I worked for a company that had a contract with 3M, 3M had asked me to write them a memo describing why we were having problems with diskette failures. I said in the memo that the disks were failing due to head crashes. ""If the customers would just clean their heads periodically, we wouldn't have these problems,"" I said in the memo. One customer responded with ""What kind of shampoo do you recommend?""</p>
<p>An end-user hotline received a call about a bad software disk. They asked the customer to make a copy of the disk and mail it in to the hotline.  A few days later, they received a letter with a mimeographed copy of the disk. Since it was a double-sided disk, both sides of the disk had been Xeroxed.</p>
<p>A Computer Operator says as she is lifting an RP06 disk pack from the drive:  ""Gee, how much does one of these weigh?""</p>
<p>Me:  ""It depends on how much data is on the disk.</p>
<p>The operator believed it.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience while working as a student operator at Michigan Tech.  One particularly trying afternoon, the computer was merrily crashing for a number of reasons. After about four such spectacles, we broadcast that the computer would be down for the remainder of the afternoon. There was a resigned groan from the users and they began to file out of the Center, except for one comely young woman with wide blue eyes who wandered up to the counter and queried: ""What's wrong with the computer?""</p>
<p>Too tired and irritated to give her a straight answer, I looked her straight in the eye and replied: ""Broken muffler belt.""</p>
<p>A look of deep concern wafted into her expression as she asked: ""Oh, that's bad. Can you call Midas?""</p>
<p>A few excerpts from the Computer Help Desk:</p>
<p>Caller: ""What's the name for when you're entering data into the computer?""<br /> HD:  ""Data Entry.""<br /> Caller: ""Thank you!""</p>
<p>Overheard in a student computer lab:<br /> Client (raising hand and waving frantically): ""The computer says 'Enter your name and press RETURN. 'What do I do??""<br /> Lab Assistant:  ""Enter your name and press RETURN.""<br /> Client (as if a revelation has struck): ""Oh!""</p>

She didn't even say 'Good Morning' let alone say 'Happy Birthday'. </p>
<p>""I said to myself Well that's wives for you. The children will remember.' But the children came into breakfast and didn't say a word. And when I started to the office, I was feeling pretty low and despondent. </p>
<p>As I walked into my office, Janet said 'Good Morning, Boss-Happy Birthday' and I felt a little bit better that someone had remembered. I worked until noon. About noon, Janet knocked on my door and said, You know it's such a beautiful day outside and it is your birthday, so let's go to lunch, just you and I.' I said, 'By George, that is the greatest thing I have heard all day. Let's go.' </p>
<p>""We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go, we went out into the country to a private place. We had two Martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. </p>
<p>""On the way back to the office, she said, 'You know, it's such a beautiful day we don't need to go back to the office, do we?' I said, 'No, I guess not.' </p>
<p>""She said, 'Let's go by my apartment, and I'll fix you another Martini.' </p>
<p>""We went to her apartment. We enjoyed another Martini and smoked a cigarette and she said, 'Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable' and I allowed her as I didn't mind at all. </p>

31334,"<p>There was a man who was heading away for a week on business. His<br /> wife was incredibly horny and needed a good fuck every now and<br /> again so she was left with a warning from her husband before he<br /> left. He said, ""If I find out that you have been shagging<br /> another man while I'm gone then I will pull every pubic hair<br /> from your crotch!""</p>
<p>He was dead serious but his wife thought she could occupy<br /> herself for just one week using her fingers and the handle of<br /> her tennis racquet (which she did a lot when her husband was<br /> gone).</p>
<p>However she failed and one day before her husband was set to<br /> return she was gagging for more than she could get from her<br /> fingers and the tennis racquet! So she headed into town in the<br /> hope of finding a large well-bodied fuckable man to satisfy her<br /> lust. While walking down the High Street she found a very hunky<br /> and sexy black man that she wouldn't mind screwing and so she<br /> walked up to him and said-""Will you come home with?"" and the<br /> black man replied, ""Only for a chocolate biscuit."" She gave him<br /> a biscuit and they headed towards her house.</p>
<p>So they got home and the woman said, ""Will you come inside and<br /> upstairs?""</p>
<p>""Only for a chocolate biscuit"" So she gave him another biscuit.</p>
<p>So they got upstairs and into the woman's bedroom. ""Will you<br /> take off your clothes and lie with me on the bed?""</p>
<p>""Only for a chocolate biscuit"" So she gave him yet another<br /> biscuit!!</p>
<p>""Will you fuck me until I hit orgasm at least three times!""</p>
<p>""Only for a chocolate biscuit"" So she gave him a biscuit leaving<br /> only one left in the box and they got to business. </p>
<p>He was drilling into her-fucking her harder and faster until she<br /> was dripping wet-screwing her pussy and hitting her G-spot with<br /> every hard core thrust. She was at her orgasmic peak and when it<br /> was over they were both swollen and sore and so exhausted that<br /> they fell asleep together in the bed.</p>
<p>The next mourning the husband arrived home from his trip and<br /> headed upstairs to great his wife with a homecoming ride. She<br /> heard him coming upstairs and immediately told the black to get<br /> into the cupboard and hide. ""Only for a chocolate biscuit"" he<br /> said and so she gave him the last chocolate biscuit and shoved<br /> him into the cupboard just before her husband walked in.</p>
<p>He walked towards the bed and began to take off his clothes when<br /> he stopped and spotted the white spunk stains on the lilac<br /> sheets.</p>
<p>""You've been in bed with another man and don't lie to me!!!!!!!""</p>
<p>His wife didn't say a word and like he had warned he opened her<br /> legs and began to pluck all her pubic hairs from her crotch one<br /> by one. By the time he reached the last one he couldn't get it<br /> to come out and so he shouted, ""Come out you black bastard!!!""</p>
<p>And the guy in the cupboard shouted ""Only for a chocolate<br /> biscuit!!!!!!""</p>

''Hey honey, you're getting fat. Your butt is huge. I'll bet it's as wide as the gas grill.''   Feeling the need to prove his point, he got out a yard stick and measured the grill, then his wife's butt. ''Yep,'' he said,'' just what I thought, just about the same size.'' The wife became mad and left him gardening alone. She went inside the house and didn't speak to him for the rest of the day. When they retired to bed that evening, the husband cuddled up to his wife and said, ''How about it, honey? How about a little lovemaking?''

<p>Drive through with a carload of naked people.</p>
<p>Speak in such a garbled fashion that the order-taker will think there is a problem with the speaker and ask you to order at the window. When you arrive at the window, speak in the same garbled, incomprehensible fashion.</p>
<p>Drive through with someone on the hood to accept the food.</p>
<p>Bring along a Mr. Microphone. When the order-taker speaks, aim the mic at their speaker but do so while aiming the Mr. Microphone speaker at the mic to produce excruciating feedback of their own voice.</p>
<p>Have a friend hide in the trunk. When you approach the window to pickup your order, have him start yelling and banging his fists on the trunk.</p>
<p>If you are a male, have a female friend place the order by speaking VERY seductively and suggestively into the speaker. When she finishes, have her hide and pull up to accept your order.

<p>The ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his hands together at his groin, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in agony. The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize.</p>
<p>""Please allow me to help. I'm a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you'd allow me,"" she told him.</p>
<p>""Oh, no, I'll be all right. I'll be fine in a few minutes,"" the man replied, still in pain, in the foetal position, still clasping his hands together in his groin.</p>
<p>But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help. She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, she loosened his pants, and put her hands inside. She began to massage him.</p>
<p>She then asked, ""How does that feel?""</p>
<p>He replied, ""It feels great, but my thumb still hurts like hell.""</p>

<p>After some dicussion, they decided the quickest way would be to do the breast stroke, so off they set.</p>
<p>One day later the Redhead reached the French coast. Having lost sight of the other two swimmers just off the English coast she decided that they couldn't be far behind so sat on the beach looking out to sea waiting for the other two.</p>
<p>After a cold night of waiting, the Brunette finally came into sight. ""What took you so long?"" inquired the Redhead.</p>
<p>""There were some strong currents out there! But I'm here now! Am I the last?"" replied the Brunette.</p>
<p>""No. Blondie is still out there somewhere."" They decided to wait.</p>
<p>Day after day the two swimmers sat on the beach until on the 5th day Blondie came into view. Once on dry land the Brunette asked the blonde ""What took you so long?""</p>
<p>""What do you expect? You guy's cheated, replied the blonde, ""You used your hands!""</p>

31390,"<p>A Charlotte, North Carolina man, having purchased a case of very rare, very expensive cigars, insured them against ... get this ... fire.</p>
<p>Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of fabulous cigars, and having yet to make a single premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that he had lost the cigars in ""a series of small fires.""</p>
<p>The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in a normal fashion. The man sued... and won.</p>
<p>In delivering his ruling, the judge stated that since the man held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable, and also guaranteed that it would insure the cigars against fire, without defining what it considered to be unacceptable fire,"" it was obligated to compensate the insured for his loss.</p>
<p>Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the judge's ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in ""the fires."" After the man cashed his check, however, the insurance company had him arrested ... on 24 counts of arson.</p>
<p>With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used as evidence against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning the rare cigars and sentenced to 24 consecutive one year terms.</p>

31393,"<p>A university Maths professor had to compose an exam to give his students<br /> at the end of the year. He was a bit lazy, so he set the following exam:</p>
<p>----------<br /> ""Compose a math examination suitable for students to sit, and<br /> solve all questions giving suitable examples.""<br /> ----------</p>
<p>That was all.</p>
<p>He handed out the exam to his students and gave them three hours to<br /> complete it. However, after just a couple of minutes one student stood up,<br /> handed in his paper and left the room.</p>
<p>That student got an ""A"". But how?</p>
<p>Well, here's what the student wrote:</p>
<p>MATHS EXAM</p>
<p>Question 1.</p>
<p>Compose a math examination suitable for students to sit, and solve all<br /> questions giving suitable examples.</p>
<p>Correct Answer:</p>
<p>Compose a math examination suitable for students to sit, and solve all<br /> questions giving suitable examples.</p>
<p>End.</p>
<p>He figured that if that exam was good enough for a university professor to<br /> set his students, it was certainly good enough to use as an example!</p>
<p>In the future, the professor banned that specific answer from the exams.</p>

31398,"<p>One day the teacher walks into her classroom and announces to the class that on each Friday she will ask a question to the class and anyone who answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday.</p>
<p>On the first Friday the teacher asks: ""How many grains of sand are on the beach?"" needless to say, no one could answer.</p>
<p>The following Friday, the teacher asks the class: ""How many stars are in the sky?"" and again no one could answer. Frustrated little Johnny decides that the next Friday he would somehow answer the question and get a 3 day weekend.</p>
<p>So Thursday night Johnny takes 2 ping pong balls and paints them black. The next day he brings them to school in a paper bag. At the end of the day just when the teacher says, ""here's this week's question,"" Johnny empties the bag to the floor sending the ping pong balls rolling to the front of the room. Because they are young kids who find any disruption of class amusing, the entire class starts laughing.</p>

31424,"<p>It was autumn, and time for the blonde chicken farmer to go over his books. To his puzzlement,he found that his flock of Rhode Island Reds was twice as profitable, in terms of the eggs they produced, as was his flock of White Leghorns.""Look at this,"" he said to his wife.""I've gone over the numbers again and again, and there's no doubt about it: the Reds are laying twice as many eggs, and bringing in twice the money of the Whites. I just don't understand it.""""I'll tell you something else,"" said his equally blonde wife, running a finger over the figures in her husband's spreadsheet.""It looks like the Reds are eating twice as much as the Whites too. Maybe that's why they're producing twice as many eggs.""""By golly, you're right,"" said the farmer. Stymied, he went to bed that night, making a mental note to call an expert the next day.He spent the following morning on the phone, calling the best poultry experts all over the country, but none could offer a satisfactory explanation as to why a flock of Rhode Island Reds would eat twice as much or produce twice as many eggs as a flock of White Leghorns.On the verge of giving up, the farmer realized he had wasted a whole morning on the phone, when he should have been out tending his chickens. He hurried out to the huge hen house, where he ran into Jeb, the young farmhand.""Get up late this morning?"" asked Jeb.The farmer explained, as he had at least twenty times already that day, about the mystery of the chickens, and how he had sought expert advice, to no avail.Jeb listened, and when the farmer was done talking, said, ""Boss, I think I can tell you why the Reds are eating twice as much and laying twice as many eggs as the Whites.""The blonde farmer smirked.""Oh, really, Jeb? And why would that be?""""Well, Boss,"" said Jeb, ""you own twice as many Reds.""</p>

"
31442,"<p>THE HEAD -- Often covered with hair, the head should have all the essential<br /> parts:<br /> EARS -- Ears should be well-placed, incredibly attuned to a child's<br /> uttering- i.e. ""you suck!� even when spoken under the breath and in another<br /> room. Yet strong enough to tune out the loudest music of ""Hootie and the<br /> Blowfish"" when preparing dinner.<br /> EYES -- Eyes can be of any color, should be able to see (although there have<br /> been many very successful mothers who were blind- they simply used the<br /> all-powerful ""eyes at the back of the head"" tool). Expression should be soft and<br /> gentle, yet capable of ""shooting bullets"" at appropriate times. I, on occasion,<br /> use the ""I will turn your little butt to salt right here"" look in times of<br /> extreme stress.<br /> NOSE -- Ah, the nose, able to smell a soiled diaper at 50 yards! I have not<br /> found the ""bigger is better"" theory at work here. I have known mothers with tiny<br /> little turned-up noses that look completely ineffectual, actually ""scent"" the<br /> time (10 minutes) when her little offspring smoked his/her first cigarette. A<br /> fantastic feat, it was a treat to watch her. She made one small error once-<br /> completely understandable- she mistook the Scotch he tried for a single-malt,<br /> rather than a blend. I could forgive her this- she was a Gin drinker.<br /> MOUTH -- Not quite as large as Rush Limbaugh's (God forbid), nor as small as<br /> Bettie Boop (I do not think she would make an effective mother). It should be<br /> able to sing a soft, albeit, out-of-key nursery rhyme, or raise the rafters when<br /> ""mother"" is displeased. My only absolute rule it that it should never, never be<br /> used to insult, demean or humiliate the child. Anger is all right, but verbal<br /> abuse is forbidden. Also, the mouth is needed for eating -quite often, and in<br /> small doses usually, because mothers do not have enough time to actually sit<br /> down to eat a full meal at one time- ""mom, I need this done now"", ""mom can you<br /> take me here now"", ""mom where is my....,"" ""mom, come here and look at this!"" and<br /> the dreaded, ""oops...Oh God.....MOM!!!!!""<br /> SHOULDERS -- The actual size is not so important, I know many women who even<br /> enhance their size due to fashion styles. It really doesn't matter, as long as<br /> they can bear the weight of the world occasionally and then much more often<br /> during High School.<br /> BREASTS -- Here is where you all get treated to an honest to God mother-type<br /> lecture. So hunker down and just listen. These particular accouterments to the<br /> human body are there for one reason, and one reason only - Milk Machines! They<br /> were put there to nourish a baby and when the time comes, boy is they handy! Now<br /> I realize that there are some women out there that look like they could feed<br /> Nicaragua single-handedly and some (as, ahem, myself) that look as if they were<br /> drier than the Sahara Desert. But let me assure you that the good Lord provided,<br /> just such a large range of sizes to make some men look like idiots in their<br /> admiration of something that every other mammal in the world has. If we could<br /> get this through our thick skulls, so that many women did not feel inadequate,<br /> then my work as 'Semi-Super Woman' would be done.<br /> STOMACH -- This includes the waist, which I have not had since 1971.<br /> Seriously, I jump right from bottom of the rib cage to top of the hip-bone, with<br /> a huge pinch of extra skin in-between. It is truly amazing to me that I lost it<br /> so suddenly and did not even hear it drop. This particular part of the body can<br /> change dramatically from woman to woman after having a child. I, myself,<br /> developed stretch marks that have had gynecologists spending enormous amounts of<br /> time trying to decipher hidden pictures that they are sure that they can see.<br /> Sort of like a Rorschach test game. I have had friends who have had 5 babies and<br /> have a stomach that you could bounce a dime off, and not only that, there's not<br /> a mark on them. (I, as a matter of fact, have lost several coins in the folds of<br /> my big belly, but I look at it as a kind of retirement fund).</p>

31447,"<p>Due to the current financial situation, changes will be made to the Business Travel Standards and Procedures Manual.<br /> Effective Monday the following revised procedures apply: </p>
<p>Lodging<br /> ----------<br /> All employees are encouraged to stay with relatives and friends while on business travel. If weather permits, public areas such as parks should be used as temporary lodging sites. Bus terminals, train stations, and office lobbies may provide shelter in periods of inclement weather. </p>
<p>Transportation<br /> ----------------<br /> Hitch-hiking is the preferred mode of travel in lieu of commercial transport. Luminescent safety vests will be issued to all employees prior to their departure on business trips. Bus transportation will be used only when work schedules require such travel. Airline tickets will be authorized in extreme circumstances and the lowest fares will be used. For example, if a meeting is scheduled in Seattle, but the lower fare can be obtained by traveling to Detroit, then travel to Detroit will be substituted for travel to Seattle. </p>
<p>Meals<br /> -------<br /> Expenditures for meals will be limited to an absolute minimum. It should be noted that certain grocery and specialty chains, such as Hickory Farms, General Nutrition centers, Costco, and Sam's Club often provide free samples of promotional items. Entire meals can be obtained in this manner. Travelers should also be familiar with indigenous roots, berries, and other protein sources available at their destinations. If restaurants must be utilized, travelers should use ""all you can eat"" salad bars. This is especially effective for employees traveling together as one plate can be used to feed the entire group. </p>
<p>Employees are also encouraged to bring their own food on business travel. Cans of tuna fish, Spam, and Beefaroni can be consumed at your leisure without the necessary bother of heating or costly preparation. </p>
<p>Miscellaneous<br /> ---------------<br /> All employees are encouraged to devise innovative techniques in effort to save company dollars. One enterprising individual has already suggested that money could be raised during airport layover periods, which could be used to defray travel expenses. In support of this idea, red caps will be issued to all employees prior to their departure so that they may earn tips by helping others with their luggage. Small plastic roses and ball point pens will also be available to employees so that sales may be made as time permits. </p>
<p>We welcome any suggestions for further cost cutting.</p>

The drunk wandered off into the crowd.An hour or so later he came back, even more drunk than before. Once again the showman demurred, but once again the drunk insisted, and once more scored three bullseyes and was given another turtle.Eventually the drunk rolled up again and insisted on a third attempt. Once more he picked up the rifle, waved it around in the general direction of the target, and pulled the trigger three times. Once more he had scored three bullseyes. But this time there was an onlooker with good eyesight.""That's fantastic"", the man said. ""Hasn't he scored three bulls?""The showman, cursing his luck, made a play of going over to the target and inspecting it closely.""Yes Sir!"" , he announced to the crowd. ""This is fantastic!

<p>Un d�a, Federico invita a su madre a cenar a su apartamento. Durante la cena, la madre no pudo evitar reparar en lo hermosa que era Karla. Durante mucho tiempo hab�a tenido sospechas de que su hijo sosten�a una relaci�n con Karla y, al verla, la sospecha no pudo sino acrecentarse. En el transcurso de la velada, mientras observaba el modo en que los dos se comportaban, se pregunt� si estar�an acost�ndose. Leyendo a su madre el pensamiento, Federico asevera:</p>
<p>""Mam�, s� lo que est�s pensando, pero te aseguro que Karla y yo s�lo somos compa�eros de apartamento"".</p>

<p>Federico contesto que, conociendo a  su madre, dudaba que ella se lo hubiese llevado pero que le escribir�a una nota y que la dejar�a en un lugar visible en la casa de su madre: en la puerta del refrigerador. As� que se sent� y escribi�:</p>
<p>'Querida mam�:</p>

31497,"<p>Bill Gates dies in a car accident. He finds himself in purgatory, being sized up by St. Peter. ""Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before in your case; I'm going to let you decide where you want to go.""</p>
<p>Bill replied, ""well, what's the difference between the two?"" St. Peter said, ""I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision.""</p>
<p>""Fine, but where should I go first?""</p>
<p>""I'll leave that up to you.""</p>
<p>""Okay then,"" said Bill, Let's try Hell first.""</p>
<p>So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of bikini-clad women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun was shining; the temperature perfect. He was very pleased. ""This is great!"" he told St. Peter. ""If this is hell, I REALLY want to see heaven!""</p>
<p>""Fine,"" said St. Peter, and off they went.</p>
<p>Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision. ""Hmmm. I think I'd prefer Hell,"" he told St. Peter.</p>
<p>""Fine,"" retorted St. Peter, ""as you desire.""</p>
<p>So Bill Gates went to Hell. Two weeks later, St. Peter decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall, screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned and tortured by demons. ""How's everything going?"" he asked Bill.</p>
<p>Bill responded, with his voice filled with anguish and disappointment, ""This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the beautiful beaches, the scantily-clad women playing in the water?""</p>
<p>""That was a demo,"" replied St. Peter.</p>

Max, the older, had been having problems remembering what cards were what, and usually needed help from his wife. At the end of the card game Ed said to Max, ""You did very good tonight. You didn't need any help at all. Why is that?"" </p>
<p>Max replied, ""Why ever since my wife sent me to that memory school, I haven't had any problems at all."" </p>
<p>""Memory school? What memory school?"" </p>
<p>Max thought for a moment, ""Oh, what's that flower that's red with thorns? A really pretty flower...?"" </p>
<p>""A rose?"" </p>
<p>""Yeah...that's it!"" </p>
<p>Max turned to his wife and mumbled, ""Hey, Rose! What's the name of that memory school you sent me to?""</p>

All the other  colors would print fine, which truly baffled me because the only true colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. For instance, green is a combination of cyan and yellow, but green printed fine.</p>
<p>Every color of the rainbow printed fine except for yellow. I had the customer change ink cartridges. I had the customer delete and reinstall the drivers. Nothing worked. I asked my co-workers for help; they offered no new ideas.</p>
<p>After over two hours of troubleshooting, I was about to tell the customer to send the printer in to us for repair when she asked quietly,</p>

<p>For a computer programming class, I sat directly across from someone, and our computers were facing away from each other.</p>
<p>A few minutes into the class, she got up to leave the room. I reached between our computers and switched the inputs for the keyboards. She came back and started typing and immediately got a distressed look on her face.</p>
<p>She called the teacher over and explained that no matter what she typed, nothing would happen. The teacher tried everything. By this time I was hiding behind my monitor and quaking red-faced.</p>
<p>I started to type, ""Leave me alone!""</p>
<p>They both jumped back, silenced. ""What the . . . "" the teacher said.<br /> I typed, ""I said leave me alone!""</p>
<p>The kid got real upset. ""I didn't do anything to it, I swear!""<br /> It was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud. The conversation between them and HAL 2000 went on for an amazing five minutes.</p>

<p>El primer General decide que el examinador le tome las medidas desde la planta del pie hasta la parte superior de su cabeza. Despu�s de medirle, el inspector le atribuye una cuant�a de 183 mil d�lares.</p>
<p>El segundo General decide estirar los brazos hacia los lados, manteni�ndolos paralelos al suelo, y pide ser medido desde la punta del dedo medio de la mano derecha, hasta la punta del dedo medio de la mano izquierda. El interventor le mide y le atribuye una cuant�a de 205 mil d�lares.</p>

<p>The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the offer. St. Peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a huge room full of clocks.</p>
<p>The guy asks, ""What's up with these clocks?""</p>
<p>St. Peter explains, ""Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged.""</p>

<p>St. Peter explains, ""Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds his clock.""</p>
<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, ""What's the story with that clock?""</p>

31607,"<p>Harry had a bit of a drinking problem. Every night, after dinner, he took off for the local watering hole. He spent the whole evening there, and arrived home, well inebriated, around midnight each night. He always had trouble getting his key into the keyhole, and getting the door opened. His wife, waiting up for him, would go to the door and let him in. Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out, and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry continued his nightly routine. </p>
<p>One day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior, and was particularly distraught by it all. The friend listened to her, and then said, ""Why don't you treat him a little differently when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words, and welcome him home with a kiss? He then might change his ways."" </p>
<p>The wife thought it was worth trying. That night, Harry took off again, after dinner. And, about midnight, he arrived home, in his usual condition. His wife heard him at the door, quickly went to it, opened the door, and let Harry in. This time, instead of berating him, as she had always done, she took his arm, and led him into the living room. She sat him down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. Then she went behind him, and started to cuddle him a little. </p>
<p>After a while, she said to him, ""It's pretty late. I think we had better go upstairs to bed now, don't you?"" </p>

<p>They walked up, knocked on the door, and heard a voice say, ""Come on in."" They opened the door and saw glass all over the floor and a broken bottle lying on its side on the foyer. A man on the couch said, ""Are you the people that broke the window?""</p>
<p>""Uh yeah. Sorry about that,"" the husband replied.<br /> ""No, actually I want to thank you. I'm a genie that was trapped for a thousand years in that bottle. You've released me. I'm allowed to grant three wishes - I'll give you each one wish, and I'll keep the last one for myself.""</p>
<p>""OK great!"" the husband said. ""I want a million dollars a year for the rest of my life."" No problem - it's the least I could do.</p>
<p>And you, what do you want?"" the genie said, looking at the wife.<br /> ""I want a house in every country of the world,"" she said.<br /> ""Consider it done."" the genie replied.</p>
<p>""And what's your wish genie?"", the husband said.</p>
<p>""Well, since I have been trapped in that bottle, I havn't had sex with a woman in a thousand years. My wish is to sleep with your wife.""</p>
<p>The husband looks at the wife and said, ""Well we did get a lot of money and all those houses, honey. I guess I don't care.""</p>
<p>The genie took the wife upstairs, and ravished her for two hours.</p>
<p>After it was over, the genie rolled over, looked at the wife and said, ""How old is your husband, anyway?""<br /> ""35."" she replied.<br /> ""And he still believes in genies??? That's amazing!""</p>

The golfer walked onto the water, found his the ball, placed it next to the water hazard and hit it onto the green.As you may have guessed, the first golfer was Moses, and the second golfer was Jesus.The third teed off. The ball soared through the air and it too was headed for the water. However, just before the ball went in the water, a fish jumped up and grabbed the ball in its mouth. As the fish was about to go back into the water, a eagle grabbed the fish and started to fly away. Then, as the eagle flew over the green a big flash of lightning hit the eagle. Well, the eagle dropped the fish and as the fish fell on the green, the ball rolled out of his mouth and into the hole.Then Jesus shouted, ""Dad! If you do that again,I'm going to stop inviting you to play golf with us!""</p>

"
31627,"<p>For my birthday this year my wife purchased me a week of private lessons at<br /> the local health club. Though still in great shape from when I was on the<br /> varsity chess team in high school, I decided it was a good idea to go ahead and<br /> try it. I called and made reservations with someone named Tanya, who said she is<br /> a 26-year-old aerobics instructor and athletic clothing model. My wife seemed<br /> very pleased with how enthusiastic I was to get started. They suggested I keep<br /> an ""exercise diary"" to chart my progress. </p>
<p>Day 1. Started the morning at 6:00 AM. Tough to get up, but worth it when I<br /> arrived at the health club and Tanya was waiting for me. She's something of a<br /> goddess, with blond hair and a dazzling white smile. She showed me the machines<br /> and took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill. She seemed a little<br /> alarmed that it was so high, but I think just standing next to her in that<br /> outfit of hers added about ten points. Enjoyed watching the aerobics class.<br /> Tanya was very encouraging as I did my sit ups, though my gut was already aching<br /> a little from holding it in the whole time I was talking to her. This is going<br /> to be GREAT. </p>
<p>Day 2. Took a whole pot of coffee to get me out the door, but I made it. Tanya<br /> had me lie on my back and push this heavy iron bar up into the air. Then she<br /> puts weights on it, for heaven's sake! Legs were a little wobbly on the<br /> treadmill, but I made it a full mile. Her smile made it all worth while. Muscles<br /> ALL feel GREAT. </p>
<p>Day 3. The only way I can brush my teeth is by laying the toothbrush on the<br /> counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I am certain that I have<br /> developed a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was OK as long as I didn't try to<br /> steer. I parked on top of a Volkswagen. Tanya was a little impatient with me and<br /> said my screaming was bothering the other club members. The treadmill hurt my<br /> chest so I did the stair monster. Why would anyone invent a machine to simulate<br /> an activity rendered obsolete by the invention of elevators? Tanya told me<br /> regular exercise would make me live longer. I can't imagine anything worse. </p>
<p>Day 4. Tanya was waiting for me with her vampire teeth in a full snarl. I<br /> can't help it if I was half an hour late. It took me that long just to tie my<br /> shoes. She wanted me to life dumbbells. Not a chance, Tanya. The word ""dumb""<br /> must be in there for a reason. I hid in the men's room until she sent Lars<br /> looking for me. As punishment she made me try the rowing machine. It sank. </p>
<p>Day 5. I hate Tanya more than any human being has ever hated any other human<br /> being in the history of the world. If there was any part of my body not in<br /> extreme pain I would hit her with it. She thought it would be a good idea to<br /> work on my triceps. Well I have news for you Tanya I don't have triceps. And if<br /> you don't want dents in the floor, don't hand me any barbells. I refuse to<br /> accept responsibility for the damage. YOU went to sadist school. YOU are to<br /> blame. The treadmill flung me back into a science teacher, which hurt like<br /> crazy. Why couldn't it have been someone softer, like a music teacher, or social<br /> studies? </p>
<p>Day 6. Got Tanya's message on my answering machine, wondering where I am. I<br /> lacked the strength to use the TV remote so I watched eleven straight hours of<br /> the weather channel. </p>
<p>Day 7. Well, that's the week. Thank goodness that's over. Maybe next time my<br /> wife will give me something a little more fun, like a gift certificate for a<br /> root canal.</p>

<p>Ms Brooks had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry<br /> waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the<br /> situation was. </p>
<p>The principal told Ms Brooks he would give the boy a test and if he failed to<br /> answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first-grade and behave. </p>
<p>She agreed. </p>
<p>Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed </p>
<p>to take the test. </p>

31643,"<p>Three men get captured by cannibals on a tropical island. Before<br /> they are stripped of their skin to make canoes out of, they are<br /> given their choice of how to kill themselves. The first wishes<br /> to die quickly and painlessly, and shoots himself in the head.<br /> The second chooses to die slowly and somewhat euphoricly by<br /> drowning, and subsequently immerses himself in the lagoon until<br /> dead.

31649,"<p>Years ago while lying in my hammock and drinking JD from the bottle I noticed my cat dragging something under the fence. Upon inspection, to my dismay, I realized it was the next door neighbors' 10 year old daughter's rabbit. For years I had watch her come home from school and head straight out to its cage, free it and play with it in the yard.  I knew today would be no different and fearing for our cat, Cricket, I had to think fast. </p>
<p>The rabbit was quite dirty, as if it had put up quite a struggle, so I washed it off with the hose, combed it with the Dog brush and blew it dry with the leaf blower. Upon finishing its grooming I jumped the fence and replaced back in its cage hoping its death would be written off as ""natural causes"".</p>
<p>Back to the hammock and JD. </p>
<p>Within the hour the neighbour's Volvo pulled in as usual and out popped the little girl, and as usual she headed straight for the cage. Only this time she stopped about six feet away and screamed <strong>""DDDDDAAAADDDDDDDYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""</strong></p>
<p>Her father, panic sticken, stood looking at the cage. Being the good neighbour that I am I rushed to fence and asked if there was anything I could do.</p>
<p>Her father less than calmly blurted, ""What kind of sick individual would dig up a little girl's rabbit and put it back in it's cage?!""</p>

31651,"<p>A couple went to church every week, but every week without fail the husband would fall asleep during the sermon.</p>
<p>The wife, being embarrassed by her husband's loud snoring, decided to bring a needle to the next service with her and poke him when he nods off.</p>
<p>The next week when they were in church the husband, as always, fell asleep. When the preacher asked, 'Who created the Earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th?' The wife stuck her husband with the needle and he jumped up and exclaimed, 'Oh my God!' The preacher said, 'That's correct.' And the husband sat down mumbling to himself.</p>
<p>He soon fell asleep again and when the preacher got to the question, 'And who died on the cross to save us from eternal damnation?' The wife stuck her husband again and he jumped up and exclaimed, 'Jesus Christ!' And the preacher said, 'Right again.' With this the husband fell suspicious of his wife and decided to catch her in the act.</p>
<p>The husband pretended to fall asleep while keeping an eye on his wife when the preacher said, 'What did Mary say to Joseph after Jesus was born?'

<p>And I knew if I had the chance, </p>
<p>they could make my modem dance </p>
<p>with chats and GIFs and silly pick-up lines. </p>
<p>But, Help Desk phone calls made me shiver </p>
<p>with every busy they'd deliver. </p>
<p>Bad news on the front page, </p>
<p>A 19-hour outrage. </p>
<p>I can't remember if I cried </p>
<p>when I realized that Steve Case had lied. </p>

31675,"<p>Once upon a time there lived a prince and a princess that showed<br /> their love for each other all the time. There was also this<br /> wizard that hated seeing people in love, especially the prince<br /> and princess. One day he decided to put an end to it. The wizard<br /> turned the princess into a rose in the garden. But she was only<br /> a rose during the day and at night she turned back into a woman.<br /> So finally the wizard was happy.</p>
<p>After awhile the wizard noticed that the prince was letting his<br /> love (the princess) in the castle at night when she turned back<br /> into a human. The wizard was furious. So the next day he picked<br /> two roses plus the one rose the princess was turned into. He set<br /> them on a table and told the prince, ""If you can pick the rose<br /> that is your love then she will forever be a human. If you pick<br /> wrong she will forever be a rose in the garden"". The prince<br /> thought for awhile and picked the one all the way on the left.<br /> He was right and the princess turned back into a human and lived<br /> happily ever after with her prince.</p>
<p>Phew...now the question to this riddle: How did the prince now<br /> the left rose was his love?</p>
<p>The answer: He knew which one was her cause he remembered at<br /> night time he let her in the castle so she wouldn't have dew on<br /> her like the other two roses that were out in the garden all<br /> night.</p>

31727,"<p>A wealthy man decided to go on a safari in Africa. He took his<br /> faithful pet dog along for company. One day the dog starts<br /> chasing butterflies and before long he discovers that he is<br /> lost. So, wandering about he notices a leopard heading rapidly<br /> in his direction with the obvious intention of having lunch.</p>
<p>The dog thinks, ""Boyo, I'm in deep doo doo now."" (He was an<br /> Irish setter).... Then he noticed some bones on the ground close<br /> by, and immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his<br /> back to the approaching cat.</p>
<p>Just as the leopard is about to leap, the dog exclaims loudly,<br /> ""Man, that was one delicious leopard. I wonder if there are any<br /> more around here?"" </p>
<p>Hearing this the leopard halts his attack in mid stride, as a<br /> look of terror comes over him, and slinks away into the trees.<br /> ""Whew"", says the leopard. ""That was close. That dog nearly had<br /> me.""</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a<br /> nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and<br /> trade it for protection from the leopard. So, off he goes. But<br /> the dog saw him heading after the leopard with great speed, and<br /> figured that something must be up.</p>
<p>The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans<br /> and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The cat is<br /> furious at being made a fool of and says, ""Here monkey, hop on<br /> my back and see what's going to happen to that conniving<br /> canine."" </p>
<p>Now the dog sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back,<br /> and thinks, ""What am I going to do now?"" But instead of running,<br /> the dog sits down with his back to his attackers pretending he<br /> hasn't seen them yet. And just when they get close enough to<br /> hear, the dog says, ""Where's that monkey. I just can never trust<br /> him. I sent him off half an hour ago to bring me another<br /> leopard, and he's still not back!!""</p>

Janet responded, ""Just because I am aesthetically challenged (that's ""politically correct"" for ugly) doesn't mean I don't have to fight off unwelcome sexual advances."" Hillary asks, ""Well, how do you deal with the problem?"" ""Whenever I feel that a guy is getting ready to make a pass at me, I muster all my might and squeeze out the loudest, nastiest fart that I can"", says Janet. That night, Bill was already in bed with the lights out when Hillary slips into bed. She could hear him start to stir, and knew that he would be wanting some action. She had been saving her farts all day, and was ready for him. She tenses up her butt cheeks and forces out the most disgusting sounding fart you could imagine.

31730,"<p>A shipwrecked sailor spent several years on a deserted island. Then one morning he was thrilled to see a ship offshore and a smaller vessel pulling out toward him.

He said to read through these and let us know if you still want to be rescued.""</p>
"
31731,"<p>Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the, ""In-flight safety lecture"" and their other announcements a bit more entertaining.  Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:</p>
<p>1. From a Southwest Airlines employee.... ""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane...""</p>
<p>2. Pilot... ""Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land... it's a bit cold outside and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern.""</p>
<p>3. After landing: ""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.</p>
<p>4. As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella. WHOA!""</p>
<p>5. After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: ""Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted.""</p>
<p>6. From a Southwest Airlines employee... ""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. </p>
<p>In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love more.</p>
<p>7. Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you or your money more, than Southwest Airlines.""</p>
<p>8. ""Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments.""</p>
<p>9. ""As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.""</p>
<p>10. ""Last one off the plane must clean it.""</p>
<p>11. From the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry...  Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...!</p>
<p>12. Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach, the Captain had really fought to get the plane down. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA and announced, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate!""</p>
<p>13. Another flight Attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.""</p>
<p>14. An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile, and give them a ""Thanks for flying XYZ airline.""</p>
<p>He said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally, everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane. She said, ""Sonny, mind if I as you a question?""</p>
<p>""Why no, Ma'am,"" said the pilot, ""what is it?""</p>
<p>The little old lady said, ""Did we land or were we shot down?""</p>
<p>15. After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant came on with, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate. Once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.</p>
<p>16. Part of a Flight Attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today and the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of us here at US Airways.""</p>

31749,"<p>One spring day a stranger walked into a small town looking for a<br /> job. He met up with a farmer who hired him as a farmhand to help<br /> with the planting. On the way to the farm, which was thirty<br /> miles away, the farmer asked the stranger what his name was. The<br /> stranger said, ""My name is John, just plain John."" ""Everybody<br /> has a last name,"" the farmer said. ""I don't use my last name,<br /> because I am embarrassed of it,"" John said. Finally, after a lot<br /> of pushing about his name, John said ""My last name is<br /> Five-fingers-up-my-ass."" ""I'll just call you John,"" the farmer<br /> said.</p>
<p>When they got to the farm, the farmer introduced the new hired<br /> hand to his wife. Later that day while John was milking the<br /> cows, she asked her husband about John's last name. The farmer<br /> replied, ""Call him John, just plain John."" Her curiosity was not<br /> satisfied, however, so she went to the barn to try to find out<br /> what John's last name was. After much pleading, John finally<br /> said, ""I'll tell you my last name if you promise not to tell<br /> anyone even your husband."" ""I'll never tell anyone,"" she said.<br /> ""My last name is very embarrassing to me, it's Fuck-me-quick.""<br /> ""I'll just call you John,"" she said as her face turned red.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon the farmer's daughter came home from school<br /> and was introduced to John. The next day she was watching John<br /> while he did his work and asked him about his last name. After a<br /> great deal of pestering, he made her promise not to tell, and<br /> she agreed to keep quiet. ""My last name is Cunt-itches."" he<br /> said. ""I'll just call you John."" she said.</p>
<p>The summer went by with no problems with John's work. After the<br /> harvest that fall the wife said to her husband, ""Now that the<br /> crops are harvested, why don't we take a vacation for a couple<br /> of weeks. John can handle things here while we're gone."" The<br /> farmer agreed to talk to John about it that evening. That night<br /> the farmer talked to John and he agreed to watch the farm. The<br /> next day the family left. Two weeks passed and the farmer and<br /> his family returned. They found an empty house, all their<br /> valuables were gone, the cows were half starved and hadn't been<br /> milked in days. The farmer called the police, unfortunately John<br /> was not found.</p>
<p>Two years went by, the family replaced most of their belongings,<br /> and still no trace of John. One Fall day the farmer took his<br /> family to the horse races at the county fair. After a few<br /> minutes the daughter saw John on the other side of the track.<br /> She got her mother's attention and said, ""Mom, Cunt-itches,<br /> Cunt-itches."" ""Well, scratch it,"" her mother said. A few minutes<br /> later she noticed John and said to her husband, ""Fuck-me-quick,<br /> Fuck-me-quick."" He replied, ""Can't you wait until we get home?""<br /> Then he saw John. He stood up and yelled, ""I'll give twenty<br /> dollars to any man who can get Five-fingers-up-my-ass!"" Needless<br /> to say, John got away.</p>

31762,"<p>It was around noon time when a redneck family decided to take<br /> their brand new boat for a first time drive. They didn't want to<br /> go alone so they invited their neighbors. When the two couples<br /> arrived at the lake they carefully put the boat in the water.<br /> When they started to go they noticed the boat wouldn't move and<br /> it was making a loud roaring noise. No matter how much he pushed<br /> up on the throttle the boat still would not move. After about an<br /> hour of trying to figure out what was wrong the two couples<br /> idled over to a near by lake marina where they were for sure<br /> going to get help. They told them what was happening and asked<br /> if they could help. The boat mechanic checked the trim, that<br /> prop and all the instruments and nothing was wrong with them, so<br /> he decided to jump in the water and look under the boat. Within<br /> two seconds of him being under water he came up choking on water<br /> because he was laughing so hard. They asked him what was wrong<br /> and he said your boats still on the trailer.</p>

31763,"<p>There was this gas station in ""redneck country"" trying to increase its sales, so the owner put up a sign saying ""Free Sex with Fill-up."" </p>
<p>Soon a redneck customer pulled in, filled his tank, and then asked for his free sex.</p>
<p>The owner told him to pick a number from (1) to (10), and if he guessed correctly, he would get his free sex. </p>
<p>The buyer then guessed (8) and the proprietor said, ""No, you were close. The number was (7). Sorry, no free sex this time but maybe next time"".</p>
<p>Some time thereafter, the same man, along with his buddy this time, pulled in again for a fill-up, and again he asked for his free sex. </p>
<p>The proprietor again gave him the same story and asked him to guess the correct number. The man guessed (2) this time, and the proprietor said, ""Sorry, it was (3). You were close but no free sex this time"".</p>
<p>As they were driving away, the driver said to his buddy, ""I think that game is rigged and he doesn't give away free sex"". </p>
<p>The buddy replied, ""No, it's not rigged -- my wife won twice last week.""</p>

31764,"<p>A ten year-old Jewish boy was failing math. His parents tried everything from tutors to hypnosis; but to no avail.</p>
<p>Finally, at the insistence of a family friend, they decided to enroll their son in a private Catholic school.</p>
<p>After the first day, the boy's parents were surprised when he walked in after school with a stern, focused and very determined expression on his face. He went straight past them, right to his room and quietly closed the door.</p>
<p>For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room with math books strewn about his desk and the surrounding floor. He emerged long enough to eat, and after quickly cleaning his plate, went straight back to his room, closed the door and worked feverishly at his studies until bedtime.</p>
<p>This pattern of behavior continued until it was time for the first quarter's report card. The boy walked in with it unopened, laid it on the dinner table, and went straight to his room. Cautiously, his mother opened it and, to her amazement, she saw a large red 'A' under the subject of Math. Overjoyed, she and her husband rushed into their son's room, thrilled at his remarkable progress.</p>
<p>""Was it the nuns that did it?"" the father asked.<br /> The boy shook his head and said, ""No.""</p>
<p>""Was it the one-to-one tutoring? The peer-mentoring?""<br /> ""No.""<br /> ""The textbooks?  The teachers? The curriculum?""<br /> ""No"", said the son. </p>
<p>""On that first day, when I walked in the front door and saw that guy nailed to the Plus Sign, I KNEW they meant business!""</p>

31765,"<p>A blonde decides to try horse-back riding, even though she has had no<br /> lessons or prior experience. She mounts the horse unassisted and the<br /> horse<br /> immediately springs into motion.  It gallops along at a rhythmic and<br /> steady<br /> pace, but the blonde begins to slip in the saddle.  In terror, she grabs<br /> for<br /> the horse's mane, but she cannot seem to get a firm grip.  She tries to<br /> throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of<br /> the<br /> horse anyway.  The horse continues it's galloping pace, seemingly<br /> unaware of<br /> its slipping rider. Finally, giving up her frail grip, she leaps away<br /> from<br /> the horse to try to throw herself to safety.  Unfortunately, her foot<br /> becomes entangled in the stirrup and she is now at the mercy of the<br /> horse's<br /> pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground again and<br /> again.</p>
<p>As her head is being battered against the ground, she is mere moments<br /> away<br /> from unconsciousness when the Wal-Mart manager runs out to shut off the<br /> horse</p>

31766,"<p>It was the Spring of 1957 and Bobby went to pick up his date. When he got to the front door, the girl's father answered and invited him in.""Carrie's not ready yet, so why don't you have a seat?"" he said.""That's cool,"" said Bobby.Carrie's father asked Bobby what they were planning to do. Bobby replied politely, ""We'll probably just go to the soda shop or a movie."" Carrie's father responded, ""Why don't you two go out and screw? I hear all the kids are doing it.""Naturally, this comes as a quite a surprise to Bobby, so he asked Carrie's Dad to repeat it.""Yeah,"" said Carrie's father, ""Carrie really likes to screw; she'll screw all night if we let her!""Bobby's eyes lit up, and his plan for the evening was beginning to look pretty good.A few minutes later, Carrie came downstairs in her little poodle skirt and announced that she was ready to go. Almost breathless with anticipation, Bobby escorted his date out the front door. About 20 minutes later, Carrie rushed back into the house, slammed the door behind her, and screamed at her father, ""Daddy! It's called 'The Twist'!""</p>

31792,"<p>A beautiful young lady was a traveling sales person and her car broke down way out in the country. She checked the car as best she could but couldn't find what was wrong. It was starting to get dark so she decided she had better find shelter for the night.</p>
<p>She found a farm house a short distance up the road and knocked on the door. The farmer answered the door and asked her what she needed. She told the farmer that her car was broken down and she needed a place to stay for the night.</p>
<p>The Farmer told Her he only had two bedrooms, He and his wife used one and their 18 year old son use the other. The Farmer thought about it a minute and said my son went to town and won't be home until late and he has a big bed anyhow if you want you can sleep in his bed tonight. She thought to her self, Wow 18 year old dick tonight, and said to the</p>
<p>farmer that would be fine. </p>
<p>After a nice supper they all went to bed. She took all of her clothes off and lay spread eagle on the bed waiting for the boy. About three in the morning the boy comes in gets undressed and goes to bed. She waited a while, sure that he would be making advances, but</p>
<p>nothing happened. </p>
<p>After a little while she thought, Well maybe he's shy, so she said could you switch sides of the bed with me, thinking he may get her on the way over. </p>
<p>He got up and walked around and got into the bed on the other side. She lay there a little longer and decided to try it again. </p>
<p>Again, he got up and walked around and got into the bed on the other side. She figured there is only one way to make this hick understand, so she rolled over right on top of him and said ""OK now do you know what I want?"" </p>
<p>He said, ""Yeah, you want the whole damn bed.""</p>

<p>Well the man thought about it and finally blurted out, ""Give me a million dollars."" So the genie gave him a million dollars and his wife two million while reminding him of the ""one condition"".</p>
<p>Next the man said, "" I'd like a house on the east coast and a house on the west coast."" So the genie gave him his two houses and his wife four houses.</p>
<p>Finally the genie said, ""You have one wish remaining but remember, your wife gets double."" </p>
<p>So the man thought for nearly an hour about his final wish. Looking up at the genie hovering over the sand he said with a sly grin on his face, ""Ok Genie, I want you to beat me half to death.""</p>

All of our technicians are currently busy helping people who are even less competent than you, so please hold for the next available technician. The waiting time is now estimated at between fifteen minutes and eternity. </p>
<p>In order to expedite your call, please punch your 58-digit product identification number on to your telephone, followed by your product serial number, which can be found in a secret compartment inside your computer where, for security purposes, it is printed in the smallest typeface possible to prevent being seen. Please note that you made need a size 11 3/4 torx screwdriver which may only be available from your original equipment manufacturer. </p>
<p>Do that NOW! </p>
<p>Thank you again for calling Technical Support. We recommend that you sit at your computer, preferably turning it on at some point, and have at hand all your floppy disks, CD-ROM disks, computer manuals and original packing materials in order to allow the technician to aid you in the unlikely event that he ever gets to your call. </p>
<p>If you were an inconsiderate jerk -- we mean forgetful customer -- and threw away your original packing materials, please call the company that sent you the computer and ask them to resend you the empty box with the plastic bubbles, fake popcorn and the wasted paper advertising that they recycle. We will hold your place in line on the phone while you wait for your boxes to be delivered. (yeah right !) ... </p>
<p>It would also be helpful for you to refrain from sobbing while explaining your problem to the technician. Shouting obscene threats will cause you to be immediately disconnected and blackballed from further communication with Technical Support, not only from ours but that of every other electronics-related firm in the industrialized world. (we all talk you know)... </p>
<p>Thank you once again for calling Technical Support. In order to enable us to better assist you, it would be helpful to know more about you and your equipment. Have you called Technical Support before? If you have, please press the numeral ""one"" on your telephone touch pad. </p>
<p>If not, press the numeral ""two."" If you are not sure, using the letters on your touch pad, spell out the phrase: ""I am confused and despondent and quickly losing the will to live."" Once you have finished, hang up your phone and make arrangements to sell your computer because by the time the technician takes your call, it will be obsolete, and you will be too senile to use it anyway. ... </p>
<p>Thank you for calling Technical Support. Unfortunately, all of our technicians just went out for lunch. This means that to the estimated waiting time we gave you earlier, you may now add at least another two hours. </p>
<p>Thank you for calling Technical Support. Before talking to the technician about your problem and risking the possibility that you may be wasting his valuable time, please ask yourself the following questions: 1. If my monitor screen is dark, is it possible I have forgotten to plug in my computer? 2. Have I exhausted every possible means of help before utilizing the sacred, last-resort-only telephone option? 3. Have I sent a fax to Fast Fax Technical Support? 4. Have I consulted my manual? 5. Have I read the Read-Me notice on the floppy disk? 6. Have I called up my know-it-all geek cousin who I can't stand but who can probably fix this thing for me in under five minutes? 6. Have I given the central processing unit of my computer a good, solid whack? </p>
<p>If you can not honestly answer ""yes"" to all these questions, please get off the line immediately so that our overworked technicians can help those truly desperate customers whose suffering is so much greater than yours. You must be really be so bored that you have to call technical support just to have someone to speak to about geek stuff. ... </p>
<p>Thank you for calling Technical Support. You may not be aware that this week we are featuring a discount on a number of popular CD-ROM titles you may wish to purchase, such as the best-selling Porn Doubler, which allows you to access erotic material from the Internet twice as fast. If you would like to hear all 26,000 titles read to you, shout ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" into the telephone now. This will not cause you to lose your place in line for Technical Support; in fact it may jump you ahead of several other callers. ... </p>

<p>Thank you for calling Technical Support. Our electronic sensors indicate that you are about to slump over and die from a massive frustration attack combined with severe dehydration from lack of food and water. Before doing so, please take a moment to place your telephone receiver back in its base and switch off your computer so as not to wear down its internal battery. </p>
<p>As a non-living person, you will have no further need of Technical Support and so we regretfully must remove you from our list of registered product users. </p>

31818,"<p>There was a farmer who grew watermelons. He was doing pretty well, but he was disturbed by some local kids who would sneak into his watermelon patch at night and eat his watermelons. After some careful thought, he came up with a clever idea that he thought would scare the kids away for sure.<br /> He made up a sign and posted it in the field. The next day, the kids show up and they saw the sign which read: ""Warning! One of the watermelons in this field has been injected with cyanide."" </p>
<p>The kids ran off, made up their own sign and posted it next to the farmer's sign. When the farmer returned, he surveyed the field. He noticed that no watermelons are missing, but the sign next to his read: ""Now there are two!""</p>

31837,"<p>Never write a note or memo if you can phone or visit instead; everyone wants to talk whenever you're ready.Don't sit down to talk.  The acoustics are better the higher you are, and remember that most people are a bit deaf so speak up louder!Try to talk with _at least_ three people between you and your listener, so that they don't feel left out.The very best place for a conversation is in the corridor, beside someone else's desk.  If the corridor is full, try leaning against their cupboard or hanging over their screen.Never warn people of your approach by knocking on their desk or cupboard.  People love surprises, especially if they're busy.The best time to disturb someone is when they look thoughtful or are concentrating.  It's your _duty_ to give them a break now and again.To make sure that _you_ get regular breaks, never use a ""Do No Disturb"" sign. When other people use them they're only joking.Always hold meetings around a desk.  If you book a conference room everyone will think you've got something to hide.If the phone isn't answered after four rings, hang on. Someone will answer it eventually, and they might like a chat, too.Never divert calls if you're leaving your desk.  Your telephone could get into bad habits.Try to whistle, hum or tap your fingers while you work.  It is a comfort to others to know that you're still there.If you have to design the office layout, remember to leave lots of wide-open spaces so that we can see and hear each other right across the floor.</p>

When the same<br /> person once more answered, I yelled, ""You're a jackass!"" and<br /> hung up. Next to his phone number I wrote the word ""jackass"" and<br /> put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks when I was<br /> paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up. He would<br /> answer and I'd yell, ""You're a jackass!"" It always cheered me up.</p>
<p>Later in the year the phone company introduced caller ID. This<br /> was a real disappointment for me. I would have to stop calling<br /> the jackass. Then one day I had an idea. I dialed his number and<br /> heard his voice. ""Hello?""</p>
<p>I made up a name. ""Hi. This is the sales office of the telephone<br /> company and I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our<br /> new caller ID program."" He answered, ""No!"" and slammed down the<br /> receiver. I quickly called him back and said, ""That's because<br /> you're a jackass!""</p>
<p>The reason I'm taking the time to tell you this story is to show<br /> you how if there's ever anything bothering you, you can do<br /> something about it. Just dial 555-1212.</p>
<p>(Keep reading, it gets better.)</p>
<p>One day an old lady at the mall was really taking her time<br /> pulling out of her parking space. I didn't think she was ever<br /> going to leave. Finally, her car began to move ever so slowly<br /> and she began backing out. I backed up a little more to give her<br /> plenty of room. Great, I thought, she's finally leaving. All of<br /> a sudden this black Camero came flying up the parking aisle in<br /> the wrong direction and pulled into her space. I started honking<br /> my horn and yelling, ""You can't do that, buddy! I was here<br /> first!""</p>
<p>The guy got out of his Camero completely ignoring me. He walked<br /> toward the mall as if he didn't even hear me. I thought to<br /> myself, this guy is a jackass. There sure are a lot of jackasses<br /> in this world. I noticed he had a ""For Sale"" sign in the back<br /> window of his car. I wrote down the number. Then I hunted for<br /> another place to park.</p>
<p>The next day I was at home sitting at my desk. I had just gotten<br /> off the phone after calling 555-1212 and yelling, ""You're a<br /> jackass!"" (It's really easy to call him now since I have his<br /> number on speed dial.) Then I noticed the phone number of the<br /> guy with the black Camaro and decided to call him too. After a<br /> couple of rings someone answered the phone. I asked, ""Are you<br /> the man with the black Camaro for sale?""</p>
<p>""Yes.""</p>
<p>""Can you tell me where I can see it?""</p>
<p>""Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house and<br /> the car is parked right out front.""</p>
<p>I asked, ""What's your name?""</p>
<p>""My name is Don Hansen.""</p>
<p>""When's a good time to catch you, Don?""</p>
<p>""I'm home in the evenings.""</p>
<p>""Listen, Don, can I tell you something?""</p>
<p>""Sure.""</p>
<p>""Don, you're a jackass!"" And I slammed the phone down. </p>
<p>After I hung up I added Don's number to my speed dialer. Now I<br /> had two jackasses to call whenever I had a bad day. However this<br /> wasn't as much fun as it used to be. So I thought about it and<br /> came up with a solution.</p>
<p>First, I had my phone dial jackass #1. The man answered nicely<br /> and I yelled, ""You're a jackass!"" But I didn't hang up.</p>
<p>The jackass said, ""Are you still there?""</p>
<p>I said, ""Yeah.""</p>
<p>He said, ""Stop calling me.""</p>
<p>I said, ""No!""</p>
<p>He said, ""What's your name, pal?""</p>
<p>I said, ""Don Hansen.""</p>
<p>He said, ""Where do you live?""</p>
<p>""1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house and my black Camaro<br /> is parked out front.""</p>
<p>""I'm coming over right now, Don. You'd better start saying your<br /> prayers.""</p>
<p>""Yeah, like I'm really scared, Jackass!"" And I hung up.</p>
<p>Then I called Jackass #2. He answered, ""Hello.""</p>
<p>I said, ""Hello, jackass!""</p>
<p>He said, ""If I ever find out who you are...""</p>
<p>""You'll what?""</p>
<p>""I'll kick your butt.""</p>
<p>""Well, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now, jackass!""</p>
<p>And I hung up. Then I picked up the phone and called the police.<br /> I told them I was at 1802 West 34th Street and that I was going<br /> to kill my gay lover as soon as he got home. Another quick call<br /> to Channel 13 news about the gang war going down on West 34th<br /> Street. After that I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th<br /> Street to watch the whole thing. Glorious!</p>
<p>I watched two jackasses kicking the crap out of each other in<br /> front of 6 squad cars and a police helicopter I also taped it<br /> off the evening news!</p>

""I want you each to keep your eye on this antique watch. It's a very special watch. Its been in my family for six generations."" He began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting, ""Watch the watch, watch the watch, watch the watch....""The crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, light gleaming off its polished surface. Hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch, until suddenly it slipped from the hypnotist's fingers and fell to the floor, breaking into a hundred pieces. ""Shit"" said the hypnotist.It took three weeks to clean up the theater.</p>

31846,"<p>Dear Tide, I have always used your product ever since my college days, because mom says it was the best. One weekend about a month ago, I was at my girlfriend's place, wearing my new white shirt. Much to my chagrin, I spilled some red wine on my white shirt. She made a comment about my drinking problem, one thing lead to another, and soon I had her blood all over my not-so-nice white shirt. I tried washing it with her detergent, and it just didn't do the trick. So, on my way home, I stopped at the store and picked up a box of new Ultra Tide. It washed the stain so well that the DNA tests were entirely inconclusive! I can't praise your product enough. Thank you for saving my life! I must go now. I also have to send my praise to the makers of Hefty garbage bags... Thanks again! John Smith</p>

Unfortunately, they chose to discontinue their correspondence at that point. I have heard, however, that their recruitment letter has been revised and is far less snotty than it once was.<br /> April 18, 1994</p>
<p>Mr. John T. Mongan 123 Main Street Smalltown, California 9;;;;,-;;;;,</p>
<p>Dear John:</p>
<p>You've got the grades. You've certainly got the PSAT scores. And now you've got a letter from MIT. Maybe you're surprised. Most students would be.</p>
<p>But you're not most students. And that's exactly why I urge you to consider carefully one of the most selective universities in America.</p>
<p>The level of potential reflected in your performance is a powerful indicator that you might well be an excellent candidate for MIT. It certainly got my attention!</p>
<p>Engineering's not for you? No problem. It may surprise you to learn we offer more than 40 major fields of study, from architecture to brain and cognitive sciences, from economics (perhaps the best program in the country) to writing.</p>
<p>What? Of course, you don't want to be bored. Who does? Life here is tough and demanding, but it's also fun. MIT students are imaginative and creative - inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<p>You're interested in athletics? Great! MIT has more varsity teams - 39 - than almost any other university, and a tremendous intramural program so everybody can participate.</p>
<p>You think we're too expensive? Don't be too sure. We've got surprises for you there, too.</p>
<p>Why not send the enclosed Information Request to find out more about this unique institution? Why not do it right now?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael C. Benhke Director of Admissions</p>

<p>Michael C. Behnke MIT Director of Admissions Office of Admissions, Room 3-108 Cambridge MA 02139-;;;;,</p>
<p>Dear Michael:</p>
<p>You've got the reputation. You've certainly got the pomposity. And now you've got a letter from John Mongan. Maybe you're surprised. Most universities would be.</p>
<p>But you're not most universities. And that's exactly why I urge you to carefully consider one of the most selective students in America, so selective that he will choose only one of the thousands of accredited universities in the country.</p>
<p>The level of pomposity and lack of tact reflected in your letter is a powerful indicator that your august institution might well be a possibility for John Mongan's future education. It certainly got my attention!</p>
<p>Don't want Bio-Chem students? No problem. It may surprise you to learn that my interests cover over 400 fields of study, from semantics to limnology, from object-oriented programming (perhaps one of the youngest professionals in the country) to classical piano.</p>
<p>What? Of course you don't want egotistical jerks. Who does? I am self indulgent and over confident, but I'm also amusing. John Mongan is funny and amusing - whether you're laughing with him or at him.</p>
<p>You're interested in athletes? Great! John Mongan has played more sports - 47 - than almost any other student, including oddball favorites such as Orienteering.</p>
<p>You think I can pay for your school? Don't be too sure. I've got surprises for you there, too.</p>
<p>Why not send a guaranteed admission and full scholarship to increase your chance of being selected by John Mongan? Why not do it right now?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>John Mongan</p>
<p>P.S. If you'd like a copy of a fun-filled, fact-filled brochure, ""John Mongan: What a Guy!"" just ask.</p>

31963,"<p>At a recent COMDEX, Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with<br /> the auto industry and stated: ""If GM had kept up with technology like the<br /> computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got<br /> 1000 miles to the gallon.""<br /> In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating<br /> (by Mr. Welch himself):<br /> If GM had developed technology like Microsoft; we would all be driving cars<br /> with the following characteristics:<br /> 1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day.<br /> 2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new<br /> car.<br /> 3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would<br /> just accept this restart and drive on.<br /> . 4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your<br /> car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to<br /> reinstall the engine.<br /> 5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought ""Car95"" or<br /> ""CarNT."" But then you would have to buy more seats.<br /> 6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five<br /> times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five percent of<br /> the roads.<br /> 7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced<br /> by a single ""general car default"" warning light.<br /> 8. The airbag system would say, ""Are you sure?"" before going off.<br /> 9. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and<br /> refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the<br /> key, and grab hold of the radio antenna.<br /> 10. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand<br /> McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor<br /> want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's<br /> performance to diminish by 50% or more.<br /> Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice<br /> Department.<br /> 11. Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to<br /> drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same<br /> manner as the old car.<br /> 12. You'd press the ""start"" button to shut off the engine.</p>

31970,"<p>One day I recieved a letter from grandma...</p>
<p>The other day I went up to a local Christian bookstore and saw a ""honk if you love Jesus"" bumper sticker. I was feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting, so I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper. Boy, I'm glad I did! What an uplifting experience followed! </p>
<p>I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is and I didn't notice that the light had changed. It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed! I found that LOTS of people love Jesus! </p>
<p>While I was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, ""For the love of GOD! GO! GO! Jesus Christ, GO!"" What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus! Everyone started honking! I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people. I even honked my horn a few times to share in the love! </p>
<p>There must have been a man from Florida back there because I heard him yelling something about a ""sunny beach"". I saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant, he said that it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or someething. Well, I've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. My grandson burst out laughing. He was enjoying this religious experience, too!</p>
<p>A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I atttended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed. </p>
<p>So, I waved to all my sisters and brothers grinning, and drove on through the intersection. I noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and I felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared, so I slowed the car down, leaned out of the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away. </p>
<p>Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks! </p>
