23004,"<p>Whether the cause is a previous night of drinking or a big lunch, the outcome is the same: Farts. Seventy percent of the time, we can dispense freely. The other 30% of the time, such as at work, we have some tough decisions to make. This document is intended to help you in those decisions. Holders - The obvious choice is just plain holding it in. A popular choice among the females and an almost impossible choice for males. I am not in favor of holding, as I believe the medical community has not done enough research about the long-term damage of holding. Really, where does it go if you hold it in? So be forewarned, using this tactic is to be done at your own risk. Desk Jockey - When deciding to release right at your desk, one has many factors to consider: - Do you have your own office? Feel free to fart at will risk free. After commencing, I highly recommend locking the door and feigning you are not in the office to avoid any unwanted visitors. I also highly recommend against spraying air freshener, as the smell of the freshener is a dead giveaway. Candles are a good alternative solution for the females. - Are you seated at a cubicle or open desk? If so, one has to consider the proximity of the other workers and the density of workers in the area. If it is just you and one other person in the area, there is nowhere to place the blame. If others are fairly distant to you, the smell will dissipate by the time it reaches the others on all but the most egregious of days. There is always the chance of dispensing at higher decibels than anticipated due to the highly unstable nature of farts. In these most unfortunate situations, you will have to use cover up sounds such as scraping your heal on the floor. I recommend practicing making sounds covering a wide range of tones and pitches in anticipation of such an event. Dropping objects such as staplers, binders and tape may not produce a similar sound, but if done in rapid succession could distract others from the initial event. Meetings: - Sometimes the urge strikes at the most inopportune time. Meetings and gas really do not mix. Releasing at a meeting is by far the trickiest of all the situations one could find oneself in. Although I am against holding in general, a meeting may be the time for it. It really depends if you have established baseline farts before the meeting. This will give you a sense of the decibel and scent level of what is to be expected. Warning: Do not ever use a meeting as the place to establish a baseline. Of course none of the above applies if you are meeting with vendors. You have free reign to do whatever you like. Aisle Walker: - Releasing while walking around the office is a popular option. By the time the scent disseminates, you should be nowhere near the scene of the incident. The added benefit is that if the release is done at higher decibels than anticipated, you can break out into an all out sprint thereby fleeing the scene before others even look up to notice. Broom Closet: - One option is to find a broom closet and release inside the closet. The only drawback is explaining why you were in the broom closet if you are caught entering or leaving the closet. I found stashing stationery supplies in the closet provides a nice excuse. People will love you for informing them about the backup stationery supply cabinet. Of course, you then have to find another closet, as your original place will become too risky.And remember, if you're workplace has many open flames, you are on your own.</p>

Instead of going home, however, he squandered the entire weekend (and his paycheck) partying with the boys.When he finally returned home on Sunday night, he ran into a barrage of epithets from his furious wife. After a couple of hours of nagging and berating, his wife asked, ""How would you like it if you didn't see me for a couple of days?""""That would suit me just fine"" he replied.Monday went by, and the man didn't see his wife. Tuesday and Wednesday came and went, with the same result. Come Thursday, the swelling had gone down a bit and he could see her, just a little, out of the corner of his left eye.</p>

23023,"<p>An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully. From morning<br /> till night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about something.<br /> The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing with his old mule.<br /> He tried to plow a lot.</p>
<p>One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field. He<br /> drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his<br /> lunch. Immediately, his wife began haranguing him again. Complain, nag, nag; it<br /> just went on and on. </p>
<p>All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet; caught her smack<br /> in the back of the head. Killed her dead on the spot. </p>
<p>At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd.<br /> When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a<br /> minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him,<br /> he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement. This was so<br /> consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it. </p>
<p>So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why<br /> he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and<br /> disagreed with all the men. </p>
<p>The old farmer said: ""Well, the women would come up and say something about<br /> how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in<br /> agreement."" </p>
<p>""And what about the men?"" the minister asked. </p>
<p>""They wanted to know if the mule was for sale.""</p>

23035,"<p>Tired of constantly being broke, and stuck in an unhappy marriage, a young<br /> husband decided to solve both problems by taking out a large insurance<br /> policy on his wife (with himself as the beneficiary), and arranging to<br /> have her killed. A ""friend of a friend"" put him in touch with a nefarious<br /> underworld figure, who went by the name of Artie.</p>
<p>Artie explained to the husband that his going price for snuffing out a<br /> spouse was $5,000. The husband said he was willing to pay that amount, but<br /> that he wouldn't have any cash on hand until he could collect his wife's<br /> insurance money. Artie insisted on being paid SOMETHING up front. The man<br /> opened up his wallet, displaying the single dollar bill that rested<br /> inside. Artie sighed, rolled his eyes, and reluctantly agreed to accept<br /> the dollar as down payment for the dirty deed.</p>
<p>A few days later, Artie followed the man's wife to the local supermarket<br /> grocery section store. There, he surprised her in the produce department,<br /> and proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands. As the poor<br /> unsuspecting woman drew her last breath and slumped to the floor, the<br /> manager of the produce department stumbled unexpectedly onto the scene.<br /> Unwilling to leave any witnesses behind, Artie had no choice but to<br /> strangle the produce manager as well. Unknown to Artie, the entire<br /> proceedings were captured by hidden cameras and observed by the store's<br /> security guard, who immediately called the police.</p>
<p>Artie was caught and arrested before he could leave the store. Under<br /> intense questioning at the police station, Artie revealed the sordid plan,<br /> including his financial arrangements with the hapless husband.</p>
<p>And that is why, the next day in the newspaper, the headline declared,<br /> ""ARTIE CHOKES TWO FOR A DOLLAR AT SUPERMARKET.""</p>

<p>Probably Dexatrim abuse, maybe some amphetamines. Who is that skinny?! she might even be anorexic, she IS always giving her burger to her friend. One side question, what the hell are Popey and Brutus thinking? They almost made the list for courting her. </p>

<p>He openly admits it. The other dwarfs deny involvement but they are under investigations. Allegations that Doc is writing some extra scripts for Sneezy and all the guys are partaking are afloat. </p>
<p>2. Daffy Duck </p>
<p>If he isn't using crack, Merion Barry is clean. He is so wired he bounces around on his head without pain. Blows his beak off all the time. Some symptoms might be from ""daffiness"" but Haldol wouldn't work for him. Might for his buddy with Tourettes, Porky though. </p>
<p>1. Shaggy </p>
<p>By far the #1 suspect. His clothes, his hair, his bad goatee, the boy converses with dogs. But all of this is nothing until you go to the Munchie Factor. Anybody who averages 9.3 dog treats consumed per episode does pot. And Look at the way him and his friends painted that van!</p>

Then he looked back at the lock, and<br /> quickly turned to the final number, and opened the lock.<br /> The teacher was amazed. ""I'm in awe at your faith, pastor,"" she said.<br /> ""It's really nothing,"" he answered. ""The number is on a piece of tape on the<br /> ceiling.""</p>

<p>A priest was driving along and saw a nun on the side of the road, he stopped<br /> and offered her a lift which she accepted. She got in and crossed her legs,<br /> forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg. The priest had a look and<br /> nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthfully slid his hand<br /> up her leg. The nun looked at him and immediately said, 'Father, remember psalm<br /> 129?' The priest was flustered and apologized profusely. He forced himself to<br /> remove his hand. However, he was unable to remove his eyes from her leg. Further<br /> on while changing gear, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once<br /> again Said, 'Father, remember psalm 129?' Once again the<br /> priest`apologized.'Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.'</p>
<p>Arriving at the convent, the nun got out gave him a meaningful glance and<br /> went<br /> on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to retrieve a<br /> bible and looked up psalm 129. It Said, 'Go forth and seek, further up, you will<br /> find glory.'</p>

<p>To a 2-L jacketed round reactor vessel (reactor #1) with an<br /> overall heat transfer coefficient of about 100 Btu/F-ft2-hr, add<br /> ingredients one, two and three with constant agitation. In a<br /> second 2-L reactor vessel with a radial flow impeller operating<br /> at 100 rpm, add ingredients four, five, six, and seven until the<br /> mixture is homogenous. To reactor #2, add ingredient eight,<br /> followed by three equal volumes of the homogenous mixture in<br /> reactor</p>
<p>#1. Additionally, add ingredient nine and ten slowly, with<br /> constant agitation. Care must be taken at this point in the<br /> reaction to control any temperature rise that may be the result<br /> of an exothermic reaction.</p>
<p>Using a screw extrude attached to a #4 nodulizer, place the<br /> mixture piece-meal on a 316SS sheet (300 x 600 mm). Heat in a<br /> 460K oven for a period of time that is in agreement with Frank &amp;<br /> Johnston's first order rate expression (see JACOS, 21, 55), or<br /> until golden brown. Once the reaction is complete, place the<br /> sheet on a 25C heat-transfer table, allowing the product to come<br /> to equilibrium.</p>

<p>He was buying some fishing hooks and I told him that he would probably need some stronger line to go with those hooks. He agreed but before he left I suggested he bought a new rod to go with his new line and hooks. And to my surprise he bought it as well. So I thought I would try to sell him a boat so that he could go out and catch some big fish. After deciding on the boat he realized that his car wouldn?t be able to tow the boat so I showed him the new truck we had and he bought that as well. By the time he had walked out his total was $39562. </p>

<p>So, the bartender says ""47 seconds�. The man says, ""OK, when I say go,<br /> start your watch. Go!"" The alligator opens its mouth Wide, while the bartender<br /> watches his mouth.

<p>There IS a code of Restroom Etiquette"" that MUST be followed. ===============================================</p>
<p>The following is the urinal configuration in a sample men's room. An X above the number will indicate ""in use."" </p>
<p>(Sample): </p>
<p>~~ ~~ ~~ x ~~ ~~ ~~ x ~~ </p>
<p>(Indicates that urinals 3 and 6 ~~ 1 ~~ 2 ~~ 3 ~~ 4 ~~ 5 ~~ 6 ~~ are occupied.) </p>
<p>------------------------- </p>
<p>You are to identify correctly, based on urinal etiquette, at which stall you are to stand. Good luck! </p>
<p>1.) ~~ ~~ x ~~ ~~ x ~~ ~~ ~~ (Urinals 2 and 4 occupied.) </p>
<p>~~ 1 ~~ 2 ~~ 3 ~~ 4 ~~ 5 ~~ 6 ~~ </p>
<p>Your choice: ___ </p>
<p>Correct answer: 6 It's the ONLY one to go to and every guy instinctively knows this. </p>
<p>=============================================== </p>
<p>2.) ~~ x ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ (Urinal 1 occupied.) </p>
<p>~~ 1 ~~ 2 ~~ 3 ~~ 4 ~~ 5 ~~ 6 ~~ </p>
<p>Your choice: ___ </p>
<p>Correct answer: 6 Stall 5 is acceptable, but you run a greater risk of being next to someone who arrives later. </p>
<p>===============================================</p>
<p>3.) ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ (empty) </p>
<p>~~ 1 ~~ 2 ~~ 3 ~~ 4 ~~ 5 ~~ 6 ~~ </p>
<p>Your choice: __ </p>
<p>Correct answer: 1 or 6 You are tacitly saying, ""I don't want anyone next to me."" </p>
<p>=============================================== </p>
<p>4.) ~~ ~~ x ~~ ~~ x ~~ ~~ x ~~ (2, 4 and 6 occupied) </p>
<p>~~ 1 ~~ 2 ~~ 3 ~~ 4 ~~ 5 ~~ 6 ~~ </p>
<p>Your choice: ___ </p>
<p>Correct answer: 1 You're stuck being next to at least ONE guy, so you minimize the impact and get a wall on your left. NEVER go between TWO guys if you can help it. Exceptions to this are stadium restrooms where the herd thunders in. </p>
<p>=============================================== </p>
<p>5.) ~~ ~~ x ~~ ~~ ~~ x ~~ x ~~ (2, 5 and 6 occupied) </p>
<p>~~ 1 ~~ 2 ~~ 3 ~~ 4 ~~ 5 ~~ 6 ~~ </p>
<p>Your choice: __ </p>
<p>Correct answer: 4 Believe it or not, 1 and 3 ""couples"" you with the guy in stall 2. And we wouldn't want THAT now, would we? This differs from question 4 in such a subtle way that the nuances cannot be explained. Suffice to say, only we men would understand! </p>
<p>=============================================== </p>
<p>6.) ~~ x ~~ x ~~ ~~ ~~ x ~~ x ~~ (1, 2, 5 and 6 occupied) </p>
<p>~~ 1 ~~ 2 ~~ 3 ~~ 4 ~~ 5 ~~ 6 ~~ </p>
<p>Your choice: ___ </p>
<p>Correct answer: NONE! You go to the mirror and pretend to comb your hair or straighten a tie until the urinals ""open up"" a bit more. If you have to go REAL, REAL BAD, for god's sake! ... use a doored stall. =============================================== </p>
<p>Other parts of the Unwritten Code of the Urinals: </p>
<p>-- NO Talking, unless it's a good friend... but even then, keep it terse and unemotional. This ain't no clubhouse. </p>
<p>-- I don't think I need to tell you, absolutely NO touching of anyone other than yourself. A touch of another's elbow is of the highest offense. </p>
<p>-- NO Singing. Period. </p>
<p>-- Glances are for purposes of acknowledgment only...""Yeah, I see you there. I will not look again"".</p>

23093,"<p>One day many years ago, a fisherman's wife blessed her husband with twin sons.<br /> They loved the children very much, but couldn't think of what to name their<br /> children. Finally, after several days, the fisherman said, ""Let's not decide on<br /> names right now. If we wait a little while, the names will simply occur to us.""<br /> After several weeks had passed, the fisherman and his wife noticed a peculiar<br /> fact. When left alone, one of the boys would always turn towards the sea, while<br /> the other boy would face inland. It didn't matter which way the parents<br /> positioned the children, the same child always faced the same direction. ""Let's<br /> call the boys towards and Away,"" suggested the fisherman. His wife agreed, and<br /> from that point on, the boys were simply known as TOWARDS and AWAY.<br /> The years passed and the lads grew tall and strong. The day came when the<br /> aging fisherman said to his sons, ""Boys, it is time that learned how to make a<br /> living from the sea."" They provisioned their ship, said their good-byes, and set<br /> sail for a three month voyage.<br /> The three months passed quickly for the fisherman's wife, yet the ship had not<br /> returned. Another three months passed, and still no ship. Three whole years<br /> passed before the grieving woman saw a lone man walking towards her house. She<br /> recognized him as her husband. ""My goodness! What has happened to my darling<br /> boys?"" she cried.<br /> The ragged fisherman began to tell his story:<br /> ""We were just barely one whole day out to see when towards hooked into a great<br /> fish. Towards fought long and hard, but the fish was more than his equal. For a<br /> whole week they wrestled upon the waves without either of them letting up. Yet<br /> eventually the great fish started to win the battle, and towards was pulled over<br /> the side of our ship. He was swallowed whole, and we never saw either of them<br /> again.""<br /> ""Oh dear, that must have been terrible! What a huge fish that must of<br /> been! What a horrible fish. What a horrible fish.""<br /> ""Yes, it was, but you should have seen the one that got Away....""</p>
"
23094,"<p>A bloke in Australia walks up to the bar with a big ostrich<br /> behind him, and as he sits, a small cat jumps up on the stool<br /> beside him. The barman comes over, regarding the trio with some<br /> curiosity, and says, ""What'll it be?"" The man says, ""I'll have a<br /> pint"", and turns to the ostrich, ""What's yours?"" ""I'll have a<br /> pint as well."" says the ostrich. Bloke looks at the cat, and<br /> says, ""I suppose you want a drink, too."" The cat replies, ""I'll<br /> have a half, but I ain't payin'!"" So the barman pulls two and a<br /> half pints, and says, ""That'll be three pounds forty, please.""<br /> The man reaches into his pocket, feels around, and, to the<br /> barman's surprise, pulls out exactly the three-forty in change.</p>
<p>A while later, the same thing happens, and the man pulls the<br /> exact amount out of the same pocket. The next day, the man, the<br /> ostrich, and the cat return to the same bar. ""I'll have a pint,""<br /> says the man. ""Same for me,"" says the ostrich. The cat orders up<br /> a half and says, ""But I ain't payin'!"" Repeat of yesterday. The<br /> bloke pays each time with the exact amount from his pocket.</p>
<p>This becomes almost a regular routine until, late one evening,<br /> the trio enter again. ""The same?"" asks the barman. ""Well,"" says<br /> the man, ""it's close to last orders. I'll have a large scotch.""<br /> He turns to the ostrich enquiringly. The bird says, ""I'll have a<br /> large scotch as well."" The cat says, ""I'll have a small<br /> scotch...but I ain't payin'!"" The barman rings up the drinks and<br /> turns, with a sly grin, ""That'll be seven pounds twenty,<br /> please."" To his amazement, the man pulls the exact seven and<br /> twenty out of his pocket.</p>
<p>As the trio are finishing their drinks, the barman can't contain<br /> his curiosity any longer. ""Excuse me, sir, but before you leave<br /> there's something I must know...how do you manage to always come<br /> up with the exact change out of your pocket...every time?""<br /> ""Well"", says the man, ""it's a long story. But basically, several<br /> years ago I took care of an old lady well into her nineties, and<br /> when she died, she left me her old house. Nothing special, but<br /> as I was cleaning out the attic, I found an old lamp, and when I<br /> rubbed it, this genie appeared and offered me two wishes.""<br /> ""That's fantastic,"" says the barkeep, ""What did you wish for?""</p>
<p>""If I ever need to pay for anything, I just put my hand in my<br /> pocket and the right money will always be there."" ""That's<br /> brilliant,"" says the barman, ""most people would wish for a<br /> million pounds or something, but you'll always be as rich as you<br /> want for as long as you live."" ""That's right, whether its a<br /> quart of milk or even a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always<br /> there. The best thing I ever did!"" </p>
<p>As he turns to go, the barman calls him back and says, ""One last<br /> thing, sir... err, your friends there... we don't get many cats<br /> or ostriches drinkin' in here...?"" The man looks glum. ""Yes, I<br /> know. That's probably the worst thing I ever did, but I'm stuck<br /> with 'em. You see, for my second wish from the genie, I asked<br /> for a chick with long legs and a tight pussy.""</p>

Namely, how did the sperm get into the woman?The mom asked the boy what he thought the answer was. The boy said that the sperm is manufactured in the man's stomach, it rises up to his chest, then throat, and into his mouth whereupon he kisses the woman and deposits the sperm into her mouth.The mom told her boy that that was a good guess, but wrong. She said that she would give him a hint...that the sperm came out of the man's penis.Suddenly, the boy's face became quite red and he said, ""YOU MEAN YOU PUT YOUR MOUTH ON THAT THING!!??""</p>

While he is gone, one of the others sparks up a conversation about his son.He says, ""I was afraid to think of my son's future when he was working as a secretary for a Real estate agency, but when he left that job, he started his own agency, and he's so rich now, that he gave his best friend a new house for his birthday!""Another man says, ""I thought my son was going nowhere when he had a job getting coffee for a stockbroker, but when he left that job, he started playing the market, and now he's so rich, he gave his best friend a million dollars in stock for his birthday!""Another man says, ""I thought my son wasn't going anywhere with his job as a secretary in a car dealership, but now he owns his own dealership, and he gave his best friend a new Mercedes for his birthday!""The fourth man returned from the bathroom, and they asked him about his son.The fourth man replied, ""Well, I fear for my son's future because he's a hair stylist, and last year, I found out that he was gay, but, on the plus side, his four boyfriends gave him a new house, a million in stock, and a Mercedes for his birthday.""</p>

23107,"<p>A man went to the nursing home to visit his grandfather. ""How<br /> are they treating you, grandfather?"" he asked. ""Fine!"" came the<br /> reply, ""The nurses here are really nice."" ""How is the food?""<br /> ""Good!"" ""Are you sleeping well, grandfather?"" ""Oh, yes I sleep<br /> nine hours a night. </p>
<p>Every night they bring me a glass of milk and a viagara.""<br /> Worried, the grandson asked the administrators why he was given<br /> viagara. ""We give him a glass of warm milk to help him sleep. We<br /> give him viagara to keep him from rolling out of bed.""</p>

23108,"<p>An old man and his wife have gone to bed.<br /> After laying there a few minutes the old man farts and says,""Seven Points.""</p>
<p>His wife rolls over and says, ""What in the world was that?""<br /> The old man replied, ""It's fart football!""</p>
<p>A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says -<br /> ""Touchdown, tie score!"" </p>
<p>After about five minutes the old man farts again and says -<br /> ""Touchdown, I'm ahead 14 to 7!""</p>
<p>Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, -<br /> ""Touchdown, tie score!""<br /> Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says -<br /> ""Fieldgoal, I lead 17 to 14!"" </p>
<p>Now the pressures on and the old man refuses to get beat by a woman so he strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally unacceptable he gives it everything he has but instead of farting he poops the bed.</p>
<p>The wife looks and says, ""What the heck was that?""</p>
<p>The old man replied, ""Half-time, Switch sides!""</p>

<p>Dear Wife:</p>
<p>You must realize that now you are 54 years old, and I have certain needs which you are no longer able to satisfy. I am otherwise happy with you as a wife, and I sincerely hope you will not be hurt or offended to learn that by the time you receive this letter, I will be at the Grand Hotel with my 18 year old teaching assistant. I'll be home before midnight. </p>
<p>Your Husband,</p>
<p>Professor Malone</p>

<p>When he arrived at the hotel, there was a faxed letter waiting for him that read as follows:</p>

<p>Dear Husband:</p>
<p>You, too, are 54 years old and by the time you receive this letter, I will be at the Breakwater Hotel with the 18 year old pool boy. Since you are a mathematician, you will appreciate that 18 goes into 54 more times than 54 goes into 18. </p>

They unite in conjugal union and all goes well whereupon he takes his leave of her and she prepares to go to sleep for the night.After a few minutes there's a knock on the door and there the old guy is again ready for more action.  Somewhat surprised she consents to further coupling which is again successful after which the octogenarian bids her a fond good night and leaves.She is certainly ready for slumber at this point and is close to sleep for the second time when there is another knock at the door and there he is again fresh as a 25 year old and ready for more. Once again they do the horizontal boogie.  As they're laying in afterglow the young bride says to him, 'I am really impressed that a guy your age has enough juice to go for it three times.

<p>TRUMPETS: BOM! BOM! BOM-BOM BOM BOM BOM!</p>
<p>BOB COSTAS: Good evening, and as you can tell by the sound of the Olympic<br /> Theme Song that we play almost as much as we show Kerri Strug's historic<br /> vault, it's time for our broadcast of The Recently Videotaped Olympic<br /> Games Featuring Americans. We're going to start by taking you right to the<br /> track-and-field stadium, where the men's 100-meter dash is about to get<br /> under way, despite the fact that it actually happened 4 hrs ago.</p>
<p>TRACK COMMENTATOR:Bob, this promises to be an exciting race, featuring<br /> Americans.</p>
<p>COSTAS:And what are the obstacles that these Americans have overcome to<br /> create a Human Interest Factor for our broadcast?</p>
<p>TRACK COMMENTATOR: Bob, from left to right, they have overcome psoriasis,<br /> vertigo and a bad allergy to vinaigrette dressing.</p>
<p>COSTAS: We'll come back to the men's 100-meter final, but right now we're<br /> going to replay the video of Kerri Strug, an American,overcoming her ankle<br /> injury to make her courageous vault. (Kerri Strug vaults.)</p>
<p>COSTAS: What a human moment! Time for a commercial.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: We're IBM. We're a giant corporation with vast computer<br /> expertise That's why we're in charge of keeping track of all the<br /> statistics for these, the Olympic Games of 1953. Thank you.</p>
<p>BOM! BOM! BOM-BOM BOM BOM BOM!</p>
<p>COSTAS: Now we're going to take you to women's beach volleyball, where the<br /> sun is shining brightly despite the fact that it is now 10:37 p.m. on the<br /> East Coast.</p>
<p>BEACH VOLLEYBALL COMMENTATOR: Thanks, Bob. This is Holly McPeak, an<br /> American, and as you can see in this digitized, computer-enhanced,<br /> ultra-slow-motion Beach Cam closeup shot, she has overcome cellulite.</p>
<p>COSTAS: I'll say. When is she going to serve?</p>
<p>BEACH VOLLEYBALL COMMENTATOR: She'll be serving in about 4 seconds, Bob.</p>
<p>COSTAS: I'm sorry, but we don't have that kind of time, because we need to<br /> show this Heartwarming Moment. (Kerri Strug vaults.)</p>
<p>COSTAS: Now let's go out to the cycling competition, where I believe we<br /> have a race involving an American.</p>
<p>CYCLING COMMENTATOR: That is correct, Bob. We have an American shown here<br /> pedaling furiously in 637th place, with a solid chance to move up to 636th.</p>
<p>COSTAS: What obstacle has this American overcome?</p>
<p>CYCLING COMMENTATOR: Bob, he is overcoming one hellacious case of<br /> hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>COSTAS: We'll have more on that exciting cycling race, but right now we're<br /> going to return to the Olympic track stadium for an update on the men's<br /> 100-meter dash.</p>
<p>TRACK COMMENTATOR: Bob, the race started about two seconds ago and should<br /> be over in about eight more seconds. None of the Americans has fallen down.</p>
<p>COSTAS: We're going to break away from the men's 100-meter dash at this<br /> point, but we will be covering it throughout the course of the evening.<br /> Right now, however, we want you to see this moment, captured by our NBC<br /> cameras. (Kerri Strug vaults.)</p>
<p>COSTAS: Now let's head out to the pool to check on the progress of the<br /> American swimmers, all of whom have overcome asthma.</p>
<p>SWIMMING COMMENTATOR: Bob, here we see an American swimmer winning a race.<br /> This happened earlier.</p>
<p>COSTAS: How much earlier?</p>
<p>SWIMMING COMMENTATOR: Twenty-four years, Bob. This is Mark Spitz.</p>
<p>COSTAS: Time for this commercial.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: We're the Nike Corporation. We pay famous athletes millions of<br /> dollars to wear our shoes. Because of this, you, the public, pay absurdly<br /> high prices for these shoes. Is that stupid, or what? Thank you.</p>
<p>BOM! BOM! BOM-BOM BOM BOM BOM! (Kerri Strug vaults.)</p>
<p>COSTAS: OK, right now there are exciting gold-medal competitions going on<br /> in archery, shooting, rowing, kayaking, table tennis, softball,<br /> volleyball, team handball and judo, so right now we're going to take you<br /> to beach volleyball.</p>
<p>BEACH VOLLEYBALL COMMENTATOR: Bob, as you can see, American Holly McPeak<br /> is bending over.</p>

He tied the other end of the rope to a large rock. He drank<br />  some poison and set fire to his clothes. He even tried to shoot<br />  himself at the last moment.</p>
<p> He jumped and fired the pistol. The bullet missed him and cut through<br />  the rope above him. Free of the threat of hanging, he plunged into<br />  the sea. The sudden dunking extinguished the flames and made him<br />  vomit the poison. He was dragged out of the water by a kind fisherman<br />  and was taken to hospital, where he died ... of exposure!</p>

23143,"<p>An Irishman named Murphy went to his doctor after a long illness. The doctor, after a lengthily examination, sighed and looked Murphy in the eye and said, ""I've some bad news for you. You have cancer and it can't be cured. I'd give you two weeks to a month.""</p>
<p>Murphy, saddened and shocked by the news, but of solid character, managed to compose himself and walk from the doctor's office into the waiting room. There he saw his son who had been waiting. Murphy said, ""Son, we Irish celebrate when things are good and we celebrate when things don't go so well. In this case, things aren't so well. I have cancer and I've been given a short time to live. Let's head for the pub and have a few pints.</p>
<p>After three or four pints the two were feeling a little less somber.<br /> There were some laughs and more beers. They were eventual approached by some of Murphy's old friends who asked what the two were celebrating. Murphy told them that the Irish celebrate the good and the bad. He went on to tell them that they were drinking to his impending end.</p>
<p>He told his friends ""I've only got a few weeks to live as I have been diagnosed with AIDS."" The friends gave Murphy their condolences and they had a couple more beers.</p>
<p>After his friends left, Murphy's son leaned over and whispered his confusion. ""Dad, I thought you said that you were dying from cancer? You just told your friends that you were dying from AIDS?""</p>
<p>Murphy said, ""I am dying from cancer son, I just don't want any of them sleeping with your mother after I'm gone!""</p>

<p>The bartender politely informs Roy that it appears that he has already had plenty to drink, he could not be served additional liquor at this bar, and could a cab be called for him?</p>
<p>Roy is briefly surprised, then softly scoffs, grumbles, climbs down off the bar stool and staggers out the front door.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Roy stumbles in the SIDE door of the ""same"" bar. He wobbles up to the bar and hollers for a drink. The bartender comes over and, still politely but more firmly, refuses service to him due to his inebriation, and again offers to call a cab. He looks at the bartender for a moment angrily, curses, and shows himself out the side door, all the while grumbling and shaking his head.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Roy bursts in through the BACK door of the bar. He plops himself up on a bar stool, gathers his wits and belligerently orders a drink. The bartender comes over and emphatically reminds him that he is clearly drunk, will be served no drinks, and either a cab or the police will be called immediately.</p>
<p>Roy surprisingly looks at the bartender, and in hopeless anguish, cries - ""MAAAN! How many bars do you work at!?!?!""</p>

23190,"<p>A fellow was reading the paper one day lamenting the fact that<br /> his doctor has ordered him to lose 75 pounds. Next thing he sees<br /> is an advertisement for a guaranteed weight loss program.<br /> ""Guaranteed like heck,"" he thinks to himself. ""But lets see what<br /> they think they can do."" He calls them on the phone and<br /> subscribes to the 3 day, 10 LB weight loss program.</p>
<p>The next day there comes a knock at his door, and when he<br /> answers, there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic 19 year<br /> old babe dressed in nothing but a pair of Nikes and a sign<br /> hanging around her neck. She introduces herself as a<br /> representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, ""If<br /> you can catch me, you can have me."" Without a second thought he<br /> takes off after her. A few miles later, huffing and puffing, he<br /> finally catches her and has his way with her. After they are<br /> through he kisses the girl one last time and thinks to himself<br /> with a nod, ""I like the way this company does business."" For the<br /> next two days, the same girl shows up and the same thing happens<br /> each time. On the fourth day, he weigh himself and, sure enough,<br /> he has lost 10 pounds.</p>
<p>Deciding that he likes his somewhat more slender physique, not<br /> to mention the method of treatment, he calls the company back<br /> and subscribes to their 5 day, 20 LB weight loss program. He<br /> thinks that losing 20 pounds in only 5 days seems like a lot,<br /> but he is intrigued by what their workout schedule might be like<br /> this time.</p>
<p>As expected, the next day there comes a knock at his door. When<br /> he answers it there stands a 22 year old knockout dressed in<br /> nothing but a pair of Reeboks and a sign hanging around her<br /> neck. She is simply stunning, the most beautiful woman he has<br /> ever seen. She introduces herself as a representative of the<br /> weight loss company. The sign reads, ""If you can catch me, you<br /> can have me."" He's out the door like a shot. This gal is in<br /> excellent shape and it takes a while to catch her. But when he<br /> does, it is worth every cramp and wheeze. She is wonderful, the<br /> best he has ever had. He is really looking forward to the next<br /> four days... For the next four days, the same girl shows up and<br /> the same thing happens each time, much to his delight. On the<br /> sixth day, he weighs himself and, unbelievably, he has lost<br /> another 20 pounds.</p>
<p>I love this company, he thinks to himself, ""I never knew losing<br /> weight could be so easy and so much fun."" Feeling much better<br /> about himself, he decides to go for broke and subscribe to the<br /> company's 7 day, 50 pound weight loss program. ""Are you sure,<br /> sir?"" Asks the representative on the phone. ""This is our most<br /> vigorous program."" ""Absolutely,"" says he, ""I love your program.<br /> Haven't felt this good in years!""</p>
<p>The next day there comes a knock at his door and he<br /> enthusiastically answers it. There stands before him a 200 pound<br /> perfect specimen of a man dressed in nothing but racing spikes<br /> and a sign around his neck. He introduces himself as a<br /> representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, ""If I<br /> can catch you, I can have you.""</p>

23193,"<p>A helicopter was flying around above Seattle when an electrical malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic navigation and communications equipment.  Due to the  clouds and haze, the pilot could not determine the helicopter's position.    The pilot saw a tall building, flew toward  it,  circled,  and held up a handwritten sign that   said ""WHERE AM I?"" in large letters.   People in the tall building quickly  responded to  the  aircraft, drew a large sign, and held   it in a building  window.  Their  sign said ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.""The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map,   determined the course to steer to SEATAC   airport, and landed safely.   After they were on the ground, the copilot    asked  the  pilot  how he had done it.   ""I knew it had to be the Microsoft Building, because they gave me a technically correct but completely useless answer.""</p>

23280,"<p>One particular Christmas season a long time ago, Santa was getting ready for his annual trip ... but there were problems everywhere.<br /> Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed Santa even more. When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. More stress. Then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.</p>
<p>Frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered that the elves had hid the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from. Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.</p>
<p>He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said, very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas Santa. Isn't it just a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Isn't it just a lovely tree?<br /> Where would you like me to stick it?""</p>

<p>""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. ""They're packed with nutrients."" </p>

"
23321,"<p>When I was in high school I used to be terrified of my girlfriend's father,<br /> who I believe suspected me of wanting to place my hands on his daughter's chest.<br /> He would open the door and immediately affect ma good-naturedly murderous<br /> expression, holding out a handshake that, when gripped, felt like it could<br /> squeeze carbon into diamonds.<br /> Now, years later, it is my turn to be the dad. Remembering how unfairly<br /> persecuted I felt when I would pick up my dates; I do my best to make my<br /> daughter's suitors feel even worse. My motto: Wilt them in the living room and<br /> they'll stay wilted all night.<br /> ""So,"" I'll call out jovially. ""I see you have your nose pierced. Is that<br /> because you're stupid, or did you merely want to APPEAR stupid?""<br /> As a dad, I have some basic rules, which I have carved into two stone tablets<br /> that I have on display in my living room.<br /> Rule One: If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a<br /> package, because you're sure as heck not picking anything up.<br /> Rule Two: You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her,<br /> so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your<br /> eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.<br /> Rule Three: I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age<br /> to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips.<br /> Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are<br /> complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I<br /> propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing<br /> and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, In order to<br /> assure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your<br /> date with my daughter, I will take my electric staple gun and fasten your<br /> trousers securely in place around your waist.<br /> Rule Four: I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without<br /> utilizing a ""barrier method"" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when<br /> it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I WILL kill you.<br /> Rule Five: In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about<br /> sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only<br /> information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my<br /> daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this<br /> subject is ""early.""<br /> Rule Six: I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to<br /> date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter.<br /> Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date<br /> no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make<br /> YOU cry.<br /> Rule Seven: As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to<br /> appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be<br /> on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her<br /> makeup, a process which can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge.<br /> Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing<br /> the oil in my car?<br /> Rule Eight: The following places are not appropriate for a date with my<br /> daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden<br /> stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight.<br /> Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or<br /> happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my<br /> daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than<br /> overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka zipped up to her Adam's apple.<br /> Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which<br /> feature chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay.<br /> My daughter claims it embarrasses her to come downstairs and find me<br /> attempting to get her date to recite these eight simple rules from memory. I'd<br /> be embarrassed too--there are only eight of them, for crying out loud! And, for<br /> the record, I did NOT suggest to one of these guys that I'd have these rules<br /> tattooed on his arm if he couldn't remember them. (I checked into it and the<br /> cost is prohibitive.) I merely told him that I thought writing the rules on his<br /> arm with a ball point might be inadequate--ink washes off--and that my wood<br /> burning set was probably a better alternative.<br /> One time, when my wife caught me having one of my daughter's would-be suitors<br /> practice pulling into the driveway, get out of the car, and go up to knock on<br /> the front door (he had violated rule number one, so I figured he needed to run<br /> through the drill a few dozen times) she asked me why I was being so hard on the<br /> boy. ""Don't you remember being that age?"" she challenged.<br /> Of course I remember. Why do you think I came up with the eight simple rules?</p>

Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are equally tired and discontented. Then bundle up your wife or girlfriend and send her to the man whose name appears at the top of the following list and add your name to the bottom of the list. When your turn comes, you will receive 15,625 women. One of them is bound to be better than the one you already have. At the writing of this letter, a friend of mine had already received 184 women, of whom 4 were worth keeping. REMEMBER this chain brings luck.

An unmarried man living with his widowed mother was able to choose between a Hooters waitress and a Hollywood super model. You can be lucky too, but DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN!

23409,"<p>King Arthur was getting ready to go on a Quest.  He was worried about leaving his beautiful Queen Guinevere alone with all those lonely knights of the Round Table.  So he went to his famous wizard, Merlin, for some advice.  After explaining his predicament to Merlin, the wizard looked thoughtful and said to come back in a week and he'd see if he could come up with something.A week later King Arthur was back in Merlin's laboratory where the good wizard was showing him his latest invention.  It was a chastity belt... except it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place.  'This is no good, Merlin!' the king exclaimed, 'Look at this opening.  How is this supposed to protect m'lady, the Queen?''Ah, sire, just observe.' said Merlin as he searched his cluttered workbench until he found what he was looking for.  He then selected his most worn out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway.  He then inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two.'Merlin, you are a genius!' said the grateful monarch, 'Now I can leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected.'  After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his Quest.Several years passed until he returned to Camelot.  Immediately he assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for an informal 'short arm' inspection.  Sure enough!  Each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way.  All of them except Sir Lancelot.'Sir Lancelot,' exclaimed King Arthur, 'The one and only true knight!  Only you among all the nobles have been true to me.  What is it in my power to grant you?  Name it and it is yours!'But Sir Lancelot  was speechless...</p>

<p>""Yes,"" the pet store owner said, ""this bird has a vocabulary of about 1000 words plus 50 phrases guaranteed to fit most occasions.""</p>
<p>The deal was made and the parrot was brought home complete with a cage. The next day the purchaser went back and said the parrot had yet to say a word. </p>
<p>""That's to be expected,"" said the pet shop owner. ""Try getting the bird a few of the toys that were here for the bird to use in the shop. It just needs to feel at home with you."" Toys were purchased and a day went by. The parrot's owner returned and said there still had been no talking. </p>
<p>""I see,"" said the pet shop owner. ""Perhaps if you got a bird bath, the parrot would start to talk while using it."" A bird bath was purchased and yet another day went by. The next day the owner was back with the same complaint.  This time the pet shop owner mentioned that sometimes the bird had been praised in its training by being allowed to ring a little bell.</p>
<p>The parrot's owner bought the bell reluctantly. The following day the parrot's owner was there waiting as the store opened. ""Still no luck?"" asked the store owner.</p>
<p>""No. Nothing said yet,"" answered the bird's owner. ""Well, I bet the bird's just lonesome for some of the birds here at the shop."" ""What? You want me to buy another bird!?!"" yelped the unhappy owner of the parrot.</p>
<p>""No, no, calm down,"" reassured the store owner.  ""All you have to do is get a mirror and the bird will think it has a companion.""</p>
<p>At last the sale of a mirror was agreed upon. The pet store owner the next day opened the store and found the troublesome customer had returned ... this time with the parrot, only it was dead! ""What happened?"" asked the store owner, ""Didn't the bird ever talk?"" </p>
<p>""Yes, right before it died it said: What's the matter? Don't they sell birdseed at the pet store anymore?""</p>

The conversation was slow going so I thought we should go off somewhere more intimate so we could talk more privately. So we went to this restaurant and he is still acting a bit funny and I am trying to cheer him up and I start to wonder if it is me or something else. I ask him and he says no. But you know I am not really sure. </p>
<p>Anyway, in the cab back to his house, I say that I love him and he just puts his arm around me. I don't know what the hell this means because you know he doesn't say it back or anything. We finally get back to his place and I am wondering if he is going to dump me. So I try to ask him about it but he just switches on the TV. Reluctantly, I say I am going to go to sleep. Then, after about 10 minutes, he joins me and we have sex. But, he still seemed really distracted, so afterwards I just wanted to leave. I don't know, I just don't know, what he thinks anymore. I mean, do you think he's met someone else???? </p>
<p>His story:<br /> **********<br /> Lousy day at work, low on funds, and tired. Got some action though.</p>

23430,"<p>A nun was going to Chicago. She went to the airport and sat down waiting for her flight.</p>
<p>She looked over in the corner and saw one of those weight machines that tells your fortune. So, she thought to herself ""I'll give it a try just to see what it tells me.""</p>
<p>She went over to the machine and put her nickel in, and out came a card that said, ""You're a nun you weigh 128lbs and you are going to Chicago, Illinois.""</p>
<p>She sat back down and thought about it. She told herself it probably tells everyone the same thing, but decided to try it again.</p>
<p>She went back to the machine and put her nickel in. Out came a card read, ""You're a nun, you weigh 128lbs you're going to Chicago, Illinois and you are going to play a fiddle.""</p>
<p>The nun said to herself, ""I know that's wrong, I have never played a musical instrument a day in my life."" She sat back down.</p>
<p>From nowhere a Cowboy came over and set his fiddle case down next to her. The nun picked up the fiddle and just started playing beautiful music.</p>
<p>Startled, she looked back at the machine and said, ""This is incredible. I've got to try it again.""</p>
<p>Back to the machine, she put her nickel in and another card came out. It said, ""You're a nun, you weigh 128lbs, you're going to Chicago, Illinois and you're going to break wind.</p>
<p>Now, the nun knows the machine is wrong; ""I've never broke wind in public a day in my life!"" Well, she tripped, fell off the scales and broke wind.</p>
<p>Stunned, she sat back down and looked at the machine. She said to herself, ""This is truly unbelievable! I've got to try it again.""</p>
<p>She went back to the machine, put her nickel in and collected the card.</p>
<p>It said, ""You're a nun, you weigh 128lbs, you have fiddled and farted around and missed your flight to Chicago!!!!!!""</p>

<p>Jack asks sadly, ""And that would be?"" </p>
<p>""Well,"" the Doctor explains, ""what we would do is take the muscles from the trunk of a baby elephant and implant them in your penis."" </p>
<p>Jack thinks about it silently then says, ""Well the thought of going through life without ever having sex again is too much, let's go for it."" </p>

23447,"<p>A programmer and an engineer are sitting next to each other on a long flight from Los Angeles to New York.</p>

<p>The engineer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.</p>
<p>The programmer persists and explains that the game is real easy and is a lot of fun. He explains ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5. Then you ask me a question, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $5.""</p>

<p>The programmer, now somewhat agitated, says, ""OK, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $100!""</p>
<p>This catches the engineer's attention, and he sees no end to this torment unless he plays, so he agrees to the game.</p>
<p>The programmer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" The engineer doesn't say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the programmer.</p>

The programmer, more than a little miffed, shakes the engineer and asks ""Well, so what's the answer?"" Without a word, the engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the programmer $5, and turns away to get back to sleep.</p>

23460,"<p>A team of archaeologists were excavating in Israel when they came upon<br /> a cave. Written across the wall of the cave were the following<br /> symbols, in this order of appearance: A woman, a donkey, a shovel, a<br /> fish, and a Star of David. They decided that this was a unique find<br /> and the writings were at least three thousand years old. They chopped<br /> out the piece of stone and had it brought to the museum where<br /> archaeologists from all over the world came to study the ancient<br /> symbols. They held a huge meeting after months of conferences to<br /> discuss the meaning of the markings. </p>
<p>The President of the society stood up and pointed at the first drawing<br /> and said: ""This looks like a woman. We can judge that this race was<br /> family oriented and held women in high esteem. You can also tell<br /> they were intelligent, as the next symbol resembles a donkey, so,<br /> they were smart enough to have animals help them till the soil.""</p>
<p>""The next drawing looks like a shovel of some sort, which means they<br /> even had tools to help them.""</p>
<p>""Even further proof of their high intelligence is the fish which means<br /> that if a famine had hit the earth, whereby the food didn't grow, they<br /> would take to the sea for food.""</p>
<p>""The last symbol appears to be the Star of David which means they were<br /> evidently Hebrews.""</p>
<p>The audience applauded enthusiastically.</p>

23461,"<p>An old farmer decided it was time to get a new rooster for his hens.  The current rooster was   still doing an okay job, but he was getting on in  years and the farmer figured getting a new rooster   couldn't hurt.  So he buys a new cock from the   local rooster emporium, and turns him loose in the   barnyard.    Well, the old rooster sees the young one strutting   around and he's a little worried about being replaced. He walks up to   the new bird.""So you're the new stud in   town?  I bet you really think you're hot stuff   don't you?  Well I'm not ready for the chopping   block yet.  I'll bet I'm still the better bird.    And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around   that hen house over there.  We'll run around it   ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have   all the hens for himself.""    Well, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he   definitely thought he was more than a match for   the old guy.  ""You're on,"" he said, ""and since   I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of   half a lap.  I'll still win easy!""   So the two roosters go over to the henhouse to   start the race with all the hens gathering to   watch.  The race begins and all the hens start   cheering the old rooster on.  After the first lap,   the old rooster is still maintaining his lead.   After the second lap, the old guy's lead has   slipped a little -- but he's still hanging in there.  Unfortunately, the old rooster's lead continues to   slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he's   just barely in front of the young fella.    By now the farmer has heard the commotion.  He   runs into the house, gets his shotgun and runs   into the barnyard figuring a fox or something is   after his chickens.  When he gets there, he sees   the two roosters running around the henhouse,   with the old rooster still slightly in the lead.    He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires, and   blows the young rooster away.    ""Damn. That's the third gay rooster I've bought this month.""</p>

23463,"<p>Every night, after dinner, a man took off for the local tavern. He spent the whole evening there, and arrived home very drunk around midnight each night. He always had trouble getting his key into the keyhole and getting the door opened. His wife, waiting up for him, would go to the door and let him in. Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out, and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry continued his nightly routine. One day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior, and was particularly distraught by it all. The friend listened to her, and then said, ""Why don't you treat him a little differently, when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words, and welcome him home with a kiss? He then might change his ways."" The wife thought that might be a good idea. That night, Harry took off again, after dinner. And, about midnight, he arrived home, in his usual condition.His wife heard him at the door, and quickly went to it, and opened the door, and let Harry in.This time, instead of berating him, as she had always done, she took his arm, and led him into the living room. She sat him down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. Then she went behind him, and started to cuddle him a little. After a little while, she said to him, ""It's pretty late, dear. I think we had better go upstairs to bed, now, don't you think?""At that, Harry replied, in his inebriated state, ""I guess we might as well. I'll be getting in trouble with the stupid wife when I get home anyway!""</p>

23473,"<p>During a service at an old synagogue in Eastern Europe, when the Shema<br /> prayer was said, half the congregants stood up and half remained sitting.<br /> The half that was seated started yelling at those standing to sit down, and<br /> the ones standing yelled at the ones sitting to stand up...  The<br /> rabbi,learned as he was in the Law and commentaries, didn't know what to<br /> do.  His congregation suggested that he consult a housebound 98 year old<br /> man, who was one of the original founders of their temple.  The rabbi hoped<br /> the elderly man would be able to tell him what the actual temple tradition<br /> was, so he went to the nursing home with a representative of each faction<br /> of the<br /> congregation.</p>
<p>The one whose followers stood during Shema said to the old man, ""Is the<br /> tradition to stand during this prayer?</p>
<p>The old man answered, ""No, that is not the tradition.""  </p>
<p>The one whose followers sat said, ""Then the tradition is to sit during<br /> Shema!""</p>
<p>The old man answered, ""No, that is not the<br /> tradition.""</p>

<p>A short time afterwards, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign and went<br /> inside. He looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then walked over to<br /> the sign, looked at it and whined.</p>
<p>Getting the idea, the receptionist got the office manager. The office<br /> manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the least. However, the<br /> dog looked determined, so he led him into the office. Inside, the dog jumped up<br /> on the chair and stared at the manager. </p>
<p>The manager said, ""I can't hire you. The sign says you have to be able to<br /> type.""</p>
<p>The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to type out<br /> a perfect letter. He took out the page and trotted over to the manager and gave<br /> it to him, then jumped back on the chair.</p>
<p>The manager was stunned, but then told the dog, ""The sign says you have to be<br /> good with a computer.""</p>
<p>The dog jumped down again and went to the computer. The dog proceeded to<br /> demonstrate his expertise with various programs and produced a sample<br /> spreadsheet and database and presented them to the manager. </p>
<p>By this time the manager was totally dumbfounded! He looked at the dog and<br /> said, ""I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and have some interesting<br /> abilities. However, I still can't give you the job.""</p>
<p>The dog jumped down and went to a copy of the sign and put his paw on the part<br /> about being an Equal Opportunity Employer.</p>
<p>The manager said, ""Yes, but the sign also says that you have to be<br /> bilingual."" </p>
<p>The dog looked at him straight in the face and said, ""Meow.""</p>

<p>Chrysler Corporation is adding a new car to its line to honor Bill Clinton. The Dodge Drafter will begin production in Canada this year.</p>
<p>When Clinton was asked what he thought about foreign affairs, he replied: ""I don't know, I never had one.""</p>

23529,"<p>A quick narrative. I always wanted a hopped up muscle car when I was younger. I couldn't afford one. Now I can, and I have one. It is a '70 Mustang, and her name is Bessie. Bessie is the prototypical juvenile, male-caveman, scratch your crotch and drink cheap beer car. Chromed engine, dual exhaust, 250 horsepower, big tires, tra la la la. </p>
<p>I'm driving Bessie on Beach Boulevard behind an ancient guy in a beat up truck. He decides to turn in front of me without a blinker. I accelerate to swerve and avoid him, and this assh*le, overaerobicized woman jumps in front of my car with her hand up. </p>
<p>Meet Ethel, the neighborhood busybody/nuisance. She proceeds to yell in my window, ""Hey, slow down you %$&amp;#@ idiot."" I'm a well-bred, mellow guy by nature, so I ignore this. As I drive away, she yells, ""assh*le"" at me again. Twice? *&amp;%$# that. I turn around and drive up next to her. </p>
<p>""Do you have a problem?"" I ask. </p>
<p>""Yeah, why are you driving like an idiot?"" </p>
<p>""I was driving like an idiot? How, exactly?"" </p>
<p>""You were speeding. I watched you."" ""You were? I see. How did you measure my speed?"" (Ever the interrogator, I am.) </p>
<p>""I heard you."" </p>
<p>""So, you measured my speed by ear?"" </p>
<p>""I can hear."" </p>
<p>""How fast did you HEAR me going?"" </p>
<p>""Look,"" she says, ""I don't have to take this. Here comes a cop. I'll wave him down."" </p>
<p>THE POLICE? This woman is a trip. She waves him down, and proceeds to tell him that she observed me speeding. </p>
<p>""What happened?"" he asks. I told him the story, and told him that I accelerated to an indicated 30 mph (the speed limit is 50) to avoid a collision. </p>
<p>""Are those mufflers legal?"" Ethel asks. </p>
<p>She's pushing it. I reply, ""I have a C.A.R.B. exemption for them."" I give the paperwork to the cop. </p>
<p>She tries to find another thing to screw me with. She says ""What about those big tires? They CAN'T be legal. "" I began feeling little overheated gears in the back of my head start to turn. </p>
<p>""These tires were available on the 1970 Boss 429, "" I told the cop, "" Which makes them street legal as a replacement."" </p>
<p>Ethel gets angry. She whines, ""So you're not going to give out any tickets to this assh*le?"" </p>
<p>The cop says, ""No, I am not."" </p>
<p>I've about had it. So I say, ""Sir, this woman told you that she left the street at the corner, and then she met up with my car here. According to Title 19, pedestrians have to cross the street at a right angle. This woman admitted she crossed at a 45-degree angle, which is a ticketable offense."" </p>
<p>""What?"" The cop looks confused. </p>
<p>""Also, she told you that she walked in front of my car to stop me. A citizen can't detain someone without probable cause, under Terry v. Ohio (My new favorite case). Since she couldn't measure my speed, she had no probable cause to detain me. That is an indictable offense."" </p>
<p>The cop says, ""But, I didn't see any of this."" </p>
<p>""But,"" I said, ""I did, and, as an officer of the Court, I can demand her arrest. I'll agree to dismiss the Illegal Detention charge, but I want her cited for not crossing at a right angle and Hazardous Conduct on a Public Street."" </p>
<p>The cop called his Lieutenant, and after the cop told the story, he authorized the summonses. </p>
<p>She went home with $215.00 worth of traffic tickets, and they are worth a total of four points against her license, as well as the appropriate insurance surcharge! </p>
<p>Of course, if she demands a trial I won't prosecute. But the look on her face as she walked away was more than enough satisfaction for me. </p>
<p>Yeah, I've passed the bar, and I'm on a mission from God.</p>

23560,"<p>A man was approached by co-worker at lunch who invited him out for a few beers after work. The man said that his wife would never go for it, that she does not allow him to go drinking with the guys after work. The co-worker suggested a way to overcome that problem: ""When you get home tonight, sneak into the house, slide down under the sheets, gently pull down your wife's panties, and give her oral sex. Women love it, and believe me, she'll never mention that you were out late with the boys."" </p>
<p>So the man agreed to try it, and went out and enjoyed himself. Late that night, he sneaked into the house, slid down under the sheets, gently slid down his wife's panties, and gave her oral sex. She moaned and groaned with pleasure, but after a little while, he realized he had to take a leak, so he told he he'd be right back, got out of bed and walked down the hall to the bathroom. When he opened the door and went in, he was very surprised to see his wife sitting on the toliet. </p>

You don't know me but<br /> I've come to....'' </p>
<p>''Oh, no need to explain. I've been expecting you,'' Mrs. Smith cut in. </p>
<p>''Really ?'' the photographer asked. ''Well, good! I've made a specialty of<br /> babies.'' </p>
<p>''That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat. Just<br /> where do we start?'' asked Mrs. Smith, blushing. </p>
<p>''Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch<br /> and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun too; you<br /> can really spread out.'' </p>
<p>''Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me.'' </p>
<p>''Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try<br /> several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure<br /> you'll be pleased with the results.'' </p>
<p>''I hope we can get this over with quickly,'' gasped Mrs. Smith. </p>
<p>''Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I'd love to be in and<br /> out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.'' </p>
<p>''Don't I know!'' Mrs. Smith exclaimed. The photographer opened his briefcase<br /> and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. ''This was done on the top of a<br /> bus in downtown London.'' </p>
<p>''Oh my god!!'', Mrs. Smith exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief. </p>
<p>''And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider their mother<br /> was so difficult to work with.'' The photographer handed Mrs. Smith the picture. </p>
<p>''She was difficult ?'' asked Mrs. Smith.<br /> ''Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job<br /> done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get a<br /> good look.'' </p>
<p>''Four and five deep?'' asked Mrs. Smith, eyes widened in amazement. </p>
<p>''Yes,'' the photographer said. </p>
<p>''And for more than three hours too. The mother was constantly squealing and<br /> yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then darkness approached and I began to<br /> rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I<br /> just packed it all in.'' Mrs. Smith leaned forward. </p>
<p>''You mean they actually chewed on your, eh......equipment ?'' </p>
<p>''That's right. Well madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we<br /> can get to work.'' </p>
<p>''Tripod??'', Mrs. Smith looked extremely worried now. </p>

23588,"<p>Y2K Solution:  'Millenium Year Application Software System' (MYASS)   We are currently building a data center that will contain all firm data that is Year 2000 compliant.  The program is referred to as:  'Millenium Year Application Software System' (MYASS).  Next Monday at 9:00 am there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to everyone.  We will continue to hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at MYASS.  As for the status of implementation of the program, I have not addressed the networking aspects, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands.  Several people are using the program already and have come to depend on it.Just this morning, I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS.I've noticed that some of the less technical personnel are somewhat afraid of MYASS.  Just last week, when asked to enter some information into the program, I had a secretary say to me, 'I'm a little nervous, I've never put anything in MYASS before.'  I volunteered to help her through her first time, and, when we were through, she admitted that it was relatively painless, and that she was actually looking forward to doing it again.  She went so far as to say that, after using SAP and ORACLE, she was ready to kiss MYASS. I know there are concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but I am pleased to say the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS.  In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS.  We planned this database to encompass all information associated with the business.  So as you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want into MYASS.  As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace to walk by an office and see a manager hand a paper to an employee and say, 'Here, stick this in MYASS'. This program has already demonstrated great benefit to the company during recent OSHA and EPA audits.  After requesting certain historical data, the agency representatives were amazed how quickly we provided the information.  When asked how the numbers could be retrieved so rapidly, our Environmental Manager proudly stated, 'Simple, I just pulled them out of MYASS'.</p>

She replied, �I was just going to make some ice cream.� The husband insisted that he would make it. As he was walking into the kitchen, she called out, �WITH A CHERRY ON TOP!� �Okay dear,� he replied. �And sprinkles too!� �Okay dear.� From the kitchen came sounds of banging pots and pans and nearly twenty minutes later he came back into the room with bacon and eggs.

23607,"<p>Actual letter of resignation from an employee at Zantex Computers, USA, to<br /> her boss, who apparently resigned very soon afterwards!<br /> Dear Mr. Baker,<br /> As an employee of an institution of higher education, I have a few very basic<br /> expectations. Chief among these is that my direct superiors have an intellect<br /> that ranges above the common ground squirrel. After your consistent and annoying<br /> harassment of my co-workers and myself during the commission of our duties, I<br /> can only surmise that you are one of the few true genetic wastes of our time.<br /> Asking me, a network administrator, to explain every little nuance of everything<br /> I do each time you happen to stroll into my office is not only a waste of time,<br /> but also a waste of precious oxygen. I was hired because I know how to network<br /> computer systems, and you were apparently hired to provide amusement to myself<br /> and other employees, who watch you vainly attempt to understand the concept of<br /> cut and paste for the hundredth time.<br /> You will never understand computers. Something as incredibly simple as binary<br /> still gives you too many options. You will also never understand why people hate<br /> you, but I am going to try and explain it to you, even though I am sure this<br /> will be just as effective as telling you what an IP is. Your shiny new iMac has<br /> more personality than you ever will. You walk around the building all day,<br /> shiftlessly looking for fault in others. You have a sharp dressed useless look<br /> about you that may have worked for your interview, but now that you actually<br /> have responsibility, you pawn it off on overworked staff, hoping their talent<br /> will cover for your glaring ineptitude.<br /> In a world of managerial evolution, you are the blue-green algae that<br /> everyone else eats and laughs at. Managers like you are a sad proof of the<br /> Dilbert principle. Seeing as this situation is unlikely to change without you<br /> getting a full frontal lobotomy reversal, I am forced to tender my resignation,<br /> however I have a few parting thoughts. 1. When someone calls you in reference to<br /> employment, it is illegal for you to give me a bad recommendation. The most you<br /> can say to hurt me is I prefer not to comment. I will have friends randomly call<br /> you over the next couple of years to keep you honest, because I know you would<br /> be unable to do it on your own. 2. I have all the passwords to every account on<br /> the system, and I know every password you have used for the last five years.<br /> If you decide to get cute, I am going to publish your favorites list, which I<br /> conveniently saved when you made me back up your useless files. I do believe<br /> that terms like Lolita are not usually viewed favorably by the administration.<br /> 3. When you borrowed the digital camera to take pictures of your Mother's<br /> birthday, you neglected to mention that you were going to take nude pictures of<br /> yourself in the mirror. Then you forgot to erase them like the techno-moron you<br /> really are. Suffice it to say I have never seen such odd acts with a sauce<br /> bottle, but I assure you that those have been copied and kept in safe places<br /> pending the authoring of a glowing letter of recommendation. (Try to use a spell<br /> check please, I hate having to correct your mistakes.)<br /> Thank you for your time, and I expect the letter of recommendation on my desk<br /> by 8:00 am tomorrow. One word of this to anybody and all of your little twisted<br /> repugnant obsessions will be open to the public.<br /> Never fuck with your systems administrator. Why? Because they know what you<br /> do with all that free time!<br /> Wishing you a grand and glorious day<br /> Cecelia</p>

So the doctor tried giving the husband 25% of the pain, and he felt no effect, so the doctor and the couple decided to give the husband 50% of the pain instead.  Well, he still felt no pain, so the doctor increased it to 100% of the pain.  In the end of the birth, the baby was crying, the mother relived to have no pain and the husband had felt no pain at all.

23616,"<p>You've all heard of the Air Force's ultra-high-security, super-secret base in Nevada, known simply as ""Area 51?"" Well, late one afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their ""secret"" base. They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. The pilot's story was that he took off from Las Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Las Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way. The next day, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane ... only this time there were two people in the plane. The same pilot jumped out and said, ""Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!""</p>

23618,"<p>The Americans and Russians at the height of the arms race<br /> realized that if they continued in the usual manner they were<br /> going to blow up the whole world. One day they sat down and<br /> decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. They<br /> would have five years to breed the best fighting dog in the<br /> world and which ever side's dog won would be entitled to<br /> dominate the world. The losing side would have to lay down its<br /> arms.</p>
<p>The Russians found the biggest meanest Doberman and Rottweiler<br /> bitches in the world and bred them with the biggest meanest<br /> Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest<br /> puppy from each litter, removed his siblings which gave him all<br /> the milk. They used steroids and trainers and after five years<br /> came up with the biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen.<br /> Its cage needed steel bars that were five inches thick and<br /> nobody could get near it.</p>
<p>When the day came for the dog fight, the Americans showed up<br /> with a strange animal. It was a nine foot long Dachshund.<br /> Everyone felt sorry for the Americans because they knew there<br /> was no way that this dog could possibly last ten seconds with<br /> the Russian dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund<br /> came out of it's cage and slowly waddled over towards the<br /> Russian dog. The Russian dog snarled and leaped out of it's cage<br /> and charged the American dachshund. But, when it got close<br /> enough to bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened it's<br /> mouth and consumed the Russian dog in one bite. There was<br /> nothing left at all of the Russian dog.</p>
<p>The Russians came up to the Americans shaking their heads in<br /> disbelief. ""We don't understand how this could have happened. We<br /> had our best people working for five years with the meanest<br /> Doberman and Rottweiler bitches in the world and the biggest<br /> meanest Siberian wolves.""</p>
<p>""That's nothing"", an American replied. ""We had our best plastic<br /> surgeons working for five years to make an alligator look like a<br /> Dachshund.""</p>

They spent the day, and at closing time they walked past the gorilla cage, and the man noticed the gorilla looking at his wife. ""That gorilla is getting excited just looking at your tits,"" he said. ""Why don't you take your blouse off and we'll see what he does?"" At first she declined. But finally persuaded by her husband, she took off her blouse and bra. The gorilla went nuts. He started grunting and jumping up and down. ""Hey,"" the husband said, ""let's really blow his mind. Take off all your clothes and we'll see what he does."" Again she said no and again he persuaded her. This time the ape really went bananas! He climbed up and down the bars, did flips, ran around in circles and tossed his food all over the cage. The husband went over to the cage, opened the door and pushed his wife in. ""Now,"" said the husband with an evil smile, ""tell HIM you have a headache!""</p>

23636,"<p>It seems that there was a little old church out in the countryside: painted white and with a high steeple.One Sunday, the pastor noticed that his church needed painting. He checked out the Sunday ads and found a paint sale. The next day, he went into town and bought a gallon of white paint. He went back out to the church and began the job.He got done with the first side. It was looking great. But he noticed he had already used a half gallon. He didn't want to run back in town and being the creative person that he was, he found a gallon of thinner in the shed out back, and began to thin his paint.It worked out great. He finished the remaining three sides with that last half gallon of paint.That night, it rained: it rained hard. The next morning when he stepped outside of the parsonage to admire his work, he saw that the first side was looking great, but that the paint on the other three sides had washed away.The pastor looked up in sky in anguish and cried out, ""What shall I do?""A voice came back from the heavens saying, ""Repaint, and thin no more!""</p>

As they slowly headed closer to the pearly gates the judge suddenly<br /> stopped dead in his tracks and in no uncertain terms said, ""Listen, I don't care<br /> how rare it is for someone of my stature to make it up here, but if there are<br /> any attorneys in there, I'm not going in.

<p>Later in the day, the shopkeeper is driving home, when he spots<br /> the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in<br /> hand. Just then, he sees a huge 9 foot alligator swimming<br /> quickly toward her. She takes aim, kills the creature and with a<br /> great deal of effort hauls it on to the swamp bank. Laying<br /> nearby were several more of the dead creatures.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper watches in amazement. Just then the blonde flips<br /> the alligator on it's back, and frustrated, shouts, ""Damn, this<br /> one isn't wearing any shoes either!""</p>

<p>Then as soon as the man was asleep, he'd be jarred awake by her with his penis in her mouth, and she'd hold a sign up saying ""$50 or I'll bite hard!"" </p>
<p>Of course usually the guy would pay and she'd let him go. Well one day a Polish guy's car broke down, and had to stay the night. Sure enough, he felt something between his legs at night, and there she is with him in her mouth and holding the sign, ""$50 or I'll bite."" </p>
<p>The polish guy just smiled and said, ""$100 or I'll piss!""</p>

23685,"<p>The 5 questions most feared by men are:<br /> 1. What are you thinking about?<br /> 2. Do you love me?<br /> 3. Do I look fat in this?<br /> 4. Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5. What would you do if I died?</p>
<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e., tells the truth). Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible responses.</p>
<p>Question # 1: What are you thinking about? The proper answer to this, of course, is: "" I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you."" This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which most likely is one of the following:<br /> a. Football.<br /> b. Golf.<br /> c. How fat you are.<br /> d. How much prettier she is than you<br /> e. How I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, ""If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!""</p>
<p>Question # 2: Do you love me? The proper response is: ""YES!"" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in order, ""Yes, dear.""</p>
<p>Inappropriate responses include:<br /> a. Oh Yeah, sh@*-loads.<br /> b. Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> c. That depends on what you mean by love.<br /> d. Does it matter?<br /> e. Who, me?</p>
<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat?<br /> The correct answer is an emphatic: ""Of course not!"" Among the incorrect answers are:<br /> a. Compared to what?<br /> b. I wouldn't call you fat, but you're not exactly thin.<br /> c. A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d. I've seen fatter.<br /> e. Sorry what did you say? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>Question # 4: Do you think she's prettier than me?<br /> Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: ""Of course not!"" Incorrect responses include:<br /> a. Yes, but you have a better personality<br /> b. Not prettier, but definitely thinner<br /> c. Not as pretty as you when you were her age<br /> d. Define pretty<br /> e. Sorry what did you say ? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>Question # 5: What would you do if I died? A definite no-win question.(The real answer, of course, is ""Buy a Lotus and a Boat"").</p>
<p>No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:</p>
<p>WOMAN: Would you get married again?<br /> MAN: Definitely not!<br /> WOMAN: Why not - don't you like being married?<br /> MAN: Of course I do.<br /> WOMAN: Then why wouldn't you remarry?<br /> MAN: Okay, I'd get married again.<br /> WOMAN: You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)<br /> MAN: (makes audible groan)<br /> WOMAN: Would you sleep with her in our bed?<br /> MAN: Where else would we sleep?<br /> WOMAN: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?<br /> MAN: That would seem like the proper thing to do.<br /> WOMAN: And would you let her use my golf clubs?<br /> MAN: She can't use them; she's left-handed.<br /> WOMAN: - - - silence - - -<br /> MAN: Sh&amp;%.</p>

23691,"<p>The following concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the University of Copenhagen:</p>
<p>""Describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer.""</p>
<p>One student replied:</p>
<p>""You tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground. The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building.""</p>
<p>This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed immediately. He appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case. The arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, but did not display any noticeable knowledge of physics. To resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics. For five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought. The arbiter reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use. On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:</p>
<p>""Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground. The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared. But bad luck on the barometer.</p>
<p>""Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work uut the height of the skyscraper.</p>
<p>""But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sqrroot (l/g).</p>
<p>""Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up.</p>
<p>""If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building.</p>
<p>But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper'.""</p>
<p>The student was Nils Bohr, the only Dane to win the Nobel prize for Physics.</p>

23692,"<p>It's your first time. As you lie back your muscles tighten. You<br /> put him off for a while searching for an excuse, but he refuses<br /> to be swayed as he approaches you. He asks if you're afraid and<br /> you shake your head bravely. He has had more experience, but<br /> it's the first time his finger has found the right place. He<br /> probes deeply and you shiver; your body tenses; but he's gentle<br /> like he promised he'd be. He looks deeply within your eyes and<br /> tells you to trust him--he's done this many times before. His<br /> cool smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him more room<br /> for an ease entrance. You begin to plead and beg him to hurry,<br /> but he slowly takes his time, wanting to cause you as little<br /> pain as possible. As he presses closer, going deeper, you feel<br /> the tissue give way; pain surges throughout your body and you<br /> feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues. He looks at<br /> you concerned and asks you if it's too painful. Your eyes are<br /> filled with tears but you shake you head and nod for him to go<br /> on. He begins moving in and out with skill but you are now too<br /> numb to feel him within you. After a few frenzied moments, you<br /> feel something bursting within you and he pulls it out of you,<br /> you lay panting, glad to have it over. He looks at you and<br /> smiling warmly, tells you, with a chuckle, that you have been<br /> his most stubborn yet most rewarding experience. You smile and<br /> thank your dentist. After all, it was your first time to have a<br /> tooth pulled.</p>

Insanity is my only means of relaxation.  Forget the health food.  I need all the preservatives I can get.  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst, for they are sticking to their diets.</p>

<p>The older you get, the tougher it is to lose weight, because by then your body and your fat are really good friends.</p>
<p>Age doesn't always bring wisdom.  Sometimes age comes alone.  Life not only begins at forty, it begins to show.  Just when I was getting used to yesterday, along came today.  Sometimes I think I understand everything, then I regain consciousness.  If at first you don't succeed, see if the loser gets anything.  You don't stop laughing because you grow old; you grow old because you stop laughing.  I don't mind the rat race, but I could do with a little more cheese.</p>

So he walked<br /> down and said to the man, �Excuse me sir, I don't mean to be rude but I noticed<br /> you have a small head. Is this a birth defect?� The man said �No, I got this in<br /> the war. The German�s in WWII torpedoed my ship. I was the only survivor on the<br /> ship so I swam to shore. One day a mermaid swam up to me and said she would<br /> grant me three wishes. For my first wish I wanted to return to the U.S. The<br /> mermaid granted that wish. My second wish was to have all the money I would ever<br /> need. Wish granted. My third wish was to have sex with the mermaid. She said, �I<br /> can't grant that wish because mermaids can't have sex.�� </p>
<p>So I said, �How about a little head?�</p>

""I make eggs for the farmer."" ""Right, great, see ya round."" Then the zebra saw this very handsome beast that looked almost like her, but without the stripes.

23719,"<p>No man is allowed to make love to his wife with the smell of garlic, onions,<br /> or sardines on his breath in Alexandria, Minnesota. If his wife so requests, law<br /> mandates that he must brush his teeth. Warn your hubby that after lovemaking in<br /> Ames, Iowa, he isn't allowed to take more than three gulps of beer while lying<br /> in bed with you-or holding you in his arms. Bozeman, Montana, has a law that<br /> bans all sexual activity between members of the opposite sex in the front yard<br /> of a home after sundown-if they're nude. (Apparently, if you wear socks, you're<br /> safe from the law!) During lunch breaks in Carlsbad, New Mexico no couple should<br /> engage in a sexual act while parked in their vehicle, unless their car has<br /> curtains. In Cleveland, Ohio women are not allowed to wear patent-leather shoes.<br /> Clinton, Oklahoma has a law against masturbating while watching two people<br /> having sex in a car. It's safe to make love while parked in Coeur d'Alene,<br /> Idaho. Police officers aren't allowed to walk up and knock on the window. Any<br /> suspicious officer who thinks that sex is taking place must drive up from<br /> behind, honk his horn three times and wait approximately two minutes before<br /> getting out of his car to investigate. In Connorsville, Wisconsin no man shall<br /> shoot off a gun while his female partner is having a sexual orgasm. In Detroit,<br /> couples are not allowed to make love in an automobile unless the act takes place<br /> while the vehicle is parked on the couple's own property. A law in Fairbanks,<br /> Alaska does not allow moose to have sex on city streets. In Florida it is<br /> illegal for single, divorced, or widowed women to parachute on Sunday<br /> afternoons. In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania it is illegal to have sex with a truck<br /> driver inside a toll booth. The owner of every hotel in Hastings, Nebraska, is<br /> required to provide each guest with a clean and pressed nightshirt. No couple,<br /> even if they are married, may sleep together in the nude. Nor may they have sex<br /> unless they are wearing one of these clean, white cotton nightshirts. Another<br /> law in Helena, Montana, mandates that a woman can't dance on a table in a saloon<br /> or bar unless she has on at least three pounds, two ounces of clothing. A state<br /> law in Illinois mandates that all bachelors should be called master, not mister,<br /> when addressed by their female counterparts. An excerpt from brilliant Kentucky<br /> state legislation. ""No female shall appear in a bathing suit on any highway<br /> within this state unless she be escorted by at least two officers or unless she<br /> be armed with a club"". The following important ammendment however is to be<br /> considered here: ""The provisions of this statute shall not apply to females<br /> weighing less than 90 pounds nor exceeding 200 pounds, nor shall it apply to<br /> female horses."" In Kingsville, Texas there is a law against two pigs having sex<br /> on the city's airport property. Any couple making out inside a vehicle, and<br /> accidentally sounding the horn during their lustful act, may be taken to jail<br /> according to a Liberty Corner, New Jersey law. In Los Angeles, California, a man<br /> is legally entitled to beat his wife with a leather belt or strap, but the belt<br /> can't be wider than 2 inches, unless he has his wife's consent to beat her with<br /> a wider strap. Consent should be given prior to the event, as is carefully<br /> stipulated. In Merryville, Missouri, women are prohibited from wearing corsets<br /> because ""The privilege of admiring the curvaceous, unencumbered body of a young<br /> woman should not be denied to the normal, red-blooded American male."" In<br /> Michigan, a woman isn't allowed to cut her own hair without her husband's<br /> permission. In Nevada sex without a condom is considered illegal. An ordinance<br /> in Newcastle, Wyoming, specifically bans couples from having sex while standing<br /> inside a store's walk-in meat freezer! In Norfolk, Virginia, a woman can't go<br /> out without wearing a corset. (There was a civil-service job-for man only-called<br /> a corset inspector.) In Oblong, Illinois, it's punishable by law to make love<br /> while hunting or fishing on your wedding day. In Oxford, Ohio, it's illegal for<br /> a woman to strip off her clothing while standing in front of a man's picture. In<br /> hotels in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, every room is required to have twin beds.<br /> And the beds must always be a minimum of two feet apart when a couple rents a<br /> room for only one night. And it's illegal to make love on the floor between the<br /> beds! A Tremonton, Utah law states that no woman is allowed to have sex with a<br /> man while riding in an ambulance. In addition to normal charges, the woman's<br /> name will be published in the local newspaper. The man does not receive any<br /> punishment. Utah state legislation outlaws all sex with anyone but your spouse.<br /> Next to that adultery, oral and anal sex, masturbation is considered sodomy and<br /> can lead to imprisonment. Sex with an animal - unless performed for profit -<br /> however is NOT considered sodomy. Polygamy - provided only the missionary<br /> position has been applied - is only a misdemeanor. In Ventura County, California<br /> cats and dogs are not allowed to have sex without a permit. The only acceptable<br /> sexual position in Washington D.C. is the missionary-style position. Any other<br /> sexual position is considered illegal. In Willow dale, Oregon no man may curse<br /> while having sex with his wife. In the state of Washington there is a law<br /> against having sex with a virgin under any circumstances. (Including the wedding<br /> night).</p>

23761,"<p>The president of Chase Manhattan Bank, after being humiliated by an old<br /> woman, decides he should take a vacation/business trip.  Since the<br /> president has heard about how fun Taipei is, he decides to visit the<br /> offices there.  He books two tickets, one for him and one for his<br /> secretary.</p>
<p>After his arrival in Taipei, the president receives an urgent message<br /> from headquarters that the richest man in Taiwan wants to put all his<br /> money into a Chase Manhattan account.  Since the account would be<br /> quite substantial, the president decides to meet personally with the<br /> man.</p>
<p>The next day, the president and his secretary go to meet the Taiwanese<br /> business at a really expensive  restaurant.  Throughout the dinner, the<br /> president tries to bring up the subject of opening the accounts for the<br /> Taiwanese businessman.  However, the prospective client only seems to<br /> be<br /> interested in the president's secretary.  After the dinner, the businessman<br /> asks the secretary to spend the rest of the evening seeing the sights<br /> in<br /> Taipei with him.  Not wishing to offend the prospective client, the<br /> president<br /> orders his secretary to spend some time with the man.  He tells her<br /> that<br /> she must be diplomatic and under no circumstances is she to insult the<br /> man by rejecting him outright.</p>
<p>After going to a dance club for a few hours, the businessman takes the<br /> secretary aside.  As he holds her hand and looks her straight in the<br /> eyes, he tells her that he loves her.  Then, he gets on his knees and<br /> asks her to marry him.</p>
<p>Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback.  However, she remembers<br /> what her boss told her.  Don't reject the guy outright.  So, she tries<br /> to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting to marry<br /> her.<br /> So, after a few minutes, the woman says to the man ""I will only marry<br /> you under three conditions.  First, I want my engagement ring to be a<br /> 75<br /> carat diamond ring, with a matching 200 carat diamond tiara.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese man pauses for awhile.  Then, he nods his head and says<br /> ""No problem!!  I buy.  I buy.""</p>
<p>Realizing that her first condition was too easy, the woman says to the<br /> man ""I want you to build me a 100 room mansion in New York.  As a<br /> vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine<br /> country in France.""</p>
<p>The man pauses for awhile.  He whips out his cellular phone, calls some<br /> brokers in New York, then he calls some brokers in France.  He looks at<br /> the woman, nods his head and says ""Okay, okay.  I build, I build.""</p>
<p>Realizing that she has one last condition, the secretary knows that<br /> she'd better make this a good one.  She takes her time to think and<br /> finally, she gets an idea.  A sure-to-work condition.  She squints her<br /> eyes,<br /> looks at the man and says, rather coldly,  ""Since I like to have sex, I<br /> want the man I marry to have a 12-inch penis.""</p>
<p>The man seems a bit disturbed.  He cups his face with his hands and<br /> rests his elbows on the table.  All the while, he's muttering something<br /> in Chinese.  Finally, after what seemed like forever, the man shakes<br /> his<br /> head, looking real sad, says to the woman ""I cut.  I cut.""</p>

But eventually he had to go on a business trip and had to leave his gorilla in the care of his next-door neighbor. So he explained to his neighbor that all he had to do was feed his gorilla three bananas a day at three, six and nine o'clock. But he was never ever, ever to touch its fur. </p>
<p>So the next day the man came and gave the gorilla a banana and looked at it for a while thinking, ""Why can't I touch its fur?"" as there didn't seem to be anything wrong with it. Every day he came in and looked for a little while longer as he still couldn�t understand until, about a week later, he�d worked himself into a frenzy and decided that he was going to touch the gorilla. </p>
<p>He passed it the banana and very gently brushed the back of his hand against its fur. Suddenly the gorilla went ape wild and started to jump around, then it turned and began running towards the man who, in turn, ran through the front door, over the lawn, across the street, into some one else�s sports car and drove off. In the rear-view mirror, he could see the gorilla in its own sports car, driving right behind him. He drove for two hours until the engine began to splutter and the car just stopped. He jumped out and began to run down the street, over a brick wall, into someone's front garden and up the apple tree. </p>
<p>He turned around to find the gorilla right behind him beating its chest. The man jumped down and ran back in to the street screaming, until it became dark and he thought he'd lost the gorilla. The man ran into an alley-way, then, suddenly, he saw a giant shadow coming down the street ahead. The gorilla! It came to the end of the alley, stood and looked straight into the bloodshot eyes of the man and came towards him slowly. This time there was no escape. </p>
<p>As the gorilla neared him, the man began to feel faint. The giant beast came face to face with him, raised its mighty hand and said, ""Tag! You�re it!""</p>

<p>Suddenly, at the altar, Satan appears! Everyone starts screaming and<br /> running for the front entrance, trampling each other in their determined<br /> efforts to get away from Evil Incarnate.</p>
<p>Soon, everyone is evacuated from the church except for one man, who sit<br /> calmly in his pew, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy<br /> is in his presence. This confuses Satan a bit.</p>
<p>Satan walks up to the man and says, ""Hey, don't you know who I am?""</p>

<p>The interviewer tries another straightforward one to break the ice. ""And can you tell us your height, please?"" </p>

<p>The blonde bobs her head from side to side for about twenty seconds, mouthing something silently to herself, before replying ""Stephanie"".</p>
<p>The interviewer is completely baffled at this stage, so he asks ""Just out of curiosity, miss. We can understand your counting on your fingers to work out your age, and the measuring tape for your height is obvious, but what were you doing when we asked you your name?""</p>

Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed an acceptable response to ""I love you."" Hallmark would make ""Sorry, what was your name again?"" cards. When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during the game, she'd appear in a little box in the corner of the screen during a time-out. Breaking up would be a lot easier. A smack to the ass and a ""Nice hustle, you'll get 'em next time"" would pretty much do it. Birth control would come in ale or lager. Each year, your raise would be pegged to the fortunes of the NFL team of your choice. The funniest guy in the office would get to be CEO. ""Sorry I'm late, but I got really wasted last night"" would be an acceptable excuse for tardiness. At the end of the workday, a whistle would blow and you'd jump out your window and slide down the tail of a brontosaurus and right into your car like Fred Flintstone. It'd be considered harmless fun to gather 30 friends, put on horned helmets, and go pillage a nearby town. Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating the ""public ugliness"" ordinance. Tanks would be far easier to rent. Garbage would take itself out. Instead of beer belly, you'd get ""beer biceps."" Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could present your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said, ""You're #1!"" Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would only occur in leap years. On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you'd get the day off to go drinking. St. Patrick's Day, however, would remain exactly the same. But it would be celebrated every month. ""Cops"" would be broadcast live, and you could phone in advice to the pursuing cops or to the crooks. Two words: Ally McNaked. Regis and Kelli would be chained to a cement mixer and pushed off the Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative pay-per-view event in world history. The only show opposite ""Monday Night Football"" would be ""Monday Night Football From A Different Camera Angle."" It would be perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as you returned it the following day with a full tank of gas. Every man would get four real ""Get Out of Jail Free"" cards per year. Faucets would run ""Hot,"" ""Cold,"" and ""100 proof."" Daisy Duke shorts would never again go out of style. Telephones would automatically cut off after 30 seconds of conversation.</p>

Tell me where you hid the loot or I'll blow your brains out."" But the bandit didn't speak English, and the Ranger didn't speak Spanish. Fortunately, a bilingual lawyer was in the saloon and translated the Ranger's message. The terrified bandit blurted out, in Spanish, that the loot was buried under the oak tree in back of the cantina.""What did he say?"" asked the Ranger.

23815,"<p>Yes, parenthood changes everything. But parenthood also changes with each baby. Here, some of the ways having a second and third child differs from having your first: </p>
<p>Your Clothes<br /> -1st baby: You begin wearing maternity clothes as soon as your OB/GYN confirms your pregnancy.<br /> -2nd baby: You wear your regular clothes for as long as possible.<br /> -3rd baby: Your maternity clothes ARE your regular clothes. </p>
<p>The Baby's Name<br /> -1st baby: You pore over baby-name books and practice pronouncing and writing combinations of all your favorites.<br /> -2nd baby: Someone has to name his or her kid after your great-aunt Mavis, right? It might as well be you.<br /> -3rd baby: You open a name book, close your eyes, and see where your finger points. </p>
<p>Preparing for the Birth<br /> -1st baby: You practice your breathing religiously.<br /> -2nd baby: You don't bother practicing because you remember that last time, breathing didn't do a thing.<br /> -3rd baby: You ask for an epidural in your 8th month. </p>
<p>The Layette<br /> -1st baby: You pre-wash your newborn's clothes, color-coordinate them, and fold them neatly in the baby's little bureau.<br /> -2nd baby: You check to make sure that the clothes are clean and discard only the ones with the darkest stains.<br /> -3rd baby: Boys can wear pink, can't they? </p>
<p>Worries<br /> -1st baby: At the first sign of distress--a whimper, a frown--you pick up the baby.<br /> -2nd baby: You pick the baby up when her wails threaten to wake your firstborn.<br /> -3rd baby: You teach your 3-year-old how to rewind the mechanical swing. </p>
<p>Activities<br /> -1st baby: You take your infant to Baby Gymnastics, Baby Swing, and Baby Story Hour.<br /> -2nd baby: You take your infant to Baby Gymnastics.<br /> -3rd baby: You take your infant to the supermarket and the dry cleaner. </p>
<p>Going Out<br /> -1st baby: The first time you leave your baby with a sitter, you call home 5 times.<br /> -2nd baby: Just before you walk out the door, you remember to leave a number where you can be reached.<br /> -3rd baby: You leave instructions for the sitter to call only if she sees blood. </p>
<p>At Home<br /> -1st baby: You spend a good bit of every day just gazing at the baby.<br /> -2nd baby: You spend a bit of every day watching to be sure your older child isn't squeezing, poking, or hitting the baby.<br /> -3rd baby: You spend a little bit of every day hiding from the children. </p>

23836,"<p>An old farmer is outside for a walk around his land when he  sees a sign on his neighbour's lawn; 'Horse for Sale'. Curious,  he decides to have a look-see. As he approaches his  neighbour's stable, he sees his old Italian friend brushing down  a fine-looking stallion. 'Hello friend, I saw your sign out there and came over to see  your horse for sale.' Now, the Italian farmer speaks very poor  English, but manages to answer well enough. 'Yep, yep, disa is da horse for-a sale.' 'This horse here?' quizzes the old farmer, 'Why he's a fine  horse! Why-ever would you sell him?' 'Well,' sighs the Italian farmer, 'He no looka so good  anymore.' The old farmer, convinced that his neighbour has lost his mind,  makes the sale and leads the horse across his field over to the  stable. As he taps the horse gently on the back to coax him  into the stable, he watches as the horse misses the door  completely and smacks head first into the wall. 'That ol' cheat sold me a near blind horse!' growls the old farmer. He then  proceeds to storm over across the field, reigns in hand, to give  his neighbour a piece of his mind. 'You sold me a near blind  horse you ol' cheat and you didn't even tell me!' he screams. 'Eh! I tolla you!' cries the Italian farmer, 'I say, 'he no looka so good anymore!' '</p>

23871,"<p>EUREKA! The Discovery that political conservatism is determined by the genes opens a window on a brighter tomorrow. (After all, who would actually choose to be Republican?)                     By Daniel MendelsohnThe startling discovery that affiliation with the Republican Party is genetically determined, announced by scientists in the current issue of the journal Nurture, threatens to overshadow the announcement by scientists that there might be a gene for homosexuality in men. Reports of the gene that codes for political conservatism, discovered after a long study of quintuplets in Orange County, Calif., has sent shock waves through the medical, political and golfing communities. Psychologists and psychoanalysts have long believed that Republicans' unnatural and frequently unconstitutional tendencies result from unhealthy family life -- a remarkable high percentage of Republicans had authoritarian, domineering fathers and emotionally distant mothers who didn't teach them how to be kind and gentle. But biologists have long suspected that conservatism in inherited. ""After all,"" said on author of the Nurture article, ""it's quite common for a Republican to have a brother or sister who is a Republican."" The finding has been greeted with relief by parents and friends of Republicans, who have tended to blame themselves for the political views of otherwise lovable people -- their children, friends and unindicted co-conspirators. One mother, a long time Democrat, clasped her hands in ecstasy on hearing of the findings: ""I just knew it was genetic,"" she said, seated beside her two sons, both avowed Republicans. ""I just knew nobody would actually choose that lifestyle!"" When asked what the Republican lifestyle was, she said, ""Well, you can just tell from watching TV, like at the convention in Houston: the loud outfits, the flaming xenophobia, the flamboyant demagogy -- you know."" Both sons said they had suspected their Republicanism from an early age but did not confirm it until they were in college, when they became convinced it wasn't just a phase they were going through. Despite the near certainty of the medical community about Republicanism's genetic origins, troubling issues remain. The Nurture article offered no response to the suggestion that the startling high incidence of Republicanism among siblings could result from the fact that they hare not only genes but also psychological and emotional attitudes, being the products of the same parents and family dynamics. And it remains to be explained why so many avowed Democrats are known to vote Republican occasionally -- or at least to fantasize about doing so. Polls show that three out of five adult Democrats admit to having had a Republican experience. In well-adjusted people, however, this experimentation rarely outlasts adolescence. Surprisingly, some Republican activists hail the findings as a step forward rather that as an invitation to more conservophobia. They agree than since Republicans didn't ""choose"" their unwholesome lifestyle any more that someone ""chooses"" to have a ski-jump nose, they shouldn't be denied civil rights to which normal people are entitled. Other Republicans, recalling 19th century studies that ""proved"" the mental inferiority of blacks, find the frenzied search for the biological cause of Republicanism pointless, if not downright sinister. But for most real Americans, the discovery opens a window on a brighter tomorrow. In a few years, gene therapy could eradicate Republicanism altogether. If conservatism is not the result of sheer orneriness (as many suspect) but is something Republicans can't help and probably even don't like, there's no reason why we shouldn't tolerate Republicans in the military or even high elected office -- provided they don't flaunt their political beliefs.</p>

23877,"<p>One day, a cat dies of natural causes and goes to heaven, where he meets Saint Peter himself. Saint Peter says to the cat, ""You lived a good life, and if there is any way I can make your stay in heaven more comfortable, please let me know."" The cat thinks for a moment and says, ""Peter, all my life I have lived with a poor family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor."" Saint Peter stops the cat and says, ""Say no more,"" and a wonderful, fluffy pillow appears. A few days later, six mice are killed in a tragic farming accident, and all of them go to heaven. Again, Saint Peter is there to greet them with the same offer. The mice answer, ""All our lives we have been chased. We have had to run from cats, dogs, and even women with brooms. Running, running, running; we're tired of running. Do you think we could have roller skates so that we don't have to run anymore?"" Saint Peter says, ""Say no more"" and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller skates. About a week later, Saint Peter stops by to see the cat and finds him snoozing on the pillow. Saint Peter gently wakes the cat and asks him, ""How are things since you got here?"" The cat stretches and yawns, then replies, ""It is wonderful here. Better than I could have ever expected. And those 'Meals On Wheels' you've been sending by are the best!""</p>

23878,"<p>A Preacher went to his church office on Monday morning and discovered a dead donkey in the church yard. He called the police.<br /> Since there did not appear to be any foul play, the police referred the Preacher to the health department.</p>

<p>The mayor did not disappoint. He immediately began to rant &amp; rave at the pastor and finally said, ""Why did you call me any way? Isn't it your job to bury the dead?""</p>

23879,"<p>12 Tips From Workforce to Managers </p>
<p>1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 5:00 and then bring it to me. The challenge of a deadline is refreshing. </p>
<p>2.If it's really a ""rush job,"" run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to inquire how it's going. That helps. </p>
<p>3.Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where you are. </p>
<p>4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books or supplies, don't open the door for me. I need to learn how to function as a paraplegic and this is good training. </p>
<p>5. If you give me more that one job to do, don't tell me which is the priority. Let me guess. </p>
<p>6. Do your best to keep me late. I like the office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do. Beside, having no life will help prepare me for making partner. </p>
<p>7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. Leaks like that could cost me a promotion. </p>
<p>8. If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in conversation. </p>
<p>9. If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done. </p>
<p>10.Never introduce me to the people you're with. When you refer to them later, my shrewd deduction powers will identify them. </p>
<p>11. Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could really change your life. </p>
<p>12. Tell me all your little problems. None of us have any and it's nice to know someone is less fortunate.</p>

23890,"<p>If you send this message off to 20 people within the next 4 days, and each of them send this letter off to 20 other people within 4 days... </p>
<p>In 40 days, approx. 10 trillion of these messages will cross the internet. </p>
<p>From day 40 to day 44, an additional 200 trillion of these messages will cross the internet, at an average of 50 trillion messages per day. </p>
<p>From day 44 to 48, an additional 4,000 trillion of these messages will cross the internet, at an average of 1,000 trillion messages a day, 41.7 trillion messages per hour, 694 billion messages per minute, or 11.6 billion messages per second. Of course, the internet will have ground to a complete halt way before then, and a good thing too, because by day 44 (assuming each man, woman and child in the world is tied to the internet) you would have to respond to about 2 chain mail letters per second, sending off 20 responses each second, giving you 5/100 of a second to send each message. </p>
<p>If you drop the ball, you will break about 1,800,000 chain letters per day, bringing almost two million times the bad luck upon yourself than if you broke the first chain letter to begin with. </p>

23920,"<p>A little corporate humor<br /> ----------------------<br /> I took some friends out to dinner last week, and I noticed a spoon in the shirt pocket of our waiter as he handed us the menus. It seemed a little  odd, but I dismissed it as a random thing. Until our busboy came with  water &amp; tableware; he too, sported a spoon in his breast pocket. I looked  around the room, and all the waiters, waitresses, busboys, etc. had spoons in  their pockets.</p>
<p>When our waiter returned to take our order, I just had to ask, ""Why the spoons?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" he explained, ""our parent company recently hired some Andersen<br /> Consulting efficiency experts to review all our procedures, and after<br /> months  of statistical analyses, they concluded that our patrons drop<br /> spoons on the floor 73% more often than any other utensil; at a frequency of 3 spoons per hour per workstation. By preparing all our workers for this contingency in advance, we can cut our trips to the kitchen down and save time...nearly 1.5 extra man-hours per shift.<br /> Just as he concluded, a ""ch-ching"" came from the table  behind him,  and he quickly replaced a fallen spoon with the one from his pocket.<br /> ""I'll grab another spoon the next time I'm in the kitchen instead of<br /> making a special trip,"" he proudly  explained.<br /> I was impressed.  ""Thanks. I  had to ask.""<br /> ""No problem,"" he answered, then he continued to take our orders.</p>
<p>As the members of my dinner party took their turns, my eyes darted<br /> back &amp; forth from each person ordering and my menu. That's when, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a thin, black thread protruding from our waiter's fly. Again, I  dismissed it; yet I had to scan the room and,  sure enough, there were other waiters &amp; busboys with strings hanging out of their trousers.<br /> My curiosity overrode discretion at this point, so before he could leave I had to ask. ""Excuse me, but...uh...why, or what...about that string?""<br /> ""Oh, yeah"" he began in a quieter tone. ""Not many people are that observant. That same efficiency group found we could save time in the Men's room, too."" ""How's that, I asked?""<br /> ""You see, by tying a string to the end of our, eh. . ., selves, we can<br /> pull it out at the urinals literally hands-free and thereby eliminate<br /> the need to wash our hands, cutting time spent in the restroom by over<br /> 93%!"" ""Oh, that makes sense,"" I said, but then thinking through the<br /> process, I asked, ""Hey, wait a minute.  If the string helps you pull it out, how do you get it back in?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" he whispered, ""I don't know about the other guys; but I use<br /> the spoon in my pocket""!</p>

23921,"<p>Be sure to read the warning at the bottom.</p>
<p>Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is sexually active or not?</p>
<p>1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when women<br /> make love they produce amounts of the hormone estrogen, which makes hair<br /> shine and skin smooth.</p>
<p>2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses the pores and makes your skin glow.</p>
<p>3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that<br /> romantic dinner.</p>
<p>4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches and<br /> tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable than<br /> swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!</p>
<p>5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases endorphins into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well-being.</p>
<p>6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually<br /> active body gives off greater  quantities of chemicals called pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!</p>
<p>7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE<br /> EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.</p>
<p>8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages<br /> saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid that<br /> causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.</p>
<p>9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release<br /> the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.</p>
<p>10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a natural<br /> antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever. </p>
<p>This message has been sent to you for good luck in sex. The original is in a room in Palaiseau. It has been sent around the world nine times.</p>

<p>This is no joke! Send copies to people you think need sex (who doesn't?). Don't send money, as the fate of your genitals has no price.<br /> Do not keep this message. </p>
<p>This message must leave your e-mail in 96 hours. Please send ten copies and see what happens in four days. </p>

<p>FBI agents conducted a raid of a psychiatric hospital in San Diego that was<br /> under investigation for medical insurance fraud. After hours of reviewing<br /> thousands of medical records, the dozens of agents had worked up quite an<br /> appetite. The agent in charge of the investigation called a nearby pizza parlor<br /> with delivery service to order a quick dinner for his colleagues. </p>
<p>The following telephone conversation took place and was recorded by the FBI<br /> because they were taping all conversations at the hospital. </p>
<p>Agent: Hello. I would like to order 19 large pizzas and 67 cans of soda. </p>
<p>Pizza Man: And where would you like them delivered? </p>
<p>Agent: We're over at the psychiatric hospital. </p>
<p>Pizza Man: The psychiatric hospital? </p>
<p>Agent: That's right. I'm an FBI agent. </p>
<p>Pizza Man: You're an FBI agent? </p>
<p>Agent: That's correct. Just about everybody here is. </p>
<p>Pizza Man: And you're at the psychiatric hospital? </p>
<p>Agent: That's correct. And make sure you don't go through the front doors. We<br /> have them locked. You will have to go around to the back to the service entrance<br /> to deliver the pizzas. </p>
<p>Pizza Man: And you say you're all FBI agents? </p>
<p>Agent: That's right. How soon can you have them here? </p>
<p>Pizza Man: And everyone at the psychiatric hospital is an FBI agent? </p>
<p>Agent: That's right. We've been here all day and we're starving. </p>
<p>Pizza Man: How are you going to pay for all of this? </p>
<p>Agent: I have my checkbook right here. </p>
<p>Pizza Man: And you're all FBI agents? </p>
<p>Agent: That's right. Everyone here is an FBI agent. Can you remember to bring<br /> the pizzas and sodas to the service entrance in the rear? We have the front<br /> doors locked. </p>
<p>Pizza Man: I don't think so.</p>

On his way there two nuns look at him and he says, ""Good morning sisters"" and they reply in a sing song manner, ""You got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning."" This stuns the priest who thought he had been very polite but he just goes on. He encounters a Brother a little while later along the way and he says,""Good morning Brother."" The Brother replies in a sing song voice, ""You got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning."" The priest looks confused at all this but goes on. He gets a little farther and he comes across a fellow priest and he says, ""Good morning Father."" the priest replies in a sing song manner, ""You got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning."" Now the priest was mad. He continues his walk to the dining hall not saying a word to anyone. The Bishop sees him and says, ""Father ..."" The young priest was not going to take any more even from the bishop. He looks at the bishop and says, ""No I did not get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning."" The bishop looks at him stunned and says ""What?"" The priest realised his mistake and said ""I am sorry your holiness, what is it you want.""The Bishop looks at him and says, ""All I was going to do was ask you why you had on Sister Ann's shoes?""</p>

I was speeding, and a cop pulled me over. He asked<br /> where I lived. I said, ""right here, officer"". Later, I parked it<br /> on the freeway, got out, and yelled at all the cars, ""Get out of<br /> my driveway!</p>
<p>My house is on the median strip of a highway. You don't really<br /> notice, except I have to leave the driveway doing 60 MPH.</p>

<p>I had to stop driving my car for a while...the tires got dizzy. </p>
<p>I used to work in a fire hydrant factory. You couldn't park<br /> anywhere near the place. </p>

<p>I saw a sign: ""Rest Area 25 Miles"". That's pretty big. Some<br /> people must be really tired. </p>
<p>A cop stopped me for speeding. He said, ""Why were you going so<br /> fast?"" I said, ""See this thing my foot is on? It's called an<br /> accelerator. When you push down on it, it sends more gas to the<br /> engine. The whole car just takes right off. And see this thing?<br /> This steers it."" </p>
<p>I was going 70 miles an hour and got stopped by a cop who said,<br /> ""Do you know the speed limit is 55 miles per hour?"" ""Yes,<br /> officer, but I wasn't going to be out that long..."" </p>
<p>One time a cop pulled me over for running a stop sign. He said,<br /> ""Didn't you see the stop sign?"" I said, ""Yeah, but I don't<br /> believe everything I read."" </p>

<p>4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is<br /> not strong enough to rotate a 42-pound boy wearing Batman<br /> underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough,<br /> however, to spread paint on all four walls of a large room. </p>
<p>5. When using the ceiling fan as a baseball bat, you have<br /> to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A<br /> ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. </p>

<p>14. Pool filters do not like Jell-O. </p>
<p>15. VCRs do not eject PB&amp;J sandwiches even though TV<br /> commercials show they do. </p>
<p>16. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000<br /> sq. foot house 4 inches deep. </p>

23991,"<p>A businessman is on a high profile trip to Japan to meet a very prestigious client. For him this is the deal of the century, he does not want to mess it up. This deal could really put his company on the map. Bearing this in mind he flies over a night early so he can get his head together and prepare for the big meeting in the morning. As he checks into the hotel he notices some stunning oriental girls hanging around the reception but doesn't give it a second thought. When he's settled in his room with everything prepared for the morning he decides to order from room service a little night-cap. </p>
<p>As he browses the menu he realises the girls in the reception are on the menu as well. He thinks to himself, it has been a long time since he's been with a woman. He been so wrapped up in his work lately there's been no time for relationships. Also it would put a spring in his step and put him in a better frame of mind for the following days events. After studying the menu he orders a scotch and coke and a girl called Melissa. Well it's not long before there down to business and he hasn't lost any of his magic. He's giving the performance of a lifetime he's got the girl practically screaming. As she bites her lip she shouts out in Japanese ""Ho chee!, Ho chee!"". Wow! She's loving it. Once its all over he pays the girl and goes to sleep satisfied and kinda proud that he still got what it takes. </p>
<p>The following morning he's up bright and early to meet the client. He was expecting a high pressure board meeting but is pleasantly surprised to discover that he shall be conducting business during a round of golf, how civilised. During the round he is discussing his product with Mr Meagi the CEO of Japans largest corporation. </p>
<p>Everything is looking very favourable and he's sure he's clinched the deal. On the 18th hole Mr Meagi plays a fantastic shot and gets a hole in one from over 500 yards. Knowing that this is his last opportunity to praise the man the businessman he gives it his best shot. The whole days business has been conducted in English and as a gesture of respect the businessman decides to try and congratulate the man in Japanese. </p>
<p>He wracks his brains and remembers what the hooker was screaming last night. (She was truly impressed) So he says to Mr Meagi ""Ho chee Sir, Ho chee"". </p>
<p>To which Mr Meagi furiously replies ""Wot you mean wong hole?""</p>

23992,"<p>John went to Dr. Smith because of intense migraine headaches.</p>
<p>The doctor tried many things, but no relief. Finally, after many visits, the doc sat down and said, ""You know, John, why don't you try something unusual. Why don't you do something that I always do when I have a headache like that. I phone my wife and tell her I'm coming home; she waits for me in the bedroom, with her blouse off, and I nestle my head between those two beautiful breasts and soon the headache disappears! You ought to try something like that--I don't know what else to do for you. It wouldn't hurt.""</p>
<p>""Well I might try something like that,"" said John.</p>
<p>A month later, John is back in the clinic, seeing another doctor on another unrelated matter, and he and Dr. Smith pass each other in the hallway. ""John!"" says the doc, ""Haven't seen you in a while! How's those headaches?""</p>
<p>""Great! They're all gone! Thanks for your advice!"" said John.</p>
<p>""Hey, that's fantastic!"" said Dr. Smith, walking on down the hallway.</p>

23993,"<p>A Polak wanted to learn how to sky dive. He got an instructor and<br /> started lessons. The instructor told the Polak to jump out of the<br /> plane and pull his rip cord. The instructor then explained that he<br /> himself would jump out right behind him so that they would go down<br /> together. The Polak understood and was ready.</p>
<p>The time came to have the Polak jump from the air plane. The<br /> instructor reminded the Polak that he would be right behind him. The<br /> Polak proceeded to jump from the plane and after being in the air<br /> for a few seconds pulled the rip cord. The instructor followed by<br /> jumping from the plane. The instructor pulled his rip cord but the<br /> parachute did not open. The instructor, frantically trying to get<br /> his parachute open, darted past the Polak.</p>
<p>The Polak seeing this yelled, as he undid the straps to his<br /> parachute, ""So you wanna race, eh?""</p>

23995,"<p>A man walked into a crowded doctor's office. As he approached the desk,<br /> the receptionist asked ""Yes sir, may we help you?"" </p>
<p>""There's something wrong with my dick."" He replied.</p>
<p>The receptionist became aggravated and said, ""You shouldn't come into a<br /> crowded office and say things like that.""</p>
<p>""Why not? You asked me what was wrong and I told you."" He said.</p>
<p>""We do not use language like that here."" She said. ""Please go outside and<br /> come back in and say that there's something wrong with your ear or<br /> whatever.""</p>
<p>The man shrugged his shoulders, walked out, waited several minutes and<br /> re-entered. The receptionist smiled smugly and asked, ""Yes?""</p>
<p>""There's something wrong with my ear."" He stated.</p>

"
23996,"<p>Absent Minded: Opens his vest, pulls out his tie, and pisses in his pants.</p>
<p>Clever: Uses no hands, shows off by fixing tie with both hands, looks around for admiration, and sometimes ends up pissing on the floor and onto his shoes.</p>
<p>Cross-eyed: Looks into urinal on the left, pisses into the one in the center, and flushes the one on the right.</p>
<p>Desperate: Waits in a long time, teeth floating and feet shuffling.  Starts to piss as he walks up to urinal but before he can unzip himself. Lets out a long groan and grunt as he finally gets to relieve himself.</p>
<p>Disgruntled: Stands for a while, grunts, gives up, and walks away.</p>
<p>Drunk: Holds left thumb in right hand and pisses into his pants.</p>
<p>Easily induced: Any thought, mention, sight, or slosh of a liquid, from sipping coffee to a runny nose, causes bladder to immediately signal full condition.</p>
<p>Efficient: Waits until he has to crap, then does both at once.</p>
<p>Erect: Either because his bladder is full or he just saw a sexy woman, his penis is so erect that he must thrust his buttocks backward a bit to be able to pull his member out of his pants. Gets pubic hair caught up in his zipper.</p>
<p>Excitable: Shorts half twisted around, cannot find the hole, and ends up ripping his shorts or jamming the zipper into his shirttail.</p>
<p>Flashy: Tells loud jokes while pissing; shakes off drops with a great flourish.</p>
<p>Frivolous: Plays stream up and down and across the urinal.  Likes to see how many bubbles he can make froth up. Tries to hit and sink the cigarette floating around in the water. Has never really grown up.</p>
<p>Indifferent: If all the urinals are being used, he goes into a toilet stall to piss. If all the toilet stalls are taken also, he pisses into the sink or garbage can.</p>

<p>Scientific: Backs up from the urinal to take a long shot, misses, and pisses on shoes.</p>
<p>Slob: Does not bother to flush urinal after using it, drips all over his shoes and pants when zipping himself back up, and does not bother to wash hands as he leaves with his fly undone. Usually has to adjust his balls afterwards as he is sitting down.</p>
<p>Sneak: Farts silently while pissing, acts very innocent, and knows that the man next to him will be blamed.</p>
<p>Sociable: Joins friends in piss whether he has to go or not.</p>
<p>Timid: Cannot urinate if someone is watching, pretends to, and then flushes the urinal as if he has already used it. Sneaks back in once everyone has left the restroom.</p>
<p>Tough: Bangs dick against side of urinal to dry it.</p>
<p>Worried: Is not sure of what he has been into lately and makes a quick inspection.</p>

23998,"<p>A guy arrives at the pearly gates, waiting to be admitted. St. Peter is reading through the Big Book to see if the guy's name is written in it. </p>
<p>After several minutes, St. Peter closes the book, furrows his brow, and says, ""I'm sorry, I don't see your name written in the Book.""</p>
<p>""How current is your copy?"" he asks.</p>
<p>""I get a download every ten minutes,"" St. Peter replies, ""why do you ask?""</p>
<p>""I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I was always the stubborn type. It was not until my death was imminent that I cried out to God, so my name probably hasn't arrived to your copy yet.""</p>
<p>""I'm glad to hear that,"" Pete says, ""but while we're waiting for the update to come through, can tell me about a really good deed that you did in your life?""</p>
<p>The guys thinks for a moment and says, ""Humm, well there was this one time when I was driving down a road and I saw a group of biker gang members harassing this poor girl. </p>
<p>I slowed down, and sure enough, there they were, about 20 of them harassing this poor woman. </p>
<p>Infuriated, I got out my car, grabbed a tire iron out of my trunk, and walked up to the leader of the gang. He was a huge guy, 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, with a studded leather jacket and a chain running from his nose to his ears. </p>
<p>As I walked up to the leader, the bikers formed a circle around me and told me to get lost or I'd be next.""</p>
<p>""So I ripped the leader's chain out of his face and smashed him over the head with the tire iron. </p>
<p>Then I turned around and yelled to the rest of them, ""Leave this poor innocent girl alone! You're all a bunch of SICK, deranged animals! Go home before I really teach you a lesson in PAIN!""</p>

<p>He died abruptly under strange circumstances and the funeral had<br /> a closed casket. After the burial, the wife went straight to the<br /> local bar and began to party as if there was no tomorrow.</p>
<p>The gaiety of her actions were becoming extreme while her<br /> neighbors approached in a group to ask these questions, ""Are you<br /> not afraid, concerned, worried, that this man who practiced<br /> black magic and stated when he died he would dig his way up and<br /> out of the grave to come back and haunt you for the rest of your<br /> life?""</p>
