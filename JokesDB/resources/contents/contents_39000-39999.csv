39064,"<p>Here are a few problems and solutions you may encounter with<br /> your wife.</p>
<p>Problem: Your wife wants more foreplay during sex, and you<br /> arent really the man for the job.</p>
<p>Solution: Show up with 2 other girls in the bedroom and tell<br /> her you didnt understand her, you thought she meant ""four-play.""</p>
<p>********************<br /> Problem: Shes always buying too many damn pairs of shoes.</p>
<p>Solution: On her birthday, paint a few of her existing shoes a<br /> different color and wrap them up, that might keep your bank<br /> account at more that 2 digits.</p>
<p>********************<br /> Problem: Shes always drooling over some good-looking<br /> celebrity like Brad Pitt, and she indirectly tells you that you<br /> should be more like him.</p>
<p>Solution: Casually mention to her that Pamela Anderson Lee<br /> looks so great with her breast implants, your wife probably will<br /> never have tits as suculant as that, and it should shut her up<br /> for a while.</p>
<p>********************<br /> Problem: Shes into torture sex (whips, phone cord, handcuffs)<br /> but its not what you think, she wants to torture YOU.</p>
<p>Solution: Check out as many Harry Houdini books at the library<br /> as possible.</p>
<p>********************<br /> Problem: During the night, without noticing it, your wife<br /> takes more than her share of the blanket, and you're always<br /> feeling like a damn eskimo in the middle of the night, freezing<br /> your ass off.</p>
<p>Solution: Slowly and carefully place the bathroom rug on top<br /> of her while shes asleep. Then with your greatest stealth, pull<br /> all of the blanket on your side for a good nights sleep.</p>

39145,"<p>Beheading of Osama�s dick<br /> ----------------------------------<br /> Osama Bin Laden lost his penus when he was 12 years old. His father is responsible for beheading it because his wife ran away with Mohamad Attar who later found out that she was really a she-male. Mohamad Attar got terrified of that matter and asked US citizenship which the US government successfully granted to him. Unfortunately, while he was on the way to US, he got a job from a quite a dickless asshole.<br /> Osama now hiding away from straight people. Every night, he bends down in the bushes of Taliban. Almost every night, in stinky holes which Osama hides, he tells his gay stories to his fellow dicks. Sometimes, they just pull his lice living beard and slap him silly couple times and tell him �FUCK YOU!�  Or, moon him with their shit hanging desert-no-water asses until he shouts �MERCY!�.  From the day his father beheaded his hideous miniature penus, he got married to several different gay morons. Every one of them left him just after he opened his worm living mouth because it is just dead smells like holy pig shit.</p>

<p>You know the book Men are from Mars, Women from Venus? Well,<br /> here's a prime example of that. This assignment was actually<br /> turned in by two of my English students: Rebecca (last name<br /> deleted) and Gary (last name deleted).</p>

<p>In class Assignment for Wednesday:</p>
<p>Today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem<br /> story. The process is simple. Each person will pair off with the<br /> person sitting to his or her immediate right. One of you will<br /> write the first paragraph of a short story. The partner will<br /> read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the<br /> story. The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so<br /> on back and forth. Remember to re-read what has been written<br /> each time in order to keep the story coherent. The story is over<br /> when both agree a conclusion has been reached. And now, the<br /> Assignment as submitted by</p>
<p>Rebecca &amp; Gary:</p>
<p>At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted.<br /> The chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings<br /> at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said in<br /> happier times, that he liked chamomile. But she felt she must<br /> now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl. His possessiveness<br /> was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her<br /> asthma started acting up again. So chamomile was out of the<br /> question.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack<br /> squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things<br /> to think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic<br /> bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over<br /> a year ago. ""A.S. Harris to Geostation 17,"" he said into his<br /> transgalactic communicator. ""Polar orbit established. No sign of<br /> resistance so far..."". But before he could sign off a bluish<br /> particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through<br /> his ship's cargo bay. The jolt from the direct hit sent him<br /> flying out of his seat and across the cockpit.</p>
<p>He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before<br /> he felt one last pang of regret for physically brutalizing the<br /> one woman who had ever had feelings for him. Soon afterwards,<br /> Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful<br /> farmers of Skylon 4. ""Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing<br /> War and Space Travel"", Laurie read in her newspaper one morning.<br /> The news simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared<br /> out the window, dreaming of her youth when the days had passed<br /> unhurriedly and carefree, with no newspapers to read, no<br /> television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at<br /> all the beautiful things around her. ""Why must one lose one's<br /> innocence to become a woman?"", she pondered wistfully.</p>
<p>Little did she know, but she has less than 10 seconds to live.<br /> Thousands of miles above the city, the Anu-udrian mothership<br /> launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles. The<br /> dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace<br /> Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless<br /> target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to<br /> destroy the human race. Within two hours after the passage of<br /> the treaty the Anu-udrian ships were on course for Earth,<br /> carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet. With<br /> no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical<br /> plan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere<br /> unimpeded. The President, in his top-secret mobile submarine<br /> headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the<br /> inconceivably massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 85<br /> million other Americans. The President slammed his fist on the<br /> conference table. ""We can't allow this! I'm going to veto that<br /> treaty! Let's blow 'em out of the sky!""</p>

He just felt<br /> so good, he went out and cornered a small monkey and roared at him: ""WHO IS THE<br /> MIGHTIEST OF ALL THE JUNGLE ANIMALS?""<br /> This poor quaking little monkey replied: ""You are of course, no one is<br /> mightier than you.""<br /> A little while later this tiger confronts a deer, and just bellows out: ""WHO<br /> IS THE GREATEST AND STRONGEST OF ALL THE JUNGLE ANIMALS?""<br /> The deer is shaking so hard it can barely speak, but manages to stammer: ""Oh<br /> great tiger, you are by far the mightiest animal in the jungle.""<br /> The tiger, being on a roll, swaggered, up to an elephant that was quietly<br /> munching on some weeds, and roared at the top of his voice: ""WHO IS THE<br /> MIGHTIEST OF ALL THE ANIMALS IN THE JUNGLE?""<br /> Well, this elephant grabs the tiger with his trunk, picks him up, slams him<br /> down; picks him up again, and shakes him until the tiger is just a blur of<br /> orange and black, and finally throws him violently into a nearby tree.<br /> The tiger staggers to his feet and looks at the elephant and says: ""Man, just<br /> because you don't know the answer, you don't have to get so mad.""</p>

39212,"<p>There is a new virus going around, called 'work'. If you receive any sort of 'work' at all, whether via email, internet or simply handed to you by a colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT. </p>
<p>Work has been circulating around our building for months and those who have been tempted to open 'work' or even look at 'work' have found that their social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly. </p>
<p>If you do encounter 'work' via email or are faced with any 'work' at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words 'Sorry...I'm off to the pub'. The 'work' should automatically be deleted from your brain. </p>
<p>If you receive 'work' in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the 'work' to your garbage can. Put on your coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three pints of beer. </p>
<p>After repeating this action 14 times, you will find that 'work' will no longer be of any relevance to you. </p>
<p>Send this message to everyone in your address book. If you do not have anyone in your address book, then I'm afraid the 'work' virus has already corrupted your life.</p>

39219,"<p>One sunny day Jesus, Moses and a small, elderly man were playing golf. </p>
<p>Jesus was the first to tee off and he hit the ball a little left and it ended<br /> up in the water hazard. Because it was Jesus, his ball floated and when he got<br /> down to the hazard he walked upon the water and hit the ball onto the green. </p>
<p>Moses was the next to tee off, and like Jesus he hit the ball into the water<br /> hazard. When he got down to the hazard, he parted the waters and hit the ball<br /> onto the green. </p>
<p>The little old man was next, and he too hit into the water hazard. Just then a<br /> big fish swallowed the ball and began to swim away. A hawk swooped down and<br /> grabbed the fish in its talons and started to fly off. As the hawk passed over<br /> the green, it tightened its grip on the fish which caused the ball to pop out of<br /> the fish. The ball landed on the green and rolled into cup. </p>
<p>Jesus then turned to the old man and said, ""Look Dad, if you're going to play,<br /> play fair.""</p>
"
39220,"<p>Psychologists have discovered that the manner in which people eat Oreo<br /> cookies provides great insight into their personalities. Choose which<br /> method best describes your favorite method of eating Oreos:</p>
<p>1. The whole thing all at once.</p>
<p>2. One bite at a time</p>
<p>3. Slow and methodical nibbles, examining the results of each bite<br /> afterwards.</p>
<p>4. In little feverish nibbles.</p>
<p>5. Dunked in some liquid (milk, coffee...).</p>
<p>6. Twisted apart, the inside, then the cookie.</p>
<p>7. Twisted apart, the inside, and toss the cookie.</p>
<p>8. Just the cookie, not the inside.</p>
<p>9. I just like to lick them, not eat them.</p>
<p>10. I don't have a favorite way because I don't like Oreos.</p>
<p>Your Personality:</p>
<p>1. The whole thing. This means you consume life with abandon, you are fun<br /> to be with, exciting, carefree with some hint of recklessness. You are<br /> totally irresponsible. No one should trust you with their children.</p>
<p>2. One bite at a time. You are lucky to be one of the 5.4 billion other<br /> people who eat their Oreo's this very same way. Just like them, you lack<br /> imagination, but that's ok, not to worry, you're ""normal"".</p>
<p>3. Slow and methodical. You follow the rules. You're very tidy and<br /> orderly. You're very meticulous in every detail with every thing you do to<br /> the point of being anal retentive and irritating to others. Stay out of<br /> the fast lane if you're only going to go the speed limit.</p>
<p>4. Feverish nibbles. Your boss likes you because you get your work done<br /> quickly. You always have a million things to do and never enough time to<br /> do them. Mental break downs and suicides run in your family. Valium and<br /> Ritalin would do you good.</p>
<p>5. Dunked. Every one likes you because you are always upbeat. You like to<br /> sugar-coat unpleasant experiences and rationalize bad situations into good<br /> ones. You are in total denial about the shambles you call a life. You have<br /> a propensity towards narcotic addiction.</p>
<p>6. Twisted apart, the inside, and then the cookie. You have a highly<br /> curious nature. You take pleasure in breaking things apart to find out how<br /> they work, though not always able to put them back together, so you<br /> destroy all the evidence of your activities. You deny your involvement<br /> when things go wrong. You are a compulsive liar and exhibit deviant, if<br /> not criminal, behavior.</p>
<p>7. Twisted apart, the inside, and then toss the cookie. You are good at<br /> business and take risk that pay off. You take what you want and throw the<br /> rest away. You are greedy,selfish, mean, and lack feelings for others. You<br /> should be ashamed of yourself. But that's ok, you don't care, you got<br /> yours.</p>
<p>8. Just the cookie, not the inside. You enjoy pain.</p>
<p>9. I just like to lick them, not eat them. Stay away from small furry<br /> animals and seek professional medical help immediately.</p>
<p>10. I don't have a favorite way, I don't like Oreo cookies. You probably<br /> come from a rich family, and like to wear nice things, and go to upscale<br /> restaurants. You are particular and fussy about the things you buy, own,<br /> and wear. Things have to be just right. You like to be pampered. You are a<br /> prima donna. There's just no pleasing you. Kill yourself now.</p>

39221,"<p>Woman B. J. Etiquette Rules</p>
<p>1.  First and foremost, we are not obligated to do it.</p>
<p>2.  Extension to rule #1 - So if you get one, be grateful.</p>
<p>3.  I don't care WHAT they did in the porn video you saw; it is not standard practice to cum on someone's face.</p>
<p>4.  Extension to rule #3 - No, I DON'T have to swallow.</p>
<p>5.  My ears are NOT handles.</p>
<p>6.  Extension to rule #5 - do not push on the top of my head. Do you really WANT puke on you?</p>
<p>7.  I don't care HOW relaxed you get; it is NEVER OK to fart.</p>
<p>8.  Having my period does not mean that it's ""hummer week"" - get it through your head - I'm bloated and I feel like shit so no, I don't feel particularly obligated to blow you just because YOU can't have sex right now.</p>
<p>9.  Extension to #8 - ""Blue Balls"" might have worked on high school girls! If you're that desperate, go jerk off and leave me alone with my Midol.</p>
<p>10. If I have to pause to remove a pubic hair from my teeth, don't tell me I've just ""wrecked it"" for you.</p>
<p>11. Leaving me in bed while you go play video games immediately afterwards is highly inadvisable if you would like my behavior to be repeated in the future.</p>
<p>12. If you like how we do it, it's probably best not to speculate about the origins of our talent. Just enjoy the moment and be happy that we're good at it. See also rule #2 about gratitude.</p>
<p>13. No, it doesn't particularly taste good. And I don't care about the protein content.</p>
<p>14. No, I will NOT do it while you watch TV.</p>
<p>15. When you hear your friends complain about how they don't get B. J.  often enough, keep your mouth shut. It is inappropriate to either sympathize or brag.</p>
<p>16. Just because ""it's awake"" when you get up does not mean I have to ""kiss it good morning"".</p>
<p>Man's reply to Woman's B. J. Etiquette</p>
<p>1.  First of all, yes you are obligated to do it. if you don't, we will find someone (younger, prettier, and dirtier) who will.</p>
<p>2.  Second, swallowing a teaspoon full of cream is a hell of a lot easier than licking a dead fish</p>
<p>3.  You want to talk about farting? Does the word ""queef"" mean anything to you?</p>
<p>4.  I will use your ears as I see fit. Don't worry about it &amp; be thankful I'm not pulling your hair.</p>
<p>5.  If you ever tell me what to say &amp; not to say to my friends again, you won't have to worry about getting those little hairs stuck in your teeth...because you won't have any.</p>
<p>6.  Maybe if you brushed your teeth &amp; got the smell off your breath we would stick around afterward.</p>
<p>7.  When you're on your period, stuffing something in your mouth is the only way to stop you from bitching &amp; moaning.</p>
<p>8.  Speaking of which, if you are bleeding for five straight days, you need all the fluids you can get, trust me.</p>
<p>9.  You bitch about the taste, but trust me when I tell you that we get the sh*t end of the stick in flavor country.</p>
<p>10. At least there is no danger of bleeding in your mouth</p>
<p>11. Play with the balls</p>
<p>12. No matter how good you think you are at it, we've had better.</p>
<p>13. B. Js are the only reason we spend time with you instead of our friends, take that away and you are, literally, useless.</p>
<p>14. Caress the ass, too, we like that.</p>
<p>15. Make hay when the sun shines. it's ""wide awake"" in the morning now, but when you get old &amp; fat (and you will) and looking for some action, gah-ron-tee it'll be ""sound asleep"".</p>
<p>16. If you swallow, then you don't have to worry about getting any on your face, now will you? Leave the thinking to us, okay?</p>

39234,"<p>Once upon a time two men had been sitting in a bar drinking for a considerable time and had started to become a wee bit inebriated and argumentative. </p>
<p>They argued about football, politics, women and so on. Eventually after more drinks they started arguing about a real guy thing, as to which of them had the largest pecker. </p>
<p>The barman was starting to get a bit irritated at all the ruckus the men were creating, but because he was used to this type of thing, said to them,<br /> ""Look, if you'll just cut out the noise, I'll be the judge of this argument.<br /> Lay your peckers on the bar and I'll tell you which is the biggest."" </p>
<p>The two men agreed to this and so they proudly laid their peckers on the bar. Just as the barman was about to give his decision, a gay fellow came in and walked up to the bar. </p>
<p>The barman told the two guys to wait a minute and turning to the gay chap said ""What can I get you?""</p>
<p>The gay chap looked down at the bar and said, ""Well I was just going to have a beer, but now I think I'll have a bit of the buffet!""</p>

39239,"<p>Never leave diskettes in the disk drive, as data can leak out of the disk and corrode the inner mechanics of the drive. Diskettes should be rolled up and stored in pencil holders.</p>
<p>Diskettes should be cleaned and waxed once a week. Microscopic metal particles can be removed by waving a powerful magnet over the surface of the disk. Any stubborn metallic shavings can be removed with scouring powder and soap. When waxing the diskettes, make sure the surface is even. This will allow the diskette to spin faster, resulting in better access time.</p>
<p>Do not fold diskettes unless they do not fit into the drive. ""Big"" diskettes may be folded and used in ""little"" disk drives.</p>
<p>Never insert a diskette into the drive upside down. The data can fall off the surface of the disk and jam the intricate mechanics of the drive.</p>
<p>Diskettes cannot be backed up by running them through the Xerox machine. If your data is going to need to be backed up, simply insert two diskettes into the drive. Whenever you update a document, the data will be written on both diskettes.</p>
<p>Diskettes should not be inserted or removed from the drive while the red light is flashing. Doing so could result in smeared or possibly unreadable text. Occasionally the red light remains flashing in what is known as a ""hung"" or ""hooked"" state. If your system is ""hooking"" you will probably need to<br /> insert a few coins before being allowed access to the slot.</p>
<p>If your diskette is full and you need more storage space, remove the disk from the drive and shake vigorously for 2 minutes. This will pack the data enough (Data Compression) to allow for more storage. Be sure to cover all the openings with scotch tape to prevent loss data.</p>
<p>Access time can be greatly improved by cutting more holes in the diskette jacket. This will provide more simultaneous access points to the disk.</p>
<p>Diskettes may be used as coasters for beverage glasses, provided that they are properly waxed beforehand. Be sure to wipe the diskettes dry before using. (see item 2 above)</p>
<p>Never use scissors and glue to manually edit documents. The data is stored much too small for the naked eye, and you may end up with data from some other document stuck in the middle of your document. Razor blades and scotch tape may be used, however, provided the user is equipped with an electron microscope.</p>
<p>Periodically spray diskettes with insecticide to prevent system bugs from spreading.</p>

Find the nearest ice rink and walk across the ice 20 times in your ski boots carrying two pairs of skis, accessory bag and poles. Pretend you are looking for your car. Sporadically drop things.

Leave the ice on your face until it melts. Let it drip into your clothes. Dress up in as many clothes as you can and then proceed to take them off because you have to go to the bathroom. Slam your thumb in a car door. Don't go see a doctor. Repeat all of the above every Saturday and Sunday until it's time for the real thing.</p>

<p>So the man ranted and raved for a bit, but after a while decided to give it one more try before he took the thing back to the shop.</p>

A few minutes later, Adam emerged and said, ''Thank you Lord, that was enjoyable.'' And the Lord replied, ''Yes Adam, I thought you might enjoy that. Now, I'd like you to caress Eve.'' And Adam said, ''What is a 'caress'?'' So, the Lord again gave Adam a brief description and Adam went behind the bush with Eve. Quite a few minutes later, Adam returned, smiling, and said, ''Lord, that was even better than the kiss.'' And the Lord said, ''You've done well Adam. And now, I want you to make love to Eve.'' And Adam asked, ''What is 'make love', Lord?'' So, the Lord again gave Adam directions and Adam went again to Eve behind the bush, but this time he re-appeared in two seconds.

Just before he re-entered the lander, however, he made the enigmatic remark, ""Good luck Mr. Gorsky."" Many people at NASA thought it was a remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs. Over the years, many people questioned Armstrong as to what the ""Good luck Mr. Gorsky"" statement meant, but Armstrong always just smiled. On July 5, 1995 in Tampa, Florida, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26 year old question to Armstrong. This time he finally responded. Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could answer the question. Armstrong explained, �When I was a kid, I was playing baseball with a friend in the backyard.  My friend hit a fly ball which landed in the front of his neighbor's bedroom windows.  My neighbors were Mr. &amp; Mrs. Gorsky.  As I leaned down to pick up the ball, I heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, ""Oral sex!  You want oral sex?! You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!""</p>

In court, he was<br /> cross-examined by the driver's lawyer:<br />     Lawyer: Samuel, you've told us all about your injuries. However, according<br /> to the accident report, you told the investigating officer at the scene that you<br /> weren't injured at all, isn't that true?""<br />     Samuel: Well ... let me explain.<br />     Lawyer: Go right ahead (thinking he now had the plaintiff on the ropes).<br /> Please tell the jury.<br />     Samuel: When the officer arrived at the scene, he first looked upon my<br /> fallen horse. Finding him injured, the officer said to me, ""Looks like he has a<br /> broken leg,"" and then he took out his weapon and shot my horse dead. The officer<br /> next looked upon me and asked how I was doing. Suffering from the same injury as<br /> my horse, I of course immediately replied, ""I'm OK!""</p>

39276,"<p>(1) Marriage is not a word. It is a sentence (a life sentence!). </p>
<p>(2) Marriage is very much like a violin; after the sweet music is over, the strings are attached. </p>
<p>(3) Marriage is love. Love is blind. Therefore marriage is an institution for the blind. </p>
<p>(4) Marriage is an institution in which a man loses his Bachelor's Degree and the woman gets her Masters. </p>
<p>(5) Marriage is a thing which puts a ring on a woman's finger and two under the man's eyes. </p>
<p>(6) Marriage certificate is just another word for a work permit. </p>
<p>(7) Marriage is not just a having a wife but also worries inherited forever. </p>
<p>(8) Marriage requires a man to prepare 4 types of ""RINGS"": The Engagement Ring, The Wedding Ring, The Suffe-Ring, The Endu-Ring </p>
<p>(9) Married life is full of excitement and frustration: (a) In the first year of marriage, the man speaks and the woman listens. (b) In the second year, the woman speaks and the man listens. (c) In the third year, they BOTH speak and the NEIGHBOURS listen. </p>
<p>(10) It is true that love is blind but marriage is definitely an eye-opener. </p>
<p>(11) Getting married is very much like going to the restaurant with friends. You order what you want, and when you see what the other fellow has, you wish you had ordered that. </p>
<p>(12) It's true that all men are born free and equal - but some of them get MARRIED! </p>
<p>(13) There was this man who muttered a few words in the church and found himself married. A year later he muttered something in his sleep and found himself divorced. </p>
<p>(14) A happy marriage is a matter of giving and taking; the husband gives and the wife takes. </p>
<p>(15) Son: How much does it cost to get married, Dad? Father: I don't know son, I'm still paying for it. Son: Is it true? Dad, I heard that in ancient China, a man doesn't know his wife until he marries. Father: That happens everywhere, son, EVERYWHERE! </p>
<p>(16) There was a man who said, ""I never knew what happiness was until I got married.... and then it was too late!"" </p>
<p>(17) Love is one long sweet dream, and marriage is the alarm clock. </p>
<p>(18) They say that when a man holds a woman's hand before marriage, it is love; after marriage it is self-defence. </p>
<p>(19) When a newly married man looks happy, we know why. But when a ten-year married man looks happy, we wonder why. </p>
<p>(20) There was this lover who said that he would go through hell for her. They got married, and now he is going through HELL.</p>

39318,"<p>There was once a man from the city who was visiting a small farm, and during this visit he saw a farmer feeding pigs in a most extraordinary manner.  The farmer would lift a pig up to a nearby apple tree, and the pig would eat the apples off the tree directly.  The farmer would move the pig from one apple to another until the pig was satisfied, then he would start again with another pig.The city man watched this activity for some time with great astonishment. Finally, he could not resist saying to the farmer, ""This is the most inefficient method of feeding pigs that I can imagine.  Just think of the time that would be saved if you simply shook the apples off the tree and let the pigs eat them from the ground!""The farmer looked puzzled and replied, ""What's time to a pig?""</p>

His mom was starting to get<br /> worried so she opened his report card and sure enough he had<br /> achieved an A in Math. </p>
<p>She was very concerned as to why he could do it now but he<br /> didn't study when he was in regular school, so she went upstairs<br /> to his room and ask him. ""Son I see you got an A in Math. Was it<br /> the discipline?"" ""No,"" he said. ""Was it the nuns?"" ""No,"" he<br /> said. ""Well, what was it then?"" she ask. The boy replied back,<br /> ""Well the first day I went to that school and saw that boy they<br /> had nailed to the plus sign. . .I was gonna get an A.""</p>

She goes Tuesday's, I go Fridays.2. We also sleep in separate beds. Hers is in Florida and mine is in  Cincinnati.3. I take my wife everywhere, but she keeps finding her way back.4. I asked my wife where she wanted to go for our anniversary.  ""Somewhere I haven't been in a long time!"" she said. So I suggested  the kitchen.5. We always hold hands. If I let go, she shops.6. She has an electric blender, electric toaster, and electric bread    maker. Then she said, ""There are too many gadgets, and no place to    sit down!"" So I bought her an electric chair.7. My wife is on a new diet. Coconuts and bananas. She hasn't lost    weight, but BOY, can she climb a tree now.8. She got a mud pack and looked great for two days. Then the mud fell off.9. She ran after the garbage truck, yelling, ""Am I too late for the  garbage?"" The driver said, ""No, jump in!""10. Remember... Marriage is the number one cause of divorce.     Statistically, 100% of all divorces started with marriage.11. I married Miss Right. I just didn't know her first name was Always.12. I haven't spoken to my wife for 18 months. I don't like to interrupt her.13. The last fight was my fault. My wife asked, ""What's on the TV?""  ... I said, 'Dust!""</p>

"
39336,"<p>Here are a few things that Americans were saying in 1959. Some<br /> of you will remember, some will only laugh...</p>
<p>* I'll tell you one thing, if things keep going the way they<br /> are, it's going to be impossible to buy a week's groceries for<br /> $20.</p>
<p>* Have you seen the new cars coming out next year? It won't be<br /> long before $2,000 will only by a used one.</p>
<p>* If cigarettes keep going up in price, I'm going to quit. A<br /> quarter a pack is ridiculous.</p>
<p>* Did you hear the post office is thinking about charging a dime<br /> just to mail a letter?</p>
<p>* If they raise the minimum wage to $1.00, nobody will be able<br /> to hire outside help at the store.</p>
<p>* When I first started driving, who would have thought gas would<br /> someday cost 30 cents a gallon? Guess we'd be better off leaving<br /> the car in the garage.</p>
<p>* Kids today are impossible. Those duck tail haircuts make it<br /> impossible to stay groomed. Next thing you know, boys will be<br /> wearing their hair as long as the girls.</p>
<p>* Pretty soon, you won't be able to buy a good 10-cent cigar.</p>
<p>* I read the other day where some scientist thinks it's possible<br /> to put a man on the moon by the end of the century.</p>
<p>* Did you see where some baseball player just signed a contract<br /> for $75,000 a year just to play ball? It wouldn't surprise me if<br /> someday they'll be making more than the President.</p>
<p>* I never thought I'd see the day all our kitchen appliances<br /> would be electric. They are even making electric typewriters now.</p>
<p>* It's too bad things are so tough nowadays. I see where a few<br /> married women have to work to make ends meet.</p>
<p>* It would be long before young couples are going to have to<br /> hire someone to watch their kids so they can both work.</p>
<p>* I'm just afraid the Volkswagen car is going to open the door<br /> to a whole lot of foreign business.</p>
<p>* Thank goodness I won't live to see the day when the government<br /> takes half our income in taxes. I sometimes wonder if we are<br /> electing the best people to Congress.</p>
<p>* The drive-in restaurant is convenient in nice weather, but I<br /> seriously doubt they will ever catch on.</p>
<p>* There is no sense going to the city for a weekend. It costs<br /> nearly $15 a night to stay in a hotel.</p>
<p>* No one can afford to be sick anymore. $35 a day in the<br /> hospital is too rich for my blood.</p>
<p>* If a few idiots want to risk their necks flying across the<br /> country, that's fine, but nothing will ever replace trains.</p>
<p>* I don't know about you, but if they raise the price of coffee<br /> to 15 cents, I'll just have to drink mine at home.</p>
<p>* If they think I'll pay 50 cents for a haircut, forget it. I'll<br /> have my wife learn to cut hair.</p>
<p>* We won't be going out much anymore. Our babysitter informed us<br /> she wants 50 cents an hour. Kids think money grows on trees.</p>

39338,"<p>A man buys several sheep, hoping to breed them for wool. After several weeks, he notices that none of the sheep are getting pregnant, and calls a veterinarian for help. The vet tells him that he should try artificial insemination.</p>
<p>The guy doesn't have the slightest idea what this means but, not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the sheep are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will instead lay down and wallow in the grass when they are pregnant.</p>
<p>The man hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means HE has to impregnate the sheep. So, he loads the sheep into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back and goes to bed.</p>
<p>Next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't take, and loads them in the truck again.</p>
<p>He drives them out to the woods, bangs each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back and goes to bed. The next morning he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around.</p>
<p>One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day shagging the sheep and, upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the sheep. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the sheep are laying in the grass.</p>
<p>""No,"" she says, ""they're all in the truck and one of them is honking the horn.""</p>

39348,"<p>A man fell asleep on the beach one day while laying on his back.  When he woke up, his legs were blood red and starting to blister.  He went to the emergency room.  The doctor stuck him with so many needles, he passed out.  When the nurse was looking over his chart, she noticed he was given morphine, hydrocortisone, and viagra.  Curious, she asked the doctor what the viagra was for.  He said, ""Oh, well he's got morphine for pain, hyforcortisone for his blisters.  The Viagra is to keep the sheet off his legs as not to cause anymore irratation then neccessary.""</p>

<p>He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. </p>
<p>The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's Mercedes back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. </p>
<p>He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking!</p>

Consequently, when on one particular day 9 A.M. passed without Johnson's arrival, it caused a sensation. All work ceased and the boss himself, looking at his watch and muttering, came out into the corridor. Finally, precisely at ten, Johnson showed up, clothes dusty and torn, his face scratched and bruised, his glasses bent. He limped painfully to the time clock, punched in, and said, aware that all eyes were upon him, ""I tripped and rolled down two flights of stairs in the subway. Nearly killed myself.""

39387,"<p>George Carlin's Reflections on Life:</p>
<p>1. Never raise your hands to you kids. It leaves your groin unprotected.</p>
<p>2. I'm not into working out. My philosophy is no pain, no pain.</p>
<p>3. I'm in shape. Round is a shape.</p>
<p>4. I'm desperately trying to figure out why Kamikaze pilots wore helmets.</p>
<p>5. Do illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup?</p>
<p>6. I've always wanted to be somebody, but I should have been more specific.</p>
<p>7. Ever notice when you blow in a dog's face he gets mad at you, but when you take him in a car he sticks his head out the window.</p>
<p>8. Ever notice that anyone going slower than you is an idiot, but going faster is a maniac?</p>
<p>9. You have to stay in shape. My mother started walking 5 miles a day when she was 60. She's 97 now and we have no idea where she is!</p>
<p>10. I have six locks on my door, all in a row. When I go out, I lock every other one. I figure no matter how long somebody stands there picking the locks, they are always locking three of them.</p>
<p>11. One out of every three Americans is suffering from some form of mental illness. Think of two of your best friends. If they are OK, then it must be you.</p>
<p>12. They show you how detergents take out bloodstains. I think if you've got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe your laundry isn't your biggest problem.</p>
<p>13. Ask people why they have deer heads on their walls and they tell you it's because they're such beautiful animals. I think my wife is beautiful, but I only have photographs of her on the wall.</p>
<p>14. A lady came up to me on the street, pointed at my suede jacket and said, ""Don't you know a cow was murdered for that jacket?""  I said, ""I didn't know there were any witnesses. Now I'll have to kill you too!""</p>
<p>15. Future historians will be able to study at the Jimmy Carter Library, the Gerald Ford Library, the Ronald Reagan Library, and the Bill Clinton Adult Bookstore.</p>

39421,"<p>This guy is setting at a bar, and he's had a lot to drink that night; he asks the bartender for another drink, but the bartender says no. </p>
<p>The guy is pretty upset by this and persists, but the bartender keeps saying no.  Finally the guy asks, ""Well isn't there anything that you can give me?""  The bartender says, ""I've got this parrot over there in the corner, sitting on a perch, with no legs.  </p>
<p>The guy interested by this asks how the parrot stays on the perch with no legs.  The bartender tells the guy that the parrot just raps his dick around the perch.  </p>
<p>The guy is amazed by this and agrees to take the bird home.  On the trip home he asks the parrot if he can talk.  The parrot says, ""Sure I can talk!""  </p>
<p>The guy thinks for a second and then says, ""I've got a job for you.  I have to go to work tomorrow and my wife will be home alone all day long.  I want you to watch her and tell me everything that happens while I'm gone.  The only person other than my wife scheduled to be there is the milk man.""  </p>

39430,"<p>""Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call. I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell.</p>
<p>After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95.<br /> I'm going to do something I've never done before. I'm going to let you decide where you want to go.""</p>
<p>Bill replied, ""Well, what's the difference between the two?""</p>
<p>God said, ""I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, to see if it will help your decision.""</p>
<p>""Fine, but where should I go first?"" Bill asked.</p>
<p>""I'll leave that up to you."" God replied.</p>
<p>""Okay then,"" said Bill, ""let's try Hell first.""</p>
<p>So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of long-legged women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun was shining; the temperature perfect. He was very pleased.</p>
<p>""This is great,"" he told God. ""If this is hell, I really want to see Heaven.""</p>
<p>""Fine,"" said God, and off they went.</p>
<p>Heaven was a place high in the clouds, beautiful and sunny, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell.</p>
<p>Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision. ""Hmmm. I think I'd prefer Hell,"" he told God.</p>
<p>""Fine,"" replied God, ""as you desire.""</p>
<p>So Bill Gates went to Hell.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, God decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell.</p>
<p>When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, surrounded with heavy thick-legged women and being burned and tortured by demons, with no one to help him out of his dilemma no matter how loud he screamed.</p>
<p>""How's everything going?"" He asked Bill.</p>
<p>Bill responded with his voice filled with anguish and tormented disappointment. ""This is awful. This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago. I can't believe this is happening. What happened to that other place, with the beaches and the long-legged women playing in the water?""</p>
<p>""Oh,"" God said, ""that was Hell 3.1. This is Hell 95.</p>

39442,"<p>An 85-year-old couple, after being married for almost 60 years, died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years, mainly due to her interest in health food and exercising. When they reached the Pearly Gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion, which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen, master bath suite and a Jacuzzi. As they looked around, the old man asked St. Peter how much all this was going to cost. ''It's free,'' St. Peter replied, ''this is Heaven.'' Next, they went out in the back yard to survey the championship-style golf course that the home was located. They would have golfing privileges every day and each week, the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, ''What are the green fees?'' St. Peter replied, ''This is heaven, you play for free.'' Next, they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisines of the World laid out. ''How much to eat?'' asked the old man. ''Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!'' St. Peter replied, with some exasperation. ''Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?'' the old man asked timidly. St. Peter lectured, ''That's the best part - you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven.'' With that, the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and screaming wildly. St. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong. The old man looked at his wife and said, ''This is all your fault! If it weren't for your blasted bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!''</p>

39446,"<p>Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him, but was moved by Arthur's youthful happiness. So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer; if, after a year, he still had no answer, he would be killed.The Question: What do women really want?Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and, to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query.Well, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess, the prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester. In all, he spoke with everyone but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What most people did tell him was to consult the old witch, as only she would know the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept her price first: The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! Young Arthur as horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage water and often made obscene noises. He had never run across such a repugnant creature. He refused to force his friend to marry her and have to endure such a burden.Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He told him that nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table.Hence, their wedding was proclaimed, and the witch answered Arthur's question:What a woman really wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life.Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it went. The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total freedom.What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief and anguish.Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old witch put her worst manners on display. She ate with her hands, belched and farted, and made everyone uncomfortable. The wedding night approached.Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific night, entered the bedroom. What a sight awaited! The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him! Gawain was astounded and asked what had happened.The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her (when she'd been a witch), half the time she would be her horrible, deformed self, and the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self. Which would he want her to be during the day and which during the night?What a cruel question! Gawain began to think of his predicament:During the day a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch? Or would he prefer having by day a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful woman to enjoy many intimate moments?What would you do?What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read until you've made your own choice................................................................Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself!Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time, because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own life.Isn't that beautiful?But really now, what is the moral of this story?If you don't respect women, things are gonna get ugly!</p>

<p>The next day the collector tried again. ""Is Fred here today?""<br /> ""No, sir,"" she said, ""I'm afraid Fred has gone for cotton.""</p>
<p>When he returned the third day he humphed, ""I suppose Fred is gone for cotton again,?""<br /> ""No,"" the woman answered solemnly, ""Fred died yesterday.""</p>
<p>Suspicious that he was being avoided, the collector decided to wait a week and investigate the cemetery himself. But sure enough, there was poor Fred's tombstone, with this inscription: ""Gone, But Not for Cotton. ""RIP, Fred.</p>

39464,"<p>Forest Gump Goes to Heaven...</p>
<p>The day finally arrived: Forest Gump dies and goes to Heaven. He is met at the Pearly Gates by Saint Peter himself. The gates are closed, however, and Forest approaches the gatekeeper.</p>
<p>Saint Peter says, ""Well, Forest, it's certainly good to see you. We have heard a lot about you."" ""I must inform you that the place is filling up fast, and we've been administering an entrance examination for everyone. The tests are fairly short, but you need to pass before you can get into Heaven.""</p>
<p>Forest responds, ""It shore is good to be here Saint Peter. I was looking forward to this."" ""Nobody ever told me about any entrance exams. Shore hope the test ain't too hard; life was a big enough test as it was.""</p>
<p>Saint Peter goes on, ""Yes, I know Forest."" ""But, the test I have for you is only three questions. Here is the first: What days of the week begin with the letter 'T'?"" ""Second, how many seconds are there in a year?"" ""Third, what is God's first name?""</p>
<p>Forest goes away to think the questions over. He returns the next day and goes up to Saint Peter to try to answer the exam questions.</p>
<p>Saint Peter waves him up and asks, ""Now that you have had a chance to think the questions over, tell me your answers.""</p>
<p>Forest says, ""Well, the first one, -how many days of the week begin with the letter 'T'?"" ""Shucks, that one's easy; that'd be Today and Tomorrow!"" The saint's eyes open wide and he exclaims, ""Forest! That's not what I was thinking, but ... you do have a point though, and I guess I didn't specify, so I give you credit for that answer.""</p>
<p>""How about the next one"" says Saint Peter, ""how many seconds in a year?""</p>
<p>""Now that one's harder,"" says Forest. ""But, I thunk and thunk about that, and I guess the only answer can be twelve.""</p>
<p>Astounded, Saint Peter says, ""Twelve!"" ""Twelve!"" ""Forest, how in Heaven's name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?""</p>
<p>Forest says, ""Shucks, there gotta be twelve: January second, February second, March second....."" ""Hold it,"" interrupts Saint Peter. ""I see where you're going with it."" ""And I guess I see your point, though that wasn't quite what I had in mind."" ""I'll give you credit for that one too.""</p>
<p>""Let's go on with the next and final question,"" says Saint Peter, ""Can you tell me God's first name?""</p>
<p>Forest says, ""Well shore, I know God's first name."" ""Everbody probly knows it."" ""It's Howard.""</p>
<p>""Howard?"" asks Saint Peter. ""What makes you think it's 'Howard'?""</p>
<p>Forest answers, ""It's in the prayer.""</p>
<p>""The prayer?"" asks Saint Peter, ""Which prayer?""</p>
<p>""The Lord's Prayer,"" responds Forest: ""Our Father, Howard be thy name....""</p>

39482,"<p>Last year, I upgraded my GirlFriend 5.0 to GirlFriend 5.1, which installs<br /> itself as 'Fiancee 1.0'. Recently, I upgraded Fiancee 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and it's a<br /> real memory hog. It has taken up all my space, and Wife 1.0 must be running<br /> before I can do ANYTHING. It is also spawning Child Processes which are further<br /> consuming system resources. Some applications, such as PokerNight 10.3, BeerBash<br /> 2.5, and PubNight 7.0 are no longer able to run in the system at all. Additional<br /> plug-ins were automatically installed, such as  Mother-In-Law 55.8, and there is<br /> no uninstall feature for these plug-ins. No mention of these behaviors was<br /> discussed in the brochures or documentation, although other users have reported<br /> similar problems. Because of this, some users that I know have decided to avoid<br /> the headaches associated with these upgrades, and simply move from Girlfriend<br /> 5.0 to Girlfriend 6.0. Unfortunately, this is not without peril as well, as all<br /> traces of Girlfriend 5.0 must be removed from the system before attempting<br /> installation of 6.0. Even then, Girlfriend 6.0 will repeatedly run system checks<br /> (usually in the background, and often late at night when the system is asleep)<br /> to find evidence of previous versions. To cap it off, Girlfriend 6.0 apparently<br /> has a nag feature reminding about the advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0.<br /> However, I do like some of the features that you are planning to include in the<br /> upcoming Girlfriend 6.1 release:<br /> * A 'Don't remind me again' button<br /> * Minimize button<br /> * Shutdown feature<br /> * An install shield feature so that Girlfriend can be completely uninstalled<br /> if necessary (so you don't lose cache and other objects) .<br /> Unfortunately, since I've already upgraded to Wife 1.0, I don't think I will<br /> be able to take advantage of any of these new features, unless you decide to<br /> include them in the next Mistress release. But, of course, there is a whole raft<br /> of problems associated with the use of Mistress 1.0 and Wife 1.0 on the same<br /> system -- most notably are system conflicts and continual disk thrashing, which<br /> starts shortly after Wife 1.0 detects Mistress 1.0. Interestingly enough, all<br /> versions of PersonalLawyer still work fine. Finally, Wife 1.0 apparently deletes<br /> all MSMoney files before uninstalling itself; following that, Mistress 1.1 will<br /> refuse to install, claiming insufficient resources. I personally find all these<br /> new tools and conflicts to be too confusing and time consuming. I'm sticking<br /> with Dog 1.0k9. It slobbers and chews up the paper, but all in all these bugs<br /> are tolerable. It is simple to operate and we get along fine.</p>

The husband said in a mild<br /> tone, ""I think, in this you're not exactly right.""<br /> ""What? I'm not exactly right? What you really mean is that I'm far from being<br /> right! You mean I'm completely wrong! I'm wrong; it means I'm telling lies! I'm<br /> lying, then I'm not speaking like a human being! You mean I'm barking like a<br /> dog! Mom! Mom!

"
39548,"<p>Preparation for parenthood is not just a matter of reading books and decorating the nursery. Here are 12 simple tests for expectant parents to take to prepare themselves for the real-life experience of being a mother or father.</p>
<p>1. Women: to prepare for maternity, put on a dressing gown and stick a beanbag down the front. Leave it there for 9 months. After 9 months, take out 10% of the beans.</p>
<p>2. Men: to prepare for paternity, go the local drug store, tip the contents of your wallet on the counter, and tell the pharmacist to help himself. Then go to the supermarket. Arrange to have your salary paid directly to their head office. Go home. Pick up the paper and read it for the last time.</p>
<p>3. Before you finally go ahead and have children, find a couple who are already parents and berate them about their methods of discipline, lack of patience, appallingly low tolerance levels, and how they have allowed their children to run riot. Suggest ways in which they might improve their child's sleeping habits, toilet training, table manners and overall behavior. Enjoy it - it'll be the last time in your life that you will have all of the answers.</p>
<p>4. To discover how the nights feel, walk around, the living room from 5pm to 10pm carrying a wet bag weighing approximately 8-12 lbs. At 10pm put the bag down, set the alarm for midnight, and go to sleep. Get up at 12 and walk around the living room again, with the bag, until 1am. Put the alarm on for 3am. As you can't get back to sleep, get up at 2am and make a drink. Go to bed at 2:45 am. Get up again at 3am when the alarm goes off. Sing songs in the dark until 4am. Put the alarm on for 5am. Get up. Make breakfast. Keep this up for 5 years. Look cheerful.</p>
<p>5. Can you stand the mess children make? To find out, smear peanut butter onto the sofa and jam onto the curtains. Hide a fish finger behind the stereo and leave it there all summer. Stick your fingers in the flowerbeds then rub them on the clean walls. Cover the stains with crayons. How does that look?</p>
<p>6. Dressing small children is not as easy as it seems: first buy an octopus and a string bag. Attempt to put the octopus into the string bag so that none of the arms hang out. Time allowed for this - all morning.</p>
<p>7. Take an egg carton. Using a pair of scissors and a can of paint, turn it into an alligator. Now take a toilet tube. Using only scotch tape and a piece of foil, turn it into a Christmas tree. Last, take a milk container, a ping pong ball, and an empty packet of Coco Puffs and make an exact replica of the Eiffel Tower. Congratulations, you have just qualified for a place on the playgroup committee.</p>
<p>8. Forget the Lexus and buy a Mini Van. And don't think you can leave it out in the driveway spotless and shining. Family cars don't look like that. Buy a chocolate ice cream bar and put it in the glove compartment. Leave it there. Get a quarter. Stick it in the cassette player. Take a family-size packet of chocolate cookies. Mash them down the back seats. Run a garden rake along both sides of the car. There!, Perfect!</p>
<p>9. Get ready to go out. Wait outside the toilet for half an hour. Go out the front door. Come in again. Go out. Come back in. Go out again. Walk down the front path. Walk back up it. Walk down it again. Walk very slowly down the road for 5 minutes. Stop to inspect minutely every cigarette butt, piece of used chewing gum, dirty tissue and dead insect along the way. Retrace your steps.Scream that you've had as much as you can stand, until the neighbors come out and stare at you. Give up and go back in the house. You are now just about ready to try taking a small child for a walk.</p>
<p>10. Always repeat everything you say at least five times.</p>
<p>11. Go to your local supermarket. Take with you the nearest thing you can find to a pre-school child - a fully grown goat is excellent. If you intend to have more than one child, take more than one goat. Buy your week's groceries without letting the goats out of your sight. Pay for everything the goats eat or destroy. Until you can easily accomplish this do not even contemplate having children.</p>
<p>12. Hollow out a melon. Make a small hole in the side. Suspend it from the ceiling and swing it from side to side. Now get a bowl of soggy Froot Loops and attempt to spoon it into the swaying melon by pretending to be an airplane. Continue until half of the Froot Loops are gone. Tip the rest into your lap, making sure that a lot of it falls on the floor. You are now ready to feed a 12-month old baby.</p>
<p>13. Learn the names of every character from Barney and Friends, Sesame Street and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. When you find yourself singing ""I love you, you love me"" at work, now, CONGRATULATIONS! ... you finally qualify as a parent.</p>

39573,"<p>CYBER BREAK UP LETTER<br /> Dear [insert screen name here] (if that is your real name), </p>
<p>I regret to inform you that, under a plan for the periodic removal of unpleasantness from my life, I must terminate our online affair. This termination takes effect immediately, but only because I could not make it retroactive. Below, you will find the reasons for this action: </p>
<p>_____ While our cybersex sessions were, for the most part, competent, your constant use of ""brb gotta pee"" took some of the romance out of it. </p>
<p>_____ Your use of the term ""the ol' cyber ball and chain"" to refer to me has hurt my feelings. </p>
<p>_____ I've found another lover, one who knows the importance of punctuation. </p>
<p>_____ Certain errors during cyber sessions indicate that you were less than honest: </p>
<p>� __ You typed: ""I remove my bra"" when you claimed to be a man. </p>
<p>� __ You typed: ""I enter you"" when you claimed to be a woman. </p>
<p>� __ You typed your own name at the end. </p>
<p>� __ Your supposedly original scenario, it turns out, is simply page 56 of a Jackie Collins novel. </p>
<p>� __ Your repeated references to animals suggest that you are hiding something from me. </p>
<p>� __ Your refusal to cyber until I submitted a recent AIDS test suggests a degree of paranoia that is, simply put, unhealthy. </p>
<p>� __ I finally opened the file with your __ gif __ jpg __ police record. </p>
<p>� __ I have no choice but to comply with the court orders unless I wish to face stalking charges. </p>
<p>� __ Mommie says I need to spend less time on the computer. </p>
<p>� __ Your mommie called me and yelled at me because of all the time you're spending on the computer. </p>
<p>� __ I have established a more personal relationship with the Lord, and I would like to talk to you in great detail about what you can do to ensure a place in Heaven when the endtimes come. They are closer than you think. </p>
<p>� ___ The fact that you BCC all your love letters to me leaves me feeling less than special. As in cyber cheating. </p>
<p>� ___ I finally read your profile, and the fact that you are only 14 violates the terms of my parole. </p>
<p>� ___ I am entering the witness protection program. </p>
<p>Please understand, __ [screen name] and/or __ you misbegotten son of a bitch__ sir/madam __ mom/dad [for use in West Virginia], that there is nothing personal in this. We've simply grown apart. </p>
<p>Any additional correspondence you may direct to my attorney, </p>
<p>__ Sincerely, </p>
<p>__ Gleefully, </p>
<p>__ I have to go before the warden calls ""lights out,"" </p>
<p>__ Uh oh, my Real Life mate is coming up the stairs, </p>
<p>__ Good riddance, </p>

39583,"<p>A blonde went to a flight school insisting that she wanted to learn to fly. As<br /> all the planes were currently in use, the owner agreed to instruct her by radio<br /> on how to pilot the solo helicopter. He took her out, showed her how to start it<br /> and gave her the basics, and sent her on her way.</p>
<p>After she climbed 1000 feet, she radioed in. ""I'm doing great! I love it! The<br /> view is so beautiful, and I'm starting to get the hang of this.""</p>
<p>After 2000 feet, she radioed again, saying how easy it was to fly. The<br /> instructor watched her climb over 3000 feet, and was beginning to worry that she<br /> hadn't radioed in.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, he watched in horror as she crashed about half a mile<br /> away. He ran over and pulled her from the wreckage.</p>
<p>When he asked what happened, she said, ""I don't know! Everything was going<br /> fine, but as I got higher, I was starting to get cold. I can barely remember<br /> anything after I turned off the big fan!""</p>

"
39591,"<p>The rules for playing bedroom golf.</p>
<p>Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play, normally<br /> one club and two balls.</p>
<p>Play on course must be approved by the owner of the hole.</p>
<p>Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole<br /> and keep the balls out.</p>
<p>For the most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.</p>
<p>Course owners are permitted to check shaft before play begins.</p>
<p>Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid<br /> damage to the hole.</p>
<p>The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary<br /> until the owner is satisfied play is complete. Failure to do so<br /> may result in being denied permission to play again.</p>
<p>It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately<br /> upon arrival. Experienced players will normally take time to<br /> admire the entire course, paying special attention to well<br /> formed mounds and bunkers.</p>
<p>Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have<br /> played on in the past or are currently playing on to the owner<br /> of the course being played.</p>
<p>Upset owners have been known to damage a players equipment for<br /> this reason.</p>
<p>Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear, just in case.</p>
<p>Players should not assume that the course is in shape to play at<br /> all times. Players may be embarrassed if they find the course<br /> temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely<br /> tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find<br /> alternate means of play when this is the case.</p>
<p>Players should assume their match has been properly scheduled<br /> particularly when playing a new course for the 1st time.</p>
<p>Previous players have been known to become irate if they<br /> discover someone else is playing what they considered to be a<br /> private course.</p>
<p>The owner of the course is responsible for the pruning of any<br /> bushes, which may reduce the visibility of the hole.</p>
<p>Players are also advised not to play on courses where there is<br /> no bush surrounding the hole.</p>
<p>Players are strongly advised to get the owners permission before<br /> attempting to play the backside.</p>
<p>Slow play is encouraged, however, players should be prepared to<br /> proceed at a quicker pace at the owners request.</p>
<p>It is considered an outstanding performance, time permitting, to<br /> play the same hole several times in one match. </p>
<p>You do not have to let other players play through. </p>
<p>It is not advisable for two players to attempt the same hole at<br /> the same time.</p>
<p>Beware: Some courses may be contaminated. Report these courses<br /> to all fellow players and course owners so that they will not<br /> contaminate other courses or equipment. Should your equipment<br /> become contaminated, avoid playing any further courses until the<br /> contamination is removed. Should your course become<br /> contaminated, restrict all players from the course until the<br /> contamination is removed.</p>

<p>The owner looked at both men and said, ""The loser gets to give it.""</p>
"
39599,"<p>Escapee definition: a fart that slips out while peeing or forcing poop in a<br /> stall. this is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic/embarrassment. this<br /> is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and<br /> speeding. if you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. pretend it did not<br /> happen. if you are next to the farter, pretend that you did not hear it. no one<br /> likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. making a joke or<br /> laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. </p>
<p>jailbreak (used in conjunction with escapee) definition: when forcing poop,<br /> several farts slip out at a machine gun's pace. this is usually a side effect of<br /> diarrhea or a hangover. if this should happen do not panic, remain in the stall<br /> until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of<br /> what just occurred. </p>
<p>courtesy flush definition: the act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose<br /> cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an<br /> undisclosed location. this reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink<br /> up the bathroom. this can help you avoid being caught doing the walk of shame. </p>
<p>walk of shame definition: walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door<br /> after you have just stunk-up the bathroom. this can be a very uncomfortable<br /> moment if someone walks in and busts you. as with all farts, it is best to<br /> pretend that the smell does not exist. can be avoided with the use of a courtesy<br /> flush. </p>
<p>out of the closet pooper definition: a colleague who poops at work and is damn<br /> proud of it. you will often see an out of the closet pooper enter the bathroom<br /> with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. always look around the office for<br /> the out of the closet pooper before entering the bathroom. </p>
<p>the pooping friends network (pfn) definition: a group of coworkers who band<br /> together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. this group can<br /> help you to monitor the whereabouts of out of the closet poopers and identify<br /> safe havens. </p>
<p>safe haven definition: a seldom-used bathroom somewhere in the building where<br /> you can least expect visitors. try floors that are predominantly of the opposite<br /> sex. this will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom. </p>
<p>turd burglar definition: a pooper who does not realize that you are in the<br /> stall and tries to force the door open. this is one of the most shocking and<br /> vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. if this occurs, remain<br /> in the stall until the turd burglar leaves. this way you will avoid all<br /> uncomfortable eye contact. </p>
<p>camo-cough definition: a phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the<br /> bathroom that you are in a stall. this can be used to cover-up a watermelon or<br /> to alert potential turd burglars. very effective when used in conjunction with<br /> an astaire. </p>
<p>astaire definition: a subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential turd<br /> burglars that you are occupying a stall. this will remove all doubt that the<br /> stall is occupied. if you hear an astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the<br /> pooper can poop in peace. </p>
<p>watermelon definition: a turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the<br /> toilet water. this is also an embarrassing incident. if you feel a watermelon<br /> coming on, create a diversion. see camo-cough. </p>
<p>havana omelet definition: a load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud<br /> splashes in the toilet water. often accompanied by an escapee. try using a<br /> camo-cough with an astaire. </p>
<p>uncle ted definition: a bathroom user who seems to linger around forever.<br /> could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the<br /> pot. an uncle ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you<br /> should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. this benefits<br /> you as well as the other bathroom attendees. </p>
<p>fly by definition: the act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. walk in,<br /> check for other poopers. if there are others in the bathroom, leave and come<br /> back again. be careful not to become a frequent flyer. people may become<br /> suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom. </p>
<p>crack whore definition: a crapper that has seen more ass than a greyhound bus.<br /> telltale signs of a crack whore include pubes, piss stains and s*** streaks.<br /> avoid crack whores at all cost. try finding out when the janitor cleans each<br /> particular bathroom. don't forget, with a good cleaning, a crack whore can<br /> become a safe haven. </p>
<p>frequent flyer definition: someone who keeps going in the bathroom to check if<br /> it is empty. this always looks bad for that person. </p>
<p>have you ever heard of the ""drag bunt?""- that is when you are walking by a<br /> bunch of people and farting the whole time, dragging it by the unknowing<br /> victims.</p>

39619,"<p>Four Eskimos were sitting around a block of ice one evening<br /> telling ghost stories when one of them said, ""I bet that my<br /> igloo is the coldest igloo in the village!""</p>
<p>Another villager said, ""That is impossible, mine must be the<br /> coldest."" The remaining two villagers suggested that they have a<br /> contest to see who's igloo was the coldest. They set off<br /> immediately to find the coldest igloo.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the firt Eskimo's igloo he asked them to<br /> observe. He gathered spit in his mouth and spit in the middle of<br /> the igloo. As soon as the spit hit the floor it froze. The<br /> others were very impressed.</p>
<p>Shortly after they arrived at the second Eskimo's igloo. He<br /> walked over to the stove and removed a kettle of hot tea. He<br /> moved to the center of the igloo and poured it onto the ground.<br /> The instant the hot tea hit the ground it froze. Amazed, the<br /> others turned to leave.</p>
<p>They soon came upon the third Eskimo's igloo. He walked up to<br /> the stove and removed a kettle of hot cocoa. He brought it to<br /> the middle of the room and poured it out. As soon as it came out<br /> of the kettle it froze, then fell to the floor and shattered.<br /> The others could not believe their eyes.</p>
<p>Finally they were at the fourth Eskimo's igloo. He led them into<br /> the bedroom where he slept. He walked them over to the bed and<br /> pulled back the sheets. On the bed were 4 green balls. Confused,<br /> the others asked what they were. The Eskimo smiled, pulled out a<br /> match, and held it under the ball. A huge fart shook the igloo.</p>
<p>Years later that same Eskimo brags about the night that his<br /> farts froze.</p>

39627,"<p>Dear Bill:<br /> As a fellow Southern Baptist, I can sympathize with your predicament. Although<br /> when I was president I merely lusted in my heart, I have to admit that had I<br /> served another term, my lust might have broken free and moved down my body.<br /> God bless you in this time of trial.<br /> Jimmy Carter<br /> Dear Bill:<br /> OK, so I'll never be president, but at least Donna Rice was a fox. What's<br /> more, I want to say this to the American People. Unlike you I HAD a relationship<br /> with that woman!<br /> Gary Hart<br /> My Dear Chap:<br /> This is a bit of a sticky wicket, but if I were you, I should ask that<br /> charming Jay Leno fellow to see you through. Pop onto his show, admit that you<br /> made an ass of yourself and all will be forgiven.<br /> Hugh Grant<br /> Bill:<br /> They entrapped me, they framed me, they caught me in a motel with drugs and a<br /> prostitute, but I bounced back and so can you!<br /> Mayor Marion Barry<br /> Dear Mr. President:<br /> You may have noticed that I'm not jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. This<br /> is a way of showing my gratitude for creating the greatest pick-up line in<br /> years, namely that oral copulation doesn't constitute sex. Just today I have<br /> already used it successfully four times and it's not even 10 am yet.<br /> Warm personal regards,<br /> Newt<br /> Dear Mr. President:<br /> Now I'm on the Supreme Court. I'm here for life! And there's nothing anyone<br /> can do about it!<br /> So there!<br /> Justice Clarence Thomas<br /> Dear Former Worthy Opponent:<br /> Whoo, Boy! All I can say is, Bob Dole would never have gotten himself into<br /> this mess. Not Bob Dole! Not before Viagra, anyway!<br /> Bob Dole<br /> Dear Mr. President: I think it's terrible what they are doing to you, and I<br /> want you to know that if you need to get away from it all, you're welcome to<br /> bring Buddy and stay with me on my Wonderland Ranch for as long as you want.<br /> I'll move the Cub Scout Pack to a tent on the lawn and you can have their room. </p>
<p>Michael Jackson<br /> Dear Bill:<br /> Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.<br /> Jim Bakker<br /> P.S. Jessica sends regards and wants to get together with you sometime.<br /> Dear Bill:<br /> Next time (if there is a next time), don't let them get you on tape. Big<br /> mistake!!<br /> With sympathy,<br /> Rob Lowe<br /> Dear Bill:<br /> I know things look bad for you now but take it from me - the American public<br /> is very forgiving and one day it will all be just water under the bridge.<br /> Regards,<br /> Senator Edward Kennedy<br /> Dear Bill:<br /> Things were grim for a while, but now it looks like I might actually manage to<br /> marry my darling Camilla, and someday I'll be King! Funny how life turns out. So<br /> keep a stiff upper lip! (And relax everything else, haha! And they say I don't<br /> have a sense of humor).<br /> As we British say, keep your pecker up!<br /> H.R.H. Charles Windsor, Prince of Wales<br /> Dear Mr. President,<br /> We invite you to be the cover subject of our next issue.<br /> Editor, Cigar Magazine<br /> Dear Bill:<br /> Congratulations on your election. You are a shining example to us all. Could<br /> you and Hillary join us for dinner next Tuesday? We plan to invite the Nixons<br /> and Agnews as well.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Ronald Reagan<br /> Dear Mr. President:<br /> You have taken a big load off my mind. For a long time my conscience had been<br /> bothering me but now I can honestly say that I told the truth when I publicly<br /> stated that I had never committed adultery. I am truly sorry that your liaisons<br /> with Ms. Lewinsky have become such a political hot potatoes but you are still my<br /> heroe.<br /> Respectfully,<br /> Senator Dan Quayle.</p>

Since he'd heard these jokes before, he knew that he had to rub<br /> the lamp and make the genie come out. So he rubbed the lamp and -- oh, surprise<br /> -- out popped a genie.<br /> The genie asked, as genies will, �What is your first wish?� The government<br /> worker thought about it for a second, then replied, �I would like to be rich!�<br /> So the genie granted him his wish, and poof the man was surrounded by piles of<br /> money rivaling the heaps of even Martha Stewart and Bill Gates. </p>
<p>Since the government worker knew the whole wish process, the genie didn't even<br /> have to ask for number two before he said, �My second wish is to be on an island<br /> with beautiful women surrounding me and obeying my every command!� And poof, he<br /> was there. </p>
<p>Then the government worker -- or, as I like to call him, civil servant --<br /> decided on his third wish, �I don't want to do any work ever again!� and poof --<br /> ubiquitous ironic twist -- he was back in his office.</p>

<p>As he did, he noticed that the dog was tied to the wagon by his testicles. The fireman said, ""Son, I don't want to try to tell you how to run your fire company or anything, but I think if you would tie that rope around the dog's neck you would go faster.""</p>
<p>""Maybe so,"" said the little boy, ""But then I'd lose my siren!""</p>

39703,"<p>A married man was having an affair with his secretary. One day, their passions overcame them and they took off for her house, where they made passionate love all afternoon. Exhausted from the wild sex, they fell asleep, awakening around 8.00 p.m. </p>
<p>As the man threw on his clothes, he told the woman to take his shoes outside and rub them through the grass and dirt. Mystified, she nonetheless complied. He slipped into his shoes and drove home.</p>
<p>""Where have you been!"" demanded his wife when he entered the house. </p>
<p>""Darling, I can't lie to you. I've been having an affair with my secretary, and we've been having sex all afternoon. I fell asleep and didn't wake up until 8.00 p.m.""</p>
<p>The wife glanced down at his shoes and said, ""You lying bastard! You've been playing golf!!""</p>

39711,"<p>The Reverend John Fuzz was pastor of a small congregation in a little Pennsylvania town. One day he was walking down Main Street and he happened to notice a female member of his congregation sitting in the town bar, drinking beer. The reverend thought this was sinful and not something a member of his congregation should do, so he walked through the open door of the bar and sat down next to the woman.""Mrs. Fitzgerald,"" the reverend said sternly.""This is no place for a member of my congregation. Why don't you let me take you home?"" ""Shure,"" she said with a slur, obviously very drunk.When Mrs. Fitzgerald stood up from the bar, she began to weave back and forth. The reverend realised that she had had too much to drink and he grabbed hold of her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance and tumbled to the floor. After rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lying on top of Mrs. Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist. The bartender looked over the bar and said, ""Here, here, buddy, we won't have any of that carrying on in this bar.""The reverend looked up at the bartender and said, ""But you don't understand, I'm Pastor Fuzz.""The bartender nodded.""Well if you're that far you may as well finish.""</p>

39715,"<p>For those of you who have had to deal with governmental<br /> agencies, this will strike a familiar and then satisfying<br /> chord.....</p>
<p>A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA loan for a client. He was<br /> told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory<br /> title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The<br /> title to the property dated back to 1803, which took the lawyer<br /> three months to track down.</p>
<p>After sending the information to the FHA, he received the<br /> following reply (actual letter):</p>
<p>""Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan<br /> application, we note that the request is supported by an<br /> Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which<br /> you have prepared and presented the application, we must point<br /> out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral<br /> proper back to 1803. Before final approval can be accorded, it<br /> will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin.""</p>
<p>Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows (actual letter):</p>
<p>""Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been<br /> received. I note that you wish to have title extended further<br /> than the 194 years covered by the present application. I was<br /> unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly<br /> those working in the property area, would not know that<br /> Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the<br /> year of origin identified in our application. For the<br /> edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land<br /> prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had<br /> acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain. The land came into<br /> possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492<br /> by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been<br /> granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the<br /> then reigning monarch, Isabella.</p>
<p>The good queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles,<br /> almost as much as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the<br /> blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to fund<br /> Columbus' expedition. Now the Pope, as I'm sure you know, is the<br /> emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And God, it is<br /> commonly accepted, created this world.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that He also made<br /> that part of the world called Louisiana. He, therefore, would be<br /> the owner of origin. I hope you find His original claim to be<br /> satisfactory. Now, may we have our loan?""</p>
<p>They got it.</p>

39720,"<p>The Seven Deadly Sins of Gilligan's Island theory is quite simple.Each of the seven characters on the island represents each of the seven deadly sins. Now, this theory seems to fit upon initial inspection, there are technical difficulties when you get down to THE MAN himself, Gilligan. Run with me on this one...Most obvious is the Professor, who fits PRIDE to a T. Any man who can make a ham radio out of some wire and two coconuts has to be pretty cocky. (His character was later revised and given a series of his own, called MacGyver'.)For the sin of ENVY we need look no further than Maryann, who may have worn those skimpy little tops, but could never achieve Ginger's glamour. (As an interesting and completely irrelevant side note, a nationwide survey of college students a few years ago revealed that the professor and Maryann were voted the most likely couple to have 'done it' on the island.)And who could doubt for a moment that Ginger is LUST incarnate? Sure, the kids were supposed to think she was ACTING, but we all know what being deprived episode after episode was doing to her. You know and I know that glazed look wasn't boredom, my friends.What kind of person takes a trunk full of money on a three-hour cruise? Mr Howell gets my vote for GREED.We are now left with three characters and three Deadly Sins. We have Gilligan, the Skipper and Mrs Howell to whom we must match GLUTTONY, SLOTH and ANGER. As you can see, there is a Gilligan problem here. Certainly we can further eliminate Mrs Howell from this equation by connecting her with SLOTH. She did jack shit during her many years on the island and everybody knows it.This leaves ANGER and GLUTTONY, either of which the Skipper had no shortage. He was, after all, a big guy with the tendency to hit Gilligan with his hat at least once an episode. After much consideration, I have decided that he can easily do double-duty, covering the two remaining Deadly Sins.So here we have the Seven Deadly Sins trapped in an endlessly recurring Hell of hope followed by denial and despair, forced to live with each other in our TVs until the last re-run ends.And who is their captor? What keeps them trapped there? Gilligan. Gilligan is SATAN. Think about it.</p>

"
39736,"<p>1. Most Blues begin, ""Woke up this morning.""</p>
<p>2. "" I got a good woman"" is a bad way to begin the Blues, 'less you stick something nasty in the next line, like ""I got a good woman, with the meanest face in town.""</p>
<p>3. The Blues is simple. After you get the first line right, repeat it. Then find something that rhymes ... sort of: ""Got a good woman - with the meanest face in town. Got teeth like Margaret Thatcher - and she weigh 500 pound.""</p>
<p>4. The Blues are not about choice. You stuck in a ditch, you stuck in a ditch; ain't no way out.</p>
<p>5. Blues cars: Chevys and Cadillacs and broken-down trucks. Blues don't travel in Volvos, BMWs, or Sport Utility Vehicles. Most Blues transportation is a Greyhound bus or a southbound train. Jet aircraft an' state-sponsored motor pools ain't even in the running. Walk-in's plays a major part in the blues lifestyle. So does fixin' to die.</p>
<p>6. Teenagers can't sing the Blues. They ain't fixin' to die yet. Adults sing the Blues. In Blues, ""adulthood"" means being old enough to get the electric chair if you shoot a man in Memphis.</p>
<p>7. Blues can take place in New York City but not in Hawaii or any place in Canada. Hard times in St. Paul or Tucson is just depression. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City still the best places to have the Blues. You cannot have the blues in any place that don't get rain.</p>
<p>8. A man with male pattern baldness ain't the blues. A woman with male pattern baldness is. Breaking your leg cuz you skiing is not the blues. Breaking your leg cuz an alligator be chomping on it, is.</p>
<p>9. You can't have no Blues in an office or a shopping mall. The lighting is wrong. Go outside to the parking lot or go sit by the dumpster.</p>
<p>10. Good places for the Blues:</p>
<p>a. highway</p>
<p>b. jailhouse</p>
<p>c. empty bed</p>
<p>d. bottom of a whiskey glass</p>
<p>Bad places:</p>
<p>a. Ashrams</p>
<p>b. Gallery openings</p>
<p>c. Ivy League institutions</p>
<p>d. Golf courses</p>
<p>11. No one will believe it's the Blues if you wear a suit, 'less you happen to be an old ethnic person, and you slept in it.</p>
<p>12. Do you have the right to sing the Blues? Yes, if:</p>
<p>a. you're older than dirt</p>
<p>b. you're blind</p>
<p>c. you shot a man in Memphis</p>
<p>d. you can't be satisfied</p>
<p>No, if:</p>
<p>a. you have all your teeth</p>
<p>b. you were once blind but now can see</p>
<p>c. the man in Memphis lived.</p>
<p>d. you have a retirement plan or trust fund.</p>
<p>13. Blues is not a matter of color. It's a matter of bad luck. Tiger Woods cannot sing the blues. Gary Coleman could. Ugly white people also got a leg up on the blues.</p>
<p>14. If you ask for water and Baby give you gasoline, it's the Blues. Other acceptable Blues beverages are:</p>
<p>a. wine</p>
<p>b. whiskey or bourbon</p>
<p>c. muddy water</p>
<p>d. black coffee</p>
<p>The following are NOT Blues beverages:</p>
<p>a. mixed drinks</p>
<p>b. kosher wine</p>
<p>c. Snapple</p>
<p>d. sparkling water</p>
<p>15. If it occurs in a cheap motel or a shotgun shack, it's a Blues death. Stabbed in the back by a jealous lover is another Blues way to die. So is the electric chair, substance abuse, and dying lonely on a broken down cot. You can't have a Blues death if you die during a tennis match or getting liposuction.</p>
<p>16. Some Blues names for women:</p>
<p>a. Sadie</p>
<p>b. Big Mama</p>
<p>c. Bessie</p>
<p>d. Fat River Dumpling</p>
<p>17. Some Blues names for men:</p>
<p>a. Joe</p>
<p>b. Willie</p>
<p>c. Little Willie</p>
<p>d. Big Willie</p>
<p>18. Persons with names like Sierra, Sequoia, Auburn, and Rainbow can't sing the Blues no matter how many men they shoot in Memphis.</p>
<p>19. Make your own Blues name (starter kit):</p>
<p>a. name of physical infirmity (Blind, Cripple, Lame, etc.)</p>
<p>b. first name (see above) plus name of fruit (Lemon, Lime, Kiwi, etc.)</p>
<p>c. last name of a President (Jefferson, Johnson, Fillmore, etc.)</p>
<p>For example, Blind Lime Jefferson, or Cripple Kiwi Fillmore, etc. (Well, maybe not ""Kiwi."")</p>

39737,"<p>This is an actual essay written by a college applicant, when applying to NYU where he now attends.</p>
<p>3A. ESSAY IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF OF OUR COLLEGE TO GET TO KNOW YOU, THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION:</p>
<p>ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON?</p>
<p>I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.</p>
<p>I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.</p>
<p>Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.</p>
<p>I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.</p>
<p>I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of<br /> terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not<br /> apply to me.</p>
<p>I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.</p>
<p>But I have not yet gone to college.</p>

39738,"<p>An American earned some bonus from his work and he thought he deserved a hunting trip to Canada. When he came to Canada he popped in a hunting store for renting a hunting dog. Before he left, he asked the boss what the dog's name was, the boss told him the dog's name is ""Sales"". </p>
<p>During the hunting, Sales was so great, he barked when he saw quarries. He never stopped chasing them until he got them. No need to say, the American really got a bunch of quarries when he's done this hunting trip. </p>
<p>Couple years after then, this American earned another big bonus again. So he thought about the Canada hunting trip again. Of course he went to the same hunting store to rent that dog named Sales as soon as he arrived Canada. However, the boss told him they didn't call him Sales any more. Just because of his excellent performance, they called him ""Manager"" now. At the very same moment, the boss pointed to one corner of the store and told the American, "" Now he does nothing but barks at that corner everyday.""</p>

The first man says to the other, 'If you get lost, fire three shots into the air every hour. That way I can pinpoint you and find you.' After about three hours, the second man finds he is really lost. He decides to fire three shots into the air as the first man told him. He then waits an hour and does it again. He repeats this until he is out of ammo. The next morning, the first man finds the second with the help of forest rangers. He asks the first man if he did what he told him to do. The man answers, 'Yes, I fired three shots into the air every hour on the hour until I ran out of arrows.'</p>

<p>And Satan said, ""There goes the neighborhood.""</p>
<p>And God said, ""Let us make Man in our image, after our likeness, and let<br /> them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air<br /> and over the cattle, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping thing<br /> that creepeth upon the Earth.""

"
39783,"<p>The recent announcement that Donner and Blitzen have elected to take the early reindeer retirement package has triggered a good deal of concern about whether they will be replaced, and about other restructuring decisions at the North Pole.</p>
<p>Streamlining was due to the North Pole's loss of dominance of the season's gift distribution business. Home shopping channels and mail order catalogues have diminished Santa's market share. He could not sit idly by and permit further erosion of the profit picture.</p>
<p>The reindeer downsizing was made possible through the purchase of a late model Japanese sled for the CEO's annual trip. Improved productivity from Dasher and Dancer, who summered at the Harvard Business School, is anticipated. Reduction in reindeer will also lessen airborne environmental emissions for which the North Pole has received unfavorable press.</p>
<p>I am pleased to inform you that Rudolph's role will not be disturbed. Tradition still counts for something at the North Pole. Management denies, in the strongest possible language, the earlier leak that Rudolph's nose got that way, not from the cold, but from substance abuse. Calling Rudolph ""a lush who was into the sauce and never did pull his share of the load"" was an unfortunate comment, made by one of Santa's helpers and taken out of context at a time of year when he is known to be under executive stress.</p>
<p>As a further restructuring, today's global challenges require the North Pole to continue to look for better, more competitive steps. Effective immediately, the following economy measures are to take place in the ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" subsidiary:</p>
<p>-  The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree never turned out to be the cash crop forecasted. It will be replaced by a plastic hanging plant, providing considerable savings in maintenance;</p>
<p>-  The two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not cost effective. In addition, their romance during working hours could not be condoned. The positions are therefore eliminated;</p>
<p>-  The three French hens will remain intact. After all, everyone loves the French;</p>
<p>-  The four calling birds were replaced by an automated voice mail system, with a call waiting option. An analysis is underway to determine who the birds have been calling, how often and how long they talked;</p>
<p>-  The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of Directors. Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could have negative implications for institutional investors. Diversification into other precious metals as well as a mix of T-Bills and high technology stocks appear to be in order;</p>
<p>-  The six geese-a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer be afforded. It has long been felt that the production rate of one egg per goose per day is an example of the decline in productivity. Three geese will be let go, and an upgrading in the selection procedure by personnel will assure management that from now on every goose it gets will be a good one;</p>
<p>-  The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in better times. The function is primarily decorative. Mechanical swans are on order. The current swans will be retrained to learn some new strokes and therefore enhance their outplacement;</p>
<p>-  As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under heavy scrutiny by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the workforce is being sought. The more militant maids consider this a dead-end job with no upward mobility. Automation of the process may permit the maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring or a-mulching;</p>
<p>-  Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number. This function will be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no longer do the steps;</p>
<p>-  Ten Lords-a-leaping is overkill. The high cost of Lords plus the expense of international air travel prompted the Compensation Committee to suggest replacing this group with ten out-of-work congressmen. While leaping ability may be somewhat sacrificed, the savings are significant because we expect an oversupply of unemployed congressmen this year;</p>
<p>-  Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple case of the band getting too big. A substitution with a string quartet, a cutback on new music and no uniforms will produce savings which will drop right down to the bottom line;</p>
<p>We can expect a substantial reduction in assorted people, fowl, animals and other expenses. Though incomplete, studies indicate that stretching deliveries over twelve days is inefficient. If we can drop ship in one day, service levels will be improved. Regarding the lawsuit filed by the attorney's association seeking expansion to include the legal profession (""thirteen  lawyers-a-suing"") action is pending.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is not beyond consideration that deeper cuts may be necessary in the future to stay competitive. should that happen, the Board will request management to scrutinize the Snow White Division to see if seven dwarfs is the right number.</p>

<p>For a moment there is silence. Everyone has forgotten their own peril, and they all stare, riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the plane.</p>
<p>Then, a man stands up in the rear of the plane. ""I can make you feel like a woman,"" he says. </p>
<p>He was gorgeous. Tall, built, with long, flowing black hair and jet black eyes, he starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time. No one moves. </p>
<p>The woman is breathing heavily in anticipation as the strange man approaches. He removes his shirt. Muscles ripple across his chest as he reaches her, and extends the arm holding his shirt to the trembling woman, and whispers: ""Iron this.""</p>

From inside they heard a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, ""You, foreigners! Come in. Come into my humble shop."" So the married couple walked in.</p>
<p>The Pakistani man said to them, ""I have some special sandals I think you'd be interested in. They make you wild at sex like a great<br /> desert camel.""</p>
<p>Well, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what<br /> the man had claimed, but her husband felt he really didn't need them, being the sex god he was.</p>
<p>The husband asked the man, ""How could sandals make you into a sex freak?"" The Pakistani man replied, ""Just try them on."" </p>
<p>Well, the husband, after much badgering from his wife, finally conceded to try them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this wild look in his eyes; something his wife hadn't seen in many years--- raw sexual power. In a blink of an eye, the husband rushed the Pakistani man, threw him on a table and started tearing at the guy's pants. All the time the Pakistani man was screaming,</p>

39841,"<p>=&gt; NAME: *Expecteria Trouserius* (Trouser Snake) =&gt; LOCATION: Throughout the world=&gt; DESCRIPTION: One-eyed, with mushroom-shaped head (other types come with extra layers of skin) Varying from pink to black. Fang-less with a highly venomous spit. (Spit can reach distances up to 2-3 feet) *Size varies from 3 to 12 inches, depending on its mood &amp; sub-species.=&gt; SYMPTOMS: This snake attacks mainly women in the lower front abdomen, resulting in an inconspicuous bump. Then a severe swelling followed by excruciating pain after nine months. The attack is not usually fatal. Beware: It has been known to attack men in the rear lower abdomen!=&gt; HABITAT: Usually found in bedrooms, but has been known to appear in the most unusual places.=&gt; ANTIDOTE: Various types of vaccine available for women. However, once the venom is injected into the body only drastic measures will ensure complete recovery. There is no known antidote for men.=&gt; WHAT TO DO WHEN ATTACKEDTOURNIQUET: Do not apply a tourniquet as the venom is too deep in the body to be affected.CUTTING THE WOUND: This would be completely unnecessary and ineffective as the bleeding will stop after a few weeks anyhow.SUCKING THE WOUND: This method is the most popular with the victim, but so far has not been reported to have led to any success.=&gt; CONCLUSION: This snake, although it is very aggressive and active, is not necessarily a vermin, and treated with the right respect, makes a wonderful pet.</p>

He stuck his thumb out, but after 3 hours hadn't gotten a single person to stop. Finally, a guy in a Corvette pulled over and offered him a ride. Of course, the bike wouldn't fit in the car. The owner of the Corvette found a piece of rope lying by the highway and tied it to his bumper. He tied the other end to the bike and told the man that if he was going too fast, to honk the horn on his bike and that he would slow down. Everything went fine for the first 30 miles. Suddenly, another Corvette blew past them. Not to be outdone, the Corvette pulling the bike took off after the other. A short distance down the road, the Corvettes, both going well over 120 mph, blew through a speed trap. The police officer noted the speeds from his radar gun and radioed to the other officer that he had two Corvettes headed his way at over 120 mph. He then relayed, ''...and you're not going to believe this, but there's guy on a 10 speed bike honking to pass.''</p>

39873,"<p>LONDON (Nov 8, 1996 1:48 p.m. EST) - Scientists searching for one of the fundamental keys to the universe found they had been beaten to the answer by the comic cult novel ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""; and the answer was 42. </p>
<p>In the British novel and radio serial by Douglas Adams, an alien race programs a computer called Deep Thought to provide the ultimate answer to understanding life and the universe. </p>
<p>In the novel, seven and a half million years later Deep Thought comes back with the result - 42. </p>
<p>Astronomers at Britain's Cambridge University took a little less time - three years - to calculate the Hubble Constant that determines the age of the universe. But the answer was the same. </p>
<p>""It caused quite a few laughs when we arrived at the figure 42, because we're all great fans of The Hitchhiker's Guide,"" Dr. Keith Grange, one of the team of Cambridge scientists who worked on the project, said Friday. </p>
<p>""Everyone thought it was quite fun."" </p>
<p>The scientists were using a new technique to determine the value of the Hubble Constant, a source of constant controversy among astronomers. The Constant is a measure of the rate at which galaxies are receding from each other as a result of the Big Bang that created the universe. </p>
<p>Knowing how quickly everything is flying apart can enable scientists to work out the universe's age. </p>
<p>This has presented a problem, since the large Hubble Constant values estimated by some experts would mean that the universe is younger than its oldest stars. The Cambridge team put the age of the universe at between 14 and 16 billion years. </p>
<p>Grange said the answer was unlikely to remain 42, however. The team plans to observe more galaxy clusters and take an average of a larger number of measurements. </p>
<p>""After averaging out all these values we'll have a relatively accurate answer,"" he said. ""It may be 42, but it could be anything between0 and 55.""</p>

<p>""Ya know, I've been out here in the middle of nowhere for six months now, and I'm dying for some excitement. Any women around here?"" </p>
<p>His friend answers ""Sorry, Bud, no women around here, but if it's excitement you really want, tell ya what...There's an old cabin down by the riverbank, and an old guy name'a Charlie lives there. If you don't mind spending a little money, Charlie will show you the time of your life."" </p>

The cat replied that he wanted a nice soft coushon for him to lie on because he was tired from being chased by dogs. God gave him the coushon and the cat went off. A few hours later 3 mice came. God asked them the same thing he asked the cat. The mice asked for a pair of rollerblades each because they have been chased by women with brooms all their life.

39908,"<p>Dave Barry Column:November 7, 1997, in the Miami Herald Decaf Poopacino I have exciting news for anybody who would like to pay a lot of money for coffee that has passed all the way through an animal's digestive tract.And you just know there are plenty of people who would. Specialty coffees are very popular these days, attracting millions of consumers, every single one of whom is standing in line ahead of me whenever I go to the coffee place at the airport to grab a quick cup on my way to catch a plane. These consumers are always ordering mutant beverages with names like ``mocha-almond-honey-vinaigrette lattespressacino,'' beverages that must be made one at a time via a lengthy and complex process involving approximately one coffee bean, three quarts of dairy products and what appears to be a small nuclear reactor.Meanwhile, back in the line, there is growing impatience among those of us who just want a plain old cup of coffee so that our brains will start working and we can remember what our full names are and why we are catching an airplane. We want to strike the lattespressacino people with our carry-on baggage and scream ``GET OUT OF OUR WAY, YOU TREND GEEKS, AND LET US HAVE OUR COFFEE!'' But of course we couldn't do anything that active until we've had our coffee.It is inhumane, in my opinion, to force people who have a genuine medical need for coffee to wait in line behind people who apparently view it as some kind of recreational activity. I bet this kind of thing does not happen to heroin addicts. I bet that when serious heroin addicts go to purchase their heroin, they do not tolerate waiting in line while some dilettante in front of them orders a hazelnut smack-a-cino with cinnamon sprinkles..The reason some of us need coffee is that it contains caffeine, which makes us alert. Of course it is very important to remember that caffeine is a drug, and, like any drug, it is a lot of fun.No! Wait! What I meant to say is: Like any drug, caffeine can have serious side effects if we ingest too much. This fact was first noticed in ancient Egypt when a group of workers, who were supposed to be making a birdbath, began drinking Egyptian coffee, which is very strong, and wound up constructing the pyramids.I myself developed the coffee habit in my early 20s, when, as a ``cub'' reporter for the Daily Local News in West Chester, Pa., I had to stay awake while writing phenomenally boring stories about municipal government. I got my coffee from a vending machine that also sold hot chocolate and chicken-noodle soup; all three liquids squirted out of a single tube, and they tasted pretty much the same. But I came to need that coffee, and even today I can do nothing useful before I've had several cups. (I can't do anything useful afterward, either; that's why I'm a columnist.)But here's my point: This specialty-coffee craze has gone too far. I say this in light of a letter I got recently from alert reader Bo Bishop. He sent me an invitation he received from a local company to a ``private tasting of the highly prized Luwak coffee,'' which ``at $300 a pound . . . is one of the most expensive drinks in the world.'' The invitation states that this coffee is named for the luwak, a ``member of the weasel family'' that lives on the Island of Java and eats coffee berries; as the berries pass through the luwak, a ``natural fermentation'' takes place, and the berry seeds -- the coffee beans -- come out of the luwak intact. The beans are then gathered, washed, roasted and sold to coffee connoisseurs.The invitation states: ``We wish to pass along this once in a lifetime opportunity to taste such a rarity.''Or, as Bo Bishop put it: ``They're selling processed weasel doodoo for $300 a pound.''I first thought this was a clever hoax designed to ridicule the coffee craze. Tragically, it is not. There really is a Luwak coffee. I know because I bought some from a specialty-coffee company in Atlanta. I paid $37.50 for two ounces of beans. I was expecting the beans to look exotic, considering where they'd been, but they looked like regular coffee beans. In fact, for a moment I was afraid that they were just regular beans, and that I was being ripped off.Then I thought: What kind of world is this when you worry that people might be ripping you off by selling you coffee that was NOT pooped out by a weasel?So anyway, I ground the beans up and brewed the coffee and drank some. You know how sometimes, when you're really skeptical about something, but then you finally try it, you discover that it's really good, way better than you would have thought possible? This is not the case with Luwak coffee. Luwak coffee, in my opinion, tastes like somebody washed a dead cat in it.But I predict it's going to be popular anyway, because it's expensive. One of these days, the people in front of me at the airport coffee place are going to be ordering decaf poopacino. I'm thinking of switching to heroin. Thank You,</p>

<p>So Bob, in an attempt to force the guys to stop talking and let him sleep,<br /> tells them as a joke, that there is a new total control system developed by the<br /> FBI that spies upon all citizens, and there are lots of listening devices<br /> everywhere, so that anyone criticizing the government would be severely<br /> punished. </p>
<p>This didn�t have any effect on those guys; moreover they just laughed at Bob,<br /> and carried on and on, saying even more rude jokes about George Bush and the<br /> government. </p>

<p>Bob asks the conductor to bring him some water and sleeping pills at exactly<br /> 3:00 a.m. </p>
<p>He goes back to his place and says loudly into the base of his seat, so that<br /> talkative guys could hear him:</p>
<p>""If the FBI director can hear me: could you please bring me a glass of water<br /> and some sleeping pills at 3:00 a.m., because there are some idiots here who are<br /> speaking too loudly about some political issues and won�t let me sleep."" </p>
<p>The guys continue talking.</p>
<p>Exactly at 3:00 am, the door opens and the conductor comes out, and gives Bob<br /> the water and some sleeping pills.</p>

39932,"<p>John Kallam graduated with a BA in criminology and entered the U.S.<br /> Army.  He served for 20 years beginning in the late 1930's.  He was<br /> an investigator during the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals,<br /> and stayed in Germany for many years organizing civilian police forces<br /> in the post-war era.  He also wrote numerous books on criminal<br /> justice.  He retired from military service in the late 1950's at the<br /> rank of full colonel.</p>
<p>Returning to Fresno, California, he began teaching criminology at what<br /> was then Fresno State College.  (Later to become the California State<br /> University, Fresno.)  His work was well respected, but after about ten<br /> years of service, he was called to see the president of the college.</p>
<p>He was informed that he could no longer teach with just a bachelor's<br /> degree.  Times were changing, he was told, and the school demanded<br /> that faculty members hold a graduate degree.  Merely having 20 years<br /> of distinguished experience was no longer considered sufficient<br /> qualification to teach.  All new faculty were being required to hold<br /> a doctorate, it was explained, and the school was actually doing him a<br /> favor by letting him keep his job by getting ""only"" a master's degree.</p>
<p>So John enrolled in a summer program at an out of state college.<br /> Three months of intensive seminars and then nine months of home study<br /> would get him his MA.</p>
<p>On the first day of class, the instructor was taking roll.  He stopped<br /> when he read John's name.  ""Are you related to the John Kallam who<br /> wrote the textbook we'll be using?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""I am the John Kallam who wrote the textbook you're using,"" came the<br /> dry response.</p>

He<br /> then went to answer the telephone.<br /> The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the<br /> pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of<br /> the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg, and<br /> let it go.<br /> It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running<br /> over a skunk in front of a pulpwood mill.<br /> She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously.<br /> Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which<br /> reminded her of cooked cabbage.<br /> Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she<br /> went on like this for another ten minutes.<br /> When the telephone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned<br /> the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and<br /> folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself.<br /> She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned,<br /> apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she<br /> assured him that she had not.<br /> At this point, he removed the blindfold, and was she surprised!!<br /> There were twelve dinner guests there to wish her a Happy Birthday""!!!</p>

He followed up by saying, ""And that woman was my mother!"" - The crowd burst into laughter and delivered the rest of his talk, which went over quite well.The next week, the pastor decided he'd give this humor thing a try, and use that joke in his sermon. As he surely approached the pulpit that sunny Sunday, he tried to rehearse the joke in his head. It suddenly seemed a bit foggy to him.Getting to the microphone he said loudly, ""The greatest years of my life were spent in the arms of another woman that was not my wife!""

<p>Lost City Golf Course, Sun City, South Africa: The 13th green is fronted by a stone pit filled with crocodiles, some stretching up to 15 feet long. </p>
<p>Elephant Hills Country Club, Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe: The fairways are sometimes marked by craters caused by mortar shells fired across the Zambezi River. </p>
<p>Compton Par-3 Golf Course, Compton, California: If you like high caliber excitement, this is your place. Home to Crips versus Bloods, Ryder Cup-style competition. </p>
<p>Machrie Hotel Golf Course, Islay, Scotland: On this old-fashioned, lay of the land links, virtually every drive and approach is blind, played over huge sand dunes. Incoming! </p>
<p>Scholl Canyon Golf Course, Glendale, California: Built on a landfill, it ran into difficulties when golfers snagged clubs on buried tires and methane gas rose up from the divots. They now pump the gas to the local power company. </p>
<p>Pelham Bay and Split Rock golf courses, Bronx, New York: Pelham's remote location makes it ideal for dumping unfortunate souls. In a recent 10-year period, 13 bodies were said to have been found.</p>
<p>Singapore Island Country Club, Singapore: In the 1982 Singapore Open, pro Jim Stewart encountered a 10-foot cobra. He killed it, only to watch in horror as another emerged from its mouth. </p>
<p>Beachwood Golf Course, Natal, South Africa: Mrs. Molly Whitaker successfully executed a bunker shot here a few years back, but was then attacked by a monkey who leaped from the bush and tried to strangle her. An alert caddie dispatched the ape. </p>
<p>Plantation Golf and Country Club, Gretna, Louisiana: With 18 holes shoved into 61 acres (less than half the norm) players must huddle against protective fencing while awaiting their turn. </p>
<p>Lundin Links, Fife, Scotland: Enjoyable links near St. Andrews, unless you're Harold Wallace, who in 1950 was hit by a train while crossing the tracks beyond the fifth green.</p>

<p>17. Yes, peeing standing up is more difficult.<br /> We are bound to miss sometimes.</p>

39993,"<p>Dear Employee:</p>
<p>As a result of the reduction of money budgeted for department areas, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel.</p>
<p>Under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.</p>
<p>This program will be known as SLAP (Sever Late-Aged Personnel). Employees who are SLAPPED will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company.</p>
<p>SLAPPED employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This review phase of the program is called SCREW.</p>
<p>SCREW (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers). All employees who have been SLAPPED and SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management.</p>
<p>This appeal is called SHAFT (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination).</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be SLAPPED once, SCREWED twice, but may be SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate.</p>
<p>If an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel's Early Severance) or CLAP (Combined Lump sum Assistance Payment).</p>
<p>As HERPES and CLAP are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received HERPES or CLAP will no longer be SLAPPED or SCREWED by the company.</p>
<p>Management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our:</p>
<p>Special High Intensity Training (SHIT). We take pride in the amount of SHIT our employees receive. We have given our employees more SHIT than any company in this area. If any employee feels they do not receive enough SHIT on the job, see your immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>Your supervisor is specially trained to make sure you receive all the SHIT you can stand.</p>
<p>And, once again, thanks for all your years of service with us.</p>
