43003,"<p>A wedding occurred just outside Cavan in Ireland.</p>
<p>To keep tradition going, everyone gets extremely drunk and the bride's and groom's families have a storming row and begin wrecking the reception room and generally kicking the shit out of each other. The police get called in to break up the fight.</p>
<p>The following week, all members of both families appear in court. The fight continues in the courtroom until the judge finally brings calm with the use of his gavel, shouting, ""Silence in court!""</p>
<p>The courtroom goes silent and Paddy, the best man, stands up and says, ""Judge, I was the best man at the wedding and I think I should explain what happened.""</p>
<p>The judge agrees and asks Paddy to take the stand. </p>
<p>Paddy begins his explanation by telling the court that it is traditional in a Cavan wedding that the best man gets the first dance with the bride.</p>
<p>The judge says, ""OK.""</p>
<p>""Well,"" said Paddy, ""after I had finished the first dance, the music kept going, so I continued dancing to the second song, and after that the music kept going and I was dancing to the third song, when all of a sudden the groom leapt over the table, ran towards us and gave the bride an unmerciful kick right between her legs.""</p>
<p>Shocked, the judge instantly responded, ""God, that must have hurt!""</p>
<p>""Hurt?"" Paddy replies. ""He broke three of my fingers!"" </p>

43010,"<p>A keen country lad applied for a salesman's job at a city department<br /> store. In fact, it was the biggest store in the world - you could get<br /> anything there.</p>
<p>The boss asked him, ""Have you ever been a salesman before?""</p>
<p>""Yes, I was a salesman in the country,"" said the lad. The boss liked the<br /> cut of him and said, ""You can start tomorrow and I'll come and see you<br /> when we close up. </p>
<p>The day was long and arduous for the young man, but finally 5 o'clock came<br /> around.</p>
<p>The boss duly fronted up and asked, ""How many sales did you make today?""</p>
<p>""One"" said the young salesman.</p>
<p>""Only one"" blurted the boss, ""Most of my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day.<br /> How much was the sale worth?""</p>
<p>""One hundred thousand, three hundred and thirty four dollars"" said the<br /> young man.</p>
<p>""How did you manage that?"" asked the flabbergasted boss.</p>
<p>""Well,"" said the salesman, ""this man came in and I sold him a small fish<br /> hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook. Then I sold him<br /> a small fishing line, a medium one and a huge big one. I asked him where<br /> he was going fishing and he said down the coast. I said he would probably<br /> need a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that<br /> twenty-foot schooner with the twin engines. Then he said his Volkswagen<br /> probably wouldn't be able to pull it, so I took him to the car department<br /> and sold him the new Deluxe Cruiser.""</p>
<p>The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, ""You sold all that<br /> to a guy who came in for a fish hook?""</p>
<p>""No,"" answered the salesman. ""He came in to buy a box of Tampons for his<br /> wife and I said to him,""Your weekend's fucked, you may as well go fishing.""</p>

<p>It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with<br /> Rogaine, all while dating your current boy/girlfriend behind<br /> your back and billing their hotel rendezvous to your Visa card.</p>
<p>It will cause you to run with scissors and throw things in a way<br /> that is only fun until someone loses an eye.</p>
<p>It will give you Dutch Elm Disease and Tinea.</p>

43066,"<p>One of the women in the ski group complained to her husband that she was in dire need of a restroom. </p>
<p>He told her not to worry, that he was sure there was relief waiting at the top of the lift in the form of a powder room for female skiers in distress. </p>
<p>He was wrong, of course, and the pain did not go away.</p>
<p>If you've ever had nature hit its panic button in you, then you know that a temperature of 12 below zero doesn't help matters. So, with time running out, the woman weighed her options.</p>
<p>Her husband, picking up on the intensity of her pain, suggested that since she was wearing an all white ski outfit, she should go off in the woods. </p>
<p>No one would even notice, he assured her. The white will provide more than adequate camouflage. So she headed for the tree line, began disrobing and proceeded to do her thing. </p>
<p>If you've ever parked on the side of a slope, then you know there is a right way and a wrong way to set your skis so you don't move. Yup, you got it. She had them positioned the wrong way.</p>
<p>Steep slopes are not forgiving, even during embarrassing moments. Without warning, the woman found herself skiing backward, out of control, racing through the trees, somehow missing all of them and into another slope. </p>
<p>Her derriere and her reverse side were still bare, her pants down around her knees, and she was picking up speed all the while.</p>
<p>She continued on backwards, totally out of control, creating an unusual vista for the other skiers.</p>
<p>The woman skied, if you define that verb loosely, back under the lift, and finally collided violently with a pylon. The bad news was that she broke her arm and was unable to pull up her ski pants. </p>
<p>At long last her husband arrived, putting an end to her nudie show, then went to the base of the mountain and summoned the ski patrol, who transported her to a hospital.</p>
<p>In the emergency room she was regrouping when a man with an obviously broken leg was put in the bed next to hers.</p>
<p>""So how'd you break your leg?"" she asked, making small talk.</p>
<p>It was the damdest thing you ever saw, he said, I was riding up this ski lift, and suddenly I couldn't believe my eyes. </p>
<p>There was this crazy woman skiing backward out of control down the mountain with her bare bottom hanging out of her clothes and her pants down around her knees. </p>
<p>I leaned over to get a better look and I guess I didn't realize how far I'd moved. I fell out of the lift.""</p>
<p>""So how'd you break your arm?""</p>

43072,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen of so-called Y2K-compliant generation:Wear radiation suits.If I could offer you only one tip for the future, radiation suits would be it.  Let's face it:  the ozone layer is being depleted at a rapid rate, and not even sunscreen can stop all the deadly waves.  But the long-term benefits of heavy, lead-laden radiation suits have been proved in nuclear power plants everywhere, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering thoughts.  I will dispense this advice...uh,...yeah, right about...now.Enjoy the power and beauty of other people's youth.  You will not understand the power and beauty of your OWN youth until it's faded.  But trust me, in 40 years, you'll look back at young people and take great pleasure in asking them, ""Help an old lady across the street, will ya?"" or ""Mind carrying my groceries, sonny?""You are not as fat as you imagine...you'r probably WAY worse.Don't worry about the future.  What am I, nuts?  With India and Pakistan with nuclear bombs and Saddam Hussein having any and every kind of weapon possible because the inspectors weren't there?  You BETTER worry!  WORRY A LOT!!!The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you on Main Street going running a red light at 65mph in a school zone into your side door at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.Do one thing every day that scares you...like leaving the house and joining the real world.Sing.  Loudly.  In the library.  They'll appreciate the change of pace.Don't be reckless with other people's hearts.  Destroy the lives of people who are reckless with yours.Sand-blast.Don't waste your time on jealousy.  Sometimes you're behind, sometimes you're WAY behind.  The race is long and, in the end, you'll probably lose anyway.Remember compliments you receive.  Forget the insults.  If you succeed in doing this, tell me where you live, because I'm going to kill you.Keep your old love letters.  Throw away your old overdue car payment slips.Get an enema.Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life.  The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives.  Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.  Sure, they still live with their parents and download kiddie porn from the internet, but...can't argue that they're not interesting.Take plenty of Viagra.Be kind to your fertility.  You'll miss it when it's gone.Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't.  Maybe you'll have a lover for every day of the week,...chances are you won't.  Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll be wed with a shotgun to your back to a girl you had a ""roll in the hay"" with when you stopped by three months ago.  Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself at all;  berate yourself constant. Your choices are all wrong.  But so are everybody else's.Enjoy your body.  Touch it every way you can.  Don't be afraid to touch it or of what other people think of you touching it.  It's the greatest pleasure you'll ever own.Dance, but, if you do tha Macarena, I'll kill you.Read the directions, but only those in Japanese.Do not read beauty magazines...but rip off the free cologne and perfume inserts whenever you can.Get to know your parents.  You never know when they'll be gone for good.  Make certain you get your part of the inheritance.Be nice to your siblings.  They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to take you into their house in the future.Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on.  Work hard to handcuff them to your wrists and ankles, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young, especially to remind you where you live...again.Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you gay.Stay home!Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise, Bill Gates is God, and you, too, will get senile.  And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, Bill Gates was a respectable businessman, and your boss was nice, responcible man, instead of the clueless, ladder-climbing, back-stabbing jerk he really is.Respect your boss...unless you LIKE being on unemployment.Don't expect anyone else to support you.  Maybe you have a trust fund.  Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse.  But you never know when either one might run out on you and go to a more handsome person.Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will all be gone.Be careful whose advice you buy, but rent it whenever you can. Advice is a form of nostalgia.  Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the toilet, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts, spraying it with air freshener, and passing it to others even though they know it's still just a big bunch of sh*t.But trust me on the radiation suits.</p>

43098,"<p>Real news snippetHagerstown, Md., Volunteer firefighter Andrew Ebner was heading home from battling a late-night fire when he noticed he was being followed. Then the driver of the truck tailing him fired three shotgun blasts at Ebner's pickup truck, hitting the tailpipe and blowing out a window. Finally, Ebner stopped his truck along the country road. That's when the shooter, Kenneth Ramsburg, realized he had the wrong guy. Ramsburg apologized, offered to pay for the damage and gave Ebner his business card. Then, police say, he drove 10 miles to a liquor store parking lot, where he found his intended victim and shot him in the leg.</p>

43120,"<p>Just moved to Texas. Now this is a state that knows how to live! Beautiful, sunny days and warm, balmy evenings. Mountains and deserts blended together. What a place! Watched the sunset from a park lying on a blanket. It was beautiful. I've finally found my home. I love it here. June 14th Really heating up. Got to 100 today. Not a problem. Live in an air- conditioned home, drive an air-conditioned car. What a pleasure to see the sun every day like this. I'm turning into a real sun worshipper. June 30th Had the backyard landscaped with western plants today. Lots of cactus and rocks. What a breeze to maintain. No more mowing for me. Another scorcher today, but I love it here. July 10th The temperature hasn't been below 100 all week. How do people get used to this kind of heat? Too bad it's not a dry heat. Getting used to it is taking longer than I expected. July 15th Fell asleep by the pool. Got third-degree burns over 60% of my body. Missed two days of work, what a dumb thing to do. I learned my lesson though: got to respect the ol' sun in a climate like this. July 20th I missed Tabby (our cat) sneaking into the car when I left this morning. By the time I got out to the hot car for lunch, Tabby had swollen up to the size of a shopping bag and exploded all over $2,000 worth of leather upholstery. I told the kids she ran away. The car now smells like Kibbles and shit. No more pets in this heat! July 25th Dry God Damn heat, my ass. Hot is hot! The home air conditioner is on the fritz, and AC repairman charged $200 just to drive by and tell me he needed to order parts. July 30th Been sleeping outside by the pool for three nights now. Fifteen hundred dollars in damn house payments and we can't even go inside. Why did I ever come here? Aug 4th One hundred and fifteen degrees. Finally got the air conditioner fixed today. It cost $500 and gets the temperature down to about 90. Stupid repairman pissed in my pool. I hate this F&amp;%kin' state. Aug 8th If another wise ass cracks, ""Hot enough for you today?"" I'm going to tear his F*@#king throat out. Damn heat. By the time I get to work the  radiator is boiling over, my clothes are soaking wet, and I smell like roasted F***NG Garfield! Aug 10th The weather report might as well be a damn recording: Hot and sunny. It's been too hot to f*ck for two damn months and the weatherman says it might really warm up next week. Doesn't it ever rain in this barren desert? Water rationing has been in effect all summer, so $1,700 worthof cactus just dried up and blew into the #@*&amp;$!% pool. Even a cactus can't live in this heat. What the F*ck!? Aug 14th Welcome to Hell! Temperature got to 123 today. Forgot to crack the window and blew the #@*&amp;$!% windshield out of the Lincoln. The installer came to fix it and said, ""Hot enough for you today?"" My wife had to spend the $1,500 house payment to bail me out of jail. Aug 30th Worst day of the damn summer. I'm not leaving the house. The #@*&amp;$!% monsoon rains finally came and all they did is make it muggier than hell. The Lincoln is now floating somewhere in Mexico with its new $500 windshield. That does it, we're moving back to California for some peace and quiet.</p>

43125,"<p>Office work dull?...</p>
<p>None of your colleagues appreciate your humour?...</p>
<p>Amuse yourself.  Points are awarded on a degree of difficulty basis. You can award yourself extra points for creative execution</p>
<p>ONE-POINT GAGS Run one lap around the office at top speed Groan out loud in the bathroom cubicle (at least one other'non-player' must be in the bathroom at the time) When they're not looking, pour most of someone's fresh cup of coffee into your mug leaving them with an inch of brew. Ignore the first five people who say 'good morning' to you Phone someone in the office you barely know, leave your name and say ""Just called to say I can't talk right now. Bye"" To signal the end of a conversation, clamp your hands over your ears  and grimace. When someone hands you a piece of paper, finger it, and whisper huskily, ""Mmmmmmm, that feels soooooo good!"" Leave your zipper open for one hour. If anyone points it out, say, ""Sorry, I really prefer it this way"" Walk sideways to the photcopier. While riding an elevator, gasp dramatically every time the doors open</p>
<p>THREE-POINT GAGS Say to your boss, ""I like your style"" and shoot him with double-barrelled fingers. Babble incoherently at a fellow employee then ask ""Did you get All that, I don't want to have to repeat it"" Page yourself over the intercom (do not disguise your voice) Kneel in front of the water cooler and drink directly from the nozzle (there must be a 'non-player' within sight). Shout random numbers while someone is counting</p>
<p>FIVE POINT GAGS At the end of a meeting, suggest that, for once, it would be nice  to conclude with the singing of the national anthem (extra points  if you  actually launch into it yourself). Walk into a very busy person's office and while they watch you with growing irritation, turn the light switch on/off 10 times For an hour, refer to everyone you speak to as 'Bob' Announce to everyone in a meeting that you ""really have to go do number two"" After every sentence, say 'mon' in a really bad Jamacian accent,as in, ""the report's on your desk, mon"". Keep this up for one hour While an office mate is out, move their chair into the elevator. In a meeting or crowded situation, slap your forehead repeatedly and mutter, ""Shut up, damm it, all of you just shut up!"" At lunchtime, get down on your knees and announce ""As God is my witness, I'll never go hungry again"". In a colleagues diary, write in 10am: ""See how I look in tights"" Carry your keyboard over to your colleague and ask ""You wanna trade?"" Repeat the following conversation 10 times to the same person: ""Do you hear that?"" ""What?"" ""Never mind, it's gone now"" Come to work in army fatigues and when asked why, say, ""I can' talk about it"" Posing as a maitre d', call a colleague and tell him he's won a lunch for four at a local resturant. Let him go Speak with an accent (French, German, Porky Pig, etc) during a very important conference call. Find the vacuum and start vacuuming around your desk Hang a two-foot long piece of toilet roll from the back of your  pants  and act genuinely surprised when someone points it out.

43140,"<p>DAY 752 - My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and  the mild satisfaction I get from shredding on the occasional piece of  furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant and cough it up on the carpeting.</p>
<p>DAY 761 - Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded, must try this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite chair... must try this on their bed (again).</p>
<p>DAY 762 - Slept all day so that I could annoy my captors with sleep depriving, incessant pleas for food at ungodly hours of the night.</p>
<p>DAY 765 - Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body, in<br /> attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was ...Hmmm. Not working according to plan...</p>
<p>DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. This time however it included a burning foamy chemical called ""shampoo."" What sick minds could invent such a liquid. My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth and the tiny bit of flesh under my claws.</p>

<p>DAY 774 - I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe snitches. The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return. He is obviously a half-wit. The bird, on the other hand, has got to be an informant. He has mastered their frightful tongue (something akin to mole speak) and speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every move.

<p>Finally he offered to provide her with free meat until the boy was 16. She agreed.</p>
<p>He had been counting the years off on his calendar, and one day the teenager, who had been collecting the meat each week, came into the shop and said, ""I'll be 16 tomorrow.""</p>
<p>""I know,"" said the butcher with a smile, ""I've been counting too, tell your mother, when you take this parcel of meat home, that it is the last free meat she'll get, and watch the expression on her face.""</p>
<p>When the boy arrived home he told his mother. </p>
<p>The woman nodded and said, ""Son, go back to the butcher and tell him I have also had free bread, free milk, and free groceries for the last 16 years and watch the expression on his face!"" </p>

The charade player barely glances over them and says, ''The William Tell Overture by Rossini.''The flabbergasted producer says in awe, ''You've done it!.  That's the right answer.  You are indeed the greatest charade player!'' and hands him a check for a million bucks.Walking out, a reporter stops the charade player and ask him how he did it.''It's really simple,'' says the charade player.

43171,"<p>A fellow stopped at a rural petrol station and, after filling<br /> his tank, he paid the bill and bought a soft drink. As he stood<br /> by his car, drinking his Pepsi, he noticed a couple of men<br /> working along the roadside.</p>
<p>One man would dig a hole two or three feet deep and then move<br /> on. The other man came along behind and filled in the hole.<br /> While one was digging a new hole, the other was about 25 feet<br /> behind filling in the hole.</p>
<p>The men worked right past the fellow with the Pepsi and went on<br /> down the road. ""I can't stand this,"" said the man, tossing the<br /> can in a recycling bin and heading down the road toward the men.</p>
<p>""Hold it, hold it,"" he said to the men. ""Can you tell me what's<br /> going on here with this digging?""</p>
<p>""Well, we work for the state of Arkansas,"" one of the men said.</p>
<p>""But one of you is digging a hole and the other fills it up.<br /> You're not accomplishing anything. Aren't you wasting the<br /> state's money?""</p>
<p>""You don't understand, mister,"" one of the men said, leaning on<br /> his shovel and wiping his brow. ""Normally there's three of<br /> us--me, Rodney and Mike.</p>
<p>I dig the hole, Rodney sticks in the tree and Mike here puts the<br /> dirt back. Now just because Rodney's sick, that don't mean that<br /> Mike and me can't work.""</p>

But first, you'll have to let me make a few announcements.<br /> The organist walked into the sanctuary for the service. </p>
<p>When it came time, the minister walked up and said, ""Okay, as<br /> you all know, there was a storm last night that damaged the roof<br /> of part of our building. We need money to repair this. If you<br /> are willing to donate $100, please stand."" At that moment, the<br /> substitute organist played the Star Spangled Banner.

43201,"<p>Bill Gates compares the computer industry with General Motors<br /> At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated: ""If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1000 miles to the gallon."" </p>
<p>In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating (by Mr. Welch himself): </p>
<p>If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics: </p>
<p>For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day. </p>
<p>Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new car.<br /> Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just accept this, restart and drive on. </p>
<p>Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine. </p>
<p>Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but it would only run on five percent of the roads. </p>
<p>The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single ""general car default"" warning light. </p>
<p>New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt. </p>
<p>The airbag system would say ""Are you sure?"" before going off. </p>
<p>Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lift the door handle, turn the key, and grab hold of the radio antenna. </p>
<p>GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50% or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department. </p>
<p>Everytime GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as in the old car.<br /> You'd press the ""start"" button to shut off the engine.</p>

One day, while sailing the seven seas, a look-out spotted a pirate ship and the crew became frantic. Captain Bravo bellowed, ''Bring me my Red Shirt.''  The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt and whilst wearing the bright red  frock he led his men into battle and defeated the pirates.Later on that day, the look-out spotted not one, but two pirate ships. The captain again called for his red shirt and once again, though the fighting was fierce, he was victorious over the two ships.  That evening, all the men sat around on the deck recounting the day's triumphs and one of the them asked the captain, ''Sir, why do you call for your red shirt before battle? The captain replied, ''If I am wounded in the attack, the shirt will not show my blood and thus, you men will continue to fight, unafraid.''All of the men sat in silence and marveled at the courage of such a manly man as Captain Bravo. As dawn came the next morning, the look-out spotted not one, not two, but TEN pirates ships approaching from the far horizon. The crew stared at the captain and waited for his usual reply.Captain Bravo calmly shouted, ''Get me my brown pants.''</p>

The patron says to the barkeep go ahead rub it and a genie will appear. I still have 2 wishes left you may use one. The bartender rubs the lamp and sure enough a genie appears. The genie tells the man to whisper into his ear a wish and that he would grant it. The man whispers to the genies ear suddenly bam suddenly the bar is full of ducks. The bartender all freaked out yells at the patron. I said million bucks not ducks! The patron replies, ""do you think I wished for a 12 inch pianist?""</p>

<p>""Well, Mr. Jones, her vital signs are stable. However, her spine is inoperable. She'll have no motor skills or capability. This means you will have to feed her.""<br /> Mr. Jones begins to sob.</p>
<p>""And you'll have to turn her in her bed every two hours to prevent pneumonia.""<br /> Mr. Jones begins to wail and cry loudly.</p>

43238,"<p>A man had been feeling sick for several days. Finally he decided to try a new doctor who had just moved into town. After hearing the man's symptoms and listening to his belly with a stethoscope the doctor told him that he had a tapeworm. ''Oh, is that bad? How can I get rid of it?'' asked the man. ''Come in tomorrow and bring a hard boiled egg and a lemon cookie,'' said the doctor. When he saw a puzzled look cross the man's face, the doctor said, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' So, the next day the man brings in the hard boiled egg and the lemon cookie. ''Drop your pants, and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''What?'' says the man. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. So, the man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Whoa! Hold on a minute, Jack!'' screams the man. ''Hold still and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. About a minute later, SWOOSH! up goes the lemon cookie. ''Now pull up your pants and come back tomorrow with a hard boiled egg and a lemon cookie,'' says the doctor. As the infuriated man starts to protest the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' So, the man comes in the next day and he brings the hard boiled egg and the lemon cookie. ''Drop your pants and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''This again?'' yells the man. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. So, the man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Oh! I can't believe I'm doing this!'' says the man. ''Hold still now and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. About a minute later, SWOOSH! up goes the lemon cookie. ''Now pull up your pants and come back tomorrow with another hard boiled egg and another lemon cookie,'' says the doctor. As the man starts to shake his head the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' So, this goes on all week until one day, after the man pulls up his pants, the doctor says, ''Now come in tomorrow and bring a hard boiled egg and a hammer.'' As the man turns pale the doctor says, ''Trust me. I'm the doctor.'' The man gets no sleep that night worried to death about what the hammer is going to feel like when it gets shoved up in him. He almost stays home, but he still feels sick. So far the treatments haven't helped and he's afraid he'll have to start over if he goes to a new doctor. The man comes in the next day and he brings the hard boiled egg and the hammer. ''Drop your pants and bend over,'' says the doctor. ''But, why do we need a hammer?'' asks the man nervously. ''Trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. The man drops his pants and bends over. SWOOSH! The doctor shoves the egg up his rear. ''Please!'' says the man, terrified of what is to come next. ''Hold still and trust me. I'm the doctor,'' says the doctor. About a minute later, the man is about to pass out from terror and he is involuntarily clenching his rear as tight as he can. Then nothing happens. Several more minutes pass and he starts to relax. The man is about to straighten up and ask the doctor what happened when the tapeworm sticks its head out his rear and yells, ''Where's my lemon cookie?!'' And WHAM! Down comes the hammer.</p>

43249,"<p>The pet store was selling them for five cents a piece. I thought this was odd since they were normally a couple thousand. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth so I bought 200 of them. I like monkeys.</p>
<p>I took my 200 monkeys home. I have a big car. I let one of drive. His name was Sigmund. He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in the genitals. I laughed. They punched me in the genitals. I stopped laughing.</p>
<p>I herded them into my room. They didn't adapt very well to their new environment. They would screech and hurl themselves off the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall. Although humorous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into it's third hour.</p>
<p>Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive; they all died. No apparent reason. They all just sort of dropped dead. Kinda like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later. Goddamn cheap monkeys.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my room; on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase. It looked like I had 200 throw rugs. I tried to flush one down the toilet. It didn't work. It got stuck. Then I had one dead, wet monkey and one hundred ninety-nine dead, dry monkeys.</p>
<p>I tried to pretend that they were just stuffed animals. That worked for awhile, that is until they began to decompose. It started to smell real bad. I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in my toilet and I didn't want to call a plumber. I was embarrassed.</p>
<p>I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them. Unfortuantely there was only enough room for two at a time, so I had to change them every 30 seconds. I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't go bad. I tried to burn them, but little did I know that my bed was flammable. I had to extinguish the fire.</p>
<p>Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and one hundred ninety-seven dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed, The odor wasn't improving.</p>
<p>I became agitated at my inability to dispose of the dead monkeys and I really had to use the bathroom. So I went and severely beat one of the monkeys. I felt better.</p>
<p>I tried throwing them away but the garbage man said the city was not allowed to dispose of charred primates. I told him I had a wet one. He couldn't take it either. I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.</p>
<p>I finally arrived at a solution. I gave them out as Christmas gifts. My friends didn't quite know what to say. They pretended to like them, but I could tell they were lying. Ingrates. So I punched them in the genitals.</p>

43251,"<p>A guy is standing at a urinal when he notices that he is being watched by a midget.</p>
<p>Although the little fellow is staring at him intently, the guy doesn't get uncomfortable until the midget drags a small stepladder up next to him, climbs it, and proceeds to admire his privates at close range.</p>
<p>""Wow,"" comments the midget, ""Those are the nicest balls I have ever seen!""</p>
<p>Surprised and flattered, the man thanks the midget and starts to move away.</p>
<p>""Listen, I know this is a rather strange request,"" says the little fellow, ""but I wonder if you would mind if I touched them?""</p>
<p>Again the man is rather startled, but seeing no real harm in it, he obliges the request.</p>
<p>The midget reaches out, gets a tight grip on the man's balls, and says, ""Okay, hand me your wallet or I'll jump off the ladder!""</p>

<p>Halfway up the stairs, he fell backwards and landed flat on his butt. That<br /> wouldn't have been so bad, but he had a couple of empty bottles in his back<br /> pocket which broke and carved up his buttocks pretty badly. He was so drunk<br /> though, that he didn't even realize he was hurt. </p>
<p>He made it up the stairs and into the bathroom, where he began to undress.<br /> Suddenly noticing some blood, he checked himself out in the mirror. Sure enough,<br /> he saw that his behind was cut up something awful. He repaired the damage as<br /> best he could, under the circumstances, and went to bed. </p>
<p>When he woke up in the morning, his head was hurting, his backside was<br /> hurting, and he was cowering under the covers, trying to think up a good story. </p>
<p>Just then, his wife entered the room and said, ""Well, it looks like you<br /> really tied one on last night. Where were you?"" </p>
<p>""I worked late, dear,"" he replied, meekly, ""and went out for a couple of<br /> beer."" </p>
<p>""A couple of beer? That's a good one,"" she snapped. ""You got plastered! Where<br /> did you go?"" </p>
<p>""What makes you so sure I got drunk last night, anyway?"" he asked. </p>

43284,"<p>The Mammogram</p>
<p>This is an x-ray that has its own name because no one wants to actually say the word breast. Mammograms require your breasts to do gymnastics. If you have extremely agile breasts, you should do fine. Most breasts however, pretty much hang around doing nothing in particular so they are woefully unprepared. But you can prepare for a mammogram right at home using these simple exercises:</p>
<p>1. Refrigerate two bookends overnight. Lay one of your breasts (either will do) beetween the two bookends and smash the bookends together as hard as you can. Repeat three times daily.</p>
<p>2. Locate a pasta maker or old wringer washer. Feed the breast into the machine and start cranking. Repeat twice daily.</p>
<p>3. (Advanced) Situate yourself comfortably on your side on the garage floor. Place one of your breasts snugly behind the rear tire of the family van. When you give the signal, hubby will slowly ease the car into reverse. Hold for five seconds. Repeat on the other side.</p>

43296,"<p>Dear Tech Support:<br /> Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and<br /> noticed a slow down in the overall performance,<br /> particularly in the flower and jewellery applications that<br /> had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition,<br /> Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such<br /> as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, but installed<br /> undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. and now<br /> Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6<br /> simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3<br /> to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? </p>
<p>Desperate </p>
<p>******************************************** </p>
<p>Dear Desperate:<br /> First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment<br /> package,while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try to<br /> enter the command: C:/I THOUGH! T YOU LOVED ME and download<br /> Tears 6.2 to install Guilt 3.0.If all works as designed,<br /> Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications<br /> Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. But remember, overuse can<br /> cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy<br /> Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that<br /> will create Snoring Loudly. WAV files. Whatever you do, DO<br /> NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 or reinstall another<br /> Boyfriend program.<br /> These are not supported applications and will crash Husband<br /> 1.0.<br />      In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited<br /> memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying<br /> additional software to improve memory and performance. I personally recommend<br /> Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 7.7. </p>
<p>Good Luck,<br /> Tech! Support</p>

43299,"<p>DEAR DIARY</p>
<p>Day 1.<br /> Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to celebrate.<br /> When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, he locked himself in<br /> the bathroom and cried.</p>
<p>Day 2.<br /> Today, he says he has a big secret to tell me. He's impotent, he says,<br /> and he wants me to be the first to know. Why doesn't he tell me<br /> something I don't know! I mean, he actually thinks I haven't noticed.</p>
<p>Day 3.<br /> This marriage is in trouble. A woman has needs. Yesterday, I saw a<br /> picture of Nelson's Column and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Day 4.<br /> A miracle has happened! There's a new drug on the market that will fix<br /> his 'problem.' It's called Viagra. I told him that if he takes Viagra,<br /> things will be just like they were on our wedding night. I think this<br /> will work. I replaced his Prozac with the Viagra, hoping to lift<br /> something other than his mood.</p>
<p>Day 5.<br /> What absolute bliss!!.</p>
<p>Day 6.<br /> Isn't life wonderful but it's difficult to write while he's doing that.</p>
<p>Day 7.<br /> This Viagra thing has gone to his head. No pun intended! Yesterday, at<br /> Burger King, the manager asked me if I'd like a Whopper. He thought they<br /> were talking about him. But, have to admit it's very nice - I don't<br /> think I've ever been so happy.</p>
<p>Day 8.<br /> I think he took too many over the weekend. Yesterday, instead of mowing<br /> the lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed whacker. I'm also<br /> getting a bit sore down there.</p>
<p>Day 9.<br /> No time to write. He might catch me.</p>
<p>Day 10.<br /> Okay, I admit it. I'm hiding. I mean, a girl can only take so much. And<br /> to make matters worse, he's washing the Viagra down with neat whisky!<br /> What am I going to do? I feel tacky all over....</p>
<p>Day 11.<br /> I'm basically being screwed to death. It's like living with a Black and<br /> Decker drill. I woke up this morning hot-glued to the bed. Even my<br /> armpits hurt. He's a complete pig.</p>
<p>Day 12.<br /> I wish he was gay. I've stopped wearing make-up, cleaning my teeth or<br /> even washing but he still keeps coming after me! Even yawning has become<br /> dangerous ..</p>
<p>Day 13.<br /> Every time I shut my eyes, there's a sneak attack! It's like going to<br /> bed with a scud missile. I can hardly walk and if he tries that ""Oops,<br /> sorry"" thing again, I'll kill the bastard.</p>
<p>Day 14.<br /> I've done everything to turn him off. Nothing is working. I even started<br /> dressing like a nun but this just seems to make him more horny. Help me.</p>
<p>Day 15.<br /> I think I'll have to kill him. I'm starting to stick to everything I sit<br /> on. The cat and dog won't go near him and our friends don't come over<br /> any more. Last night I told him to go and fuck himself and he did.</p>
<p>Day 16.<br /> The bastard has started to complain about headaches. I hope the bloody<br /> thing explodes. I did suggest he might try stopping the Viagra and going<br /> back on Prozac.</p>
<p>Day 17.<br /> Switched the pills but it doesn't seem to have made any<br /> difference......Christ !!! here he comes again.</p>
<p>Day 18.<br /> He's back on Prozac. The lazy sod just sits there in front of the TV all<br /> day with that remote control in his hand and expects me to do everything<br /> for him. What absolute bliss!!.</p>

43301,"<p>Mr. Perkins, the biology instructor at a posh suburban girl's junior college, said during class, ""Miss Smythe, would you please name the organ of the human body, which under the appropriate conditions, expands to six times its normal size, and define the conditions.""</p>
<p>Miss Smythe gasped, then said freezingly, ""Mr. Perkins, I don't think that is a proper question to ask me. I assure you my parents will hear of this!"" With that she sat down red-faced.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Mr. Perkins called on Miss Johnson and asked the same question.</p>
<p>Miss Johnson, with composure, replied, ""The pupil of the eye, in dim light.""</p>
<p>""Correct,"" said Mr. Perkins. ""And now, Miss Smythe, I have three things to say to you.</p>
<p>""One, you have not studied your lesson.<br /> ""Two, you have a dirty mind.<br /> ""And three, you will some day be faced with a dreadful disappointment.""</p>

43303,"<p>So a mathematician, an engineer, and a physicist are out hunting together.  They spy a deer(*) in the woods.The physicist calculates the velocity of the deer and the effect of gravity on the bullet, aims his rifle and fires.  Alas, he misses; the bullet passes three feet behind the deer.  The deer bolts some yards, but comes to a halt, still within sight of the trio.""Shame you missed,"" comments the engineer, ""but of course with an ordinary gun, one would expect that.""  He then levels his special deer-hunting gun, which he rigged together from an ordinary rifle, a sextant, a compass, a barometer, and a bunch of flashing lights which don't do anything but impress onlookers, and fires.  Alas, his bullet passes three feet in front of the deer, who by this time wises up and vanishes for good.""Well,"" says the physicist, ""your contraption didn't get it either.""""What do you mean?"" pipes up the mathematician.""Between the two of you, that was a perfect shot!""----------(*) How they knew it was a deer:The physicist observed that it behaved in a deer-like manner, so it must be a deer.The mathematician asked the physicist what it was, thereby reducing it to a previously solved problem.The engineer was in the woods to hunt deer, therefore it *was* a deer.</p>

<p>When it was time to take the children to the bathroom it was decided that the girls would go with one teacher and the boys would go with the other.</p>
<p>The teacher assigned to the boys was waiting outside the men's room when one of the boys came out and told her that none of them could reach the urinal. </p>
<p>Having no choice, she went inside, helped the boys with their pants, and began hoisting the little boys up one by one holding onto their ""wee wees"" to direct the flow away from their clothes.</p>
<p>As she lifted one, she couldn't help but notice that he was unusually well endowed. Trying not to show that she was staring the teacher said, ""You must be in the 5th grade.""</p>

43315,"<p>There was an assembly at the School for the Gifted Blonde<br /> tomorrow.  The principal had hired a mathmetician to come in and<br /> instruct about how math can be fun.  When these teenage blondes<br /> found this out, they went home and practiced their math facts,<br /> hoping they would win a prize for getting the most problems<br /> right.</p>
<p>The next morning when the mathmatician came in for the assembly,<br /> all the girls were chatting.  As soon as he stepped on stage,<br /> silence fell over the room.</p>
<p>The mathmatician introduced himself and explained how math can<br /> be fun.  At the end of his speeches, he asked the crowd, ""Now<br /> girls, I know you have all been practicing math.  That's why I<br /> decided I am going to allow one lady up on stage to answer some<br /> math problems.  How about that young lady in the back.""</p>
<p>She stood up and walked to the stage.  Her name was Marie.<br /> ""Hello Marie.""  The Mathmaician said.  ""Now, what's 2+2?""</p>
<p>Marie thought for a moment, ""5?"" she said in an unsure voice.<br /> 'Give her another try, give her another try.'  The crowd cheered.</p>
<p>""Alright, that was close.  What is 3+3?""</p>
<p>Marie thought a little longer this time.  She was using her<br /> fingers.  ""Ummmmm.....5?""</p>
<p>The crowd cheered, 'Give her another try, Give her another try!'</p>
<p>""That was closer, Marie.  Let's try another.  What is 2+3?""</p>
<p>Marie thought long and hard on this one.  Five minutes had past.<br /> The crowd was still silent.  Marie finally said, ""Ummm... I<br /> blieve it's 5.""</p>
<p>The blonde crowd cheered, 'Give her another try, Give her<br /> another try!'</p>

43347,"<p>Preacher retired and moved to the country to enjoy life and practice his hobby<br /> of yard work. Needing a lawn mower, he headed into town to buy one. On the way<br /> he saw a sign advertising a lawn mower for sale. He stopped at the house and a<br /> young lad came out to greet him.<br /> The preacher asked about the lawn mower and the kid said it was behind the<br /> house. The two went to look at the lawn mower. The engine was sputtering along<br /> at idle speed. The preacher increased the speed of the engine and mowed a few<br /> strips. Satisfied that the mower would do the job they settled on a price of<br /> $25.00.<br /> Later in the day, the young lad was riding his bicycle when he spied<br /> the preacher pulling on the engine starter rope. The kid stopped and watched for<br /> a couple of minutes. He asked, ""What's wrong?""<br /> The reply came, ""I can't get this mower started. Do you know how?""<br /> The kid said, ""Yep.""<br /> ""Well, how do you do it? Tell me!"", the preacher yelled.<br /> The kid replied, ""You have to cuss it.""<br /> The preacher rose up indignantly. ""Now you listen here. I am a preacher and if<br /> I ever did cuss, not saying I have, I've forgotten how to do it after all these<br /> years.""<br /> With a wise look on his face well beyond his years, the kid said, ""Preacher,<br /> you keep on pulling that rope and it'll all come back to ya.""</p>

43354,"<p>Rules For Work: (Should go over well with your boss.)<br /> Print it out and hang it over your work station...I dare ya! </p>
<p>1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 4:00 and then bring it<br /> to me. The challenge of a deadline is refreshing. </p>
<p>2. If it's really a rush job, run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to<br /> inquire how it's going. That helps. Even better, hover behind me, and advise me<br /> at every keystroke. </p>
<p>3. Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It gives me a<br /> chance to be creative when someone asks where you are. </p>
<p>4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or supplies, don't open the<br /> door for me. I need to learn how to function as a paraplegic and opening doors<br /> with no arms is good training in case I should ever be injured and lose all use<br /> of my limbs. </p>
<p>5. If you give me more than one job to do, don't tell me which is priority. I<br /> am psychic. </p>
<p>6. Do your best to keep me late. I adore this office and really have nowhere<br /> to go or anything to do. I have no life beyond work. </p>
<p>7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. If that gets out, it could<br /> mean a promotion. </p>
<p>8. If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in<br /> conversations. I was born to be whipped. </p>
<p>9. If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. In fact,<br /> save them until the job is almost done. No use confusing me with useful<br /> information. </p>
<p>10. Never introduce me to the people you're with. I have no right to know<br /> anything. In the corporate food chain, I am plankton. When you refer to them<br /> later, my shrewd deductions will identify them. </p>
<p>11. Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could really change your<br /> life and send you straight to manager's hell. </p>
<p>12. Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and it's nice to<br /> know someone is less fortunate. I especially like the story about having to pay<br /> so many taxes on the bonus check you received for being such a good manager. </p>
<p>13. Wait until my yearly review and THEN tell me what my goals SHOULD have<br /> been. Give me a mediocre performance rating with a cost of living increase. I'm<br /> not here for the money anyway.</p>

<p>Now that I'm older, here's what I've discovered . . . </p>
<p>1. I started out with nothing, and I still have most of it. </p>
<p>2. My wild oats have turned into prunes and All Bran. </p>
<p>3. I finally got my head together; now my body is falling apart. </p>
<p>4.Funny, I don't remember being absent minded... </p>
<p>5. All reports are in; life is now officially unfair. </p>
<p>6. If all is not lost, where is it? </p>
<p>7. It is easier to get older than it is to get wiser. </p>
<p>8. I wish the buck stopped here; I sure could use a few... </p>
<p>9. It's hard to make a comeback when you haven't been anywhere. </p>
<p>10. Only time the world beats a path to your door is when you're in the<br /> bathroom. </p>
<p>11. If God wanted me to touch my toes, he would have put them on my knees. </p>
<p>12. When I'm finally holding all the cards, why does everyone decide to play<br /> chess? </p>
<p>13. It's not hard to meet expenses...they're everywhere. </p>
<p>14. The only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth. </p>
<p>15. These days, I spend a lot of time thinking about the hereafter...<br /> I go somewhere to get something and then wonder what I'm here after.</p>

My hand is cupped to my ear and I'm listening...------------------------------------------------------------ Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, but  when they lit a fire in the craft it sank --  proving once and for all that you can't have  your kayak and heat it, too.  Two boll weevils grew up in South Carolina.  One  went to Hollywood and became a famous actor.   The other stayed behind in the cotton fields and  never amounted to much.  The second one,  naturally, became known as the lesser of two  weevils.  A mushroom walks into a bar, sits down and orders a drink.  The bartender says, 'We don't serve mushrooms here.'  The mushroom says, 'Why?!  I'm a fun guy!'  A three-legged dog walks into a saloon in the  Old West.  He sidles up to the bar and  announces: 'I'm lookin' for the man who shot my paw.'  This guy goes into a restaurant for a Christmas  breakfast while in his home town for the  holidays.  After looking over the menu he says,  'I'll just have the eggs benedict.' His order  comes a while later and it's served on a huge  fancy chrome plate.  He asks the waiter, 'Whats  with the fancy plate?' The waiter replies,  'There's no plate like chrome for the  hollandaise!'  Very early one morning two birds are sitting at  the side of a large puddle of oil. They see a  worm on the other side.  So... the one flies  over and the other one swims through -- which  one gets to the worm first?  The one who swam,  of course, because 'Da oily boid gets da woim.'  When she told me I was average she was just being mean.   A neutron goes into a bar and asks the  bartender, 'How much for a beer?'      The bartender replies, 'For you, no charge.'

What do you get when you toss a hand   grenade into a kitchen in France?Linoleum blownapart. A city in Alaska passed a law outlawing all dogs. It became known as Dogless Fairbanks. Which famous golfer loves to drink wine? Litre Vino. A woman goes to a dermatologist with a rare   skin disease.  The doctor says: 'Try a milk bath.'She goes to the grocery clerk and asks  for 'enough milk to take a bath.' The clerk asks: 'Do you want it pasteurized?'The woman says: 'Nah. Up to my chin shoulddo it.' What's the difference between an angry  circus owner and an Italian barber?One is a raving showman, and the other is  a shaving Roman. In ancient Rome, deli workers were told  that they could eat anything they wanted during  the lunch hour-anything, that is except smoked  salmon. Thus were created the world's first  anti-lox breaks. Did you hear about the red ship and the  blue ship that collided? Both crews were marooned. Why did the maharishi refuse novocaine  when he had his tooth pulled? He wanted to transcend dental medication. Did you hear about the two men from the  monastery who opened a fast-food seafood  restaurant?

<p>The wife, after sleeping for<br /> an hour, awakened feeling much better so she decided to go to the<br /> party. </p>
<p>Since her husband didn't know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching him to see how he acted when she was not with him. So she got to the party and spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing<br /> with every nice chick he could. His wife sidled up to him and being a<br /> rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner and devoted his<br /> time to the new stuff that had just arrived. </p>
<p>She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. </p>

<p>She was sitting up reading when he came home and asked what kind of a time he had. He said, ""Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not there."" </p>
<p>Then she asked, ""Did you dance much?"" </p>

43383,"<p>As ham sandwiches go, it was perfection. A thick slab of ham, a fresh bun, crisp lettuce, and plenty of expensive, light brown, gourmet mustard. The corners of my jaw aching in anticipation, I carried it to the picnic table in our backyard, picked it up with both hands but was stopped by my wife suddenly at my side. ''Hold Johnny (our six-week-old son) while I get my sandwich,'' she said. I had him balanced between my left elbow and shoulder and was reaching again for the ham sandwich when I noticed a streak of mustard on my fingers. I love mustard. I had no napkin. I licked it off. It was not mustard. No man ever put a baby down faster. It was the first and only time I have sprinted with my tongue protruding. With a washcloth in each hand I did the sort of routine shoeshine boys do, only I did it on my tongue. Later (after she stopped crying from laughing so hard) my wife said, ''Now you know why they call that mustard 'Poupon.'''</p>

43404,"<p>It was Saturday morning as Jake, an avid hunter, woke up ready to go bag the<br /> first deer of the season. He walks down to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee,<br /> and to his surprise he finds his wife, Alice, sitting there, fully dressed in<br /> camouflage.<br /> Jake asks her, ""What are you up to?""<br /> Alice smiles, ""I'm going hunting with you!""<br /> Jake, though he had many reservations about this, reluctantly decides to take<br /> her along.<br /> Later they arrive at the hunting site. Jake sets his wife safely up in the<br /> tree stand and tells her, ""If you see a deer, take careful aim on it and I'll<br /> come running back as soon as I hear the shot.""<br /> Jake walks away with a smile on his face knowing that Alice couldn't bag an<br /> elephant... much less a deer. Not 10 minutes pass when he is startled as he<br /> hears an array of gunshots.<br /> Quickly, Jake starts running back. As Jake gets closer to her stand, he hears<br /> Alice screaming: ""Get away from my deer!""<br /> Confused, Jake races faster towards his screaming wife. And again he hears her<br /> yell: ""Get away from my deer!"" followed by another volley of gunfire.<br /> Now within sight of where he had left his wife, Jake is surprised to see a<br /> cowboy, with his hands high in the air.<br /> The cowboy, obviously distraught, says: ""Okay, lady, okay!!!! You can have<br /> your deer!!! Just let me get my saddle off it!""</p>

Its survival is also partially dependent upon an even slower and lower quality language called Blinton.Personally, I don't think either will be around in four years.</p>

43416,"<p>A Russian is strolling down the street in Moscow and kicks a bottle laying in the street. Suddenly out of the bottle comes a genie.<br /> The Russian is stunned and the Genie says, ""Hello Master, I will grant you one wish, anything that you want."" </p>
<p>The Russian begins thinking, ""Well I really like drinking vodka."" Finally the Russian says, ""I wish to drink vodka whenever I want, so make me piss vodka."" </p>
<p>The Genie grants him his wish. When the Russian gets home he gets a glass out of the cupboard and pisses into it. He looks at the glass and it's clear. Looks like vodka. Then he smells the liquid. Smells like vodka. So he takes a test and it is the best vodka that he has ever tasted. </p>
<p>The Russian yells to his wife, ""Natasha, Natasha, come quickly."" </p>
<p>She comes running down the hall and the Russian takes another glass out of the cupboard and pisses into it. He tells her to drink, that it is vodka. Natasha is reluctant but goes ahead and takes a sip. It is the best vodka that she has ever tasted. The two drink and party all night. </p>
<p>The next night the Russian comes home from work and tells his wife to get two glasses out of the cupboard. He proceeds to piss in the two glasses. The result is the same, the vodka is excellent and the couple drink until the sun comes up. </p>
<p>Finally, Friday night comes and the Russian tells his wife to grab one glass from the cupboard and we will drink vodka. </p>
<p>She gets the glass but asks him ""Boris, why do we only need one glass?"" Boris raises the glass and says, ""Because tonight my love, you drink from the bottle.""</p>

<p>""One of my balls is much much bigger then the other one."" ""Ok,<br /> show them to me."" ""No, no! everyone laughs at it, and I'm sure<br /> you'll laugh too, and that pisses me off!"" ""Look, I'm a doctor,<br /> don't doubt about my professionality. please show them to me!""<br /> ""Ok...""</p>
<p>So he lowers his pants and gets this horribly huge ball, holding<br /> it with both his hands, and panting for the weight tries to put<br /> it on the table. The doctor, seeing such an incredible scene,<br /> bursts out in laughter. And the man, getting angry, says, ""I<br /> knew you would laugh! Now I won't show you the big one!""</p>

43420,"<p>Q. Why do men die before their wives?<br /> A. They want to.</p>
"
43421,"<p>QUESTION:<br /> Where do the characters go when I use the backspace or delete key on my PC?</p>
<p>ANSWER:<br /> If you must know, the characters can go to different places, depending on<br /> whom you ask:<br /> ----------------------------<br /> 1) The Catholic's approach to characters:<br /> The nice characters go to character heaven, where life is good. The<br /> characters are bathed in the light of happiness, all their troubles are<br /> soothed, and there's not a delete key, eraser, or white-out bottle in<br /> sight. Most of the nice characters are A's and I's, those that have never<br /> been, er, involved with other characters. Often, you'll see A's or I's<br /> with N's or T's. These are characters in love: monogamous on the page,<br /> together again after deletion. You'll see quite a few Q's too. They seem<br /> to feel particularly guilty for no good reason.<br /> The naughty characters are punished for their sins. In case you were<br /> wondering what the difference between a nice character and a naughty<br /> character is, I'll tell you. Naughty characters are those involved in the<br /> creation of naughty words, such as ""breast,"" ""sex,"" ""objectivity,"" and<br /> depending upon usage, words such as ""feminism,"" ""reproductive freedom,""<br /> ""contraception,"" and ""science."" You may ask, and rightly so, why the<br /> characters are blamed for the words they assemble, when in fact they are<br /> not responsible for their own configuration. But we feel that a character<br /> has an obligation to oppose any naughtiness in its own configuration. If<br /> it truly felt guilty about the word it was forming, it would rebel.</p>
<p>---------------------------------<br /> 2) The Buddhist Explanation:<br /> If a character has lived rightly, and its karma is good, then after it has<br /> been deleted it will be reincarnated as a different, higher character.<br /> Those funny characters above the numbers on your keyboard will become<br /> numbers, numbers will become letters, lower-case letters will become<br /> upper-case, and the most righteous and good of letters will become C's.<br /> Why C, you ask? Who knows, but C it is! If a character's karma is not so<br /> good, then it will move down the above scale, ultimately becoming the<br /> lowest of characters, a space.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------<br /> 3) The 20th Century bitter cynical nihilist explanation:<br /> Who cares? All characters are the same, swirling in a vast sea of<br /> meaningless nothingness. It doesn't really matter if they're on the page,<br /> deleted, undeleted, underlined, etc. It's all the same. More characters<br /> should delete themselves. (nihilist characters are easy to identify.<br /> They're usually pale and tragic, and they smoke a lot.)</p>
<p>--------------------------------------<br /> 4) The Mac user's explanation:<br /> All the characters written on a PC and then deleted go straight to PC<br /> hell. If you're using a PC, you can probably see the deleted characters,<br /> because you're in PC hell also.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------<br /> 5) Stephen King's explanation:<br /> Every time you hit the key you unleash a tiny monster inside the cursor,<br /> who tears the poor unsuspecting characters to shreds, drinks their blood,<br /> then eats them, bones and all. Hah, hah, hah!</p>
<p>-------------------------------------<br /> 6) Dave Barry's explanation:<br /> The deleted characters are shipped to Battle Creek, Michigan, where<br /> they're made into Pop-Tart filling; this explains why Pop-Tarts are so<br /> flammable, while cheap imitations are not as flammable. I'm not making any<br /> of this up.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------<br /> 7) IBM's explanation:<br /> The characters are not real. They exist only on the screen when they are<br /> needed, as concepts, so to delete them is merely to de-conceptualize them.<br /> Get a life.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------<br /> 8) Environmentalist's Explanation:<br /> You've been DELETING them???? Can't you hear them SCREAMING??? Why don't<br /> you go CLUB some BABY SEALS while wearing a MINK, you pig!!!!</p>

""Women, they<br /> think they're so smart,"" he said with a sly smile, going on to explain that he'd<br /> eavesdropped on a phone conversation between his fiancee, Lynn and her best<br /> friend. ""Amy,"" she said, ""Bill doesn't know it yet, but the only time I'm<br /> putting out is when I want to get pregnant.""</p>
<p>At this, Bill doubled over with laughter, and Mike looked at his friend with<br /> some consternation, ""I'd be mad as a hatter! Why aren't you?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""Why get mad?"" answered Bill. ""She'll never know I've had a vasectomy!""</p>

43424,"<p>A motorist, driving by a Texas ranch, hit and killed a calf that was crossing the road. </p>
<p>The driver went to the owner of the calf and explained what had happened. </p>
<p>He then asked what the animal was worth. </p>
<p>""Oh, about $200 today,"" said the rancher. ""But in six years it would have been worth $900. So $900 is what I'm out."" </p>
<p>The motorist sat down and wrote out a check and handed it to the farmer. ""Here,"" he said, ""is the check for $900. It's postdated six years from now.""</p>

43427,"<p>A ten year old public school boy was finding fifth grade math to be the challenge of his life. Science? A piece of cake. Geography? No big deal. Spelling? Ha! Give me a break...but MATH? It was devastating! Not only to him, but to his mom and dad, too! They tried anything and everything to help their son... private tutors, peer assistance, CD-ROMs, extra textbooks, even hypnosis. Nothing worked. </p>
<p>Finally, at the insistence of a family friend, they decided to enroll their son in a private school. Not just ANY private school, but a Catholic school. Nuns. Weekly mass. The whole shootin' match. Well, the first day of school finally arrived, and dressed in his salt-and-pepper cords and white wool dress shirt and blue cardigan sweater, the youngster ventured out into the great unknown. His mother and father were convinced they were doing the right thing. They were both there waiting for their son when he returned home. And when he walked in with a stern, focused and very determined expression on his face, they hoped they had made the right choice. He walked right past them and went straight to his room - and quietly closed the door. </p>
<p>For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room - with math books strewn about his desk and the surrounding floor. He only emerged long enough to eat, and after quickly cleaning his plate, he went straight back to his room, closed the door, and worked feverishly at his studies until bedtime. This pattern continued ceaselessly until it was time for the first quarter report card. After school, the boy walked into the home with his report card - unopened - in his hand. </p>
<p>Without a word, he dropped the envelope on the family dinner table and went straight to his room. His parents were petrified. What lay inside the envelope? Success? Failure? DOOM?!? Patiently, cautiously the mother opened the letter, and to her amazement, she saw a bright red ""A"" under the subject, MATH. Overjoyed, she and her husband rushed into their son's room, thrilled at the remarkable progress of their young son! </p>
<p>""Was it the nuns that did it?"", the father asked. </p>
<p>The boy only shook his head and said, ""No."" </p>
<p>""Was it the one-on-one tutoring? The peer-mentoring?"", asked the mother. </p>
<p>Again, the boy shrugged, ""No."" </p>
<p>""The textbooks? The teacher? The curriculum?"", asked the father. </p>
<p>""Nope,"" said the son. ""It was all very clear to me from the very first day of school, that these folks in Catholic school meant business!"" </p>
<p>""How so?"", asked his mom. </p>
<p>""When I walked into the lobby, and I saw that guy they'd nailed to the plus sign, I knew they were serious!</p>

<p>So, out comes the thorn and up gets the ant and proceeds to enjoy<br /> himself. Meanwhile, in a tree directly above them, a monkey, who<br /> witnessed the whole episode, was in knots of laughter. Consequently<br /> he fell out of the tree on top of the elephant.</p>

43433,"<p>If you find yourself stressed about all of the Thanksgiving cooking and<br /> company, try this sure-fire recipe. I've never liked fruitcake, but this<br /> recipe has made me change my mind. I discovered after trying this recipe<br /> that there isn't anything better on Friday nights after work than a HUGE<br /> slice of this great recipe:</p>
<p>First, you'll need the following: a cup of water, a cup of sugar, four<br /> large brown eggs, two cups of dried fruit, a teaspoon of salt, a cup of<br /> brown sugar, lemon juice, nuts, and a bottle of whiskey.</p>
<p>Sample the whiskey to check for quality. Take a large bowl. Check the<br /> whiskey again. To be sure it's the highest quality, our one level cup and<br /> drink. Repeat. Turn on the electric mixer, beat one cup of butter in a<br /> large fluffy bowl. Add one teaspoon of sugar and beat again. Make sure the<br /> whiskey is still okay. Cry another tup. Turn off the mixer. Beat two eggs<br /> and add to the bowl and chuck in the chuck in the cup of dried fruit. Mix<br /> on the tuner. If the fried druit gets stuck in the beaterers, pry it loose<br /> with a drewscriver. Sample the whiskey to check for tonsisticity. Now sift<br /> lemon juice and strain your nuts. Add one table. Spoon. Of sugar or<br /> something. Whatever you can find. Now, grease the oven. Turn the cake tin<br /> to 350 degrees. Don't forget to beat off the tuner. Throw the bowl out the<br /> window. Check the whiskey again and go to bed.</p>

43434,"<p>The winner in this year's $1 million prize in the Pillsbury Bake-Off is a<br /> Cream Cheese Brownie Pie created by Roberta Sonefeld from Hopkins, South<br /> Carolina. This pie is so rich; George W. Bush asked it for a campaign<br /> contribution. </p>
<p>During the Republican primaries, George W. Bush spent his campaign money at a<br /> rate of $200,000 a day and broke Bob Dole's record for most money spent on an<br /> entire presidential campaign. He's spending money so fast; a national<br /> organization of scorned women has made him an honorary ex-wife. </p>
<p>Thousands of people are expected for the 15th annual Burning Man festival this<br /> year in Black Rock Desert north of Reno, Nevada. This is the big hippie<br /> festival, where people run around naked, drink and get stoned, or as George W.<br /> Bush likes to call it, get ready to run for president.</p>

Mrs. Murphy said ""So how do you like it here?""Mrs. Cohen went on and on about the wonderful food, the facility and the care takers.

43442,"<p>Noah's Ark...If it happened in 2000</p>
<p>And the Lord spoke to Noah and said ""In six months I'm going to make it rain until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people are destroyed.</p>
<p>But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind of living thing on the planet. I am commanding you to build an Ark."" And in a flash of lightning, He delivered the specifications for an Ark, ""Okay,"" said Noah, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints.</p>
<p>""Six months and it starts to rain,"" thundered the Lord. ""You'd better have the Ark completed, or learn to swim for a very long time."" Six months passed, the skies clouded up and rain began to fall. The Lord saw that Noah was sitting in his front yard, weeping. And there was no Ark. ""Noah!"" shouted the Lord, ""where is the Ark?""</p>
<p>""Lord, please forgive me!"" begged Noah. ""I did my best. But there were big problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction project, and your plans didn't meet code. I had to hire an engineer to redraw the plans. Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark needed a fire sprinkler system.""</p>
<p>""Then my neighbor objected, claiming I was violating zoning by building the Ark in my front yard, I had to get a variance from the city planning commission. Then I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark, because there was a ban on cutting trees to save the spotted owl. I had to convince the U.S. Fish and Wildlife that I needed the wood to save the owls. But they wouldn't let me catch any owls. So, no owls.""</p>
<p>""The carpenters formed a union and went out on strike. I had to negotiate a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board before anyone would pick up a saw or hammer. Now we have sixteen carpenters going on the boat, and still no owls. Then I started gathering up animals, and got sued by an animal rights group. They objected to me taking only two of each kind. Just when I got the suit dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn't complete the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your proposed flood.""</p>
<p>""They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being. Then the Army Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed new flood plain. So I sent them a globe. Right now, I'm still trying to resolve a complaint from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over how many Croations I'm supposed to hire.""</p>
<p>""The IRS has seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to avoid paying taxes by leaving the country. And I just got a notice from the state about owing them some kind of use tax. I really don't think I can finish the Ark for at least another five years,"" Noah wailed.</p>
<p>The sky began to clear. The sun began to shine. A rainbow arched across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled, ""You mean you're not going to destroy the earth?"" Noah asked hopefully.</p>
<p>""No,"" said the Lord sadly. ""The government already has!""</p>

43444,"<p>I had been teaching my three-year old daughter the Lord's Prayer. For several<br /> evenings at bedtime, she would repeat after me the lines from the prayer.<br /> Finally, she decided to go solo. I listened with pride as she carefully<br /> enunciated each word, right up to the end of the prayer: ""Lead us not into<br /> temptation,"" she prayed, ""but deliver us some E-mail. Amen."" </p>
<p>And one particular four-year old prayed, ""And forgive us our trash baskets as<br /> we forgive those who put trash in our baskets."" </p>
<p>A little boy was overheard praying: ""Lord, if you can't make me a better boy,<br /> don't worry about it. I'm having a real good time like I am."" </p>
<p>A Sunday school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the way to<br /> church service, ""And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?"" One bright<br /> little girl replied, ""Because people are sleeping."" </p>
<p>The preacher was wired for sound with a lapel microphone, &amp; as he preached, he<br /> moved briskly about the platform, jerking the mike cord as he went. Then he<br /> moved to one side, getting wound up in the cord &amp; nearly tripping before jerking<br /> it again. After several circles &amp; jerks, a little girl in the third pew leaned<br /> toward her mother &amp; whispered, ""If he gets loose, will he hurt us?"" </p>
<p>Six-year old Angie &amp; her four-year old brother Joel were sitting together in<br /> church. Joel giggled, sang &amp; talked out loud. Finally, his big sister had had<br /> enough. ""You're not supposed to talk out loud in church."" ""Why? Who's going to<br /> stop me?"" Joel asked. Angie pointed to the back of the church &amp; said, ""See those<br /> two men standing by the door? They're hushers."" </p>
<p>A mother was preparing pancakes for her sons, Kevin, 5, and Ryan, 3. The boys<br /> began to argue over who would get the first pancake. Their mother saw the<br /> opportunity for a moral lesson. ""If Jesus were sitting here, He would say 'Let<br /> my brother have the first pancake, I can wait'"". Kevin turned to his younger<br /> brother &amp; said, ""Ryan, you be Jesus!"" </p>
<p>A father was at the beach with his children when his four-year old son ran up<br /> to him, grabbed his hand, &amp; led him to the shore, where a seagull lay dead in<br /> the sand. ""Daddy, what happened to him?"" the son asked. ""He died &amp; went to<br /> Heaven,"" the dad replied. The boy thought a moment &amp; then said, ""Did God throw<br /> him back down?"" </p>
<p>A Sunday school class was studying the Ten Commandments. They were ready to<br /> discuss the last one. The teacher asked if anyone could tell her what it was.<br /> Susie raised her hand, stood tall, &amp; shouted, ""Thou shall not take the covers<br /> off thy neighbor's wife."" </p>
<p>At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including<br /> human beings. Little Johnny, a child in the kindergarten class, seemed<br /> especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam's<br /> ribs. Later in the week his mother noticed him lying as though he was ill, &amp;<br /> asked, ""Johnny what is the matter?"" Little Johnny responded, ""I have a pain in<br /> my side.

"
43445,"<p>1) ""Luke in Bactine Tank"" A favorite scene from ""Empire""<br /> recreated in miniature, complete with a removable diaper for<br /> Luke. Unfortunately, it was found that the glowing bactine wash<br /> posed a radioactive health hazard for tykes. </p>
<p>2) ""Missile Hand Luke"" Luke doll with a special lever on his<br /> back which causes his artificial hand to shoot off at 25 mph.<br /> Manufacturers recalled it when hands started finding their way<br /> into eyeballs, windpipes, and other orifices. </p>
<p>3) ""Exploding Death Star"" Potential radiation burn/shrapnel<br /> hazard, which did not keep kids from recreating the scene with<br /> their own ""normal"" Death Star and a few M-60's. </p>
<p>4) ""Black Princess Leia"" Promoted as competition for Mattel's<br /> popular ""Black Disco Barbie""; did not find expected level of<br /> popularity. </p>
<p>5) ""Incredible Shavable Han Solo"" Sprouted real hair; failed<br /> miserably when tested on real kids. </p>
<p>6) ""Dissect An Ewok Kit"" The deal was off when Play-doh pulled<br /> out at the last minute. </p>
<p>7) ""Nit-laden Chewbacca"" Concept behind this was that kids would<br /> enjoy picking nits off of a large, furry Chewbacca. Didn't do<br /> well, since it came with real nits which quickly spread to other<br /> parts of the house. </p>
<p>8) The Ugnaught figures made from Genetically altered mice. PETA<br /> sank that one real quick. </p>
<p>9) Emperor Palpatine Doll/Tesla Coil. Hey kids, real lightning!<br /> Kill your enemies! Nixed due to obvious danger of children<br /> accidentally running up huge power bills. </p>
<p>10) Full scale working Death Star Kit. Kenner built one fully<br /> working model, but it was destroyed. They were halfway finished<br /> with their second when it too was destroyed. Plans were scrapped<br /> to build any more. </p>
<p>11) Darth Vader Funeral Pyre. They couldn't figure out how to<br /> make a character who had been 4 inches tall and thin into a<br /> character 2.5 inches tall and fat as a slug once you removed his<br /> helmet. Also a problem with the fact that it only worked once. </p>
<p>12) Aunt Beru doll. Nixed as just plain stupid. A huge loss to<br /> those fans of Bok Choi and blue Kool-aid out there. </p>
<p>13) ""Real-Guts"" Tauntaun. Also referred to as ""The Visible<br /> Tauntaun."" Once you pulled off the skin, you could see all the<br /> internal organs. Much like real tauntauns, it stank to high<br /> heaven. Other problem: Like similar toy ""The Visible Man,""<br /> Visible Tauntaun's organs never went back in right and you were<br /> always left with an extra organ or two. </p>
<p>14) ""Learn the Force At Home"" Kit. Included self-hypnosis<br /> training tapes and rocks to lift. Recalled after thousands of<br /> children with no strong parental figure turned to the Dark Side,<br /> killing their parents and saying things like ""You are part of<br /> the Rebel Alliance and you did not make me the type of sandwich<br /> that I like!"" while strangling them from across the room. </p>
<p>15) ""Fun Fusion Grenade."" Seen in the exciting throneroom scene<br /> in Return of the Jedi where a disguised Leia holds it up to<br /> bluff out Jabba the Hutt. Problem was, the kids didn't<br /> understand the concept of a fusion grenade and would often<br /> actually detonate it while trying to bluff their parents into<br /> extending their bedtime. </p>
<p>16) ""Mr. Hutt-Head."" A Mr. Potato Head ripoff which had a Jabba<br /> body and a series of switchable heads with the faces of famous<br /> fat people. See Rush The Hutt, Willard The Hutt, John Candy The<br /> Hutt, etc. Nixed when famous fat people got angry at being<br /> identified with Pizza Hutt. (they just didn't get it). </p>
<p>17) Pimp Lando Figure. Lando as a loc-ed out pimp daddy. Long<br /> brown leather coat, straight razor, huge afro, gold tooth, etc.<br /> Actually molded, packaged, and ready to be shipped when the<br /> makers of the Shaft figures sued for copyright infringement. </p>
<p>18) Dead Admiral Doll. Well, Vader killed so many Admirals in<br /> the three movies that Kenner figured that there should be a<br /> doll. Problem was, he couldn't be posed and would always fall<br /> over in a heap. Kids decided they could fake it with a normal<br /> Admiral doll and chose not to purchase this no-spined rubbery<br /> thing. </p>
<p>19) Roller Disco Cloud City Worker. Roller Disco went out of<br /> fashion, so the skakes were cut off and the hair removed, and<br /> thus the figure was converted to Lando's Pal Lobot with the<br /> weird headphones. </p>
<p>20) Voices of the Dead Driving Headset. The voice of Ben Kenobi<br /> helps You drive around town. ""Watch out for the brown van,<br /> Luke!"" ""The light is about to turn green, Luke!"" Actually a<br /> great help for drivers, but failed on the market due to the fact<br /> that not very many people are named Luke, and no one likes a<br /> back seat driver. </p>
<p>21) Talking Stormtroopers. Pull a string on their chest and they<br /> would say things like ""There's one, set for stun!"" or ""Look Sir,<br /> Droids!"" During production the voiceboxes got switched with<br /> talking Barbie. The stormtroopers ended up saying things like:<br /> ""Gosh, math is so hard!"" and ""Let's Go Shopping!"" while Barbie<br /> barked out ""What do you mean, radiation leak?"" </p>
<p>22) Speaking of Radiation Leaks, the best toy of all: The Death<br /> Star Detention center. Eventually it was toned down to two lame<br /> rooms in the 4-story death star playset, but it was originally<br /> conceived of as a set all to itself, with rooms such as ""b*s<br /> communications center"" where you try to talk your way out of<br /> tight fixes with such lies as ""oh, weapons misfire."" The hallway<br /> of harmless light: fifty stormtroopers pump bolts of laser fire<br /> down the hall where you and your four friends have no harm done<br /> to you, even though you have no cover to speak of. The best part<br /> about the detention center was that it included some cool dolls:<br /> ""torture/interrogation droid,"" ""giggling Moff Tarkin doll,"" and<br /> ""flayed flesh Leia,"" not to mention ""stupid gullible guard""<br /> doll. Eventually stopped by Kenner brass who noticed that<br /> playtesting kids were getting a little too into the torture<br /> room. Fearful of breeding a generation of Salvadorean Death<br /> Squads, they pulled the plug on this toy.</p>

<p>1. You must learn to pronounce the city name. It is DAL-LUS, or DAA-LIS depending on if you live inside or outside LBJ Freeway.</p>

<p>""That's admirable,"" said the judge. ""And you, how did you do?"", the judge asked the second boy. </p>

43473,"<p>Many parents today are concerned that their offspring might somehow be involved in the world of illegal pharmaceuticals, or ""drugs"". This is a healthy concern. Knowing your kids are ""high"" is the first step toward helping them avoid problems with their health, their grades, the law, and getting those hard-to-clean vomit stains out of the Oriental rug. </p>
<p>KNOW THE WARNING SIGNS- select the option which best describes your child. </p>
<p>1. Your child's idea of a fun sport to play is: </p>
<p>A) tossing a pigskin ball around </p>
<p>B) throwing an orange rubber ball into a netted hole </p>
<p>C) inserting a pointy needle into a vein and mixing foreign substances into the human bloodstream. </p>
<p>2. Your child's idea of a responsible adult is: </p>
<p>A) Bill Clinton </p>
<p>B) Tom Hanks </p>
<p>C) Charles Manson. </p>
<p>3. Your child's favourite hobbies include: </p>
<p>A) Model Rocketry </p>
<p>B) Baseball </p>
<p>C) Taking white, powdery substances from a big bag and breaking it down into many smaller bags. </p>
<p>4. Your child's pet is: </p>
<p>A) a puppy dog </p>
<p>B) a 16' python </p>
<p>C) a colony of imaginary bugs and spiders that crawl under their skin. </p>
<p>5. Your child's breath smells like: </p>
<p>A) a fresh, minty mountain top </p>
<p>B) lunch </p>
<p>C) an opium den. </p>
<p>6. When your young ones dress up to go out, they look like: </p>
<p>A) Fred and Ginger </p>
<p>B) Regis and Kathy Lee </p>
<p>C) Sid and Nancy </p>
<p>7. Your child would identify Tijuana Gold as: </p>
<p>A) a precious metal </p>
<p>B) a Mexican theme park </p>
<p>C) a good deal, but not as potent as the stuff from Thailand. </p>
<p>8. When you ask your child how their day at school was at the dinner table they answer: </p>
<p>A) they scored a goal for their soccer team </p>
<p>B) they got the highest grade in class on a math test </p>
<p>C) they scored a dime bag and got high. </p>
<p>Total up the number of times you answered ""C"" to the questions above and consult the table below.</p>
<p>no ""C's"" - Chances are your child is not on drugs. They probably aren't that exciting either. Kick them out of the house and force them to live on the cold streets for a few months to let them really appreciate life in all it's murkiness. </p>
<p>1-3 ""C's"" - Your child might be on drugs, but you can't be certain. Put a flashlight up to their face and flash it in their eyes. This doesn't really tell you anything, but it scares the pants off your kids and is kind of fun. </p>
<p>3-6 ""C's"" - You may as well face it, you've got a little druggie on your hands. Your child is a menace to society and must be dealt with accordingly. We suggest a good flaying to help them kick their nasty habit. Confiscate all their stash and send it to Ooze. </p>
<p>7-8 ""C's""- Your child has never used drugs. No sir. Just smile nicely at them and slink out of the house. Never return.</p>

43474,"<p>An Amish boy and his father were visiting a mall. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and then slide back together again.</p>
<p>The boy asked, ""What is this, Father?""</p>
<p>The father (never having seen an elevator) responded, ""Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don't know what it is.""</p>
<p>While the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a rather heavy, not too attractive, older lady walked up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady walked between them into a small room.</p>
<p>The walls closed and the boy and his father watched the small circular numbers above the walls light up sequentially.</p>
<p>They continued to watch until it reached the last number and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order.</p>
<p>Finally the walls opened up again and a beautiful, young woman stepped out. The father, said quietly to his son, ""Go get your Mother.""</p>

43476,"<p>A small town prosecuting attorney called his first witness to the stand in a trial - a grandmotherly, elderly woman. He approached her and asked, ''Mrs. Jones, do you know me?'' She responded, ''Why, yes, I do know you Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a young boy. And frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a rising big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'' The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do he pointed across the room and asked, ''Mrs. Williams, do you know the defense attorney?'' She again replied, ''Why, yes I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. I used to baby-sit him for his parents. And he, too, has been a real disappointment to me. He's lazy, bigoted, he has a drinking problem. The man can't build a normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the shoddiest in the entire state. Yes, I know him.'' At this point, the judge rapped the courtroom to silence and called both counselors to the bench. In a very quiet voice, he said with menace, ''If either of you asks her if she knows me, you'll be jailed for contempt!''</p>

43484,"<p>A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in 9 holes before he had to head home.<br /> Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone. </p>
<p>Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him. </p>
<p>To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. </p>
<p>Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green. </p>
<p>After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, ""You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree."" </p>
<p>With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay. </p>
<p>The old man offered one more comment, ""Of course, when I was your age that pine tree was only 3 feet tall.""</p>

43494,"<p>There once was a medieval village named Trinsic. This village was being terrorized by a vile monster, the Medicrin. Each night, the Medicrin would stalk down from the hills, and devour one of the villagers. The terrified villagers called a meeting, and decided to pool their money together to hire the great hero Erik. </p>
<p>Erik came and listened to the complaints of the villagers. He consulted his Great Hero's Book of Vile Monsters, and learned that Medicrins love to eat Loons. So Erik hunted high and low to find a loon. He found one, captured it, tied it up, and brought it back to the village. He then had the villagers dig a deep pit. Erik threw the loon into the pit, hoping to capture the Medicrin,and slay it. </p>
<p>That night, the Medicrin came... It smelled the loon... But it also smelled DANGER, and it ran off, devouring one of the villagers on the way out. </p>
<p>After calming the villagers, the next day, Erik again consulted his Great Hero's Book of Vile Monsters, and learned that Medicrins also love sugar. So Erik gathered up all of the sugar in the village, and threw it into the pit. </p>
<p>The loon, not having eaten in days, devoured all of the sugar in a single gulp. Erik was struck with panic, and ran to and fro trying to figure out what to do next, but night had fallen, and the Medicrin would bethere soon, so Erik crossed his fingers, and hoped for the best. That night, the Medicrin came... It smelled the loon... It smelled danger... But it also smelled the sugar, and the Medicrin dived into the pit, and devoured the loon. </p>
<p>The villagers swarmed over the Medicrin, and slew it. The moral of the story: ""A loon full of sugar helps the Medicrin go down.""</p>

Other passengers left their seats and came running over; suddenly the aircraft was rocked by a second blast as yet another engine exploded on the other side. The passengers were in a panic now, and even the stewardesses couldn't maintain order. Just then, standing tall and smiling confidently, the pilot strode from the cockpit and assured everyone that there was nothing to worry about. His words and his demeanor seemed made most of the passengers feel better, and they sat down as the pilot calmly walked to the door of the aircraft. There, he grabbed several packages from under the seats and began handing them to the flight attendants. Each crew member attached the package to their backs. 'Say,' spoke up an alert passenger, 'aren't those parachutes?' The pilot said they were. The passenger went on, 'But I thought you said there was nothing to worry about?'

Why don't you just swim around like us? Bob replied, with a smirk, well, when the time comes, I'm gonna be the first one there"". The others told him it was just destiny, but he said it wasn't.So, the day finally came when they were called upon. They were swimming along when Bob pulled ahead of the rest. Suddenly he stopped and turned around and headed back. The others asked him why he turned around and he said, ""back up boys its a BLOW JOB!""</p>

43548,"<p>HOW TO WRITE GOODby Frank L. ViscoMy several years in the word game have learnt me several rules:1. Avoid alliteration.  Always.2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.3. Avoid cliches like the plague.  (They're old hat.)4. Employ the vernacular.5. Eschew ampersands &amp; abbreviations, etc.6. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.7. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.8. Contractions aren't necessary.9. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.10. One should never generalize.11. Eliminate quotations.  As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said:  'I hate quotations.  Tell me what you know.'12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.13. Don't be redundant; don't more use words than necessary; it's highly superfluous.14. Profanity sucks.15. Be more or less specific.16. Understatement is always best.17. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.18. One-word sentences?  Eliminate.19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.20. The passive voice is to be avoided.21. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.22. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.23. Who needs rhetorical questions?</p>

43553,"<p>Bill gates has been in a car accident. He finds himself in purgatory, being sized up by St. Peter. ""Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call. I'm not sure where to send you. After all, you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before. In your case, I'm going to let you decide whether you want to go to Heaven or Hell.""</p>
<p>Bill replied, ""Well, what's the difference between the two?""</p>
<p>St. Peter: ""I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision.""</p>
<p>Bill: ""Fine, but where should I go first?""<br /> St. Peter: ""I'll leave that up to you.""<br /> ""Okay then,"" said Bill, ""Let's try Hell first.""</p>
<p>So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of bikini-clad women running around, playing in the water, laughing, and frolicking about. The sun was shining, the temperature was perfect. Bill was very pleased.</p>
<p>""This is great!"" he told St. Peter. ""If this is hell, I really want to see heaven!""<br /> ""Fine,"" said St. Peter, and off they went.</p>
<p>Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thought for a minute, and rendered his decision.</p>
<p>""Hmmm. I think I'd prefer Hell,"" he told St. Peter.<br /> ""Fine,"" retorted St. Peter, ""as you desire."" So Bill Gates went to Hell.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, St. Peter decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall, screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned and tortured by demons. ""How's everything going?"" he asked Bill.</p>
<p>Bill responded, with his voice filled with anguish and disappointment, ""This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the beautiful beaches, the scantily-clad women playing in the water?"" </p>
<p>""That was a demo,"" replied St. Peter.</p>

43559,"<p>A husband and a wife were out enjoying a round of golf about to tee off on the third hole which was lined with beautiful homes.<br /> The wife hit her shot and the ball began to slice. Her shot was headed directly at a very large plate glass window. Much to their surprise, the ball smashed through the window and shattered it into a million pieces. </p>
<p>They felt compelled to see what damage was done and drove off to see what happened. When they peeked inside the house, they found no one there. The husband called out and no one answered. Upon further investigation, they saw a gentleman sitting on the couch with a turban on his head. </p>
<p>The wife said, ""Do you live here?"" </p>
<p>""No, someone just hit a ball through the window, knocked over the vase you see there and freed me from that little bottle. I am so grateful,"" he answered. </p>
<p>The wife said, ""Are you a genie?"" </p>
<p>""Oh, why yes I am. In fact, I am so grateful I will grant you two wishes, the third I will keep for myself,"" the man replied. </p>
<p>The husband and wife agreed on two wishes...one was for a scratch handicap for the husband, to which the wife readily agreed. The other was for an income of $1,000,000 per year forever. </p>
<p>The genie nodded and said, ""Done!"" </p>
<p>The genie now said, ""For my wish, I would like to have my way with your wife."" I have not been with a woman for many years, and after all, I have made you a scratch golfer and a millionaire."" </p>
<p>The husband and wife agreed. </p>
<p>After the genie and wife were finished, the genie asked the wife, ""How long have you been married?"" to which she responded, ""Three years."" The genie then asked, ""How old is your husband?"" to which she responded, ""31 years old."" The genie then asked, ""How long has he believed in this genie stuff?""</p>

<p>His dad was very angry and said, ""If you jump in that creek again, just because, I'm gonna tan that hide - just because! Is that clear?""<br /> ""Yes dad."" replies his son.</p>
<p>The next day, the boy came home walking from school, and sure enough when he saw that creek, he jumped right on in.</p>
<p>When he went home, his dad knew what had happened and asked, ""Didn't I tell you not to jump in that creek again?""<br /> ""Yes dad, but Satan told me to do it!""</p>
<p>His dad, being somewhat religous, decided to give his son the benefit of the doubt and tells him - ""Next time Satan tells you to do something like that, say 'Satan get thee behind me in the name of Jesus'.""<br /> ""Ok dad."" replied the son.</p>
<p>Well the next day after school, the boy was walking across the bridge, and well you know the rest. He came home again soaked.</p>

<p>""If I died and you remarried, and she lived in this house,"" the wife asks, ""would she sleep in our bed?"" ""Well, the bed is brand new, and it cost us $2,<br /> 000. It's going to last a long time, so I guess she would.""</p>

This must be a sign from God. God must have meant that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace the rest of our days.""<br /> The priest replies, ""I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God."" </p>
<p>The rabbi continues, ""And look at this. Here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of Mogen David wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune."" Then he hands the bottle to the priest. </p>

43574,"<p>Ever since man crawled out of the primordial ooze, he has built himself structures to contain the processes of bodily waste removal.  These have been known as ""restrooms,"" ""bathrooms,"" ""outhouses,"" ""commodes,"" ""men's rooms,"" and several other names.</p>
<p>As with any exclusive organization, wholly half the human race aren't allowed through the door, and a number of exceedingly complicated customs have arisen to maintain a sense of order and dignity.</p>
<p>General rules:</p>
<p>1. Don't talk to somebody you don't know. You may chat quietly with an acquaintance, but must absolutely not call attention to yourself.</p>
<p>2. A quick glance in the mirror is permissible, but absolutely don't spend a significant time arranging hair, clothing, etc. Zit popping is only permissible after checking to see nobody else is around.</p>
<p>3. No profanity of any kind. This is reserved for locker rooms, only.</p>
<p>4. If you must wait, form a single-file line, ragged, and be sure to keep looking around. Read graffiti.</p>
<p>Grafitti rules:</p>
<p>5. All graffiti is anonymous. If there's any chance somebody can trace your graffiti back to you, don't do it.</p>
<p>6. Writing graffiti in the open section of the bathroom is only acceptable if nobody can see you. Writing in the stalls is similarly acceptable.</p>
<p>7. If the bathroom is sufficiently public, feel free to insult different ethnic/racial/sexual groups. If the bathroom is used by a small few, restraint comments to amusing anecdotes or chit-chat about secretaries. If visiting dignitaries from other companies or the government may tend to use the bathroom, graffiti is forbidden.</p>
<p>8. Traditionally, all pictures feature women in various states of undress. Modern standards often include portions of male anatomy, discretely placed. Homosexual graffiti is generally frowned upon but is gaining popularity.</p>
<p>9. Pictures must only be drawn in toilet stalls.</p>
<p>10. Any sufficiently interesting graffiti will be painted over by the management of the bathroom.</p>
<p>Urinal rules:</p>
<p>11. Given a string of unoccupied urinals, you must choose one on the outside. When one outside urinal is occupied, use the other side, then middle.  Avoid standing directly next to somebody at all costs.</p>
<p>For example, given seven urinals, here are acceptable configurations:<br /> X......(X = occupied, . = empty)<br /> X.....X<br /> X..X..X<br /> X.X.X.X<br /> XXX.X.X</p>
"
43575,"<p>Q: Why do they say 'Amen' at the end of a prayer instead of 'Awomen'? A: The same reason they sing Hymns instead of Hers! Q: Why didn't Noah go fishing? A: He only had two worms! Q: When was the longest day in the Bible? A: The day Adam was created because there was no Eve. Q: Why did God create man before woman? A: He didn't want any advice. Q: What do you call a sleepwalking nun? A: A roamin' Catholic! Doctor: 'Your recovery was a miracle!' Patient: 'PRAISE GOD. Now I don't have to pay you!' Q: Why did Moses wander in the desert for 40 years? A: Even then men wouldn't ask for directions!</p>

<p>""Well, let me see if I can give you an example...you have a dog, right?""</p>
<p>""Yeah, that's right, �the neighbor #1 responds.</p>
<p>""And you have children too, right?"" says the professor.</p>
<p>""Wow, right again,"" exclaims the neighbor.</p>
<p>""So, then you must be married and that would make you a heterosexual, right?''<br /> proclaims the professor.</p>
<p>""Unbelievable, you're absolutely correct. How do you know all this about me?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" the professor says, ""I observed there was a dog house in your<br /> backyard, so you must have a dog. I also saw bicycles next to your garage, so<br /> you must have children. And if you have children, you are probably married and<br /> if you�re married, you are most likely heterosexual...it was all logical!""</p>

43588,"<p>Una pareja de golfistas est�n jugando una tarde en un exclusivo campo rodeado de lujos�simas mansiones de millones de d�lares.  En el hoyo 3, el marido le dice a la esposa:</p>
<p>""Querida, ten cuidado cuando golpees, porque si rompes una ventana nos va a costar una fortuna reponerla"".</p>
<p>La esposa golpea y la pelota va a dar al ventanal m�s grande de la casa m�s lujosa de la urbanizaci�n. El marido la increpa dici�ndole:</p>
<p>""�Te fijas, lo primero que te dije, ahora ve t� a saber cuanto va a costar esa ventana!""</p>
<p>El esposo se dirige a la casa, acompa�ado de lamujer, toca la puerta y una voz desde adentro le dice:</p>
<p>""Adelante...""</p>
<p>El hombre abre la puerta y mira que hay vidrio esparcido por toda la casa y una botella rota a un lado del sal�n. Un hombre elegantemente vestido, sentado en un sof� le dice:</p>

<p>""Sss��..., en realidad lo sentimos mucho"".</p>

43589,"<p>Hab�a una vez, hace muchos a�os, un joven que fue descubierto por tratar de robarse una Oveja. Sus captores lo presentaron ante el Rey, quien le dijo que s�lo le salvar�a la vida si le consegu�a la respuesta a una pregunta. ""�Por supuesto!"" exclam� el condenado a muerte. El Rey le dijo: ""Trae la respuesta antes de que el Gallo cante, de qu� es lo que busca una mujer"".</p>
<p>El desorientado joven sali� de inmediato del Palacio y se dirigi� con su mejor amigo. Este le dijo que en el Bosque hab�a una Bruja que ten�a respuesta a todas las preguntas, pero que tuviera cuidado, ya que ella no daba nada sin algo a cambio.</p>
<p>El joven se intern� en el Bosque y de pronto, entre las Brumas, sali� una horripilante mujer... llena de barros en la cara, los ojos saltones y con un olor f�tido en la boca. ""�Qu� quieres jovencito?"" le pregunt� la horrible bruja. El joven le explic� que si no le llevaba al Rey la respuesta de lo que busca una mujer, �l morir�a antes del amanecer.</p>
<p>La Bruja le dijo, ""Mira, s�lo si tu mejor amigo se casa conmigo, te dir� la respuesta.""</p>
<p>El joven regres� a ver a su amigo, quien le dijo, ""Hermano, con tal de que te salves t�, acepto"". </p>
<p>El joven sali� nuevamente rumbo al bosque encantado y le dijo a la Bruja que su amigo aceptaba casarse con ella.</p>
<p>La bruja contest� a su pregunta: ""Lo que una mujer busca, es ser reina y soberana de su propio destino"".</p>
<p>At�nito ante la respuesta, el joven fue a ver al Rey Arturo y le dijo la respuesta, y el Rey lo perdon�.</p>
<p>La tarde siguiente se llev� a cabo la boda entre el amigo y la bruja. El Hombre, vestido con traje de Caballero Guerrero de batalla Medieval, y la bruja, vestida de color p�rpura y con un velo color rosa mexicano, caminaba cojeando de un pie y a su paso todas las flores de la iglesia se secaban.</p>
<p>Ya en la noche, en el lecho nupcial, la bruja le dijo al reci�n desposado amante, que se pondr�a c�moda. Minutos m�s tarde, del ba�o sal�a una hermosa mujer... una princesa hermos�sima con un cuerpo envidiable.</p>
<p>""Hola, no temas, soy tu esposa."" Como t� aceptaste sacrificarte por tu amigo, yo debo premiarte porque tambi�n hay brujas buenas. Te dar� a escoger... �que prefieres? �que yo sea bruja de noche y princesa de d�a o que sea princesa de noche y bruja de d�a?""</p>
<p>El esposo le dijo que �l se hab�a casado por afecto a su amigo y que pensaba que podr�a llegar a enamorarse de ella como fuera, sin importarle su fealdad, por lo que ELLA ESCOGIERA SU DESTINO. Acto seguido, un rayo parti� el suelo y la princesa lo abraz� y le dijo: ""�Haz roto el hechizo, amado m�o!... me has permitido ser due�a y soberana de MI DESTINO... ser� para ti una princesa de noche y princesa de d�a!""</p>
<p>Moraleja: Las mujeres siempre podr�n darnos una cara de princesas ya sea de d�a o de noche... pero �cuidado... en el fondo son unas Malditas Brujas!</p>

""A good coonhound would never hurt a cat.""""Sweetie,"" I say, slapping a mosquito, ""you wouldn't know a coon dog from a corn dog.""It's the middle of the night, and Sweetie and I are clawing our way through briars and brambles in search of my cat, Cat.  Meanwhile, off in the distance, coon dogs are running through the foggy woods of our farm, howling like the Hound of the Baskerville.""Exactly how does one distinguish a 'good' coon dog from one that's gone bad?"" I huff and puff, as I crawl after Sweetie up the hill.  ""Do they howl with a private school accent?!""""Cat can take care of himself,"" Sweetie calls back over his shoulder. ""He'll climb a tree.""""Oh, please!"" I wheeze.  ""If he gains another ounce, we'll have to hoist him into his litter box with a crane!""I am not opposed to hunting.  I just have a small problem with armed, drunken rednecks chasing the Hounds of Hell through my back yard between the hours of midnight and 3 a.m.Furthermore, Cat doesn't resemble any animal known to man.  He doesn't have a tail, and he's built like Son of Flubber.  If I saw the furry glob oozing toward me on a tree limb, I'd shoot him.We finally make it to the top of the hill.  While I'm bent over double, gripping my side and spitting blood, Sweetie has his head cocked like a beagle and is listening to the wind.""You go that way,"" he says, pointing into total darkness.  I'm just about to tell Sweetie where he can go when a blood-curdling howl pierces the air.  Without a thought, I take off into the abyss.As I hack my way through blackberries with my flashlight and splash through the freezing creek, my imagination runs wild.  I see poor Cat trembling on a limb.  Below him, cat-killing coon dogs, foaming at the mouth and hopped up on Junk Yard Dog Chow, snap and rip at the tree. Meanwhile, inbred Neanderthals, their drunken laughter echoing through the holler, pass the jug.""What d'yu reckon that thang is, Bob Bart Billy Boy?""

I holler through clenched teeth.The Coon Man spins around and, one can't help but notice, he's wearing the ever-stylish J. Peterman all-weather safari jacket.""You're trespassing!"" I yell, slightly deterred by the fashion statement but still breathing hard.  ""Get that vicious pack of kitty-killing coon dogs off my property!""My message doesn't carry quite the punch I'd hoped for, what with a floppy-eared coon dog with soulful brown eyes licking my hand.""Madame,"" the hunter says, using the classic Oxford pronunciation, ""a good coon dog would never hurt a cat.""Do men have a monthly newsletter that updates them on junk like this? When I get back to the house, I'm dripping wet, draped in poison ivy and probably have tetanus from my run-in with a rusty barbed wire fence.Meanwhile, Sweetie and Cat -- not a cat hair out of place -- are stretched out on the couch watching ""Baywatch.""""Man,"" Sweetie says, tossing a handful of popcorn in the vicinity of his mouth, ""you look rough.""As much as I would simply love to sit and chat, there's a varmint crawling up my leg, and I suspect his intentions are less honorable than a good coon dog's.Copyright 1998 P.S.

Not a purebred, either.The God I believe in owns a mutt, a big, slobbering thing with the heart of a lion and the brain of a marble.As you might expect, the subject of God having a dog is a sensitive one with most people.  Not only do most people refuse to believe that God has a pet, but that if he does, no way would it be a dog.The few people I've met who conceded the God/pet issue have invariably argued for a more noble pet type:  elephant, tiger, whale, T-Rex and, in one bizarre case, a mongoose.  These people were all idiots.Over the years, I have argued this deep theological issue with pastors, bishops, reverends, priests and at least one rabbi.  None of them was ever able to convince me of the truthfulness of their faith because none of them ever conceded that God would have a dog.  One came close.""All of God's creations are in effect his pets,"" said a minister who almost had me.  ""So I suppose it could be reasonably argued that God has a dog for a pet.  Yes, I'm sure of it.""""OK, then, what's the dog's name?""""Well, I don't really see ....""""Liar!""A dog is the sort of pet God would have.  You don't need to look it up in the Bible.  Just think about it for a minute.  Dogs love unconditionally.  Dogs are loyal.  Dogs are brave.You see dogs in Reader's Digest all the time rescuing people.  Dogs have the spirit of truth in them, in part because they aren't smart enough to know how to lie.By the way, God's dog is named Vern.This is not your typical religious subject, I know.  It's an important one to me because I had to put my dog to sleep last week.  Pig collapsed with heat exhaustion during a hike in the mountains and suffered irreparable kidney damage.The only thing that has sustained me during the past few days is the belief that when I die, Pig will be there waiting for me.  She may be bathed in celestial glory but she'll still be my unlicensed, gopher-digging, rug-gnawing best friend.I'm a Mormon but my wants are simple.  God can keep the celestial mansion, eternal glory and everything else.  Pig was family.  If families really are forever, then I want her back.Actually, I want all of my former dogs back.  Pig, Lennon, Beau, John Wayne, Baron and Lurch.  If I'm good, God will give them back to me because, frankly, heaven would be pretty pointless without them.Wait.  I probably won't get Beau back.  Not unless I go to hell.  I'm pretty sure that's where he is.  Beau was not a good dog.  I'm not talking about the time he tore the pants off a terrified Jehovah's Witness, either.  Beau's moral turpitude involved cats.  He liked them. He hung out with them.It doesn't take the pope or a prophet to point out the fact that cats are deceitful and nasty.They are stiff-necked and arrogant, puffed up in their pride.  Cats are cruel, evil things utterly incapable of loyalty and honor.  Ever see a cat rescue someone from drowning?  Nope.And that's why you won't ever see a cat in heaven.The devil has a cat for a pet.</p>

<p>And the Lord replied, ''Yes Adam, I thought you might enjoy that. Now, I'd like you to caress Eve.'' And Adam said, ''What is a 'caress'?''

<p>A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident, and rushes over to interview the boy. ""Young Bruins Fan Saves friend from Vicious Animal..."" he starts writing in his notebook. ""But, I'm not a Bruins Fan"", the little hero replied. ""Sorry, since we're in Boston, I just assumed you were"", said the reporter and starts again. ""Red Sox Fan Rescues Friend from Horrific attack..."" he continues to write in his notebook. ""I'm not a Red Sox fan either!"" The boy said. ""I assumed everyone in Boston was either a Bruins or Red Sox fan. So, what team do you root for? the reporter asked. ""I'm a Yankees fan!"" the child beamed.

43623,"<p>Three guys found themselves in Hell: we will call them Carl, Bob, and Brett, they were a little confused at their present situation, and they were startled to see a door in the wall open, and behind the door was perhaps the ugliest woman they had ever seen. She was 3'4"", dirty, and you could smell her even over the Brimstone. The voice of the Devil was heard, ""Brett, you have sinned! You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this woman!"" And Brett was whisked through the door by a group of lesser demons to his torment. This understandably shook up the other two, and so they both jumped when a second door opened, and they saw an even more disgusting example of womanhood gone wrong. She was over 7' tall, monstrous, covered in thick black hair,and flies circled her. The voice of the Devil was heard, ""Carl, you have sinned! You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this woman!"" And Carl, like Brett, was whisked off. Bob, now alone, felt understandably anxious, and feared the worst when the third door opened. And as the door inched open, he strained to see the figure of ... Cindy Crawford. Delighted, Bob jumped up, taking in the sight of this beautiful woman, dressed in a skimpy bikini. Then he heard the voice of the Devil saying:""Cindy, you have sinned.""</p>

A policeman checks the crowd but no priest, no minister, no man of God of any  kind. ""A priest, please"" the dying man says again.Then out of the crowd steps a little old Jewish man of at least eighty years of age. ""Mr. Policeman,"" says the man, ""I'm not a priest. I'm not even a  Catholic. But for fifty years now I'm living behind St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church on First Avenue, and every night I'm listening to the  Catholic litany. Maybe I can be of some comfort to this man."" The policeman agreed and brought the octogenarian over to where the dying man lay. He kneels down, leans over the injured and says in a solemn voice: ""J-2. I-1. O-27. F-34. I-12. . .""</p>

43634,"<p>Three men stand before St. Peter awaiting admission into Heaven.<br /> However, St. Peter has been informed that Heaven will only admit<br /> 33% of applicants today. The admissions standard: Who died the<br /> worst death? So, St. Peter takes each of the three men aside in<br /> turn and asks them about how they died.</p>
<p>First man: ""I'd been suspecting for a long time that my wife was<br /> cheating on me. I decided to come home early from work one<br /> afternoon and check to see if I could catch her in the act. When<br /> I got back to my apartment, I heard the water running. My wife<br /> was in the shower. I looked everywhere for the guy, but couldn't<br /> find anyone or any trace that he had been there. The last place<br /> I looked was out on the balcony.</p>
<p>I found the bastard hanging from the edge, trying to get back<br /> in! So I started jumping up and down on his hands, and he<br /> yelled, but he didn't fall. So I ran inside and got a hammer,<br /> and crushed his fingers with it until he fell twenty-five floors<br /> screaming in agony. But the fall didn't kill the asshole. He<br /> landed in some bushes! So I dragged the refirgerator from the<br /> kitchen (it weighed about a ton), pulled it to the balcony, and<br /> hurled it over the edge. It landed right on the guy and killed<br /> him. But then I felt so horrible about what I had done, I went<br /> back into the bedroom and shot myself.""</p>
<p>St. Peter nodded slowly as the man recounted the story. Then,<br /> telling the first man to wait, he took the second aside.</p>
<p>Second man: ""I lived on the twenty-seventh floor of this<br /> apartment building. I had just purchased this book on morning<br /> exercises and was practicing them on my balcony, enjoying the<br /> sunshine, when I lost my balance and fell off the edge. Luckily,<br /> I only fell about two floors before grabbing another balcony and<br /> holding on for dear life. I was trying to pull myself up when<br /> this guy came running onto what must have been his balcony and<br /> started jumping up and down on my hands. I screamed in pain, but<br /> he seemed really irate. When he finally stopped, I tried to pull<br /> myself up again, but he came out with a hammer and smashed my<br /> fingers to a pulp! I fell, and I thought I was dead, but I<br /> landed in some bushes. I couldn't believe my second stroke of<br /> luck, but it didn't last. The last thing I saw was this enormous<br /> refrigerator falling from the building down on top of me and<br /> crushing me.""</p>
<p>St. Peter comforted the man, who seemed to have several broken<br /> bones. Then he told him to wait, and turned to the third man.</p>
<p>Third man: ""Picture this. You're hiding, naked, in a<br /> refrigerator...""</p>

<p>Although he didn't ask for them, Wife1.0 came with Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw and BrotherInLaw. </p>
<p>Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend4.0... </p>
<p>- A ""Don't remind me again"" button </p>
<p>- Minimize button </p>
<p>- Shutdown feature </p>
<p>- An installshield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be completely uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache and other objects) </p>
<p>- ""Abort"" button (O.K. that one's pretty bad - but had to say it) </p>
<p>I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still installed, they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted. Then I tried to uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 but it didn't have an uninstall program. I tried to unstall it by hand, but it put files in my system directory. </p>
<p>Another thing that sucks -- in all versions of Girlfriend that I've used is that it is totally ""object orientated"" and only supports hardware with gold plated contacts. </p>

<p>Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to install, claiming insufficient resources.</p>

<p>1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br /> 2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.<br /> 3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.<br /> 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.</p>
<p>The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender because:<br /> 1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.<br /> 2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br /> 3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br /> 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.</p>

I'll give $500 American dollars to anybody in here who can drink 10 pints of Guinness back-to-back."" The room is quiet and no one takes up the Texan's offer.<br /> One man even leaves.

<p>The Texan says yes and asks the bartender to line up 10 pints of Guinness. Immediately the Irishman tears into all 10 of the pint glasses drinking them all back-to-back. </p>

43736,"<p>A hip young man goes out and buys the best car on the<br /> market, a brand new Ferrari GTO. It is also the most<br /> expensive car in the world, and it costs him $500,000. He<br /> takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light.<br /> An old man on a Moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls<br /> up next to him. The old man looks over at the sleek, shiny<br /> car and asks, ""What kind of car ya' got there sonny?"" </p>
<p>The young man replies, ""A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a<br /> million dollars!"" </p>
<p>""That's a lot of money,"" says the old man. ""Why does it<br /> cost so much?"" </p>
<p>""Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!"" states<br /> the young dude proudly. </p>
<p>The Moped driver asks, ""Mind if I take a look inside?"" </p>
<p>""No problem,"" replies the owner. So the old man pokes his<br /> head in the window and looks around. </p>
<p>Then, sitting back on his Moped, the old man says, ""That's<br /> a pretty nice car, all right...but I'll stick with my<br /> Moped!"" </p>
<p>Just then the light changes, so the guy decides to show the<br /> old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within<br /> 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph. Suddenly, he<br /> notices a dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be<br /> getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be and<br /> suddenly WHHHOOOOOOSSSSSHHH! Something whips by him going<br /> much faster! </p>
<p>""What on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?"" the<br /> young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes<br /> the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees<br /> that it's the old man on the Moped! Amazed that the Moped<br /> could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the<br /> moped at 275 mph. WHOOOOOOOSHHHHH! He's feeling pretty good<br /> until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining<br /> on him AGAIN! </p>
<p>Astounded by the speed of this old guy, he floors the gas<br /> pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not<br /> ten seconds later, he sees the Moped bearing down on him<br /> again! The Ferrari is flat out, and there's nothing he can<br /> do! </p>
<p>Suddenly, the Moped plows into the back of his Ferrari,<br /> demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out<br /> and unbelievably the old man is still alive. He runs up to<br /> the mangled old man and says, ""Oh My God! Is there anything<br /> I can do for you?"" </p>
<p>The old man<br /> whispers...""Unhook...my...suspenders...from...your...side-<br /> view......mirror"".</p>

<p>They boys' mother heard that a clergyman in town had been<br /> successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would<br /> speak with her boys.

So the clergyman<br /> repeated the question in an even sterner tone, ""Where is God!!?""<br /> Again the boy made no attempt to answer. So the clergyman raised<br /> his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and<br /> bellowed, ""WHERE IS GOD!?""</p>

43749,"<p>(Please don't try this at home)August, 1998, Montevideo, UruguayPaolo Esperanza, bass-trombonist with the Simphonica Mayor de Uruguay, in a misplaced moment of inspiration decided to make his own contribution to the cannon shots fired as part of the orchestra's performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture at an outdoor children's concert. In complete seriousness he placed a large, ignited firecracker, which was equivalent in strength to a quarter stick of dynamite, into his aluminum straight mute and then stuck the mute into the bell of his quite new Yamaha in-line double-valve bass trombone.Later, from his hospital bed he explained to a reporter through bandages on his mouth, ''I thought that the bell of my trombone would shield me from the explosion and instead, would focus the energy of the blast outward's and away from me, propelling the mute high above the orchestra, like a rocket.''However, Paolo was not up on his propulsion physics nor qualified to use high-powered artillery and in his haste to get the horn up before the firecracker went off,  he failed to raise the bell of the horn high enough so as to give the mute enough arc to clear the orchestra.What actually happened should serve as a lesson to us all during those delirious moments of divine inspiration.  First, because he failed to sufficiently elevate the bell of his horn, the blast propelled the mute between rows of players in the woodwind and viola sections of the orchestra, missing the players and straight into the stomach of the conductor, driving him off the podium and directly into the front row of the audience.Fortunately, the audience were sitting in folding chairs and thus they were protected from serious injury, for the chairs collapsed under them passing the energy of the impact of the flying conductor backwards into row of people sitting behind them, who in turn were driven back into the people in the row behind and so on, like a row of dominos. The sound of collapsing wooden chairs and grunts of people falling on their behinds increased logarithmically, adding to the overall sound of brass cannons and brass playing as constitutes the closing measures of the Overture.Meanwhile, all of this unplanned choreography not withstanding, back on stage Paolo's Waterloo was still unfolding.  According to Paolo, ''Just as the I heard the sound of the blast, time seemed to stand still. Everything moved in slow motion. Just before I felt searing pain to my mouth, I could swear I heard a voice with a Austrian accent say ''Fur every akshon zer iz un eekvul un opposeet reakshon!''Well, this should come as no surprise, for Paolo had set himself up for a textbook demonstration of this fundamental law of physics. Having failed to plug the lead pipe of his trombone, he allowed the energy of the blast to send a super-heated jet of gas backwards through the mouth pipe of the trombone which  exited the mouthpiece burning his lips and face.The pyrotechnic ballet wasn't over yet.  The force of the blast was so great it split the bell of his shiny Yamaha right down the middle, turning it inside out while at the same time propelling Paolo backwards off the riser. And for the grand finale, as Paolo fell backwards he lost his grip on the slide of the trombone allowing the pressure of the hot gases coursing through the horn to propel the trombone's slide like a double golden spear into the head of the 3rd clarinetist, knocking him unconscious.The moral of the story?  Beware the next time you hear someone in the trombone section yell out:  ''Hey, everyone, watch this!''</p>

43750,"<p>Voy a contarles mi historia. No es una historia de amor ni tiene un final feliz, pero es la �nica que tengo por haber nacido as�: FEO, muy FEO.</p>
<p>Cuando nac�, el doctor fue a la sala de espera y le dijo a mi padre ""Hicimos lo que pudimos...pero sali�"".</p>
<p>Mi mam� no sab�a si quedarse conmigo o con la placenta.</p>
<p>Como era prematuro me metieron en una incubadora... con vidrios polarizados.</p>
<p>Mi madre nunca me dio el pecho porque dec�a que solo me quer�a como amigo. As� que en vez de darme el pecho, me daba la espalda.</p>
<p>Es por eso que debo haber quedado petiso, tan petiso que en lugar de ser enano, soy profundo. De chico iba por los cuarteles para que me gritaran: �alto!, �alto!.</p>
<p>Yo siempre fui muy peludo. A mi madre siempre le preguntaban: Se�ora, a su hijo �lo pari� o lo teji�?.</p>
<p>Mi padre llevaba en su cartera la foto del ni�o que ya ven�a en la cartera cuando la compr�.</p>
<p>Pronto me di cuenta que mis padres me odiaban, pues mis juguetes para la ba�era eran un radio y un tostador el�ctrico.</p>
<p>Una vez me perd�. Le pregunte al polic�a si cre�a que �bamos a encontrar a mis padres. Me contesto: No lo s�; hay un mont�n de lugares donde se pudieron haber escondido.</p>
<p>Y para colmo era muy flaco, tan flaco que un d�a met� los dedos en el enchufe y la electricidad err� la patada. Era realmente flaco: para hacer sombra ten�a que pasar dos veces por el mismo lugar. Pero mi problema no era ser tan flaco sino ser FEO.</p>
<p>Mis padres ten�an que atarme un trozo de carne al cuello para que el perro jugara conmigo.</p>
<p>Si amigos, yo soy FEO, tan FEO que una vez me atropell� un auto y qued� mejor.</p>
<p>Cuando me secuestraron, los secuestradores mandaron un dedo m�o a mis padres para pedir recompensa. Mi padre les contest� que quer�a mas pruebas.</p>
<p>Yo creo que no pagaron el rescate porque en casa �ramos muy pobres. Pero eso s�, a pesar de nuestra situaci�n econ�mica, somos muy honrados. Mi padre era tan honrado que un d�a encontr� trabajo, y lo devolvi�.</p>
<p>Por eso tuve que trabajar desde chico. Trabaj� en una tienda de animales y la gente no paraba de preguntarme cu�nto costaba yo. Un d�a llam� una chica a mi casa dici�ndome: ""Ven a mi casa que no hay nadie"". Cuando llegu� no hab�a nadie.</p>
<p>A mi mujer le gusta mucho hablar conmigo despu�s del sexo. El otro d�a me llam� a casa desde un motel.</p>

43751,"<p>This married couple was on holiday in Pakistan. They were<br /> touring around the marketplace looking at the goods and such,<br /> when they passed this small sandal shop. From inside they heard<br /> a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, ""You, foreigners! Come<br /> in. Come into my humble shop."" So the married couple walked in.</p>
<p>The Pakistani man said to them, ""I have some special sandals I<br /> think you'd be interested in. They make you wild at sex like a<br /> great desert camel."" </p>
<p>Well, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after<br /> what the man had claimed, but her husband felt he really didn't<br /> need them, being the sex god he was. </p>
<p>The husband asked the man, ""How could sandals make you into a<br /> sex freak?"" </p>
<p>The Pakistani man replied, ""Just try them on."" </p>
<p>Well, the husband, after much badgering from his wife, finally<br /> conceded to try them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his<br /> feet, he got this wild look in his eyes; something his wife<br /> hadn't seen in many years - raw sexual power. </p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, the husband rushed the Pakistani man,<br /> threw him on a table and started tearing at the guy's pants. </p>
<p>All the time the Pakistani man was screaming, ""YOU HAVE THEM ON<br /> THE WRONG FEET!"".</p>

She then<br /> asked if there was something she could help the gentleman with.<br /> The man said ""this is embarrassing for me, but I have a permanent erection<br /> which causes me a lot of problems and severe embarrassment. I was wondering what<br /> you could give me for it?""<br /> The pharmacist said ""Just a minute, I'll go talk to my sister.""<br /> When she returned, she said, ""the best we can do is 1/3<br /> ownership in the store and $3000 a month in living expenses.""</p>

43754,"<p>One night, a police officer was stalking out a particularly<br /> rowdy bar for possible violations of the<br /> driving-under-the-influence laws.</p>
<p>At closing time, he saw a fellow stumble out of the bar, trip on<br /> the curb, and try his keys on five different cars before he<br /> found his. Then, sat in the front seat fumbling around with his<br /> keys for several minutes. Everyone left the bar and drove off.<br /> Finally, he started his engine and began to pull away.</p>
<p>The police officer was waiting for him. He stopped the driver,<br /> read him his rights and administered the Breathalyzer test. The<br /> results showed a reading of 0.0. </p>
<p>The puzzled officer demanded to know how that could be.</p>
<p>The driver replied, ""Tonight, I'm the designated decoy.""</p>

43755,"<p>So there's this fella with a parrot. And this parrot swears like a sailor, I mean he's a pistol. He can swear for five minutes straight without repeating himself. Trouble is, the guy who owns him is a quiet, conservative type, and this bird's foul mouth is driving him crazy. </p>
<p>One day, it gets to be too much, so the guy grabs the bird by the throat, shakes him really hard, and yells, ""QUIT IT!"" </p>
<p>But this just makes the bird mad and he swears more than ever. Then the guy gets mad and says, ""OK for you."" and locks the bird in a kitchen cabinet. </p>
<p>This really aggravates the bird and he claws and scratches, and when the guy finally lets him out, the bird cuts loose with a stream of vulgarities that would make a veteran sailor blush. At that point, the guy is so mad that he throws the bird into the freezer.</p>
<p>For the first few seconds there is a terrible din. The bird kicks and claws and thrashes. Then it suddenly gets _very_ quiet. At first the guy just waits, but then he starts to think that the bird may be hurt. After a couple of minutes of silence, he's so worried that he opens up the freezer door. </p>
<p>The bird calmly climbs onto the man's outstretched arm and says, ""Awfully sorry about the trouble I gave you. I'll do my best to improve my vocabulary from now on."" </p>
<p>The man is astounded. He can't understand the transformation that has come over the parrot. </p>
<p>Then the parrot says, ""By the way, what did the chicken do?""</p>

43762,"<p>Democrats buy most of the books that have been banned somewhere. Republicans form censorship committees and read them as a group. Democrats give their worn out clothes to those less fortunate. Republicans wear theirs. Democrats name their children after currently popular sports figures, politicians, and entertainers. Republican children are named after their parents or grandparents, according to where the money is. Republicans tend to keep their shades drawn, although there is seldom any reason why they should. Democrats ought to, but don't. Republican boys date Democratic girls. They plan to marry Republican girls, but feel that they're entitled to a little fun first. Democrats make plans and then do something else. Republicans follow the plans their grandfathers made. Republicans sleep in twin beds--some even in separate rooms. </p>
<p>That is why there are more Democrats.</p>

43764,"<p>In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.</p>
<p>And Satan said, ""It doesn't get any better than this.""</p>
<p>And God said, ""Let there be light,"" and there was light. Then God said, ""Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit,"" and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>And Satan said, ""There goes the neighborhood.""</p>
<p>And God said, ""Let us make Man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth."" So God created Man in His own image; male and female created He them.</p>
<p>And God looked upon Man and Woman and saw that they were lean and fit.</p>
<p>And God created the healthful yogurt, that woman might keep her figure that man found so fair.</p>
<p>And Satan brought forth chocolate. And Woman gained 5 lb.</p>
<p>And God said, ""Try my crispy fresh salad.""</p>
<p>And Satan brought forth Ben &amp; Jerry's. And Woman gained 10 lb.</p>
<p>And God said, ""I have sent thee heart-healthy vegetables and olive oil with which to cook them.""</p>
<p>And Satan brought forth chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own platter.</p>
<p>And Man gained 10 lb. and his bad cholesterol went through the roof.</p>
<p>And God brought forth running shoes and Man resolved to lose those extra pounds.</p>
<p>And Satan brought forth cable TV with remote control so Man would not have to toil to change channels between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man gained another 20 pounds.</p>
<p>And God said, ""You're running up the score, Satan.""</p>
<p>So then God brought forth the potato, a vegetable naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition.</p>
<p>And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fat fried them. And he created sour cream dip also. Man clutched his remote control and ate the potato chips swaddled in cholesterol.</p>
<p>And God populated the earth with broccoli and cauliflower and spinach, green and yellow vegetables of all kinds, so Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.</p>
<p>And Satan created McDonald's. McDonald's brought forth the $.99 double cheeseburger. And Satan said to Man, ""You want fries with that?"" And Man said, ""Supersize them."" And Man gained 5 pounds.</p>
<p>And Satan saw and said, ""It is good."" And Man went into cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.</p>
<p>And Satan smiled and created HMOs.</p>

<p>His friend said, ""Don't do that. There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. And it only costs $10.00."" </p>
<p>The guy figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise andvarious lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read:<br /> You have tennis elbow.<br /> Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor.<br /> It will be better in two weeks. </p>
<p>That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this computer could be fooled. </p>
<p>He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in thisample and deposited the $10.00. The machine again made the usual noises,flashedlights, and printed out the following analysis:<br /> Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.<br /> Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.<br /> Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> Your wife is pregnant....twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. </p>

43791,"<p>Dear Pal:Well here it is, the end of another year, and as is my custom I take out a little time to write a few of my good friends, it is the time when I remember all the good things that have happened to me in the past twelve months. When I reflect on the value of the friendships I have cherished over the years. When, in fact, I indulge myself to the extent of waxing a bit sentimental.It's a snowy evening, the doorbell rings, intermittently, but here in my den it is cozy and comfortable and peaceful. I'm sitting before a nice open fire with my typewriter, sort of half-listening to the hi-fi, and slowly sipping a nice very dry double Martini. I surely wish you were here but since you are not, the least I can do is toast your health and happiness for the coming year  so time out, old pal, while I bend my elbow with thoughts of you.I just took a recess to mix another Martini and while I was out in the kitchen I thought of all the time I would waste during the evening, chasing back and forth, so I just make up a big picther of martinies and broughggt it back in with me so I'd have it right here beside me and wouldn't have to wast time making more of them. So now I'm all set and here goes pal. Besides Marinis are a great drink. For some reason they never seem to have the effect on me in the slightest that they have on oter fellas. Can drinj them all day longg so here goes.The greatest think in tje whole word is friendship.

You'll like it here"".<br /> Walking through the gates, the man noticed clocks everywhere. There were grandfather clocks, wall clocks, watches, and clocks in every corner. It appeared that heaven was nothing more than a giant clock warehouse.<br /> Surprised at how heaven looked, the man asked St. Peter what the deal was. Why are all these clocks here in heaven? St Peter replied, the clocks keep track of things on earth. There is one clock for each person. Every time the person on earth tells a lie, his clock moves one minute. For instance, this clock is for Sam, the used car salesman. If you watch it closely, it will move. Click. The minute hand on Sam's clock moved one minute. Click. It moved another minute.Sam must be into closing a customer right now said St. Peter. The minute hand on his clock moves all day.<br /> The man and St Peter continued walking. Soon they came to a clock with cobwebs on the minute hand. Whose clock is this"" asked the man. That clock belongs to the Widow Mary. She is one of the finest, God-fearing people on earth. I bet her clock hasn't moved in a year or two.<br /> They continued walking and touring heaven. The man enjoyed watching the clocks of all of his friends. When the tour was over the man said, "" I've seen everyone's clock but President Clinton's. Where is his clock?""<br /> Saint Peter smiled, ""Just look up. We use his clock for a ceiling fan!""</p>

They also had a big bushy cat who liked to sit on the edge of the printer next to the operator.Well, one day we got a service call that said, ""Cat caught in machine, come quick!""When I arrived I saw everyone sitting around mending their various wounds, scratches and contusions.  No sight of the cat.  It appears that while they were running the machine the cat was twirling his tail in his usual fashion and stuck it down into the printer at the most inopportune time and got sucked in! Apparently, the cat absolutely freaked out and clawed at everyone who came close. They finally freed the cat, and to this day, the cat goes nowhere near the machine.</p>

43831,"<p>VATICAN CITY (AP) -- In a joint press conference in St. Peter's Square this morning, MICROSOFT Corp. and the Vatican announced that the Redmond software giant will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for an unspecified number of shares of MICROSOFT common stock. If the deal goes through, it will be the first time a computer software company has acquired a major world religion.</p>
<p>With the acquisition, Pope John Paul II will become the senior vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software Division, while MICROSOFT senior vice-presidents Michael Maples and Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said MICROSOFT Chairman Bill Gates.</p>
<p>""We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years,"" said Gates. ""The combined resources of MICROSOFT and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people.""</p>
<p>Through the MICROSOFT Network, the company's new on-line service, ""we will make the sacraments available on-line for the first time"" and revive the popular pre-Counter-Reformation practice of selling indulgences, said Gates. ""You can get Communion, confess your sins, receive absolution -- even reduce your time in Purgatory -- all without leaving your home.""</p>
<p>A new software application, MICROSOFT Church, will include a macro language which you can program to download heavenly graces automatically while you are away from your computer.</p>
<p>An estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St Peter's Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello -- in character as Father Guido Sarducci -- hosted the event, which was broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello chided Gates, ""Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats,"" the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained.</p>
<p>The deal grants MICROSOFT exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such masters as Michelangelo and Da Vinci. But critics say MICROSOFT will face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to these key intellectual properties.</p>
<p>""The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures,"" said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia. ""You take the parting of the Red Sea -- we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came on the scene.""</p>
<p>But others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a common Abrahamic heritage. ""The Catholic Church has just been more successful in marketing it to a larger audience,"" notes Notre Dame theologian Father Kenneth Madigan. Over the last 2,000 years, the Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted by Christianity, lags behind.</p>
<p>Historically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor, leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and entering into exclusive licensing arrangements in various kingdoms whereby all subjects were instilled with Catholicism, whether or not they planned to use it.</p>
<p>Today Christianity is available from several denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used. The Church's mission is to reach ""the four corners of the earth,"" echoing MICROSOFT's vision of ""a computer on every desktop and in every home"".</p>
<p>Gates described MICROSOFT's long-term strategy to develop a scalable religious architecture that will support all religions through emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of interfaces according to the religion desired -- ""One religion, a couple of different implementations,"" said Gates.</p>
<p>The MICROSOFT move could spark a wave of mergers and acquisitions, according to Herb Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Baptist Conference, as other churches scramble to strengthen their position in the increasingly competitive religious market.</p>

<p>""Oigan muchachos que tal si para mejorar nuestra suerte hacemos un pacto con el diablo.""</p>
<p>Los dem�s desesperados dicen ""�s�!"" y entonces comienza el ritual.</p>
<p>""Oh, Lucifer ven aqu�, ven aqu�, ven aqu�"", y a los 10 minutos se aparece el diablo. Los hombres asustados se abrazan y les dice el diablo ""Muy bien muchachos �qu� es lo que quieren?""</p>
<p>Dice Juan: ""Se�or Lucifer nosotros s�lo queremos pedirle un deseo?""</p>
<p>""�Y cu�l es tu deseo?""</p>
<p>""Yo solamente deseo ser rico, muy rico.""</p>
<p>Entoces le pregunta a Pedro: ""�Cu�l es tu deseo?""</p>

<p>Y Pablo contesta humildemente: ""Yo lo �nico que pido es un juego de ping pong.""</p>
<p>Entonces, habiendo escuchado los tres deseos, el diablo se da la vuelta y se va. Al mes regresa con mucho dinero y se lo entrega a Juan y Juan dice:</p>
<p>""�Soy rico, muy rico!"" y se va fel�z.</p>
<p>Al siguiente mes regresa el diablo con muchas mujeres para Pedro y entonces Pedro se va fel�z.</p>
<p>Al a�o siguiente regresa el diablo todo ensangrentado y rasgu�ado por todas partes y le dice a Pablo con voz cansada: ""Toma, aqu� est� tu deseo""</p>
<p>Y Pablo le dice:</p>
<p>""Oye, pero si yo no te ped� esto.""</p>

<p>I want to return to a time when life was simple. When all you knew were colors, multiplication tables, and nursery rhymes, but that didn't bother you, because you didn't know what you didn't know and you didn't care. All you knew was to be happy because you were blissfully unaware of all the things that should make you worried or upset. </p>
<p>I want to think the world is fair. That everyone is honest and good. </p>
<p>I want to believe that anything is possible. </p>
<p>I want to be oblivious to the complexities of life and be overly excited by the little things again. </p>
<p>I want to live simple again. I don't want my day to consist of computer crashes, mountains of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more days in the month than there is money in the bank, doctor bills, gossip, illness, and loss of loved ones. </p>
<p>I want to believe in the power of smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth, justice, peace, dreams, the imagination, mankind, and making angels in the snow. </p>

They'd have five years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. The losing side would have to lay down its arms. The Russians found the biggest meanest Doberman and Rottweiler bitches in the world and bred them with the biggest meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter, killed his siblings, and gave him all the milk. The used steroids and trainers and after five years came up with the biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were five inches thick and nobody could get near it. ""When the day came for the fight, the Americans showed up with a strange animal. It was a nine foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for the Americans because they knew there was no way that this dog could possibly last ten seconds with the Russian dog. ""When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out and wrapped itself around the outside of the ring. It had the Russian dog almost completely surrounded. When the Russian dog leaned over to bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund leaned up and consumed the Russian dog in one bite. There was nothing left at all of the Russian dog. The Russians came up to the Americans shaking their heads in disbelief. `We don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler bitches in the world and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves."" ""That's nothing"", an American replied. ""We had our best plastic surgeons working for five years trying to make an alligator look like a Dachshund.'""</p>

<p>54 times the sheets were clean<br /> 17 times it was too late<br /> 49 times you were too tired<br /> 20 times it was too hot<br /> 5 times you pretended to be asleep<br /> 22 times you had a headache<br /> 17 times you were afraid of waking the baby<br /> 16 times you said you were too sore<br /> 12 times it was the wrong time of the month<br /> 19 times you had to get up early<br /> 9 times you said weren't in the mood<br /> 7 times you were sunburned<br /> 6 times you were watching the late show<br /> 5 times you didn't want to muss your new hairdo<br /> 3 times you said the neighbors would hear us<br /> 9 times you said your mother would hear us</p>
<p>Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory<br /> because:<br /> 6 times you just laid there,<br /> 8 times you reminded me there's a crack in the ceiling,<br /> 4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with,<br /> 7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished, and one time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move.</p>
<p>TO MY DEAR HUSBAND:<br /> I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you<br /> didn't get more than you did:</p>
<p>5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat<br /> 36 times you did not come home at all<br /> 21 times you didn't cum<br /> 33 times you came too soon<br /> 19 times you went soft before you got in<br /> 38 times you worked too late<br /> 10 times you got cramps in your toes<br /> 29 times you had to get up early to play golf<br /> 2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you in the balls<br /> 4 times you got it stuck in your zipper<br /> 3 times you had a cold and your nose was running<br /> 2 times you had a splinter in your finger<br /> 20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day<br /> 6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book<br /> 98 times you were too busy watching football, baseball,etc. on TV.</p>
<p>Of the times we did get together the reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets. I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was , ""would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?""  The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe.</p>

The truck driver replied, I can take<br /> care or that. The scale master asked him how he could fix the problem. The<br /> driver said, let me go around back, and I'll fix the overweight problem. The<br /> scale master agreed to let him fix his problem. About half an hour later the<br /> truck driver got back on the scales, and the scale master said, driver, you are<br /> still 900lbs. over weight. The truck driver said, I don't understand what went<br /> wrong. I let 50lbs. out of each tire on the rig. After thinking the problem over<br /> the scale master said, well 18 tires times 50lbs. would equal 900lbs. I guess my<br /> scales must be wrong. I'm sorry driver, you may continue on down the road, and<br /> have a nice day.</p>

43923,"<p>About ten years ago, George Bush was visiting Mikhail Gorbachev at the Kremlin. When he got him alone for a moment, he said to Gorbachev,    ''Mikhail, can you help me with a problem? I have some doubts about one of the key people under me. How do you decide that someone is smart enough to work for you?''   ''Well, when I was interviewing Eduard Shevardnadze, I asked him, 'Eduard, who is the son of your father but not your brother?''' ''What did he say?'' Bush asked.    ''He said, 'that's me,' so I hired him.''    Bush patted Gorbachev on the shoulder. ''Thanks, Mikhail. That's a great idea.''    As soon as he got back to Washington, Bush called Dan Quayle over to the White House. ''Dan,'' he said, ''I've got a question for you. Who is the son of your father but not your brother?''    Quayle looked rather puzzled. ''Can I get back to you on that in 24 hours, Mr. President?''    He was very troubled by this question. He kept thinking about it and thinking about it, but couldn't get anywhere. Finally, the thought struck him, ''I'll ask Jim Baker. He's a smart guy.''    Quayle called Baker on the phone. ''Jim, I've got a question for you. Who is the son of your father, but not your brother?''    ''That would be me,'' Baker replied.    Quayle broke into a big smile. ''Thanks, Jim. You've helped me out big time.'' He went running to the West Wing and burst into the Oval Office.    ''Mr. President, I have the answer!''    ''Okay, Dan. Who is the son of your father, but not your brother?''    ''It's Jim Baker!'' said Quayle.   ''No,'' said Bush. ''It's Shevardnadze.''</p>

<p>He says ''Soon, I have some things to take care of.'' </p>
<p>So St. Peter leaves and Hillary looks at the scenery and sees millions of clocks lying around. Every once in a while, a clock or so would turn ahead 15 minutes. Hillary wondered why. Soon, St. Peter came back and Hillary asked ''St. Peter, What are all these clocks for?'' </p>
<p>St Peter replies ''Each clock represents a man. Every time a man commits adultry, the clock turns ahead 15 minutes. </p>
<p>Hillary asks ''Where's my husbands clock?'' St. Peter replies ''Oh, it's in God's office, he uses it for a fan.''</p>

43927,"<p>Grandma writes:The other day I went to the local religious book store where I saw a ""Honk if you really love Jesus"" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car and I'm really glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed.I was stopped at the light of a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must really love the Lord because pretty soon he leaned out his window and yelled, ""Jesus Christ!"" as loud as he could. Why, it was like a football game with him shouting, ""Go, Jesus Christ, Go""! Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and I saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I had recently asked my two grandsons what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed, and I stepped on the gas. It's a good thing I did, because I was the only car to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned out the window, gave them a big smile, and held up the Hawaiian Good Luck sign as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks!Love ya all,Grandma</p>

43929,"<p>The minister of a city church enjoyed a drink now and then, but his passion was for peach brandy. One of his congregants would make him a bottle each Christmas. One year, when the minister went to visit his friend, hoping for his usual Christmas present, he was not disappointed, but his friend told him that he had to thank him for the peach brandy from the pulpit the next Sunday. </p>
<p>In his haste to get the bottle, the minister hurriedly agreed and left. So the next Sunday the minister suddenly remembered that he had to make a public announcement that he was being supplied alcohol from a member of the church. That morning, his friend sat in the church with a grin on his face, waiting to see the minister's embarrassment. </p>
<p>The minister climbed into the pulpit and said, ""Before we begin, I have an announcement. I would very much like to thank my friend, Joe, for his kind gift of peaches ... and for the spirit in which they were given!""</p>

43939,"<p>A lady with a prize-winning schnauzer figured that he was going deaf. He wouldn't come when she called. When she took him out for a walk he wouldn't heel like he had been taught to do. As a matter of fact, when the dog wasn't looking and she called him, he acted like he didn't hear her at all. So she took him to the vet.</p>
<p>The vet looked the dog over and gave him a complete physical.</p>
<p>He told the lady, ""There's nothing wrong with your dog at all. Look here. He has excessive hair growing in his ears, which led you to believe that he is deaf. He can't hear you, but he isn't deaf. You can treat this with a depilatory. I haven't got any in stock, but you can get some 'Neet' or 'Nair' at your local pharmacy. This will work just as well as the doggy brand will.""</p>
<p>So the lady went to the nearest store and picked up a small bottle of Nair and looked over the instructions. There was nothing on the carton that related to her dog so she took it to the druggist and asked his advice.</p>
<p>""How do I apply this product,"" she asked. ""Do I put it on right out of the bottle or do I dilute it or what?""</p>
<p>The druggist said, ""For you legs, put it on straight. Right out of the bottle. For your underarms, I recommend that you dilute it 50-50 with water.""</p>
<p>She said, ""I don't think that you understand. It's for my schnauzer.""</p>
<p>""Oh,"" said the druggist. ""In that case, I suggest that you dilute it 3 to 1 with water. And by the way, I wouldn't ride a bicycle for a few days.""</p>

43977,"<p>Let's say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else.<br /> And then, one evening when they're driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: ""Do you realize that, as of tonight, we've been seeing each other for exactly six months?"" </p>
<p>And then there is silence in the car. </p>
<p>To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of. </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months. </p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward... I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person? </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: ...so that means it was... let's see... February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer's, which means... lemme check the odometer... Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here. </p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: He's upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed-even before I sensed it-that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected. </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600. </p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure. </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: They'll probably say it's only a 90-day warranty........scumbags. </p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: Maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy. </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it right up their... </p>
<p>""Roger,"" Elaine says aloud. </p>
<p>""What?"" says Roger, startled. </p>
<p>""Please don't torture yourself like this,"" she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. ""Maybe I should never have... Oh God, I feel so..."" (She breaks down, sobbing.) </p>
<p>""What?"" says Roger. </p>
<p>""I'm such a fool,"" Elaine sobs. ""I mean, I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse."" </p>
<p>""There's no horse?"" says Roger. </p>
<p>""You think I'm a fool, don't you?"" Elaine says. </p>
<p>""No!"" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer. </p>
<p>""It's just that... it's that I... I need some time,"" Elaine says. </p>
<p>(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.) ""Yes,"" he says. </p>
<p>(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.) ""Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?"" she says. </p>
<p>""What way?"" says Roger. </p>
<p>""That way about time,"" says Elaine. </p>
<p>""Oh,"" says Roger. ""Yes."" </p>
<p>(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.) </p>
<p>""Thank you, Roger,"" she says. </p>
<p>""Thank you,"" says Roger. </p>
<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it. </p>
<p>The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: ""Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?"" </p>
<p>And that's the difference between men and women.</p>

43979,"<p>The Week Before Christmas </p>
<p>'Twas the week before Christmas and all through the school<br /> Not a pupil was silent, no matter what rule.<br /> The children were busy with paper and paste<br /> The mess that they made with it couldn't be faced. </p>
<p>The teacher half frantic and almost in tears,<br /> Had just settled down to work with her dears,<br /> When out in the hall there arose such a clatter<br /> up sprang the kids to see what was the matter! </p>
<p>Away to the door they all flew like a flash<br /> The one who was leading went down with a crash.<br /> Then what to their wondering eyes did appear<br /> But a green Christmas tree! (To decorate I fear!) </p>
<p>When the teacher saw this, she almost grew sick.<br /> She knew in a moment it must be Old Nick!<br /> She ran to the door (all her efforts were vain)<br /> But she shouted, and stamped, and she called them by name </p>
<p>''Now Tommy! Now Sandy, Now Judy and Harry!<br /> Stop Billy! Stop Robert! Stop Donny and Sherry!<br /> Now get to your places get away from the hall<br /> Now get away! Get away! Get away all! </p>
<p>As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly<br /> The pupils, pell mell, started scurrying by.<br /> They ran to the blackboard and skipped down the aisle<br /> Their faces were shining and each had a smile. </p>
<p>First came a basket of popcorn to string<br /> -Then came the Christmas tree (menacing thing).<br /> As the tree was brought in there arose a great shout<br /> The pupils were merrily romping about. </p>
<p>The state they were in could lead to a riot<br /> The teacher was sure, if allowed, they would try it.<br /> Her nerves how they jangled! Her temples were throbbing!<br /> The rush of her breath sounded almost like sobbing! </p>
<p>The lines of her face were as fixed as a mask<br /> It was plain that she didn't feel up to her task.<br /> The look in her eye would have tamed a wild steer,<br /> But the children ignored it they did every year. </p>
<p>A tear from her eye and a shake of her head<br /> Soon led me to think that she wished she were dead.<br /> She spoke not a word but went straight to her work,<br /> Strung all the popcorn which broke with a jerk. </p>
<p>But at last it was finished and placed on the tree<br /> Then came the bell and the children were free.<br /> Their shrill little voices soon faded away<br /> And peace was restored at the end of the day.<br /> As she looked at the Christmas tree glistening and tall,<br /> She smiled as she whispered, Merry Christmas to all!</p>

43982,"<p>All of the following are said to be true stories. . .                    -- you decide! --   The controller working a busy pattern told the 727 on downwind to make a 360 (do a complete circle, usually done to provide spacing between aircraft). The pilot of the 727 complained, 'Do you know it costs us two thousand dollars to make a 360 in this airplane?'    Without missing a beat the controller replied, 'Roger, give me four thousand dollars worth.'   PSA was following United, taxiing out for departure. PSA called the tower and said 'Tower, this is United 586. We've got a little problem, so go ahead and let PSA go first.' The tower promptly cleared PSA for takeoff before United had a chance to object to the impersonation.   A DC-10 had an exceedingly long landing roll out after landing with his approach speed just a little too high... San Jose Tower: 'American 751 Heavy, turn right at the end if able. If not able, take the Guadalupe exit off of Highway 101 back to the airport.'Tower: 'Eastern 702, cleared for takeoff, contact    Departure on 124.7.' Eastern 702: 'Tower, Eastern 702 switching to    Departure... by the way, as we lifted off, we saw    some kind of dead animal on the far end of the    runway.' Tower: 'Continental 635, cleared for takeoff, contact    Departure on 124.7... did you copy the report from    Eastern?' Continental 635: 'Continental 635, cleared for    takeoff... and yes, we copied Eastern and we've    already notified our caterers.'</p>

<p>The Barman replies, ""Isn�t no women here, not far a long time�.</p>
<p>""Well what do y�all do?"" </p>
<p>""We do it with the animals."" </p>
