8000,"<p>The Encino School Board has declared Jewish English a second language. Backers of the move say the district is the first in the nation to recognize Hebonics as the language of many of America's Jews. </p>
<p>Here are some descriptions of the characteristics of the language, and samples of phrases in standard english and jewish english. Samples of pronunciation characteristics: Jewish english or ""Hebonics"" hardens consonants at the end of words. Thus, ""hand"" become ""handt."" The letter ""w"" is always pronounced as if it were a ""v."" Thus, ""walking"" becomes ""valking."" ""R"" sounds are transformed to a guttural utterance that is virtually impossible to spell in English. It's ""ghraining"" ""alghready."" </p>
<p>Samples of idiomatic characteristics- questions are always answered with questions: Question: ""How do you feel?"" Hebonics response: ""How should I feel?"" The subject is often placed at the end of a sentence after a pronoun has been used at the beginning: ""She dances beautifully, that girl."" The sarcastic repetition of words by adding ""sh"" to the front is used for emphasis."" Mountains becomes ""shmountains""; turtle becomes ""shmurtle"" Sample usage comparisons: </p>
<p>  <strong>Standard English Phrase</strong> <strong>Hebonics Phrase</strong>   ""I hope things turn out for the best""  ""you should be so lucky""   ""he walks slow""  ""like a fly in the ointment he walks""   ""sorry, I do not know the time"" ""what do I look like, a clock?""   ""you're sexy""  (unknown concept)   ""anything can happen"" ""It is never so bad, it can't get worse""   </p>
<p>There is late breaking information that the Boston School Board has declared the language spoken by Italian-Americans a second language, to be known as ""Italics.""</p>

8011,"<p>On a trip to the USA, a wealthy Arab fell in love with Susan.</p>
<p>He begged her to marry him, but she refused, saying that she had no intention of leaving America to live in a desert.</p>
<p>Immediately, the Arab bought several grand homes across the USA, from New England to California, and he took Susan on a tour of the homes, flying her from place to place in his private jet.</p>
<p>Susan was impressed, and she agreed to marry him.</p>
<p>Six weeks later, in tears, she phoned her father and asked him to take her back home.</p>
<p>""Whatever for?"" asked her father.</p>
<p>""I've married a pervert,"" she cried.</p>
<p>""What do you mean?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""I don't want to talk about it,"" she said. ""Just come and take me home.""</p>
<p>So her father drove to her New England home.</p>
<p>Arriving there, richly ornate gold gates opened electronically, and he drove along a wide, straight drive lined with oaks and maples.</p>
<p>And at the end of the mile-long drive was a building so grand that it made the White House look like a dog kennel.</p>
<p>He climbed the solid marble steps to huge doors, at least twelve feet tall, and there he met his daughter, waiting for him with her two bags packed and ready to go.</p>
<p>""Oh, father,"" she cried. ""Take me away from here at once. I cannot bear to stay a moment longer.""</p>
<p>Her father could not believe that she should want to leave such splendor.</p>
<p>""What's wrong, dear?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""The man is a pervert!"" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>He asked his daughter to explain this perversion that was upsetting her so.</p>
<p>""When I married him,"" she sobbed, ""my asshole was as tight as a penny piece, and now, it's as big as a half dollar.""</p>
<p>""Nay,"" said her father. ""surely you're not go to leave all this for the sake of forty-nine cents!"" </p>

8016,"<p>NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCETo the citizens of the United States of America,In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today.Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The right honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up ""aluminium"". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up ""vocabulary"". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"".2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard.4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.5. You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.6. You should stop playing American ""football"". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys.""Merde"" is French for ""sh*t"".8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called ""Indecisive Day"".9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us bonkers.Thank you for your co-operation.</p>

8020,"<p>Once there was a man in California. He was standing on a beach when God appeared to him. </p>
<p>God said, ""You've been a good man all your life and now I want to grant you one wish. Go ahead and wish for whatever you want.""</p>
<p>The man thought for a minute and then replied: ""You know, I've always wanted to go to Hawaii. Could you build me a highway to Hawaii so that I can drive there whenever I want?""</p>
<p>God exclaimed, ""That's impossible! The logistics....the engineering... I can't do that! Wish for something else.""</p>
<p>So the man told God, ""I've never been able to understand women. Could you give me the power to understand women?""</p>

As they kept watching they saw a older woman standing on the side of a mountain, so the brunette thinks in her head (blondes are stupid, i can trick her) so the brunette looks at the blonde and says......"".I bet you 20 dollars that woman jumps off that mountain"".  So the blonde thinks for a second and then agrees on the bet.  Sure enough about 1 minute later the woman dives off the mountian.  As the blonde was pulling her 20 dollars out of her pocket the brunette looks at her and says...i am not going to do that to you, i watched the news eirler this morning and i saw the woman jump, then the blonde replies well i wathced it earlier to but hell i didnt know the stupid woman was going to jump again!!!!</p>

8036,"<p>Four strangers travelled together in the same compartment of a<br /> European train. Two men and two women faced each other.</p>
<p>One woman was a very wealthy and sophisticated 75 year old lady<br /> who was decked out in the finest of furs and jewelry. Next to<br /> her sat a beautiful young woman, nineteen years old--who looked<br /> like something right off the cover of a fashion magazine. Across<br /> from the older lady was a man in his late-forties who was a<br /> highly decorated Sergeant Major in the Army. And next to the<br /> Sergeant Major sat a young private fresh out of boot camp.</p>
<p>As these four strangers travelled, they talked and chatted about<br /> trivial things until they entered an unlighted tunnel, and there<br /> they sat in complete darkness and total silence, until the sound<br /> of a distinct kiss broke the silence; following the kiss a loud<br /> slap could be heard throughout the cabin.</p>
<p>In the ensuing period of silence the four strangers sat quietly<br /> with their own thoughts. </p>
<p>The older lady was thinking, ""Isn't it wonderful that even in<br /> this permissive day and age there are still young women who have<br /> a little self-respect and dignity?""</p>
<p>The young woman, shaking her head and greatly puzzled, asked<br /> herself, ""Why in the world would any man in his right mind want<br /> to kiss an old fossil like that when I'm sitting here?""</p>
<p>The Sergeant Major, rubbing his sore face, was outraged that any<br /> woman could ever think that a man in his position would try to<br /> sneak a kiss in the dark.</p>
<p>And the private, grinning from ear to ear, was thinking, ""What a<br /> crazy and mixed up world this is when a private can kiss the<br /> back of his hand and then smack a Sergeant Major in the face and<br /> get away with it!""</p>

8062,"<p>Harry starts his new job at the zoo and he is given three tasks, the first is to clear the exotic fish pool of weeds. Harry starts on this when suddenly a bloody great fish leaps out and bites him. Harry is not going to let a fish have a go so he beats the offending fish to death. Upon doing so he realises that his boss is not going to be best pleased, so Harry tries to think of a way to hide the dead fish. He hits on the brilliant idea of giving the fish to the lions as lions will eat anything, so Harry feeds the fish to the lions. </p>
<p>Harry then moves on to his second job, which is to clearout the monkey house. Harry gets stuck in and a couple of chimps start throwing shit at him. Harry is not amused and bashes the chimps with his spade, killing them instantly. Harry is shitting himself, so what does he do? he feeds the chimps to the lions, because lions eat anything. </p>
<p>Anyway, Harry moves on to his last job, which is to collect honey from some South American bees. Harry starts on this and gets attacked by the bees, as you can guess Harry mashes the swarm of bees. By this point he is not too worried about the death of bees as he knows what to do, you guessed it, feed them to the lions, because lions eat anything. </p>
<p>Later that day a new lion arrives at the zoo, it wanders up to another lion and asks 'what's the food like here?' the other lion responds, ""Absolutely brilliant, today I had fish and chimps with mushy bees!""</p>

8064,"<p>One day a boy named Agaf was incredibly horny. He loved the<br /> queen. Just one suck of those huge firm tits would make him<br /> happy for life. He went to the village elder (wise man) to find<br /> out how to cure his quarms.</p>
<p>""I need to suck the queens breasts,"" Agaf said. ""How much are<br /> you paying?"" the elder asked. ""Nothing is free!"" ""A million<br /> pounds,"" Agaf lied. He was going to get the suck and then not<br /> pay becase once he had the suck nothing else mattered. ""OK.""</p>
<p>So the elder sneaked into the castle and poured some itching<br /> powder into the queens bra. The itch would last two whole days.<br /> When the queen put on her bra a horrible itch ran around her<br /> breasts. She was screaming all through the night. The pain was<br /> obsurd.</p>
<p>In the morning the king had had enough of the screaming so the<br /> king asked the elder for help, as you do! Everything was going<br /> to plan so far!</p>
<p>""Elder,"" the king said. ""My wife is in immense pain because she<br /> has got a pain in her breasts."" ""I know what to do!"" the elder<br /> said. ""Go to the hut of Agaf. He is the only one wth the magical<br /> saliva to cure the itch. You will have to let him suck your wifs<br /> breasts for ten minutes and tommorow it will have gone."" The<br /> king wasn't happy about this but he agreed.</p>
<p>So Agaf was called up and he sucked them for ten minutes flat,<br /> and the itch stopped that night because it only lasted for two<br /> days anyway.</p>
<p>So then the elder called in Agaf and said, ""You got your wish.<br /> Now pay me!"" ""No chance wanker!"" Agaf said and walked out.</p>
<p>So the elder thought long and hard for a punishment, something<br /> that would be bad for Agaf. He thought and thought, until he got<br /> it... He would put itching powder in the kings underpants!</p>

Out popped a tired old genie who said, ""O.K., so you freed me from the stupid lamp, but hey, I've been doing this 3-wishes stuff for a while now and quite frankly, I'm burned out.""

8099,"<p>Three guys died and when they get to the pearly gates, St. Peter meets them there.</p>
<p>St. Peter said, ""I know that you guys are forgiven because you're here. Before I let you into Heaven, I have to ask you a couple of questions. Make sure you tell the truth because if you don't you will forfeit your privilege of being here and we'll have to ask you to visit our friend below. Your answers will also determine what kind of car you get. You have to have a car here in Heaven because it is so big!""</p>
<p>The first guy walks up and Peter asks him, ""How long were you married?""</p>
<p>The guy replies, ""24 years.""</p>
<p>St. Peter then asks, ""Did you ever cheat on your wife?""</p>
<p>The guy says, ""Yes, about 10 times...but you said I was forgiven.""</p>
<p>Peter said, ""yeah, but that's not too good. Here's a Pinto for you to drive.""</p>
<p>The second guy walks up and gets the same questions from Peter to which he replies, ""I was married for 41 years and cheated on her only once, but that was during our first year and we worked it out and I was faithful there after.""</p>
<p>Peter said, ""I'm pleased to hear that, here's a Lincoln Town Car for you to drive.""</p>
<p>The third guy walked up and said, ""Peter, I know what you're going to ask. I was married for 63 years and didn't even look at another woman! I treated my wife like a queen!""</p>
<p>Peter said, ""That's what I like to hear. Here's a Jaguar for you to drive"" </p>
<p>A little while later, the two guys with the Lincoln and the Pinto saw the guy with the Jaguar crying on the golden sidewalk so they went to see what was the matter. When they asked him what was wrong he tearily said, ""I just saw my wife and she was on a skateboard!""</p>

8147,"<p>In rural Carbon County, PA, a group of men were drinking beer and discharging firearms from the rear deck of a home owned Irving Michaels, age 27. The men were firing at a raccoon that was wandering by, but the beer apparently impaired their aim and, despite of the estimated 35 shots the group fired, the animal escaped into a 3 foot diameter drainage pipe some 100 feet away from Mr. Michaels deck.</p>
<p>Determined to terminate the animal, Mr. Michaels retrieved a can of gasoline and poured some down the pipe, intending to smoke the animal out. After several unsuccessful attempts to ignite the fuel, Michaels emptied the entire 5 gallon fuel can down the pipe and tried to ignite it again, to no avail. </p>
<p>Not one to admit defeat by wildlife, the determined Mr. Michaels proceeded to slide feet-first approximately 15 feet down the sloping pipe to toss the match. The subsequent rapidly expanding fireball propelled Mr. Michaels back the way he had come, though at a much higher rate of speed. </p>
<p>He exited the angled pipe ""like a Polaris missile leaves a submarine,"" according to witness Joseph McFadden, 31. Mr. Michaels was launched directly over his own home, right over the heads of his astonished friends, onto his front lawn. </p>
<p>In all, he traveled over 200 feet through the air. ""There was a Doppler Effect to his scream as he flew over us,"" McFadden reported, ""Followed by a loud thud.""</p>
<p>Amazingly, he suffered only minor injuries. </p>
<p>""It was actually pretty cool,"" Michaels said, ""Like when they shoot someone out of a cannon at the circus. I'd do it again if I was sure I wouldn't get hurt.""</p>

8164,"<p>Dear Abby: I am a crack dealer in New Jersey ..<br /> ... who has recently been diagnosed as a carrier of the HIV virus. My parents<br /> live in a suburb of Philadelphia, is married to a transvestite. My father and<br /> mother have recently been arrested for growing and selling marijuana and are<br /> currently dependent on my other two sisters, who are prostitutes in.<br /> I have two brothers. One is currently serving a non-parole life sentence in<br /> WellingtonBronx and is still a part time ""working girl"" in a brothel.<br /> Her time there is limited as we hope to open our own brothel with her as the<br /> working manager. I am hoping my two sisters would be interested in joining our<br /> team. Although I would prefer them not to prostitute themselves, it would get<br /> them off the street, and hopefully, the heroin habits.<br /> All thing considered, my main problem is this: I love my fianc�e and look<br /> forward to bringing her into the family and I certainly want to be totally<br /> honest with her.<br /> Should I tell her about my distant cousin who is French?<br /> Signed, Worried About My Reputation.</p>

It is unusual to be contemporary.  Most composers do not live until they are dead.An opera is a song of bigly size.In the last scene of Pagliacci, Canio stabs Nedda who is the one he really loves.  Pretty soon Silvio also gets stabbed, and they all live happily ever after.When a singer sings, he stirs up the air and makes it hit any passing eardrums.

Refrain: For the drifting causes rifting, Opens basins mighty fine Which strike-slip will close in time. With volcanics there's no problem; they're erupting all the time; Fill the thin with pillow lavas, sheeted dikes and serpentine. Rising slowly from the ocean filled with gritties coarse and fine, Are you fore-arc? Are you anti-arc? Are you just a geosyncline?</p>

8201,"<p>The 2000 Darwin awards!(August 1999, Australia) Drinking oneself to death need not be a long lingering process. Allan, a 33-year-old computer technician, showed his competitive spirit by dying of competitive spirits. A Sydney, Australia hotel bar held a drinking competition, known as Feral Friday, with a 100-minute time limit and a sliding point scale ranging from 1 point for beer to 8 points for hard liquor. Allan stood and cheered his winning total of 236, (winners never quit!) which had also netted him the literally staggering blood alcohol level of 0.353, 7 times greater than Australia's legal driving limit of 0.05%. After several trips to the usual temple of overindulgence, the bathroom, Allan was helped back to his workplace to sleep it off, a condition that became permanent. A forensic pharmacologist estimated that after downing 34 beers, 4 bourbons, and 17 shots of tequila within 1 hour and 40 minutes, his blood alcohol level would have been 0.41 to 0.43, but Allan had vomited several times after the drinking stopped. The ost paid by Allan was much higher than that of the hotel, which was fined the equivalent of $13,100 US dollars for not intervening. It is not known whether Allan required any further embalming.</p>

8234,"<p>HAMMER: Originally employed as a weapon of war, the hammer nowadays is used as a kind of divining rod to locate expensive parts not far from the object we are trying to hit. </p>
<p>MECHANIC'S KNIFE: Used to open and slice through the contents of cardboard cartons delivered to your front door; works particularly well on boxes containing seats and motorcycle jackets. </p>
<p>ELECTRIC HAND DRILL: Normally used for spinning steel Pop rivets in their holes until you die of old age, but it also works great for drilling mounting holes in fenders just above the brake line that goes to the rear wheel. </p>
<p>PLIERS: Used to round off bolt heads. </p>
<p>HACKSAW: One of a family of cutting tools built on the Ouija board principle. It transforms human energy into a crooked, unpredictable motion, and the more you attempt to influence its course, the more dismal your future becomes. </p>
<p>VISE-GRIPS: Used to round off bolt heads. If nothing else is available, they can also be used to transfer intense welding heat to the palm of your hand. </p>
<p>OXYACETELENE TORCH: Used almost entirely for lighting various flammable objects in your garage on fire. Also handy for igniting the grease inside a brakedrum you're trying to get the bearing race out of. </p>
<p>WHITWORTH SOCKETS: Once used for working on older British cars and motorcycles, they are now used mainly for impersonating that 9/16 or 1/2 socket you've been searching for the last 15 minutes. </p>
<p>DRILL PRESS: A tall upright machine useful for suddenly snatching flat metal bar stock out of your hands so that it smacks you in the chest and flings your beer across the room, splattering it against that freshly painted part you were drying. </p>
<p>WIRE WHEEL: Cleans rust off old bolts and then throws them somewhere under the workbench with the speed of light. Also removes fingerprint whorls and hard-earned guitar callouses in about the time it takes you to say, ""Ouc...."" </p>
<p>HYDRAULIC FLOOR JACK: Used for lowering a motorcycle to the ground after you have installed your new front disk brake setup, trapping the jack handle firmly under the front fender. </p>
<p>EIGHT-FOOT LONG DOUGLAS FIR 2X4: Used for levering a motorcycle upward off a hydraulic jack. </p>
<p>TWEEZRS: A tool for removing wood splinters.<br /> PHONE: Tool for calling your neighbor to see if he has another hydraulic floor jack.<br /> SNAP-ON GASKET SCRAPER: Theoretically useful as a sandwich tool for spreading mayonnaise; used mainly for getting dog-doo off your boot. </p>

<p>TIMING LIGHT: A stroboscopic instrument for illuminating grease buildup. </p>

<p>AVIATION METAL SNIPS: See hacksaw. </p>
<p>TROUBLE LIGHT: The mechanic's own tanning booth. Sometimes called a drop light, it is a good source of vitamin D, ""the sunshine vitamin,"" which is not otherwise found under motorcycles at night. Health benefits aside, its main purpose is to consume 40-watt light bulbs at about the same rate that 105-mm howitzer shells might be used during, say, the first few hours of the Battle of the Bulge. More often dark than light, its name is somewhat misleading. </p>
<p>PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER: Normally used to stab the lids of old-style paper-and-tin oil cans and splash oil on your shirt; can also be used, as the name implies, to round off Phillips screw heads. </p>
<p>AIR COMPRESSOR: A machine that takes energy produced in a coal-burning power plant 200 miles away and transforms it into compressed air that travels by hose to a Chicago Pneumatic impact wrench that grips rusty bolts last tightened 60 years ago by someone in Springfield, and rounds them off. </p>
<p>PRY BAR: A tool used to crumple the metal surrounding that clip or bracket you needed to remove in order to replace a 50 cent part. </p>
<p>HOSE CUTTER: A tool used to cut hoses 1/2 inch too short.</p>

<p>The father walked into his boys room and said ""So, I herd you<br /> got in trouble at school today. What happened?"" The boy said, ""I<br /> was in class and I asked the teacher a question and she sent me<br /> to the principle's office. I asked him and he suspended me for<br /> two weeks. I asked mom, and she sent me up here."" ""So, what's<br /> the question?"" The father asked. ""What's so bad about Russia?""<br /> The boy said. The father picked him up and threw him out the<br /> window.</p>
<p>A cop saw all this and asked the boy what happened. The boy<br /> said, ""I was in class and I asked the teacher a question and she<br /> sent me to the principle's office. I asked him and he suspended<br /> me for two weeks. I asked mom, and she sent me up to my room. I<br /> asked dad and he threw me out the window."" ""So, what's the<br /> question?"" The cop asked. ""What's so bad about russia?"" The boy<br /> said. ""That's it young man, your going to reformed school.""</p>
<p>The first day at school, his new teacher asked him why he was<br /> there. The boy said, ""At my old school, I was in class and I<br /> asked the teacher a question and she sent me to the principle's<br /> office. I asked him and he suspended me for two weeks. I asked<br /> mom, and she sent me up to my room. I asked dad and he threw me<br /> out the window. Then I saw a cop and asked him, and he sent me<br /> here."" ""So, what's the question?"" The teacher asked. ""What's so<br /> bad about Russia?"" The boy said. ""That's it young man, go to the<br /> principle's office."" Said the rather flustered teacher.</p>
<p>He walked into the principle's office, and the principle said,<br /> ""In trouble already? What happened?"" The boy said ""At my old<br /> school, I was in class and I asked the teacher a question and<br /> she sent me to the principle's office. I asked him and he<br /> suspended me for two weeks. I asked mom, and she sent me up to<br /> my room. I asked dad and he thew me out the window. Then I saw a<br /> cop and asked him, and he sent me here. Then I asked my teacher<br /> and she sent me to your office."" ""So, what's the question?"" The<br /> principle asked. ""What's so bad about Russia?"" The boy asked.<br /> ""That's it, I'm sending you to Russia.""</p>
<p>So the boy is in Russia for the very first day, and he walks out<br /> of the airport. Right after walking out, he gets hit by a bus.</p>

8257,"<p>I took some clients out to dinner last week, and I noticed a spoon in the<br /> shirt pocket of our waiter as he handed us the menus. It seemed a little odd,<br /> but I dismissed it as a random thing. Until our busboy came with water and<br /> tableware; he too, sported a spoon in his breast pocket. I looked around the<br /> room, and all the waiters and busboys had spoons in their pockets. When our<br /> waiter returned to take our order, I just had to ask, ""Why the spoons?"" </p>
<p>""Well,"" he explained, ""our parent company recently hired some Andersen<br /> Consulting efficiency experts to review all our procedures, and after months of<br /> statistical analyses, they concluded that our patrons drop spoons on the floor<br /> 73% more often than any other utensil, at a frequency of 3 spoons per hour per<br /> workstation. By preparing our workers for this contingency in advance, we can<br /> cut our trips to the kitchen down and save time... nearly 1.5 extra man-hours<br /> per shift."" Just as he concluded, a ""ch-ching"" came from the table behind him,<br /> and he quickly replaced the fallen spoon with the one from his pocket.""I'll grab<br /> another spoon the next time I'm in the kitchen instead of making a special<br /> trip,"" he proudly explained. </p>
<p>I was impressed. ""Thanks, I had to ask."" </p>
<p>""No problem,"" he answered. Then he continued to take our orders. As the<br /> members of our dinner party took their turns, my eyes darted back and forth from<br /> each person ordering and my menu. That's when, out of the corner of my eye, I<br /> spotted a thin black thread protruding from our waiter's fly. Again, I dismissed<br /> it; yet I had to scan the room and, sure enough, there were other waiters and<br /> busboys with strings hanging out of their trousers. My curiosity overrode<br /> discretion at this point, so before he could leave I had to ask. ""Excuse me,<br /> but...uh...why, or what about that string?"" </p>
<p>""Oh, yeah,"" he began, in a quieter tone, ""not many people are that observant.<br /> That same efficiency group found we could save time in the Men's Room, too."" </p>
<p>""How's that?"" I asked. </p>
<p>""You see, by tying a string to the end of our, uh, selves, we can pull it out<br /> at the urinals literally hands-free and thereby eliminate the need to wash our<br /> hands, cutting time spent in the washroom by over 93%!"" </p>
<p>""Hey, wait a minute. If the string helps you pull it out, how do you get it<br /> back in?"" </p>
<p>""Well,"" he whispered, ""I don't know about the other guys, but I use the<br /> spoon.""</p>

8288,"<p>This is not only philosophical but is obviously pure science.</p>
<p>A herd of buffalo can move only as fast as the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first.</p>
<p>This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular culling of the weakest members.  </p>
<p>In much the same way the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.</p>
<p>In this way regular consumption of beer eliminates the<br /> weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. So that's why you always feel smarter after a few beers.</p>

<p>""Sir, why don't you take the day off today"", he said, ""I've<br /> heard your lecture so many times by now I know it by heart. I<br /> can give the lecture and you can just sit back and relax.""</p>
<p>The scientist thought this was a great idea, since he was sick<br /> and tired of giving the exact same lecture over and over again.<br /> When they arrived at the seminar the scientist put on the<br /> chauffeur's hat and seated himself in the back of the lecture<br /> hall. His trusted chauffeur walked to the podium and gave an<br /> excellent lecture showing at least as much confidence as the<br /> scientist would. At the end of the lecture the chauffeur asked,<br /> just as his master always does, ""Are there any questions?""</p>
<p>One of the professors in the hall stood up and asked a long<br /> question about a very complicated and highly theoretical matter.<br /> The chauffeur was panicking silently but finally managed to pull<br /> himself together.</p>
<p>""That, professor, is a very simple question,"" he answered, ""in<br /> fact, it is so simple even my chauffeur can answer it.""</p>

8298,"<p>The madam opened the brothel door to see an elderly Jewish man. His<br /> clothes were all disheveled and he looked needy. ""Can I help you?"" the<br /> madam asked. ""I want Natalie,"" the old man replied. ""Sir, Natalie is one<br /> of our most expensive ladies, perhaps someone else..."" ""No, I must see<br /> Natalie.""</p>
<p>Just then Natalie appeared and announced to the old man that she charges<br /> $1,000 per visit. The man never blinked and reached into his pocket and<br /> handed her ten $100 bills. The two went up to a room for an hour whereupon<br /> the man calmly left.</p>
<p>The next night he appeared again demanding Natalie. Natalie explained that<br /> no one had ever come back two nights in a row and that there were no<br /> discounts... it was still $1,000. Again the old man took out the money,<br /> the two went up to the room and he calmly left an hour later.</p>
<p>When he showed up the third consecutive night, no one could believe it.<br /> Again he handed Natalie the money and up to the room they went. At the end<br /> of the hour Natalie questioned the old man: ""No one has ever used my<br /> services three nights in a row... where are you from?"" The old man<br /> replied, ""I am from Minsk."" ""Really?"" replied Natalie, ""I have a sister<br /> who lives there."" ""Yes, I know,"" said the old man. ""She gave me $3,000 to<br /> give to you.""</p>
"
8299,"<p>Now that it seems almost a certainty that George W. Bush will become the<br /> Republican nominee for President, attention will soon focus upon whom Governor<br /> Bush will pick for his Vice Presidential running mate. It is rumored that one of<br /> the names on the 'short list' currently being floated in upper level Republican<br /> circles is former Vice President, Dan Quayle. </p>
<p>For many, there seems to be some very sound reasoning for picking Quayle. As<br /> was pointed out by one senior official who wished not be identified, Quayle<br /> ""already knows how to do the job, will contribute gaffes that will deflect<br /> attention away from Bush's own, and in a cost saving side benefit will help the<br /> party minimize printing costs for new 'Bush-Quayle' posters and bumper stickers<br /> (since they can use the leftovers from the 1988 and 1992 campaigns). </p>
<p>Apparently, part of the overall strategy is the targeting of a key demographic<br /> group that has been virtually ignored in previous presidential campaigns: Senile<br /> and confused voters. One recent survey puts the 'senile and confused' at<br /> approximately 3.8% of the voting population. The hope is that this group will<br /> mistakenly believe that this is the same Bush-Quayle ticket they voted for in<br /> 1988 and 1992 and will once again cast their votes for another, albeit<br /> different, Bush-Quayle ticket. The dilemma facing Republican strategists however<br /> is determining how best to mount an effective campaign that will get out the<br /> 'senile and confused' vote. One strategist sighed, ""They're a hard group to<br /> reach, let alone give instructions to."" </p>
<p>Additionally, word has it that the former Vice President is undertaking some<br /> unique preparations for another run at the Vice Presidency. Included in his<br /> training regimen is a comprehensive reading of Webster�s Dictionary cover to<br /> cover as well as listening to the popular vocabulary-building program on<br /> cassette tapes, ""Verbal Advantage."" </p>
<p>For many, the inclusion of former Vice President Quayle on the ticket will<br /> spell 'opportunities'. When one reporter asked Quayle ""what do you think about<br /> running on a ticket with a Bush again,"" the former Vice President expressed that<br /> he was ""clearly delighted"" about it. However, Quayle did seem somewhat puzzled<br /> and perplexed as to why Bush has now added a ""W"" to his name when he didn't seem<br /> to use one before.</p>

8332,"<p>Most diets fail because we are still thinking and eating like people. For those us who have never had any success dieting. Well now there is the new Miracle Cat Diet! This diet will also work on humans! Except for cats that eat like people -- such as getting lots of table scraps -- most cats are long and lean (or tiny and petite). the Cat Miracle Diet will help you achieve the same lean, svelte figure. Just follow this diet for one week and you'll find that you not only look and feel better, but you will have a whole new outlook on what constitutes food. Good Luck! </p>
<p>DAY ONE </p>
<p>Breakfast: Open can of expensive gourmet cat food. Any flavor as long as it cost more the .75 per can -- and place 1/4 cup on your plate. Eat 1 bite of food; look around room disdainfully. Knock the rest on the floor. Stare at the wall for awhile before stalking off into the other room. </p>
<p>Lunch: Four blades of grass and one lizard tail. Throw it back up on the cleanest carpet in your house. </p>
<p>Dinner: Catch a moth and play with it until it is almost dead. Eat one wing. Leave the rest to die.</p>
<p>Bedtime snack: Steal one green bean from your spouse's or partner's plate. Bat it around the floor until it goes under the refrigerator. Steal one small piece of chicken and eat half of it. Leave the other half on the sofa. Throw out the remaining gourmet cat food from the can you opened this morning. </p>
<p>DAY TWO </p>
<p>Breakfast: Picking up the remaining chicken bite from the sofa. Knock it onto the carpet and bat it under the television set. Chew on the corner of the newspaper as your spouse/partner tries to read it. </p>
<p>Lunch: Break into the fresh French bread that you bought as your part of the dinner party on Saturday. Lick the top of it all over. Take one bite out of the middle of the loaf. </p>
<p>Afternoon snack: Catch a large beetle and bring it into the house. Play toss and catch with it until it is mushy and half dead. Allow it to escape under the bed. </p>
<p>Dinner: Open a fresh can of dark-colored gourmet cat food -- tuna or beef works well. Eat it voraciously. Walk from your kitchen to the edge of the living room rug. Promptly throw up on the rug. Step into it as you leave. Track footprints across the entire room. </p>
<p>DAY THREE </p>
<p>Breakfast: Drink part of the milk from your spouse's or partner's cereal bowl when no one is looking. Splatter part of it on the closest polished aluminum appliance you can find. </p>
<p>Lunch: Catch a small bird and bring it into the house. Play with on top of your down filled comforter. Make sure the bird is seriously injured but not dead before you abandon it for someone else to have to deal with. </p>
<p>Dinner: Beg and cry until you are given some ice cream or milk in a bowl of your own. Take three licks/laps and then turn the bowl over on the floor. </p>
<p>FINAL DAY </p>
<p>Breakfast: Eat 6 bugs, any type, being sure to leave a collection of legs, wings, antennae on the bathroom floor. Drink lots of water. Throw the bugs and all of the water up on your spouse's or partner's pillow. </p>
<p>Lunch: Remove the chicken skin from last night's chicken-to-go leftovers your spouse or partner placed in the trash can. Drag the skin across the floor several times. Chew it in a corner and then abandon.</p>
<p>Dinner: Open another can of expensive gourmet cat food. Select a flavor that is especially runny, like Chicken and Giblets in Gravy. Lick off all the gravy and leave the actual meat to dry and get hard.</p>

8417,"<p>A fellow decides to take off early from work and go drinking. </p>
<p>He stays until the bar closes at 2am, at which time he is extremely drunk. When he enters his house, he doesn't want to wake anyone, so he takes off his shoes and starts tip-toeing up the stairs. Half-way up the stairs, he falls over backwards and lands flat on his rear end.</p>
<p>That wouldn't have been so bad, except that he had couple of empty pint bottles in his back pockets, and they broke, and the broken glass carved up his buttocks terribly. </p>
<p>But,he was so drunk that he didn't know he was hurt. A few minutes later, as he was undressing, he noticed blood,so he checked himself out in the mirror, and, sure enough, his behind was cut up something terrible. </p>
<p>Well, he repaired the damage as best he could under the circumstances, and he went to bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, his head was hurting, and his rear was hurting, and he was hunkering under the covers trying to think up some good story, when his wife came into the bedroom.</p>
<p>""Well, you really tied one on last night,"" she said. ""Where'd you go?"" ""I worked late,"" he said, ""and I stopped off for a couple of beers.""</p>
<p>""A couple of beers? That's a laugh,"" she replied, ""You got plastered last night. Where the heck did you go?""</p>
<p>""What makes you so sure I got drunk last night, anyway?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" she replied, ""my first big clue was when I got up this morning and found a bunch of band-aids stuck to the mirror.""</p>

<p>The patron takes one sip and spits it out.</p>
<p>He promptly hollers at the bartender: ""I said 12-year old scotch, you bozo!"" </p>
<p>Still unimpressed the bartender pours some 6-year old scotch.</p>
<p>The patron takes a sip...same reaction. But the bartender still doesn't<br /> believe the patron knows the difference. So he pours a shot of 10-year old<br /> scotch. Again, same reaction from the patron.</p>
<p>Finally, the bartender is convinced. He pours the patron a glass of<br /> 12-year-old scotch. The patron takes a sip and is most satisfied.</p>
<p>All the while this has been going on, a drunk at the end of the bar has been<br /> watching. He slides a shot glass down the bar to the patron and drunkenly says:<br /> ""Shay mister, taste this!"" The patron obliges...he promptly spits it out.</p>
<p>""It tastes like piss,"" he shoots back at the drunk. The drunken replies: ""It<br /> is. How old am I?""</p>

8424,"<p>There was a farmer who grew watermelons. He was doing pretty well, but he was<br /> disturbed by some local kids who would sneak into his watermelon patch at night<br /> and eat his watermelons. After some careful thought, he came up with a clever<br /> idea that he thought would scare the kids away for sure. </p>
<p>He made up a sign and posted it in the field. The next day, the kids show up<br /> and they saw the sign which read, ""Warning! One of the watermelons in this field<br /> has been injected with cyanide."" </p>
<p>The kids ran off, made up their own sign and posted it next to the farmer's<br /> sign. When the farmer returned, he surveyed the field. He noticed that no<br /> watermelons are missing, but the sign next to his read, ""Now there are two!""</p>

8425,"<p>A man is having terrible headaches. He can't sleep, eat, think,<br /> or do much of anything because of the pain. Several doctors<br /> examined him and couldn't determine the cause of his problem. He<br /> finally went to one of the top neurological specialists in the<br /> country who examines him and says, ""I've found the cause of the<br /> pain. Your testicles are pushing up into your spine. The<br /> constant pressureon the spine causes the headaches. The only<br /> thing I can do is perform surgery and remove your testicles.""</p>
<p>The man is shocked to hear this but the decision is not<br /> difficult as he know he cannot stand the pain of the headaches.<br /> He has the surgery and immediately fells like a new man. The<br /> pain is completely gone and he feels like he has a new life. He<br /> is so happy he decides to buy himself a new suit. He goes to a<br /> small men's shop and tells the old tailor that he wants to buy a<br /> suit.</p>
<p>""Sure,"" says the tailor. ""You're a 42 long, right?""</p>
<p>""Wow, how did you know?"" says the man.</p>
<p>""Hey, I've been in this business a long time. You learn a few<br /> things"" said the tailor.""</p>
<p>The tailor brought the man a suit that fit perfectly. It looked<br /> so good that the man decided to buy a new shirt to go with it.</p>
<p>""16, 34, right?"" said the tailor. </p>
<p>""Right again!"" said the man. ""You're amazing.""</p>
<p>""Hey, I've been in this business a long time. You learn a few<br /> things"".</p>
<p>The tailor brought a shirt and tie and they looked great. The<br /> man said, ""Hey, let's go for broke. Give me a pair of the silk<br /> boxers too."" </p>
<p>The tailor said, ""36 right?""</p>
<p>""I'm disappointed,"" said the man. ""But 2 out of 3 is still good.<br /> I wear size 34 boxers.""</p>
<p>The tailor said, ""Hey, I've been in this business for a long<br /> time and I think you need 36.""</p>
<p>The man replied, ""It's obvious you know your business but I've<br /> worn size 34 for as long as I can remember. I'm going to have to<br /> disagree with you on this one"".</p>
<p>""Hey look,"" said the tailor, ""I'll sell you whatever you want.<br /> But I've been in this business a long time. If you wear a size<br /> 34 it's gonna push your nuts up into your spine and give you<br /> terrible headaches.""</p>

8427,"<p>One day, Harry came upon a big, long ladder that stretched into<br /> the clouds. He'd walked this way every day and this ladder was<br /> never there before. Curious and brave, he began to climb.<br /> Eventually, he climbed into the layer of clouds, and saw this<br /> rather large, homely woman lying here on a cloud. </p>
<p>She spoke, ""Take me now or climb the ladder to success!""</p>
<p>Harry figured success had to be better than this, so he<br /> continued climbing. He came upon another level of clouds, and<br /> found a thinner, cuter woman than before. </p>
<p>She also spoke, ""Take me now or climb the ladder to success!""</p>
<p>Harry saw that his luck was changing and so continued his climb.<br /> On another level of clouds, he found a rather attractive woman<br /> with not so bad of a figure. </p>
<p>She stated, ""Take me now or climb the ladder to success!""</p>
<p>Harry really liked his advantage now! He climbed quickly and<br /> deftly, and sure enough, on the next level, he found a gorgeous,<br /> lithe, well-endowed woman lying seductively on the cloud. </p>
<p>""Take me now or climb the ladder to success,"" she huskily<br /> whispered.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't believe his eyes, but his greed got the best of<br /> him. He climbed to the next level, expecting Aphrodite or<br /> similar. Suddenly, the ladder ends, and a latch closes behind<br /> him. He looks over to see a 400-pound, 6'8"" hairy biker-looking<br /> guy with tattoos. The biker gets up and walks menacingly toward<br /> Harry. </p>
<p>Apprehensively, Harry whispers, ""Who are you?""</p>
<p>The biker answers, ""I'm Cess.""</p>

8487,"<p>Two blondes were playing golf at a foggy par three, and could see the flag, but not the green. Each hit their ball anyway. When they walked to the green, they discovered one about three feet from the cup, while the other somehow had gone directly in. They tried to figure out which ball belonged to who, since they were both using Titleist number threes. Unable to decide, they returned to the Club House and asked the golf pro for a ruling. </p>
<p>After hearing their story and congratulating them both on their superb shots under such adverse conditions he asked, ""OK, so who was playing the yellow ball ?""</p>

8496,"<p>Two Rednecks went bear hunting. While one stayed in the cabin, the other went out looking for a bear. He soon found a huge bear, shot at it but only wounded it. The enraged bear charged toward him, he dropped his rifle and started running for the cabin as fast as he could. He ran pretty fast but the bear was just a little faster and gained on him with every step. Just as he reached the open cabin door, he tripped and fell flat. Too close behind to stop, the bear tripped over him and went rolling into the cabin. The man jumped up, closed the cabin door and yelled to his friend inside, ""You skin this one while I go and get another!""</p>

One to campaign on TV and at rallies on how George Bush has had a strong light bulb-changing policy all along.<br /> 10.

I could hear Bessie moaning and groaning, and I knew that she was<br /> in a bad way, but I was hurting' real bad and I couldn't even move.

8519,"<p>A woman could never get her husband to do anything around the house. He would come home from work, sit in front of the TV, eat dinner, and sit some more -- would never do those little household repairs that most husbands take care of. This frustrated the woman quite a bit. One day the toilet stopped up. When her husband got home, she said sweetly, 'Honey, the toilet is clogged. Would you look at it?' Her husband snarled, 'What do I look like? The tidy-bowl man?' and sat down on the sofa. </p>
<p>The next day, the garbage disposal wouldn't work. When her husband got home, she said, very nicely, 'Honey, the disposal won't work. Would you try to fix it for me?' Once again, he growled, 'What do I look like? Mr. Plumber?' </p>
<p>The next day, the washing machine was on the blink. When her husband got home, she steeled her courage and said, 'Honey, the washer isn't running. Would you check on it?' And again was met with a snarl, 'What do I look like? The Maytag repairman?' </p>
<p>Finally, she had had enough. The next morning, the woman called three repairmen to fix the toilet, the garbage disposal, and the washer. When her husband got home, she said, 'Honey, I had the repairmen out today.' He frowned, 'Well, how much is that going to cost?' 'Well, honey, they all said I could pay them by baking them a cake or having sex with them.' </p>
<p>'Well, what kind of cakes did you bake them?' he asked. She smiled. 'What do I look like? Betty Crocker?'</p>

8536,"<p>Interviewer: Why is a thicker conductor necessary to carry a current in A.C. as compared to D.C. ? </p>
<p>Student: An AC current goes up and down (drawing a sinusoid) and requires more space inside the wire, so the wire has to be thicker. </p>

The blondes agreed and<br /> climbed in. The man started driving, but suddenly a little kid<br /> ran in front of the truck, and the driver swerved, and the truck<br /> plunged into a lake. The driver and his two friends struggled to<br /> open the doors of the truck to get out before they drowned, and<br /> when they reached the lake shore, they looked around for the two<br /> blondes, but they were nowhere to be found. The driver saw his<br /> dog had gotten out just fine, and wondered if the blondes had<br /> gotten stuck under the water. Just as the man was about to jump<br /> in the water to rescue them, the blondes both surfaced and swam<br /> to the shore. Looking confused, the driver asked them what had<br /> taken them so long. The blondes answered: ""Well duh! We couldn't<br /> get out--the tailgate was stuck!!""</p>

8554,"<p>A lawyer got married to a woman who had previously been married 12 times. On their wedding night, they settled into the bridal suite at their hotel and the bride said to her new groom, ""Please, promise to be gentle. I am still  a virgin.""</p>
<p>This puzzled the groom, since after 12 marriages, he thought that at least one of her husbands would have been able to perform. He asked his new bride to explain the phenomenon.</p>
<p>She responded:</p>
<p>My first husband was a Sales Representative who spent our entire marriage telling me, in grandiose terms, 'It's gonna be great!'</p>
<p>My second husband was from Software Services; he was never quite sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he would send me documentation.</p>
<p>My third husband was from Field Services and constantly said that everything was diagnostically OK, but he just couldn't get the system up.</p>
<p>My fourth husband was from Educational Services, and he simply said, Those who can, do; those who can't, teach.</p>
<p>My fifth husband was from the Telemarketing Department and said that he had the orders, but he wasn't quite sure when he was going to be able to deliver.</p>
<p>My sixth husband was an Engineer. He told me that he understood the basic process but needed three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.</p>
<p>My seventh husband was from Finance and Administration. His comments were that he knew how, but he just wasn't sure whether it was his job.</p>
<p>My eighth husband was from Standards and Regulations and told me that he was up to the standards but that regulations said nothing about how to do it.</p>
<p>My ninth husband was a Marketing Manager. He said, 'I know I have the product. I'm just not sure how to position it.'</p>
<p>My tenth husband was a psychiatrist, and all he ever wanted to do was talk about it.</p>
<p>My eleventh husband was a gynecologist, and all he ever wanted to do was look at it.</p>
<p>My twelfth husband was a stamp collector, and all he ever wanted to do was -- God I miss him!</p>
<p>So now I have married a lawyer, so I know I'm going to get screwed!</p>

<p>Farmer: Well, I sat back down and continued to milk her. Just as I got the bucket about full, she took her right leg and kicked over the bucket. </p>

8572,"<p>Here are answers to 5 of the toughest questions women ask men. </p>
<p>1 - ""What are you thinking?"" </p>
<p>2 - ""Do you love me?"" </p>
<p>3 - ""Do I look fat?"" </p>
<p>4 - ""Do you think she is prettier than me?"" </p>
<p>5 - ""What would you do if I died?"" </p>
<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example:</p>
<p>1 - ""What are you thinking?"" </p>
<p>The proper answer to this question, of course is, ""I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you."" </p>
<p>Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things: </p>
<p>a - Baseball </p>
<p>b - Football </p>
<p>c - How fat you are </p>
<p>d - How much prettier she is than you </p>
<p>e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. ""If I wanted you to know,"" Al said, ""I'd be talking instead of thinking."" </p>
<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers: </p>
<p>2 - ""Do you love me?"" </p>
<p>The correct answer to this question is, ""Yes."" For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, ""Yes, dear."" </p>
<p>Wrong answers include: </p>
<p>a - I suppose so. </p>
<p>b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes? </p>
<p>c - That depends on what you mean by ""love"". </p>
<p>d - Does it matter? </p>
<p>e - Who, me? </p>
<p>3 - ""Do I look fat?"" </p>
<p>The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, ""No, of course not"" and then quickly leave the room. </p>
<p>Wrong answers include: </p>
<p>a - I wouldn't call you fat, but I wouldn't call you thin either. </p>
<p>b - Compared to what? </p>
<p>c - A little extra weight looks good on you. </p>
<p>d - I've seen fatter. </p>
<p>e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>
<p>4 - ""Do you think she's prettier than me?"" </p>
<p>The ""she"" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, ""No, you are much prettier."" </p>
<p>Wrong answers include: </p>
<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. </p>
<p>b - I don't know how one goes about rating such things. </p>
<p>c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality. </p>
<p>d - Only in the sense that she's younger and thinner. </p>
<p>e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>
<p>5 - ""What would you do if I died?"" </p>
<p>Correct answer: ""Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino's Pizza truck that came my way."" </p>
<p>This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid exchange: </p>
<p>""Dear,"" said the wife. ""What would you do if I died?"" </p>
<p>""Why, dear, I would be extremely upset,"" said the husband. ""Why do you ask such a question?"" </p>
<p>""Would you remarry?"" persevered the wife. </p>
<p>""No, of course not, dear"" said the husband. </p>
<p>""Don't you like being married?"" said the wife. </p>
<p>""Of course I do, dear"" he said. </p>
<p>""Then why wouldn't you remarry?"" </p>
<p>""Alright,"" said the husband, ""I'd remarry."" </p>
<p>""You would?"" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>
<p>""Yes"" said the husband. </p>
<p>""Would you sleep with her in our bed?"" said the wife after a long pause. </p>
<p>""Well yes, I suppose I would."" replied the husband. </p>
<p>""I see,"" said the wife indignantly. </p>
<p>""And would you let her wear my old clothes?"" </p>
<p>""I suppose, if she wanted to"" said the husband. </p>
<p>""Really,"" said the wife icily. </p>
<p>""And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?"" </p>
<p>""Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do."" </p>
<p>""Is that so?"" said the wife, leaping to her feet. </p>
<p>""And I suppose you'd let her play with my golf clubs, too."" </p>
<p>""Of course not, dear,"" said the husband. ""She's left-handed...""</p>

8593,"<p>COPIED FROM A NEWSGROUP POSTING - (the author is responding to a woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom):</p>
<p>Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the time. It's rare us guys ever hit what were aiming for. Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around; just so I'll make sure I hit something. </p>
<p>You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't be trusted. </p>
<p>After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I'm no longer allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee-soaked toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my sleep. </p>
<p>Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm a classy guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem, and you ladies need to be understanding. It's the dreaded ""morning wood"". Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it won't bend you can't aim, well hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wall paper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet. And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seatcovers, the friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control our less-than-perfect aim. </p>
<p>Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys! in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe. I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her...look, it won't bend. She said, ""so sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time."" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with ""morning wood"". Well it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. </p>
<p>Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee, the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet. I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee. So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control. </p>
<p>It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature. Now, if it was Father Nature, there wouldn't have been a problem!!!</p>

8600,"<p>A traveling salesman was driving down a farm road when his car suddenly<br /> stopped and wouldn't start again. A farmer on a tractor was passing by and<br /> stopped to help the salesman fix his car. By the time they were finished, it was<br /> almost sundown, so the farmer told the salesman he could spend the night at his<br /> home if he didn't mind sharing the bed with his twin daughters. The salesman<br /> thought the twins were kids, so he said it was okay. They farmer took the<br /> salesman to his home and went into the house.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of talking and cleaning up, the men were called to the<br /> dinner table by the farmer's wife. As they sat down, the salesman saw the two<br /> most beautiful young ladies he had ever seen. The farmer introduced them as his<br /> twin daughters. During the entire meal all the salesman thought about was he was<br /> sleeping in the same bed as the girls and he was going to have a good time that<br /> night. They all finished their supper and the men went and talked while the<br /> women finished cleaning up. The salesman couldn't keep his mind off what was to<br /> be a good time. Finally it was time to go to bed and the salesman anxiously got<br /> prepared. The twins got into the bed, one on each side of the salesman. Just as<br /> the lights were going to be turned off, the farmer came into the bedroom and<br /> placed one egg on both sides of the salesman. The farmer said, ""This is to make<br /> sure you don't do anything with my daughters tonight!! If I come in tomorrow<br /> morning and find one or both eggs broken, I'll know you did something and I'll<br /> shoot you!! You understand? Well, the salesman looked at the eggs, the farmer,<br /> and the shotgun in the farmer's hand and quietly replied that he understood.<br /> With that, the farmer told them goodnight and turned off the light.</p>
<p>During the night, the salesman turned over and accidentally broke one of the<br /> eggs. ""What the hell,"" he thought, ""I'm dead anyway,"" and screwed the first<br /> twin. After several minutes of bliss, he rolled off of her and broke the other<br /> egg. ""Might as well go out smiling,"" he thought and had his way with the second<br /> twin. When he was finished, he noticed that it was almost sunup and the farmer<br /> was starting to stir. Thinking quickly, he looked into his sales bag and got out<br /> a tube of superglue and glued the eggs back together. The glue dried quickly and<br /> the salesman jumped back into the bed and had just put both eggs back when the<br /> farmer entered.</p>
<p>""I see the eggs are alright, so I guess I won't shoot you. Want some<br /> breakfast?""</p>
<p>""What are you making?"" the salesman asked.</p>
<p>Holding up the eggs, he said, ""Eggs.""</p>
<p>""No thanks, I'll eat later, I got to get going!!!"" the salesman quickly said<br /> and grabbed his clothes and left.</p>
<p>The farmer went to the stove and broke the first egg over the skillet, but<br /> nothing came out. He then broke the second egg and again, nothing came out.<br /> Extremely pissed off, the farmer walked out to the hen house and shouted,<br /> ""Alright...which one of you roosters is wearing a rubber???""</p>

The real difference between fat and thin people is that thin people:avoid eating popcorn in the movies because it gets their hands greasy;split a large combination pizza with three friends;think Oreo cookies are for kids;nibble cashews one at a time;think that doughnuts are indigestible;read books they have to hold with both hands;become so absorbed in a weekend project they forget to have lunch;fill the candy dish on their desks with paper clips;counteract the midafternoon slump with a nap instead of a cinnamon Danish;exchange the deep-fryer they received for Christmas for a clock-radio;lose their appetites when they're depressed;think chocolate Easter bunnies are for kids;save leftovers that are too skimpy to use for another meal in order to make interesting soups;throw out stale potato chips;will eat only Swiss or Dutch chocolate, which cannot be found except in a special store;think it's too much trouble to stop at a special store just to buy chocolate;don't celebrate with a hot-fudge sundae every time they lose a pound;warm up after skiing with black coffee instead of hot chocolate and whipped cream;try all the salads at the buffet, leaving room for only one dessert;find iced tea more refreshing than an ice-cream soda;get into such interesting conversations at cocktail parties that they never quite work their way over to the hors-d'oeuvre table;have no compulsion to keep the candy dish symmetrical by reducing the jelly beans to an equal number of each color;think that topping brownies with ice cream makes too rich a dessert;bring four cookies into the TV room instead of a box;think banana splits are for kids.</p>

8608,"<p>Callus Collection </p>
<p>Florence Franklin of Peoria, IL, holds the record. As of Sept 12, 1992, Florence had over 200 pounds of callus in her collection. ""I shave it off people,"" Florence told us. ""They don't mind. Some people even autograph the big pieces."" </p>
<p>Infestation of Mites (Group) </p>
<p>This record belongs to the 3,859 residents of Itchy Butt, Montana. In 1989, visiting doctors certified that every person in the town was suffering from scabies, a skin disease caused by mite infection. ""The mites seemed to be jumping from one person to another,"" the mayor of Itchy Butt told us, ""so we decided to get together and go for the record."" </p>
<p>Snail-Sucking (Live) </p>
<p>Armand Forcalquier, of Marseille, France, holds the record. In a contest held on Feb 12, 1992, Armand sucked down 1,238 live snails in a little over 4 hours. ""It was not easy,"" Armand boasted after he learned the record was his. ""They cling to their shells, but they can't get away from me."" </p>
<p>Nose Stuffing (Limburger Cheese) </p>
<p>Hans Kleiber, of West Berlin, holds the record. In a contest held on May 1, 1986, Hans managed to stuff 13 ounces of limburger into his nostrils in less than a minute. Hans' closest competitor gagged on nine ounces and was disqualified. </p>
<p>Raw Kidney (Eating) </p>
<p>Alice Caldwell of Butte, Montana, holds the record. On Oct 22, 1991, Alice gobbled up more than 14 pounds of raw veal and lamb kidneys. ""Kidneys are a good source of protein and vitamins,"" Alice told us. ""If you cook them, you lose some of the vitamins. As you can see, I don't care about the record - I care about my health."" </p>
<p>Roach (Largest) </p>
<p>Rita Carlson, of Pasadena, CA, claims the record for having raised the world's largest roach. Her record-setting roach is over a foot long and weighs close to two pounds (1992). ""Plenty of protein,"" Rita told us, ""and plenty of good, natural vitamins helped to make this roach into a champion. You should have seen it when I first found it crawling around my kitchen."" {There are a couple more roach records. One is highest paid for a roach named Lassie II ($112,450) and longest living (Lassie, 12 years). Both roaches came from roach afficianado Sheila Biderman. About the oldest roach, Sheila reports that ""She's like one of the family. If she ever gets too old to poke around food by herself, you can bet I'll do the humane thing and step on her, record or no record.""} </p>
<p>Socks (Continuous Wear) </p>
<p>Andy Schwartz, of Glen Ridge, NJ, claimed the record in 1989. In a sworn statement, Andy's wife declared that he had worn the same socks every day for twenty years and 114 days. In 1983, shoe stores throughout New Jersey banned Andy from their premises. Since then he has purchased his shoes through the mail. Andy plans to remove the socks and take a look at his feet in 1999. </p>
<p>Tapeworm (Longest) </p>
<p>Sally Mae Wallace of Great Grits, Mississippi, holds the record. On Sep 5, 1991, doctors extracted 37 feet (continuous) of tapeworm from Sally. ""About after 20 feet of that thing had come out of my mouth,"" Sally told us, ""I just knew I had the record. I was really filled with joy."" </p>
<p>Tongue (Hairiest) </p>
<p>Selma Ruby, of Dallas, Texas, holds the record. Selma's tongue is fully covered with hair (1992). ""I've been thinking about having it removed by an electrolysist,"" Selma told us, ""though lately people have been telling me that it's beautiful."" </p>
<p>Underarm Hair (Length) </p>
<p>Florence Floss of Ban, Idaho, holds the record. On July 15, 1992, the hair growing out of Florence's left armpit stretched to a length of 34 inches. This was more than enough for a record, but Florence hopes to have a yard of hair dangling from her armpit soon. ""I shave the other armpit,"" Florence reported to us. </p>
<p>Feet (Smell) </p>
<p>On Aug 21, 1991, Wanda Lake, 18, broke the record held by George David. Wanda removed her shoes in the crowded lobby of a Los Angeles theatre. In the five minutes that followed, the lobby was a chaotic mass of panic-stricken people trying desperately to escape. In the end, 42 people were sick, and 14 others had passed out.</p>

8617,"<p>A fellow had just been hired as the new CEO of a large high tech corporation. The CEO who was stepping down met with him privately and presented him with three numbered envelopes. ""Open these if you run up against a problem you don't think you can solve,"" he said. </p>
<p>Well, things went along pretty smoothly, but six months later, sales took a downturn and he was really catching a lot of heat. About at his wit's end, he remembered the envelopes. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, ""Blame your predecessor."" </p>
<p>The new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Satisfied with his comments, the press and Wall Street responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him. About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope. </p>
<p>The message read, ""Reorganize."" This he did, and the company quickly rebounded. After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on difficult times. </p>
<p>The CEO went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope. The message said, ""Prepare three envelopes.""</p>

<p>Startled, the tourist went over to the shopkeeper and said, ''That was a very expensive monkey. Most of them are only a few hundred dollars. Why did it cost so much?'' </p>

<p>The tourist looked at the monkey in another cage. ''That one's even more expensive - $10,000! What does it do?'' </p>
<p>''Oh, that one's a C++ monkey; it can manage object-oriented programming, Visual C++, even some Java. All the really useful stuff,'' said the shopkeeper. </p>
<p>The tourist looked around for a little longer and saw a third monkey in a cage of its own. The price tag around its neck read $50,000. He gasped to the shopkeeper, ''That one costs more than all the others put together! What on earth does it do?'' </p>

Threaten the instructor that whether or not everyone's done, they are all leaving after one hour to go drink)26. Show up completely drunk.  (Completely drunk means at some point during the exam, you should start crying for mommy).27. Every now and then, clap twice rapidly.  If the instructor asks why, tell him/her in a very derogatory tone, ""the light bulb that goes on above my head when I get an idea is hooked up to a clapper.  DUH!""28. Comment on how sexy the instructor is looking that day. 29. Come to the exam wearing a black cloak.

8622,"<p>There was a girl who had very bad speech impairment. Her mother<br /> worked out a system where the girl could help with errands. Her<br /> mother would give her a note to take down to the local market,<br /> she would give it to a cashier who would give what she needed.<br /> This system was working great until one day.</p>
<p>She came home from school and was yelling, ""I'M AM NOH THUPID,<br /> I'M AM NOH THUPID, I'M AM NOH THUPID!"" Which translates to I am<br /> not stupid.

8633,"<p>A young ensign had nearly completed his first overseas tour of sea duty when he was given an opportunity to display his ability at getting the ship under way. With a stream of crisp commands, he had the decks buzzing with men and soon, the ship had left port and was streaming out of the channel.</p>
<p>The ensign's efficiency has been remarkable. In fact, the deck was abuzz with talk that he had set a new record for getting a destroyer under way. The ensign glowed at his accomplishment and was not all surprised when another seaman approached him with a message from the captain.</p>
<p>He was, however, a bit surprised to find that it was a radio message, and he was even more surprised when he read, ""My personal congratulations upon completing your underway preparation exercise according to the book and with amazing speed. In your haste, however, you have overlooked one of the unwritten rules -- Make sure the captain is aboard before getting under way.""</p>

8635,"<p>Three bulls are in the pasture complaining. They've heard a<br /> rumor that the farmer is bringing in a new bull, and they aren't<br /> happy about sharing any of their cows.</p>
<p>The Alpha bull says, ""You know, since we settled our differences<br /> and split up the cows, I've been pretty happy with MY 120 cows.<br /> I am not about to share any of MY cows with this new bull.""</p>
<p>The second toughest bull says, ""Yeah, well I ended up with only<br /> 60 cows, so I can't afford to share any of MY cows.""</p>
<p>The youngest bull says, ""I may only be half as big as you guys,<br /> but I'm still a teenager. I'm already climbing the walls with<br /> just 20 cows.""</p>
<p>Suddenly a huge, black tractor-trailer pulls into the yard. The<br /> entire trailer contains just one animal - the biggest, baddest<br /> bull you ever saw. He weighs 3,000 pounds and has horns four<br /> feet long. As the new bull strolls down the gangplank, the<br /> two-inch thick metal plates actually sag under his weight.</p>
<p>Suddenly the former Alpha bull is a bit more flexible, ""Well,<br /> maybe I could spare a FEW cows.""</p>
<p>The second toughest bull says, ""Maybe if I hide in the corner of<br /> the pasture, he'll leave me alone.""</p>
<p>But the small, teenage bull is snorting, pawing the ground and<br /> shaking his fledgling horns in an extremely confrontational way.</p>
<p>Worried about the reckless youngster, the two older bulls trot<br /> over to the young bull and say, ""Listen, son. It's not worth<br /> dying for. Just give the new bull your 20 cows.""</p>
<p>""He can HAVE my 20 cows,"" replies the young bull, snorting and<br /> pawing the ground again. ""I'm just making sure he knows I'm a<br /> BULL!""</p>

"
8662,"<p>Frequently I am asked by my readers to explain the mysteries of child birth.  Well okay, that's actually completely untrue, but since we're on the subject I want to tell you about Lamaze class.Lamaze is a breathing technique whereby women feel no pain while having an object the size of a small watermelon claw its way out of their bodies.  Yes, this is utterly ridiculous, but Lamaze class has apparently become a prerequisite to giving birth:  in fact, a woman in East Jordan, Michigan was recently discovered by authorities to have given birth to a baby without having first attended Lamaze, and the courts actually made her put it back.Although pregnancy has been around for at least 100 years, most men don't understand anything about it.  It was news to me that pregnancy takes place in three trimesters (Trimester comes from the phrase, 'Don't you even TRY, MISTER,' uttered by women when men suggest that maybe they can't make it to Lamaze class one night.) The three trimesters are: Vomiting, Weight Gain, and Crying.The men at Lamaze class are there mainly as punishment for having caused their mates to swell up to the size of Marlin Brando.  I mean, realistically, how can we help someone else BREATHE?  (More to the point, I can testify truthfully that a woman in labor who is urged to 'breathe, honey, breathe' will respond in a tone for which 'pleasant' is an antonym.)The punishment begins with the first lesson, where everybody sits there and is supposed to be quiet while they watch a film of somebody else's baby being born.  This is where you learn you shouldn't have eaten before Lamaze class, even if your wife simply HAD to have a Pizza Hut Supreme with Double Cheese or she would pass out from hunger.  You give the other guys a 'can you believe this?' look, doing your Lamaze breathing so you won't blow pizza.  By the end of the movie they ought to usher in a urologist to perform vasectomies; they'd make a couple of grand right on the spot.  The final frame depicts everyone standing around looking happy, except maybe the baby, who frankly appears more than a little pissed off at how his morning's going.The night I went, the movie was a horror double feature, with Night of the Living Cesarean Section immediately following Birth of the Pizza Baby.After the movie there is a short break so the men can get together and vow that the only way they're going to make it through this is if they're drunk. Then the group is reassembled to practice breathing, even though we've been breathing all our lives and probably don't need any more practice.  What did pregnant women do before this Lamaze guy came along, hold their breaths for nine months?  And why do I have to practice?  Heck, I'm so good at breathing I can even do it in my sleep!  During all this panting and gasping, the men are told to squeeze their mates' thighs to 'simulate labor.'Squeeze her leg to simulate labor!  That's like simulating a concussion by getting a haircut.  If you want to simulate labor, you should run her lips through a pencil sharpener.  But you don't know this, so you dutifully squeeze while she dutifully breathes.  Men who make note of the fact that pregnancy has caused the thighs they are squeezing to maybe require two hands instead of one will be violently torn into small pieces by a bunch of crazed Lamaze women, and no female jury in the world would find anything in this other than justice.In Lamaze I learned there are several different stages of labor.  In none of them do you want your wife to have access to sharp objects. By about the third stage you both know that this breathing thing is a bunch of baloney--labor, it seems, HURTS, and you can pant like a race horse after the Kentucky Derby, but it won't alter the sensation of having a whole human being clamber out of your stomach and into the world.Often a man will run into a fellow Lamaze class husband at the hospital. It's a brief encounter, usually during a fast break to the men's room between contractions.  The wild look they exchange says it all:  this is nothing like what they expected.And after that, nothing ever is.</p>

8699,"<p>You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling you those little buggers can't be trusted.Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it won't bend, you can't aim, well hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wall paper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet.And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the frigging toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control our less than perfect aim.Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe.I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her... look, it won't bend. She said, ""so sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time."" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with ""morning wood."" Well, it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room.Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee, the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet. I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position -- lying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee.</p>

8710,"<p>After many years of marriage, a husband has turned into a couch potato, became completely inattentive to his wife and sat guzzling beer and watching TV all day. The wife was dismayed because no matter what she did to attract the husband's attention, he'd just shrug her off with some bored comment.</p>
<p>This went on for many months and the wife was going crazy with boredom. Then one day at a pet store, the wife saw this big, ugly, snorting bird with a hairy chest, powerful hairy forearms, beady eyes and dribble running down the side of its mouth.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper, observing her fascination with the bird, told her it was a special imported ""Goony bird"" and it had a very peculiar trait. To demonstrate, he exclaimed, ""Goony bird! The table!""</p>
<p>Immediately, the Goony bird flew off its perch and with single-minded fury attacked the table and smashed it into a hundred little pieces with its powerful forearms and claws! To demonstrate some more, the shopkeeper said, ""Goony bird! The shelf!""</p>
<p>Again the Goony bird turned to the shelf and demolished it in seconds.</p>
<p>""Wow!"" said the wife, ""If this doesn't attract my husband's attention, nothing will!"" So she bought the bird and took it home.</p>
<p>When she entered the house, the husband was, as usual, sprawled on the sofa guzzling beer and watching the game. ""Honey!"" she exclaimed, ""I've got a surprise for you! A Goony bird!""</p>

<p>The lawyer was then taken to his room, which was a palatial suite including a private swimming pool, a garden, and a terrace overlooking the Gates. The attorney was somewhat taken aback, and told St. Peter, ""I'm really quite surprised at these rooms, seeing as how the Pope was given such small accommodations.""</p>
<p>St. Peter replied, ""We have over a hundred Popes here, and we're really very bored with them. We've never had a lawyer.""</p>

<p>We had changed little since we had last met ten years ago. Oh, we had aged a little. But there was no real change. We spent most of the time reminiscing on the good times we had during our high school days. What most of us remembered most vividly was the semester we were offered a class in Accounting. </p>
<p>This was an innovative experimental class that had never been tried before. And because of us, it has never been offered again. You see we were very independent teen-agers in those post-war days. We were interested in ideals about equality and the future, not in accounting. </p>

<p>10&gt; Denim sky stretched out above me.<br />     O bovine and equine, sweet moos and sweet nays.<br />     How do I love thee?  Let me mount the ways.</p>
<p> 9&gt; I'm an old cow hand from the Rio Grande.<br />        I've driven cattle all over this land.<br />     I don't have mad cow disease, I tell you true,<br />        Or my name ain't Quack Quack Whistledy-Moo.</p>

<p> 6&gt; I signaled my horse in a code called Morse:<br />     ""SOS... SOS... SOS.""<br />     But the danged nag just stood like he was made of wood<br />     'Cause he can't read.<br />     ""SOS... SOS... SOS.""</p>
<p> 5&gt; Listen, my children, and you shall hear<br />     of the windy effects of beans and beer.</p>
<p> 4&gt; We rode into town<br />        to dance at the hoedown<br />           when I first met my sweet Linda Sue.<br />     I left my bed with a bound,<br />        for in the morn' I had found<br />           in the night all them whiskers she'd grew.</p>
<p> 3&gt; Jack 'n' Jill went up Boot Hill,<br />        'cause Jack, he had a hankerin'.<br />     Tipped his cap, and said, ""Gid'yap!""<br />        as he gave her rump a spankerin'.</p>
<p> 2&gt; Tiger, tiger, burning bright<br />        in the forest of the night.<br />     How'd you get to cowboy plains<br />        and what is it you're stalking?<br />     Have you come to feed on me,<br />        or is it the peyote talking?</p>
<p> 1&gt; She rides in beauty, like the night,<br />        upon her horse with blanket fleece.<br />     In Rocky Mountain jeans so tight,<br />        and smells of KC Masterpiece.</p>

8758,"<p>'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house,</p>
<p>I searched for the tools to hand to my spouse.</p>
<p>Instructions were studied and we were inspired,</p>
<p>in hopes we could manage ""Some Assembly Required.""</p>
<p>The children were quiet (not asleep) in their beds,</p>
<p>while Mom and I faced the evening with dread:</p>
<p>a kitchen, two bikes, Barbie's town house to boot!</p>
<p>And, thanks to Grandpa, a train with a toot!</p>
<p>We opened the boxes, my heart skipped a beat....</p>
<p>let no parts be missing or parts incomplete!</p>
<p>Too late for last-minute returns or replacement;</p>
<p>if we can't get it right, it goes in the basement!</p>
<p>When what to my worrying eyes should appear,</p>
<p>but 50 sheets of directions, concise, but not clear,</p>
<p>with each part numbered and every slot named,</p>
<p>so if we failed, only we could be blamed.</p>
<p>More rapid than eagles the parts then fell out,</p>
<p>all over the carpet they were scattered about.</p>
<p>""Now bolt it! Now twist it! Attach it right there!</p>
<p>Slide on the seats, and staple the stair!</p>
<p>Hammer the shelves, and nail to the stand.""</p>
<p>""Dearest"" said Mom, ""you just glued my hand.""</p>
<p>And then in a twinkling, I knew for a fact</p>
<p>that all the toy dealers had indeed made a pact</p>
<p>to keep parents busy all Christmas Eve night</p>
<p>with ""assembly required"" till morning's first light.</p>
<p>We spoke not a word, but kept bent at our work,</p>
<p>till our eyes, they went bleary; our fingers all hurt.</p>
<p>The coffee went cold and the night, it wore thin</p>
<p>before we attached the last rod and last pin.</p>
<p>Then laying the tools away in the chest,</p>
<p>we fell into bed for a well-deserved rest.</p>
<p>But I said to my wife just before I passed out,</p>
<p>""This will be the best Christmas, without any doubt.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we'll cheer, let the holiday ring,</p>
<p>and not have to run to the store for a thing!</p>
<p>We did it! We did it! The toys are all set</p>
<p>for the perfect, most perfect, Christmas, I bet!""</p>
<p>Then off to dreamland and sweet repose</p>
<p>I gratefully went, though I suppose</p>
<p>there's something to say for those self-deluded-</p>
<p>I'd forgotten that BATTERIES are never included!</p>

8776,"<p>Current Proceedings 'Not Long Enough,' News Outlets Argue</p>
<p>On the eve of closing arguments in the Michael Jackson child-molestation trial, a coalition of the major all-news networks has asked the judge in the case for a new trial, claiming that the current legal proceedings were ""not long enough.""</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the networks, Peter Fendell, held a press conference on Thursday to state the cable news outlets' position that the current trial had given ""short shrift"" to the key issues in the case.</p>
<p>""Unless there is another, longer trial, preferably one that lasts until May sweeps in 2007, justice will not be served,"" Mr. Fendell said.</p>
<p>He said that a longer trial would allow more time to focus on the lurid sexual details of the case, which he said had been ""glossed over.""</p>
<p>He added that, in addition to being ""too quick and cursory,"" the current Jackson trial was marred by the insufficient number and quality of celebrity witnesses.</p>
<p>""Instead of Jay Leno, George Lopez and Macaulay Culkin, in a new trial we would like to see Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and Johnny Depp,"" he said.</p>
<p>In response to the networks' request, the judge in the case, Superior Court Judge Rodney S. Melville, issued a terse response: ""If the networks think Michael Jackson is getting another trial, they must be on crack,"" adding, ""They might as well ask for O.J. Simpson to have another trial.""</p>

Well, the yarns were being spun and the grog was going down easy and at around 3 am, full as a boot, I went home.Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock started and cuckooed three times. Quickly I realized she'd probably wake up, so I cuckooed another nine times and was really proud of myself for having the quick-wittedness, even when pissed, to escape a possible conflict.Next morning the missus asked me what time I got in and I told her midnight. Whew, got away with that one! She then told me that we needed a new cuckoo clock. When I asked her why, she said, 'Well, at 3 am this morning, it cuckooed three times, paused, said bollocks, Cuckooed another four times, farted, cuckooed another three times, paused, cleared its throat and cuckooed twice, then giggled for over three minutes.''I think it's stuffed, don't you?'</p>

8807,"<p>Dear __________________________,</p>
<p>    I regret to inform you that you have been eliminated from further<br /> contention as Mr. Right.  As you are probably aware, the competition was<br /> exceedingly tough and dozens of well-qualified candidates such as yourself also<br /> failed to make the final cut.  I will, however, keep your name on file should an<br /> opening come available.  So that you may find better success in your future<br /> romantic endeavors, please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were<br /> disqualified from the competition: (Check those that apply)</p>
<p>__ Your last name is objectionable. I can't imagine taking it, hyphenating it,<br /> or subjecting my children to it.</p>
<p>__ Your first name is objectionable. It's just not something I can picture<br /> myself yelling out in a fit of passion.</p>
<p>__ The fact that our finest dining experience to date has been at McDonald's<br /> reveals a thriftiness that I find unappealing.</p>
<p>__ Your inadvertent admission that you ""buy condoms by the truckload""<br /> indicates that you may be interested in me for something other than my<br /> personality.</p>
<p>__ You failed the 20 Question Rule, i.e., I asked you 20<br /> questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself.</p>
<p>__ Your breasts are bigger than mine.</p>
<p>__ Your legs are skinnier than mine. If you can FIT into my pants, then you<br /> can't GET into my pants.</p>
<p>__ You're too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up<br /> repeatedly at recess.  AMEN!</p>
<p>__ You're too tall. I'm developing a chronic neck condition from trying to<br /> kiss you.</p>
<p>__ The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent<br /> slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable.</p>
<p>__ Although I do enjoy the X-Files, I find your wardrobe of Star Trek uniforms<br /> a little disconcerting.</p>
<p>__ Your frequent references to your ex-girlfriend lead me to suspect that you<br /> are some sort of psychotic stalker.</p>
<p>__ Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I am seeking in a<br /> long term partner.</p>
<p>__ Your height is out of proportion to your weight.  If you should, however,<br /> happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches, please resubmit your<br /> application.</p>
<p>__ The fact that you categorize the ProBowler's Tour as 'Must<br /> See TV' demonstrated that you do not meet my intelligence requirements.</p>
<p>__ Somehow I doubt those condoms that I found in your overnight bag were<br /> really necessary for a successful business trip.</p>
<p>__ I am out of your league; set your sights lower next time.</p>

<p>They set themselves up on the edge of a clearing, donned their costume and began to give the moose love call.</p>
<p>Before long, their call was answered as a bull came crashing out of the forest and into the clearing.</p>
<p>When the bull was close enough, the guy in front said, ""Okay, let's get out and get him.""</p>

8881,"<p>Three scientists were talking one day when one of them asked if there had ever been an experiment carried out to determine the effect of blocking off an elephants rectum for an extended period of time. They discovered that it had never been tried and so they resolved to try it themselves.They got an elephant and inserted a huge plug into it's arse and let the elephant go about it's daily business of eating 500 pounds of greenstuff a day.After a couple of days, it occurred to the scientists that someone was going to have to remove the plug from the elephants arse. None of them were prepared to do it so they got themselves a monkey and trained it to remove the plug when it heard a particular bell sound.`  . Come the day of the end of the experiment when the plug was finally to be removed, they set themselves up at respectable distances from the monkey and elephant - 1 scientist was 50 yards away, 1 was 500 yards away and the third was a mile away. All had recording equipment etc set up to record the event. One had a button to press to sound the bell and prompt the monkey to remove the plug from the elephant's arse.The button was pressed, the bell sounded and there was this god-almighty explosion.The scientist at 1 mile from the elephant was splattered with shit and he raced up to the scientist 500 yards from the elephant. He too was covered in shit.They both raced up to the scientist who had set himself up 50 yards from the elephant to find him up to his neck in shit, covered in scratches and bruises and with a couple of broken bones in his arms and legs. He was also pissing himself laughing. One of his colleagues commented on all the injuries he had sustained and asked why was he laughing so much.""The bell sounded, the monkey pulled the plug and I was injured when the blast threw me backwards away from my position."", he said.""But why were you laughing so much?"", his colleagues asked again.""You'd be laughing too if you could have seen the expression on the monkey's face as he tried to put the plug back in.""</p>

8887,"<p>REDMOND, Wash. - Oct. 21, 1997 -- In direct response to accusations made by the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today that it will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of America for an undisclosed sum. </p>
<p>""It's actually a logical extension of our planned growth"", said Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, ""It really is going to be a positive arrangement for everyone"". Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of the White House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and assured members of the press that changes will be ""minimal"". </p>
<p>The United States will be managed as a wholly owned division of Microsoft. An initial public offering is planned for July of next year, and the federal government is expected to be profitable by ""Q4 1999 at latest"", according to Microsoft president Steve Ballmer. In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had ""willingly and enthusiastically"" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting directly to Bill Gates. When asked how it felt to give up the mantle of executive authority to Gates, Clinton smiled and referred to it as ""a relief"". He went on to say that Gates has a ""proven track record"", and that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their ""full support and confidence"". Clinton will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he has earned as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft. Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as ""silly"", though did say that he would make executive decisions for the U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters. Gates went on to say that the House and Senate would ""of course"" be Abolished. </p>
<p>""Microsoft isn't a democracy"", he observed, ""and look how well we're doing"". When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was proceeding, Gates said, ""We don't deny that discussions are taking place"". Microsoft representatives closed the conference by stating that United States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in government services and discounts on all Microsoft products.</p>

8892,"<p>A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where he had been born and brought up.As he scurried away from the fencing of the compound, he felt grass under his little feet and saw the dawn breaking for the first time in his life. 'Wow, this is great,' he thought.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before he came to a hedge and, after squeezing under it he saw a wonderful sight lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and nibbling at the lush grass.</p>
<p>""Hey,"" he called. ""I'm a rabbit from the laboratory and I've just escaped. Are you wild rabbits?""<br /> ""Yes. Come and join us,"" they cried.</p>
<p>Our friend hopped over to them and started eating the grass. I tasted so good. ""What else do you wild rabbits do?"" he asked. </p>
<p>""Well,"" one of them said. ""You see that field there? It's got carrots growing in it. We dig them up and eat them.""</p>
<p>This, he couldn't resist and he spent the next hour eating the most succulent carrots. They were wonderful. </p>
<p>Later, he asked them again, ""What else do you do?"" </p>
<p>""You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it. We eat them as well."" </p>
<p>The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned a while later completely full. ""Is there anything else you guys do?"" he asked.</p>
<p>One of the other rabbits came a bit closer to him and spoke softly.<br /> ""There's one other thing you must try. You see those rabbits there, ""he said, pointing to the far corner of the field. ""They're girls. We shag them. Go and try it."" </p>
<p>Well, our friend spent the rest of the morning shagging his little heart out until, completely spent, he staggered back over to the guys.<br /> ""That was fantastic,"" he panted. </p>
<p>""So are you going to live with us then?"" one of them asked.<br /> ""I'm sorry, I had a great time but I can't.""</p>

At the end of the tour, the guard asked them what they did for a living. When they all replied that they were contractors the guard said, ''Hey, we need one of the rear fences redone. Why don't you guys take a look at it and give me a bid?'' So to the back fence they all went.  First to step up was the Florida contractor. He took out his tape measure and pencil, did some measuring and said, ''Well I figure the job will run about $900. $400 for materials, $400 for my crew, and $100 profit for me.''  Next was the Texas contractor. He also took out his tape measure and pencil, did some quick figuring and said, ''Looks like I can do this job for $700. $300 for materials, $300 for my crew, and $100 profit for me.''  Without so much as moving, the New York contractor said, ''$2,700.''  The guard, incredulous, looked at him and said, ''You didn't even measure like the other guys! How did you come up with such a high figure?''  ''Easy,'' he said. ''$1,000 for me, $1,000 for you, and we hire the guy from Texas.''</p>

8915,"<p>A rich lady from California, who was a tree hugger and a vociferous anti-hunter, purchased a piece of timberland in Oregon. </p>
<p>There was a large tree on one of the highest points in the tract. She wanted to get a good view of her land so she started to climb the big tree. </p>
<p>As she neared the top, she encountered a spotted owl that attacked her.</p>
<p>In her haste to escape, the lady slid down the tree to the ground and got many splinters in her private parts. </p>
<p>In considerable pain, she hurried to the nearest country doctor. Being a hunter himself, the doctor listened to her story with great patience and then told her to go into the examining room and he would see if he could help her.</p>
<p>She sat and waited for three hours before the doctor reappeared. </p>
<p>The angry lady demanded, ""What took you so long?"" </p>
<p>He smiled and then told her, ""Well, I had to get permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management before I could remove old-growth timber from a recreational area and I am sorry, because they all turned me down!""  </p>

8917,"<p>The middle-aged wife had just returned to the house on Saturday afternoon after a shopping trip. She was quite agitated, and proceeded to tell her husband about a certain shoe salesman who had been rude.</p>
<p>It seems she was sitting down while he helped her try on various shoes, and happened to glance up and notice that she was not wearing any knickers under her dress. Without even thinking, he just blurted out, ""If that thing was full of ice cream, I'd eat every bite.""</p>
<p>Well, she was understandably insulted, and now wanted to know what her husband was going to do about it.</p>
<p>The husband just sat there, watching football on TV, and grunted. The wife became hysterical, and insisted on knowing why he didn't go down to the shop and punch the rude salesman right in the nose.</p>
<p>""Well"", the husband replied, ""There are three reasons I won't punch that guy in the nose. First of all, you shouldn't have even been shopping for shoes, since you have a whole wardrobe full of them. Secondly, you have no business going shopping with no knickers on. But most of all, I'm not going to punch anyone who's big enough to eat that much ice cream!""</p>

8918,"<p>The Florida State Department of Fish and Wildlife is advising  hikers,<br /> hunters, fishers, and golfers to take extra  precautions and keep alert for<br /> alligators while in Osceola,  Polk, Manatee, Orange and Dade Counties.</p>
<p>They advise people to wear noise-producing devices such as  little bells on<br /> their clothing to alert but not startle the  alligators unexpectedly.</p>
<p>They also advise the carrying of pepper spray in case of an  encounter with<br /> an alligator.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to watch for fresh signs of alligator  activity.</p>
<p>People should recognize the difference between small young  alligator and<br /> large adult alligator droppings.</p>
<p>Young alligator droppings are smaller and contain fish bones  and possibly<br /> bird feathers.</p>
<p>Adult alligators droppings have little bells in them and  smell like pepper<br /> spray.</p>

8928,"<p>April 15 is tax day in the US, so please read the following to<br /> make certain that you have paid all of your taxes for either yourself or<br /> your husband or boyfriend.</p>
<p>The only thing any Government has not taxed is the male penis.</p>
<p>This is due to the fact that<br />  40 % of the time it is hanging around unemployed,<br />  20 % of the time it is pissed off,<br />  30 % of the time it is hard up and<br />  10 % of the time it is in the hole.</p>
<p>On top of this it has two dependents and both of them are nuts!</p>
<p>According to the income tax amendment act 1995, your penis will be<br /> taxed according to its size.</p>
<p>To determine your category, please refer to Schedule 2 of the Income<br /> Tax return Form 8 which states the following :</p>
<p> 10 to 12 inches --------- Luxury tax ---------- $ 50.00<br />   8 to 10 inches --------- Pole tax ------------ $ 45.00<br />   5 to  8 inches --------- Privilege Tax ------- $ 40.00<br />   3 to  5 inches --------- Standard Tax -------- $ 30.00</p>
<p>Anyone under 3 inches is entitled to a refund of 20 %<br /> and special relief as a handicapped person.<br /> Please do not ask for an extension.</p>
<p>Those who exceed 12 inches will be liable for<br /> Capital Gains Tax.</p>

8941,"<p>Diet for Stress How's your stress level? This should help. It is more than a diet, so read on... This diet is designed to help you cope with the stress that builds up during the day.</p>
<p>Breakfast:</p>
<p>1/2 grapefruit 1 slice whole wheat toast 8 oz. skim milk</p>
<p>Lunch: 4 oz. lean broiled chicken breast 1 cup steamed spinach 1 cup herb tea 1 Oreo cookie</p>
<p>Mid-Afternoon snack: The rest of Oreos in the package 2 pints Rocky Road ice cream with nuts, cherries and whipped cream 1 jar hot fudge sauce</p>
<p>Dinner: 2 loaves garlic bread 4 cans or 1 large pitcher Coke 1 large sausage, mushroom and cheese pizza 3 Snickers bars</p>
<p>Late Evening News: Entire frozen Sara Lee cheesecake (eaten directly from freezer)</p>
<p>Rules for this Diet<br /> 1.  If you eat something and no one sees you eat it, it has no calories.<br /> 2.  If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, the calories in the candy jar are canceled out by the diet soda.<br /> 3.  When you eat with someone else, calories don't count if you do not eat more than they do.<br /> 4.  Food used for medicinal purposes NEVER count, such as hot chocolate, toast and Sara Lee Cheesecake.<br /> 5.  If you fatten up everyone else around you, then you look thinner.<br /> 6.  Movie related foods do not have additional calories because they are part of the entertainment package and not part of one's personal fuel.  Examples: Milk Duds, buttered popcorn, Junior Mints,  Red Hots and Tootsie Rolls.<br /> 7.  Cookie pieces contain no calories. The process of breaking  causes calorie leakage.<br /> 8.  Things licked off knives and spoons have no calories if you are in the process of preparing something.<br /> 9.  Foods that have the same color have the same number of calories. Examples are: spinach and pistachio ice cream; mushrooms and mashed potatoes.<br /> 10.  Chocolate is a universal color and may be substituted for any other food color.<br /> 11.  Anything consumed while standing has no calories.  This is due to gravity and the density of the caloric mass.<br /> 12.  Anything consumed from someone else's plate has no calories since the calories rightfully belong to the other person and will cling to his/her plate. (We ALL know how calories like to cling!)</p>

"
8946,"<p>1. BEING PASSIVE.<br /> Don't let him undress you and himself. Just help him a little<br /> bit: like making the first step. Just because we are men it<br /> doesn't mean that we must do all the job. </p>
<p>2. WEARING JEANS OR TIGHT PANTS.<br /> It takes time to take off these kind of clothes. Every second<br /> counts. Remember one thing: the more time you got, the more<br /> rounds you got, and the more rounds you got the more satisfied<br /> you get. </p>
<p>3. GOING DOWN HALFWAY.<br /> Once you start going down, don't stop at the belly button, keep<br /> going or just don't go past the neck at all. </p>
<p>4. CHOCKING HIS CHICKEN.<br /> Men feel pain, we are not as tough as you think. No man has a<br /> leather dick. You got to be smooth with the dick. Pulling it too<br /> hard doesn't make us feel horny, it hurts even though we don't<br /> tell you. </p>
<p>5. LICKING HIS EAR TOO MUCH.<br /> It's just the same as a dog licking a bitches ass. </p>
<p>6. MOANING LIKE A RUNNER THAT NEEDS AIR.<br /> Better moan with style girls cause men love to make fun of girls<br /> who can't moan like movie stars. Try not too make much noise<br /> when you exhale.</p>
<p>7. SCRATCHING HIS BACK.<br /> We don't need no autographs, girls. It does not feel good at<br /> all. Depend on the length of nail and how deep you dig them in<br /> our backs so keep your nails in you pockets please. If you feel<br /> the need to scratch a boys back, either grip the hell out of the<br /> sheets or the headboard.</p>
<p>8. LETTING YOUR HAIR FALL IN HIS FACE.<br /> Men need air, they breath.</p>
<p>9. JUMPING ON HIPS TO HARD.<br /> A man is not a horse so please take it easy unless you got a big<br /> booty to take care of the landing.</p>
<p>10. SCREAMING TOO LOUD WHEN YOU CUM.<br /> Are you crazy? Do you want us to get caught by your parents? Or<br /> do you just love seeing me jump through the window butt naked...</p>
<p>11. KEEP YORSELF CLEAN!<br /> Everyone knows that fish is the smell. But we don't have to be<br /> smelling it when you take your panties off. Please warn us if<br /> you haven't freshened up. And nobody wants to suck on salty<br /> dirty titties. Men aren't the only ones who sweat. And we sure<br /> don't want you smelling like you work at a fish market either.<br /> Make sure your ass is clean!!! No man wants to eat off a dirty<br /> plate.</p>
<p>12. MAKE SURE YOUR FEET ARE IN CHECK.<br /> Every man has a certain turn on, everything on a woman must be<br /> perfect, that's how we like it. Do not, I repeat do not get in<br /> bed with us with your feet looking like you were walking bare<br /> foot on toxic waste. You know what I am talking about, nail<br /> polish coming off halfway, smelly as hell, uneven toenails,<br /> soles feeling like sandpaper. Its hard to perform good foreplay<br /> with that. And don't even think about asking us to suck your<br /> toes when they look like they have been beaten with a sledge<br /> hammer (ugly) and we are not to fond of unpolished toes either.<br /> We like them soft, pretty, and tasty looking.</p>
<p>13. GIVING HEAD.<br /> Don't use your teeth! It hurts, really!</p>
<p>14. AFTER SEX BROADCASTING.<br /> Don't go bragging to your friends saying that you have us so<br /> called ""whipped"" its not cool at all, especially when his<br /> friends are around. If a man is ""whipped"" he won't admit it.</p>
<p>15. KEEP IT REAL.<br /> When you're at the point of breaking up, don't wait until then<br /> to tell us we didn't knock it right. You know damn well we had<br /> you climbing the walls and walking on air.</p>

8949,"<p>1. If they want to loan you money, tell them you just filed for bankruptcy and you could sure use some money. Ask, ""How long can I keep it? Do I have to ever pay it back, or is it like the other money I borrowed before my bankruptcy?""</p>
<p>2. If they start out with, ""How are you today?"" say, ""Why do you want to know?"" Or you can say, ""I'm so glad you asked, because no one seems to care these days and I have all these problems, my sciatica is acting up, my eyelashes are sore, my dog just died . . ."" When they try to get back to the sales process, just continue on talking about your problems.</p>
<p>3. If the person says he's Joe Doe from the XYZ Company, ask him to spell his name, then ask him to spell the company name, then ask where it is located. Continue asking personal questions or questions about the company for as long as necessary.</p>
<p>4. This one works better if you are male: Telemarketer: ""Hi, my name is Judy and I'm with Canter and Siegel services... You: ""Hang on a second."" (few seconds pause) ""Okay, (in a really husky voice) what are you wearing?""</p>
<p>5. Crying out, in well-simulated tones of pleasure and surprise, ""Judy!! Is this really you? I can't believe it! Judy, how have you BEEN?"" Hopefully, this will give Judy a few brief moments of terror as she tries to figure out where the heck she could know you from.</p>
<p>6. Say, ""No,"" over and over. Be sure to vary the sound of each no, and keep an even tempo even as they're trying to speak. This is the most fun if you can keep going until they hang up.</p>
<p>7. If MCI calls trying to get you to sign up with their Family and Friends plan, reply, in as sinister a voice as you can muster, ""I don't have any friends . . . would you be my friend?""</p>
<p>8. If they clean rugs: ""Can you get blood out, you can? Well, how about goat blood or HUMAN blood - chicken blood too?""</p>
<p>9. Let the person go through their spiel, providing minimal but necessary feedback in the form of an occasional ""Uh-huh"", ""really"", or, ""That's fascinating."" Finally, when they ask you to buy, ask them to marry you. They get all flustered, but just tell them you couldn't give your credit card number to someone who's a complete stranger.</p>
<p>10. Tell them you work for the same company they work for. Example: Telemarketer: ""This is Bill from Watertronics."" You: ""Watertronics!! Hey I work for them too. Where are you calling from?"" Telemarketer: ""Uh, Dallas, Texas."" You: ""Great, they have a group there too? How's business and how's the weather? Too bad the company has a policy against selling to employees! Oh well, see ya.""</p>
<p>11. Tell the Telemarketer you are busy and if they would be so kind as to give you their phone number, you'll call them back. If they say they aren't allowed to give out their number, ask them for their home number and offer to call them at home. If the person says, ""Well, I don't really want you to call me at home,"" say, ""Yeah! Now you know how I feel!""</p>

<p>Larry did this a few more times before the principal came along and the teacher explained Larry's problem. The principal and the first grade teacher told little Larry that if he could answer some questions that they could decide in which grade he belonged. Well, they soon discovered that Larry knew all the state capitals and country capitals that the principal could think of. </p>
<p>The teacher suggested they try some biology questions... 'What does a cow have 4 of but a woman has only 2?' asked the teacher. </p>
<p>'Legs!' Larry immediately replied. </p>
<p>'What does a man have in his pants that a woman doesn't?' asked the teacher. </p>

8956,"<p>A policeman was interrogating 3 SARDARS who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first SARDAR a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it.</p>
<p>""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""</p>
<p>The first SARDAR answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"" </p>
<p>The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.""</p>
<p>Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second SARDAR and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"" </p>
<p>The second SARDAR smiles, flips his hair and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""</p>
<p>The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""</p>
<p>Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third SARDAR and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""</p>
<p>The SARDAR looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""The suspect wears contact lenses.""</p>
<p>The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. ""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that.""</p>
<p>He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file in his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.</p>
<p>""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""</p>
<p>""That's easy,"" the SARDAR replied. ""He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.""</p>

8963,"<p>How To Rite Good1.  Avoid alliteration.  Always.2.  Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.3.  Avoid cliches like the plague.  (They're old hat.)4.  Employ the vernacular.5.  Eschew ampersands &amp; abbreviations, etc.6.  Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.7.  It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.8.  Contractions aren't necessary.9.  Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.10. One should never generalize.11. Eliminate quotations.  As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ''I hate  quotations.  Tell me what you know.''12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.13. Don't be redundant; don't use more words than necessary; it's  highly superfluous.14. Be more or less specific.15. Understatement is always best.16. One-word sentences?  Eliminate.17. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.18. The passive voice is to be avoided.19. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.20. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.21. Who needs rhetorical questions?22. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.</p>

8968,"<p>Rules for surviving Web addiction =================================1. I will have a cup of coffee in the morning and read my newspaper like I used to, before the Web.2. I will eat breakfast with a knife and fork and not with one hand typing.3. I will get dressed before noon.4. I will make an attempt to clean the house, wash clothes, and plan dinner before even thinking of the Web.5. I will sit down and write a letter to those unfortunate few friends and family that are Web-deprived.6. I will call someone on the phone who I cannot contact via the Web.7. I will read a book...think I still remember how.8. I will listen to those around me and stop telling them to turn the TV down so I can hear the music on the Web.9. I will not be tempted during TV commercials to check for e-mail.10. I will try leave the house at least once a week, whether it is necessary or not.11. I will remember that my bank is not forgiving if I forget to balance my chequebook because I was too busy on the Web.12. I will remember I must go to bed sometime...the Web will always be there tomorrow! My comments about the above rules, and how they'll never work for me. =====================================================================1. Drinking coffee ??!! Yeeuuurrkk !!! I hate coffee !! And reading the newspaper.. no way.. what a waste of a tree ! i can get the same information via the web.2. Who has time for breakfast these days ??? If i have time for breakfast, then i have time to sleep-in just a few minutes longer! -3. I don't even get up before noon!. - Some days i don't go to bed either!4. Cleaning the house ?? - That's womans work !.. That's why i get my brother to do it !.. He acts like an old woman sometimes. - Washing my clothes ? - Hell.. i only put these things on four days ago... there's at least another weeks wear i can get out of them before i think about washing them. Planning dinner? For me that is remembering where i put the Dial-a-kebab leaflet...5. I can't write properly, my joined up writing is illegible, even i have trouble reading it sometimes. As for having friends who don't own a computer.. well.. last time i saw them was the day before i left college... in the late 1980's !6. As i said in reply (5), i don't know anyone who doesn't have access the the Web, Why would i want to contact someone who is technically challenged anyway??7. Ok.. i do still read books, but that is only during my lunch break, as they don't let staff use the works computers for surfing the web during the lunch time break, and calling the web via my laptop and my mobile phone costs an arm and a leg.8. Hell.. i don't have that problem... I have my own special sound-proofed room as my computer room, where i can cut-out all external noise coming from the rest of my house.9. I more likely to be tempted to go and check what's on the TV, while i wait for my e-mail to download.10. Leave the house ? - Don't you know all web addicts are really Agoraphobic, which is how they got to be a web addict in the first place !11. That one is no problem, with all this modern up-to-date internet banking, i can balance my chequebook while i am on the web.12.

The man just grunts. The usher says again ""Sir, if you don't move I will have to call the manager."" Again the man just grunts. So the usher goes to get the manager. the manager says ""Sir, if you don't move I will have to call the police, so I suggest you move"". But once again the man only grunts. So the manager calls the police. The police come and say to the man ""OK, what's your name?"" The man replies ""Joe"" Then the police officer says ""And Joe, where did you come from?"" The man painfully answers, ""the balcony""</p>
