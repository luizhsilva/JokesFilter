26000,"<p>There were two prostitutes , one was very beautiful and the other was ugly. The beautiful prostitute used to make around $1,000-$3,000  a month but the ugly one made around $10,000-$13,000.</p>
<p>Confused to why the fuck the ugly one made more money than her, the beautiful prostitute went to the ugly one and asked her. </p>
<p>"" Hey girl ! How are you? Looks like you're doing great ,you bought a new car and an apartment, where did you get the money ?"".</p>
<p>On this the ugly bitch replied. "" Actually I play games with my customer and so I earn a lot, maybe more than you . What I do with my customer is that when we have  intercourse I put a small firecracker in my pussy and when it blows up , I start shouting oh you blew up my pussy you bastard, scared that this may put them in trouble my customers end up paying me $500-$800  to get away"".</p>
<p>Hearing this, the beautiful blonde prostitute went to the shop<br /> to buy some firecrackers, but as the less power crackers were not available that day she bought a huge powerful firecracker and went to work.</p>
<p>While having intercourse she put the big bomb in her pussy and  it went off with a huge bang. Then the prostitute started shouting as planned "" You blew up my pussy ...You blew up my pussy"".</p>
<p>On this the customer replied ,"" You bitch, the hell with your pussy, where the fuck is my DICK "".</p>

26006,"<p>A couple had been married 15 years. One afternoon they were working in the garden together.</p>
<p>As the wife was bending over pulling weeds the husband said, ""Hey honey, you are getting fat. Your butt is getting huge. I bet it's as big as the gas grill now."" </p>
<p>The husband feeling he needed to prove his point, got a yardstick, measured the grill and then measured his wife's butt.</p>
<p>""Yep,"" he said, ""Just what I thought, just about the same size.""</p>
<p>The wife got very incensed and decided to let him do the gardening alone. She went inside and didn't speak to her husband the rest of the day.</p>

26009,"<p>Because Shakespeare was so deeply absorbed during the writing of his tragedies, he put almost impossible strains on his bladder. To make matters even worse, the tiny hooks and eyes that his tailor had placed on his pants slowed down the process considerably. So the playwright demanded that the tailor make larger hooks and eyes.After a few days of trial, the Bard reported back, ""Truly it's speedier these larger hooks and eyes, but still and all, when I'm in a hurry, it's not quick enough. So I want you to redesign my trousers using leather ties."" The tailor did exactly as he was told and Shakespeare jumped into the pants without delay.Exactly one week later, however, the playwright was back at his door.""Truly the leather straps are faster than those hooks and eyes, but even so it's still too slow. So I propose that you throw away the straps and just cut me a little hole.""The tailor bounced to his feet.""You ask for hooks, I give you hooks. You ask for straps, I give you straps. But holes? Holes! You of all people ought to know that . . . there's no holes, Bard!""</p>

<p>When they finally arrived at the airport, the driver wanted to avoid<br /> having a hassle with the passengers. Just to be sure he didn't have any<br /> trouble collecting, he planned on reducing the fare by one-half of his<br /> normal trip rate. He'd already had a long day, and didn't need the problem.</p>
<p>As the car finally came to a stop after a twenty minute drive to the<br /> airport, the driver said, ""O.K. We've arrived at the airport, and..."" </p>
<p>""What's your fare, mister?!"" the leader interrupted the driver rudely.<br /> ""And remember we are smart about you guys,"" he reminded the driver one<br /> more time.</p>
<p>""To show you guys how great I am to visitors of our fine city, I am going<br /> to charge you only $10. Normally, I'd charge at least $20.00 for your<br /> trip. Please pay that and we'll be square."" </p>

26041,"<p>Thursday November 21, 2002<br /> By KATE McCLARE </p>
<p>STOCKHOLM -- Idiots in the office are just as hazardous to your health as cigarettes, caffeine or greasy food, an eye-opening new study reveals. In fact, those dopes can kill you! </p>
<p>Stress is one of the top causes of heart attacks -- and working with stupid people on a daily basis is one of the deadliest forms of stress, according to researchers at Sweden's Lindbergh University Medical Center. </p>
<p>The author of the study, Dr. Dagmar Andersson, says her team studied 500 heart attack patients, and were puzzled to find 62 percent had relatively few of the physical risk factors commonly blamed for heart attacks. </p>
<p>""Then we questioned them about lifestyle habits, and almost all of these low-risk patients told us they worked with people so stupid they can barely find their way from the parking lot to their office. And their heart attack came less than 12 hours after having a major confrontation with one of these oafs. </p>
<p>""One woman had to be rushed to the hospital after her assistant shredded important company tax documents instead of copying them. A man told us he collapsed right at his desk because the woman at the next cubicle kept asking him for correction fluid -- for her computer monitor. </p>
<p>""You can cut back on smoking or improve your diet,"" Dr. Andersson says, ""but most people have very poor coping skills when it comes to stupidity -- they feel there's nothing they can do about it, so they just internalize their frustration until they finally explode."" </p>
<p>Stupid co-workers can also double or triple someone's work load, she explains. ""Many of our subjects feel sorry for the drooling idiots they work with, so they try to cover for them by fixing their mistakes. One poor woman spent a week rebuilding client records because a clerk put them all in the 'recycle bin' of her computer and then emptied it -- she thought it meant the records would be recycled and used again."" </p>

26044,"<p>************************* Chief Executive Officer Mattel, Inc. El Segundo, CA</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Listen you little troll, I've been helping you out every year, playing at being the perfect Christmas present, wearing skimpy bathing suits in frigid weather, and drowning in fake tea from one too many tea parties, and I hate to break it to ya, but IT'S DEFINITELY PAYBACK TIME! There had better be some changes around here this year, or I'm gonna call for a nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you won't wanna be around to smell it).</p>
<p>So, here's my 1997 resolution/wish list:</p>
<p>1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized sweatshirt. I'm sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these bathing suits gonna get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have nylon and velcro crawling up your butt?</p>
<p>2. Real underwear that can be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What bonehead at Mattel decided to cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my skin?!? It looks like cellulite!</p>
<p>3. A REAL man...maybe GI Joe. Hell, I'd take Tickle-Me Elmo over that wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend, Ken. And what's with that earring anyway? If I'm gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him (and me) anatomically correct.</p>
<p>4. Arms that actually bend so I can push the aforementioned Ken-wimp away once he is anatomically correct.</p>
<p>5. Breast reduction surgery. I don't care whose arm you have to twist, just get it done.</p>
<p>6. A sports bra. To wear until I get the surgery.</p>
<p>7. A new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don't cut it. How about a systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account exec!</p>
<p>8. A new, more 90s persona. Maybe ""PMS Barbie"", complete with a miniature container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips; ""Animal Rights Barbie"", with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake fur coat and handcuffs; or ""Stop Smoking Barbie"", sporting a removable Nicotrol patch and equipped with several packs of gum.</p>
<p>9. No more McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl.</p>
<p>10. Mattel stock options. It's been 37 years--I think I deserve it.</p>
<p>Ok, Mr CEO, that's it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I don't think these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can find yourself a new bimbo doll for next Christmas. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>

<p>The Psychologist replies with, ""very interesting."" He shows the next picture. ""And what is this a picture of?""</p>
<p>The man looks at it, turning it in different directions then says, ""That's a man and a woman on a bed making love.""</p>
<p>The Psychologists resumes with the third ink blot and asks, ""What is this a picture of?""</p>
<p>Again the patient turns it in all directions and replies, ""That's a man and a woman on a bed making love.""</p>

26076,"<p>The town fathers were looking for a way to increase attendance<br /> and participation at their regular meetings. One member<br /> suggested bringing in a hypnotist. The officials agreed. A<br /> famous hypnotist was hired. The event was publicized around<br /> town. Everyone was pleased.</p>

I specialised in ladies' underpants."" Barry proudly replied.So the lady looks it up in her big book and say, ""OK, you're eligible for $50 a week.""""Hot damn, you mean I don't gotta do nothin' and I can get $50 a week. Man, that even beats crawfishin'!"" Barry shouted.Then Thomas sat down and the lady asked him the same question. Thomas looked her straight in the eye and said, ""I was a diesel fitter.""She looked up in her big book again and said ""Very good then, you're eligible for $100 a week in unemployment benefits.""""WAIT A HOT DAMN MINUTE!"" Barry shouted. ""How come he gets $100 a week, and me, I only get $50. I told you I used to be a crotch stitcher; you know you gotta be real good to do that kind of work so the seams are all nice a straight and smooth so nothing scratches you down there. And Thomas here, he's only a diesel fitter. And he's gonna make twice than I'm making?""""Oh,"" the lady replied, ""but he's a skilled labourer with an education. Diesel fitters are in high demand especially by oilfields and heavy equipment users. There's not many diesel specialists around.""""Whoa, whoa, whoa, lady,"" Barry continued, ""you got it all wrong. Yeah, Thomas's a diesel fitter, all right.

26157,"<p>In a recent discussion, two things were mentioned that were supposed to be seductive to a woman:  -- having a guy paint her toe-nails  -- being able to tie a knot in a cherry stem with      one's tongueThe person who brought these activities up was reluctant to elaborate, so I emailed and chat-roomed a number of women, asking if they would explain. The following is the results of this informal survey: The Toe-Nail Thing...- I do know that some women love having their feet   played with (massaged, toe-painted, etc), but I'm not   one of those since my feet are too ticklish.- On the funny side: it puts the male in a submissive   position -- Down on their hands and knees. (I don't   really think that is it... but it sounds good.)- as a guess... i think it would 1) make a woman feel   special to have a man showing her such personal   attention, 2) show her the tender, slow care he can   provide, and 3) let her know he would do just about   anything for her. I dunno... I guess on my part that's   how i would take it.- taking the time to paint a woman's toenails   supposedly demonstrates sensitivity and caring...   In short, it's foreplay.- You got me! LOL- Did you see the movie ''bull Durham''? One of the guys   painted a woman's toenails.- a guy that paints his lady's toenails is someone who   adores his lady.. know where i can get me one?- Some women have a toe fetish. It is one of the   erogenous zones in some women. I'm one of them.   That's why the painted toenails... turns us on.- Well feet are very sensitive to the touch..and if   you're gentle enough..well its nice...good enough   answer for ya??- It's a cop out. It means she is too fat to bend over   and paint them herself. - Never heard of it. Maybe it's just being pampered by   someone else that's seductive.- I love to have attention paid to my feet, so that   would explain liking one's toe-nails being paintedThe Cherry-Stem Thing...- I figure it has something to do with being good with   one's tongue (I'm told I am), and the ''cherry'' thing   is just another reference to part of the female   anatomy?- I asked another female here at work. She didn't know   either but thought that it probably related to   certain sexual abilities.- As for the cherry stem, if you have to ask, you'll   never understand. *blush* I mean, what could you use   your tongue for that requires THAT kind of dexterity   and that even I would be too embarrassed to discuss!?- I think the old cliche about the cherry thing is your   prowess in oral sex....- well ...... the tying the knot in the cherry stem is   pretty obvious ...... that tells how talented you are   with your tongue ... I would say ......- something about the tongue movement.. i can do it...   and it would turn you on....- I'm gonna be blunt here ok..so bear w/me... the   cherry thing w/the tongue..well that just gives me   the idea or thought of what else the tongue can do..   hehe- It's very erotic...especially if I get to eat the   cherry prior to the tongue tying ceremony - a very   religious and sacred ceremony performed when one is   whooing another. It's just plain nutz!- If you can manage to pass that trait it does give   indication of your umm errr durability ... oh you   know what I mean. Like to see if the tongue has the   ''Proper'' motion techniques. - The cherry stem thing has to do with having a   flexible tongue (and I can tie one with mine). It's   the same question as ''Why do men get turned on   watching a women eat an ice-cream cone or a banana?''- I can tie a knot in a cherry stem -- haven't done it   in ages -- it's an old bar trick- the cherry stem thing... shows great tongue   control... and we ALL know what that means...</p>

26173,"<p>A big-city California lawyer went duck hunting in rural Texas. </p>
<p>He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence. </p>

<p>The old farmer replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here.""</p>

<p>The farmer replied, ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up.""</p>
<p>The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. </p>
<p>The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. </p>
<p>His second kick nearly wiped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on this belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up.</p>

<p>The old farmer smiled and said, ""No I give up, you can have the duck.</p>

<p>The first course was set in front of them and the Jewish couple announced, ""This is soup made with matzoh balls.""</p>
<p>On seeing the 2 large matzoh balls in the soup, the redneck man was hesitant to taste this strange looking brew. Gently, the Jewish couple urged him to, ""Just have a taste. If you don't like it, you don't have to finish it.""</p>
<p>Finally he agrees. He digs his spoon in, first picking up a small piece of matzoh ball with some soup in the spoon, and tasting it gingerly. The usual mmmm sound can be heard coming from somewhere deep in his chest, and he quickly finished the soup.</p>
<p>""That was delicious,"" he said, but I was wondering...<br /> ""Can you eat any other parts of the matzoh?""</p>

26198,"<p>Last week a very important meeting took place among God, the Pope and<br /> Moses. They were troubled because the President of the United States<br /> was behaving in an inappropriate manner and there were many people who<br /> saw nothing wrong in what he had done. They decided that the only<br /> course of action left was to create an 11th Commandment to get their<br /> message across. Now, the problem remained exactly how to word this new<br /> commandment so that it matched the other commandments in style and<br /> holy inspiration. After great meditation and discussion they<br /> concluded: ""Thou salt not comfort thy rod with thy staff.""</p>

26199,"<p>A guy goes into a bar and goes up to the bartender. He says ""I bet you 200 bucks I can piss in that glass in the corner and not spill a drop."" The bartender agreed knowing he could never do it. So the man goes into the corner and pisses all ove everything even the bartender. So he walks back to the laughing bartender and the bartender says ""I knew you couldn't do it."" The man replies, ""You can have your 200 dollars, I just bet those guys over there 2000 dollars that I could piss all over your place and you still would be laughing.""</p>

26200,"<p>A white guy is walking along a beach when he comes cross a lamp<br /> partially buried in the sand. He picks up the lamp and gives it<br /> a rub. Two genies appear and they tell him that he has been<br /> granted three wishes.</p>
<p>The guy makes his three wishes and the genies disappear. The<br /> next thing the guy knows, he's in a bedroom in a mansion<br /> surrounded by fifty beautiful women. He makes love to all of<br /> them and begins to explore the house. He feels something soft<br /> under his feet. He looks down and the whole floor is covered<br /> with $100 bills.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there's a knock at the door. He answers the door and<br /> standing there are two persons dressed in Ku Klux Klan outfits.<br /> They drag him outside to the nearest tree, throw a rope over a<br /> limb and hang him by the neck until he is dead. The Klansmen<br /> walk off.</p>
<p>As they are walking away they remove their hoods. It's the two<br /> genies. One genie says to the other one, ""Hey, I can understand<br /> the first wish of having all these beautiful women in a big<br /> mansion to make love to. I can also understand wanting to be a<br /> millionaire. But to be hung like a black man is beyond me!""</p>

26208,"<p>A man walks into the front door of a bar. He is obviously drunk, and staggers up to the bar, seats himself on a stool and, with a belch ,asks the bartender for a drink. The bartender politely informs the man that it appears that he has already had plenty to drink, he could not be served additional liquor at this bar, and could a cab be called for him? The drunk is briefly surprised, then softly scoffs, grumbles, climbs down off the bar stool and staggers out the front door. </p>
<p>A few minutes later, the same drunk stumbles in the SIDE door of the bar.He wobbles up to the bar and hollers for a drink. The bartender comes over and, still politely - but more firmly, refuses service to the man due to his inebriation, and again offers to call a cab. The drunk looks at the bartender for a moment angrily, curses, and shows himself out the side door, all the while grumbling and shaking his head. </p>
<p>A few minutes later, the same drunk bursts in through the BACK door of the bar. He plops himself up on a bar stool, gathers his wits and belligerently orders a drink. The bartender comes over and emphatically reminds the man that he is clearly drunk, will be served no drinks, and either a cab or the police will be called immediately. </p>
<p>The surprised drunk looks at the bartender, and in hopeless anguish, cries ""MAAAN! How many bars do you work at?</p>

26209,"<p>A little boy goes to his dad and asks, ""What is politics?"" </p>

<p>""Your Mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. </p>

<p>He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. </p>

<p>Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. </p>
<p>The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I Understand the concept of politics now."" </p>
<p>The father says, ""Good son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about."" </p>
<p>The little boy replies, ""Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored and the Future is in deep shit.""</p>

The man goes, ""No, go away.""<br /> Another five minutes pass, and the boy returns to him, asking a<br /> similar-yet-different question: ""What are those?""

Yet<br /> another five minutes pass, and the boy comes back. ""What is that<br /> hairy thing?,"" he asks.  The man begrudgingly says, ""That is the<br /> duck's nest.""

<p>""Welcome your holiness, your dedication and unselfishness in serving your fellow man during your life has earned you great stature in heaven. You may pass through the gates without delay and are granted free access to all parts of heaven.""</p>

<p>Are there perhaps any transcripts which recorded the Actual conversations between God and the prophets of old? I would love to see what was actually said, with-out the dimming of memories over time.""</p>

26243,"<p>One day a young man and woman were in their bedroom making love. All of a sudden a bumble bee entered the bedroom window. As the young lady parted her legs the bee entered her vagina. The woman started screaming, ""Oh my god, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!"". </p>
<p>The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation. The doctor thought for a moment and said, ""Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit"". </p>
<p>The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said ""OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my dick I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina."" </p>
<p>The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said ""Yes,yes, whatever, just get on with it."" </p>
<p>So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey,inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes,the doctor said, ""I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper"". </p>
<p>So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed. The young lady began to quiver with excitement, she began to moan and groan aloud, ""Oh doctor, doctor!"" she shouted. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself. </p>
<p>He then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises. </p>
<p>The husband, at this point, suddenly became very annoyed and shouted. ""Now wait a minute, what the hell do you think you're doing?!"" he blasted. </p>
<p>The doctor, still concentrating, replied: ""Change of plan, I'm gonna drown the bastard!!""</p>

26250,"<p>From the ""Say What?"" file -- true story: I'm taking two classes<br /> this semester, one of which is Public Policy. Our professor is an<br /> adjunct; nice lady, tries too hard. Anyway, a few weeks ago, we're<br /> covering a chapter on environmental politics, and she casts an<br /> overhead with facts and figures on some of the more powerful<br /> environmental lobbying groups. Among them is the Audubon Society.<br /> If you do not know what the Audubon Society is, then stop reading.</p>
<p>So one of the students asks, ""What is the Audubon Society?"" (Bird<br /> watchers, if you ignored my previous instructions.) To which the<br /> professor replies:</p>
<p>""I don't know, I think it's a group to protect that road in<br /> Germany.""</p>
<p>It hits me like a spear. ""She did not just say that, did she?"" I<br /> think to myself. I look up -- and she's serious.</p>
<p>""That's Auto-BAHN, not Audubon!"" I reply, only to be drowned out by<br /> the chorus of students in the back who are either laughing or<br /> yelling, ""Birds! Birds!""</p>
<p>""What?"" she says.</p>
<p>I reply, ""It's a group organized for the protection of birds.""</p>
<p>She stays silent for a moment, then responds, ""Well, what kind of<br /> bird is an audubon, is it a spotted owl or something?""</p>

26256,"<p>A newlywed farmer and his wife were visited by her mother, who immediately demanded an inspection of the place. The farmer had genuinely tried to be friendly to his new mother-in-law, hoping that it could be a friendly, non-antagonistic relationship. All to no avail though, as she kept nagging them at every opportunity, demanding changes, offering unwanted advice, and generally making life unbearable to the farmer and his new bride. While they were walking through the barn, during the forced inspection, the farmer's mule suddenly reared up and kicked the mother-in-law in the head, killing her instantly. It was a shock to all no matter their feelings toward her demanding ways...  At the funeral service a few days later, the farmer stood near the casket and greeted folks as they walked by. The pastor noticed that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he would nod his head yes and say something. Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, however, he would shake his head no, and mumble a reply. Very curious as to this bizarre behavior, the pastor later asked the farmer what that was all about. The farmer replied, 'The women would say, 'What a terrible tragedy' and I would nod my head and say 'Yes, it was.' The men would then ask, 'Can I borrow that mule?' and I would shake my head and say, 'Can't, it's all booked up for a year.''</p>

26308,"<p>Level 1:<br /> It's 11:00 on a weeknight, you've had a few beers. You get up to leave because<br /> you have work the next day and one of your friends buys another round. One of<br /> your unemployed friends. Here at level I you think to yourself, ""Oh come on,<br /> this is silly. Why, as long as I get seven hours of sleep (snap fingers), I'm<br /> cool."" </p>
<p>Level 2:<br /> It's midnight. You've had a few more beers. You've just spent 20 minutes<br /> arguing against artificial tuff. You get up to leave again, but at level<br /> 2, a little devil appears on your shoulder. And now you're thinking, ""Hey! I'm<br /> out with my friends! What am I working for anyway? These are the good times!<br /> Besides, as long as I get five hours sleep (snaps fingers), I'm<br /> Cool."" </p>
<p>Level 3:<br /> One in the morning. You've abandoned beer for tequila. You've just spent 20<br /> minutes arguing for artificial tuff. And now you're thinking, ""Our waitress is<br /> the most beautiful woman I've ever seen!"" At level 3, you love the world. On the<br /> way to the bathroom you buy a drink for the stranger at the end of the bar just<br /> because you like his face. You get drinking fantasies (like, ""Hey fellas, if we<br /> bought our own bar, we could live together forever. We could do it. Tommy, you<br /> could cook."") But at level 3, that devil is a little bit bigger.., and he's<br /> buying. And you're thinking<br /> ""Oh, come on, come on now. As long as I get three hours sleep.., and a<br /> complete change of blood (snaps fingers), I'm cool."" </p>
<p>Level 4:<br /> Two in the morning. And the devil is bartending. For last call, you ordered a<br /> bottle of rum and a Coke. You are artificial tutti. This time on your way to the<br /> bathroom, you punch the stranger at the end of the bar just because you don't<br /> like his face! And now you're thinking, ""Our busboy is the best looking man I've<br /> ever seen."" You and your friends decide to leave, right after you get thrown<br /> out, and one of you knows an at, er<br /> hours bar. And here, at level 4, you actually think to ourself, ""Well .... as<br /> long as I'm only going to get a few hours sleep anyway, I may as well .... stay<br /> up all night!!!! Yeah! That'd be good for me. I don't mind going to that board<br /> meeting looking like Keith Richards. Yeah, I'll turn that around, make it work<br /> for me. And besides, as long as I get 31 hours sleep tomorrow<br /> ................... cool. </p>
<p>Level 5:<br /> Five in the morning, alter unsuccessfully trying to get your money back at the<br /> tattoo parlor (""But I don't even know anybody named Ruby!!!""), you and your<br /> friends wind up across the state line in a bar with guys who have been in prison<br /> as recently as that morning. It's the kind of place where even the devil is<br /> going, ""Uh, I gotta turn in. I gotta be in Hell at nine.I've got that brunch<br /> with Hitler, I can't miss that."" At this point,<br /> you're ail drinking some kind of thick blue liquor, like something from a<br /> Klingon wedding. A waitress with fresh stitches comes over, and you think to<br /> yourself, ""Someday I'm gonna marry that girl!"" One of your friends stands up and<br /> screams, ""We're drivin' to floridaf Y!!!""- and passes out.<br /> You crawl outside for air, and then you hit the worst part of level 5 -<br /> the sun. You weren't expecting that were you? You never do. You walk out or a<br /> bar in day light, and you see people on their way to work, or jogging. And they<br /> look at you-and they know. And they say... ""Who's Ruby?"" Let's be honest, if<br /> you're 19 and you stay up ail night, it's like a victory, like you've beat the<br /> night.., but if you're over 27, then that sun is like God's flashlight. We all<br /> say the same prayer then, ""I swear, I will never do this again (how long?) as<br /> long as I live!"" And some of us have that little addition, ""and this time, I<br /> mean it!""</p>

26311,"<p>[Some of these ideas are news to me, so I've decided to share...  however I do not vouch for their accuracy]DID YA KNOW?Why do dimes, quarters and half dollars have notched edges, while pennies and nickels do not? The US Mint began putting notches on the edges of coins containing gold and silver to discourage holders from shaving off small quantities of the precious metals. Dimes, quarters and half dollars are notched because they used to contain silver. Pennies and nickels aren't notched because the metals they contain are not valuable enough to shave.Why do Xs at the end of a letter signify kisses? In the Middle Ages, when many people were unable to read or write. Documents were often signed using an X. Kissing the X represented an oath to fulfill obligations specified in the document. The X and the kiss eventually became synonymous.Why is shifting responsibility to someone else called ""passing the buck""? In card games, it was once customary to pass an item, called a buck, from player to player to indicate whose turn it was to deal. If a player did not wish to assume the responsibility, he would pass the buck"" to the next player.Why do people clink their glasses before drinking a toast? It used to be common for someone to try to kill an enemy by offering him a poisoned drink. To prove to a guest that a drink was safe, it became customary for a guest to pour a small amount of his drink into the glass of the host. Both men would drink it simultaneously. When a guest trusted his host, he would then touch -- or clink -- the host's glass with his own.Why are people in the public eye said to be ""in the limelight""? Invented in 1825, limelight was used in lighthouses and stage lighting by burning a cylinder of lime in an oxyhydrogen flame that produced a brilliant light. In the theater, performers on stage in the ''limelight"" were seen by the audience to be the center of attention.Why do ships and aircraft in trouble use ""mayday"" as their call for help? This comes from the French word m'aidez - meaning ""help me"" - and is pronounced ""mayday."" (Note: not exactly.... it's pronounced ""med-ay"", but close enough)Why are zero scores in tennis called ""love""? In France, where tennis first became popular, a big, round zero on the scoreboard looked like an egg and was called l'oeuf, which is French for ""egg"". When tennis was introduced in the US, Americans pronounced it ""love,""Why are many coin banks shaped like pigs? Long ago, dishes and cookware in Europe were made of a dense, orange clay called pygg. When people saved coins in jars made of this clay, the jars became know as ""pygg banks"". When an English potter misunderstood the word, he made a bank that resembled a pig. And it caught on!</p>

He decided to stop at the next city he came to, and park somewhere quiet so he could get an hour or two of sleep. As luck would have it, the quiet place he chose happened to be on one of the city's major jogging routes. No sooner had he settled back to snooze when there came a knocking on his window. He looked out and saw a jogger running in place. ""Yes?"" ""Excuse me, sir,"" the jogger said, ""do you have the time?"" The man looked at the car clock and answered, ""8:15"". The jogger said thanks and left. The man settled back again, and was just dozing off when there was another knock on the window and another jogger. ""Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?"" ""8:25!"" The jogger said thanks and left. Now the man could see other joggers passing by and he knew it was only a matter of time before another one disturbed him. To avoid the problem, he got out a pen and paper and put a sign in his window saying, ""I do not know the time!"" Once again he settled back to sleep. He was just dozing off when there was another knock on the window. ""Sir, sir? It's 8:45!.""</p>

<p>MESSAGE FROM CORPORATE (Any Corporate)<br /> TO: ALL MEXICAN STAFF<br /> FROM: HUMAN RESOURCES<br /> RE: IMPROPER LANGUAGE USAGE<br /> DATE: NOVEMBER 05, 2001</p>
<p>Several corporate officers have brought to our attention that Mexican staff commonly uses inappropriate language. Such behavior, in addition to violating Company Policy # 23.2, is regarded as highly unprofessional and offensive. Therefore, from this date forward, everyone concerned should immediately adhere to the following rules:</p>
<p>1. Words like 'carajo', 'chingada' and other such expressions will not be used for emphasis, no matter how heated the discussion might be.</p>
<p>2. You will not say 'pendejo' or 'la cagas', when somebody is being reprimanded, or 'que pendejada' or 'que mamadas son estas' when a major mistake or conflict has risen. All forms derived of the verbs, 'pendejear', 'mamar' or 'cagar' are unsuitable in our environment, for they lead to further confusion and potential disagreement.</p>
<p>3. No Manager, Director, or least Vice-President under any circumstances will be referred to as 'hijo de su chingada madre', 'hijo de puta', 'cabr�n' or 'ojete'.</p>
<p>4. Lack of determination will not be referred to as 'falta de huevos', 'pinche puto' or 'maric�n', nor will persons with lack of initiative be referred as 'culero' or 'pendejo'.</p>
<p>5. Unusual creative or original ideas should not be referred to as 'pinches jaladas'.</p>
<p>6. Do not say 'como chinga' or 'jode' if a person is persistent, or 'est� jodido' if a colleague is going through a difficult situation, or his or her department's position is untenable or ill-conceived. Furthermore, you must not say 'que chinga' when matters turn complicated.</p>
<p>7. When asking someone to leave you alone, you must not say 'vete a la chingada' or 'vete al carajo', do not ever substitute 'May I help you' with '�qu� chingados quieres?'. When things get-tough and unacceptable, and statement such as 'We are going through a difficult time' should be used rather than: 'esto est� de la chingada'.</p>
<p>8.Performance Management sessions with staff should never be referred to as 'esto ya mam�'.</p>
<p>9.If you make a mistake just say so, and not say 'ya la cagu�' or 'ya me llev� la chingada' when your Direct Reports get to know about your mistakes.</p>
<p>10.Under no circumstance should you call our staff members who are approaching retirement as 'rucos ojetes'.</p>
<p>11.When in a hurry never use expressions such as '�ndale, cabr�n' or 'orale, pinches putos'.</p>
<p>12. The statement 'te la pelas' should not be used to discourage someone.</p>
<p>13. 'Nos la pelaron los pinches gringos' should not be used to convey the idea of victory in a negotiation.</p>
<p>14. Body language like the one used by Mexican Senator Roque Villanueva is prohibited.</p>
<p>15. When a problem is not your responsibility, you must not say 'no es mi pedo', for there is not an accurate translation of the statement in our language</p>
<p>Thanks and have a nice day.</p>

26329,"<p>41 Rules Men Wish Women Knew1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. 2. Learn to work the toilet seat: if it's up put it down. 3 . Don't cut your hair. Ever. 4. Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if he can find the perfect present, again! 5. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear. 6. Sometimes, he's not thinking about you. Live with it. 7. Don't ask him what he's thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lent, the shotgun formation and monster trucks. 8. Get rid of your cat. And no, it's not different, it's just like every other cat. 9. Dogs are better than ANY cats. Period. 10. Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be. 11. Shopping is not sport. 12. Anything you wear is fine. Really. 13. You have enough clothes. 14. You have too many shoes. 15. Crying is blackmail. Use it if you must, but don't expect us to like it. 16. Your brother is an idiot, your ex-boyfriend is an idiot and your Dad probably is too. 17. Ask for what you want. Subtle hints don't work. 18. No, he doesn't know what day it is. He never will. Mark anniversaries on a calendar. 19. Yes, pissing standing up is more difficult than peeing from point blank range. We're bound to miss sometimes. 20. Most guys own two to three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress? 21. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers. 22. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor. 23. Your Mom doesn't have to be our best friend. 24. Foreign films are best left to foreigners. 25. Check your oil. 26. Don't give us 50 rules when 25 will do. 27. Don't fake it. We'd rather be ineffective than deceived. 28. It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together. 29. Anything we said 6 or 8 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments become null and void after 7 days. 30. If you don't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys. 31. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad and angry, we meant the other one. 32. Let us ogle. If we don't look at other women, how can we know how pretty you are? 33. Don't rub the lamp if you don't want the genie to come out. 34. You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done not both. 35. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials. 36. Christopher Columbus didn't need directions, and neither do we. 37. Women wearing Wonderbras and low-cut blouses lose their right to complain about having their boobs stared at. 38. Consider Golf a mini-vacation from you. We need it, just like you do. 39. Telling us that the models in the men's magazines are airbrushed makes you look jealous and petty and it's certainly not going to deter us from reading the magazines. 40. The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out. 41. Anyone can buy condoms.</p>

<p>Dear Mom,</p>
<p>It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm telling you thatI have eloped with my new boyfriend.</p>
<p>I'll admit I guess I was attracted to him for all the wrong reasons, with all his piercing, tattoos, and his big motorcycle.</p>
<p>I know what we have together is true love, real passion and he is so nice to me.</p>
<p>But not only that Mom, I'm pregnant and Ahmed said that we will be very happy in his trailer in the woods. </p>
<p>He wants to have many more children with me and that's one of my dreams. </p>
<p>I've learned that marijuana doesn't hurt anyone and we'll be growing it for us and his friends, who are providing us with all the cocaine and ecstasies we may want. </p>
<p>In the meantime, we'll pray for the scientists to find the AIDS cure, for Ahmed to get better, he deserves it. </p>
<p>Don't worry Mom, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself.  Just please try to be happy for me. </p>
<p>Some day we'll visit so you can get to know your grandchildren, I promise.</p>
<p>Your daughter, Judith</p>
<p>PS: Mom, none of the above is true. I'm at the neighbor's house. I just wanted to show you that there are worse things in life than the report card that's in my desk drawer...<br /> I love you! </p>

What do you do for a living?'' ''I drive a truck, and the smell is just from the computers I'm hauling.'' ''Okay, truck drivers are not nerds,'' he says and serves him a beer. As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in with tape around his glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver is totally shocked. ''Why did you do that?'' ''Not to worry, the nerds are overpopulating Silicon Valley and are in season now. You don't even need a license.'' The truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads back onto the freeway. Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, grabbing up the computers.They are all engineers, accountants, and programmers wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen. He can't let them steal his whole load. So, remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, felling several of them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop. ''What's wrong? I thought nerds were in season,"" says the truck driver. ''Well, sure,'' says the patrolman. ''But you can't bait 'em.''</p>

26361,"<p>Jesus and Satan were having an ongoing argument about who was better on his computer. They had been going at it for days, and God was tired of hearing all of the bickering.Finally God said, ""Pipe down now, Satan. I am going to set up a test that will run two hours and I will judge who does the better job.""So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away. They moused. They did spreadsheets. They wrote reports. They sent faxes. They sent e-mail. They sent out e-mail with attachments. They downloaded. They did some genealogy reports. They made cards. They did every known job. But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every bad word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed. The electricity finally flickered back on and each of them restarted their computers.Satan started searching frantically, screaming ""It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!""Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became irate.""Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?""God shrugged and said, ""Jesus saves.""</p>

26364,"<p>Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the ""in-flight safety lecture"" and their other announcements a bit more entertaining. Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:</p>
<p>""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane..."" </p>
<p>Pilot - ""Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land ... it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern."" </p>
<p>And, after landing: ""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride."" </p>
<p>As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella. WHOA!"" </p>
<p>After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: ""Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as Hell everything has shifted."" </p>
<p>From a Southwest Airlines employee.... ""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt, and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love more. </p>
<p>Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest Airlines."" </p>
<p>""As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses."" </p>
<p>""Last one off the plane must clean it."" </p>
<p>And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry ...Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...! </p>
<p>Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City: The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, ""That was quite a bump and I know what ya'll are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendants' fault.....it was the asphalt!"" </p>
<p>Another flight Attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal."" </p>
<p>After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant came on with, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal. </p>
<p>Part of a Flight Attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of us here at US Airways.""</p>

<p>Matt, on the other hand, whips out his wallet, pulls out a couples of singles and gladly hands them over to the beggar with a smile. </p>
<p>The beggar thanks him kindly and then continues on to the other passengers. Frank is outraged by his friend's act of generosity. </p>
<p>""What on earth did you do that for?"" shouts Frank. ""You know he's only going to use it on drugs or booze."" </p>
<p>Matt replies, ""And we weren't?""</p>

<p>""I will give each of you each one wish. That's three wishes<br /> total,"" says the genie. </p>
<p>The Canadian says, ""I'm a farmer, my dad was a farmer, and my<br /> son will also farm. I want the land to be forever fertile in<br /> Canada."" </p>
<p>With a blink of the genie's eye, *POOF* the land in Canada was<br /> forever made fertile for farming. </p>
<p>Bin Laden was amazed, so he said, ""I want a wall around<br /> Afghanistan, so that no infidels, Jews, or Americans can come<br /> into our precious state."" </p>
<p>Again, with a blink of the genie's eye, *POOF* there was a huge<br /> wall around Afghanistan. </p>
<p>""Uncle Sam"" (A former civil engineer), asks, ""I'm very curious.<br /> Please tell me more about this wall."" </p>
<p>The Genie explains, ""Well, it's about 15,000 feet high, 500 feet<br /> thick, and completely surrounds the country; nothing can get in<br /> or out - it's virtually impenetrable."" </p>
<p>Uncle Sam says, ""Fill it with water.""</p>

26369,"<p>En la parada del autob�s, un nutrido grupo espera, en apretada l�nea, su turno subir al veh�culo. Entonces, le llega el turno a una bella joven que viste botas altas y una chaqueta a juego con una peque�a minifalda de cuero. La chica se percata que el escal�n de acceso al autob�s es tan alto, que la mini le va a impedir subir. Sonrojada por la pena, se lleva las manos atr�s, buscando la cremallera, la localiza, la baja un tanto y se dispone a subir. �Nada! Todav�a la falda le impide levantar la pierna para alcanzar el escal�n.</p>
<p>Avergonzada, mira al chofer, sonr�e t�midamente y, de nuevo, se lleva las manos atr�s y baja un poco m�s la cierre. Pese a todo, todav�a la minifalda le impide levantar la pierna para subir.</p>
<p>La gente que espera en l�nea comienza a incomodarse y a protestar. En aquel momento, el fornido tipo que esperaba su turno detr�s de ella, la toma por la cintura, y con facilidad la sube al �mnibus como si fuera una pluma. La muchacha, furiosa, se vuelve al desconocido y le increpa:</p>
<p>""�C�mo se atreve a tocarme, descarado! �Yo no s� qui�n es usted, fresco!""</p>
<p>Y el hombret�n, encogi�ndose de hombros, le responde:</p>

26370,"<p>We've all been interviewed for jobs. And, we've all spent most<br /> of those interviews thinking about what not to do. Don't bite<br /> your nails. Don't fidget. Don't interrupt. Don't belch. If we<br /> did any of the don'ts, we knew we'd disqualify ourselves<br /> instantly. But some job applicants go light years beyond this.<br /> We surveyed top personnel executives of 100 major American<br /> corporations and asked for stories of unusual behavior by job<br /> applicants. The lowlights:</p>
<p>1. ""... stretched out on the floor to fill out the job<br /> application.""</p>
<p>2. ""She wore a Walkman and said she could listen to me and the<br /> music at the same time.""</p>
<p>3. ""A balding candidate abruptly excused himself. Returned to<br /> office a few minutes later, wearing a hairpiece.""</p>
<p>4. ""... asked to see interviewer's resume to see if the<br /> personnel executive was qualified to judge the candidate.""</p>
<p>5. ""... announced she hadn't had lunch and proceeded to eat a<br /> hamburger and french fries in the interviewer's office - wiping<br /> the ketchup on her sleeve""</p>
<p>6. ""Stated that, if he were hired, he would demonstrate his<br /> loyalty by having the corporate logo tattooed on his forearm.""</p>
<p>7. ""Interrupted to phone his therapist for advice on answering<br /> specific interview questions.""</p>
<p>8. ""When I asked him about his hobbies, he stood up and started<br /> tap dancing around my office.""</p>
<p>9 . ""At the end of the interview, while I stood there<br /> dumbstruck, went through my purse, took out a brush, brushed his<br /> hair, and left.""</p>
<p>10. ""... pulled out a Polaroid camera and snapped a flash<br /> picture of me. Said he collected photos of everyone who<br /> interviewed him.""</p>
<p>11. ""Said he wasn't interested because the position paid too<br /> much.""</p>
<p>12. ""While I was on a long-distance phone call, the applicant<br /> took out a copy of Penthouse, and looked through the photos<br /> only, stopping longest at the centerfold.""</p>
<p>13. ""During the interview, an alarm clock went off from the<br /> candidate's brief case. He took it out, shut it off, apologized<br /> and said he had to leave for another interview.""</p>
<p>14. ""A telephone call came in for the job applicant. It was from<br /> his wife. His side of the conversation went like this: ""'Which<br /> company? When do I start? What's the salary?' I said, 'I assume<br /> you're not interested in conducting the interview any further.'<br /> He promptly responded, 'I am as long as you'll pay me more.' I<br /> didn't hire him, but later found out there was no other job<br /> offer. It was a scam to get a higher offer.""</p>
<p>15. ""His attache [case] opened when he picked it up and the<br /> contents spilled, revealing ladies' undergarments and assorted<br /> makeup and perfume.""</p>
<p>16. ""Candidate said he really didn't want to get a job, but the<br /> unemployment office needed proof that he was looking for one.""</p>
<p>17. ""... asked who the lovely babe was, pointing to the picture<br /> on my desk. When I said it was my wife, he asked if she was home<br /> now and wanted my phone number. I called security.""</p>
<p>18. ""Pointing to a black case he carried into my office, he said<br /> that if he was not hired, the bomb would go off. Disbelieving, I<br /> began to state why he would never be hired and that I was going<br /> to call the police. He then reached down to the case, flipped a<br /> switch and ran. No one was injured, but I did need to get a new<br /> desk.""</p>

<p>STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE (Episode V + VI to come)</p>
<p>Q: Why do the Stormtroopers wear that clumsy body armor, if it doesn't stop<br />    laser blasts?<br /> A: Because they've indoctrinated the entire population to be scared<br />    shitless of people in white armor. </p>
<p>Q: How does the Death Star travel move from system to system?<br /> A: A real big rubber band. </p>
<p>Q: Why does Death Star have that trench around it?<br /> A: That's where the rubber band fits. </p>
<p>Q: If Darth Vader was strong with the force, how come he didn't notice Han<br />    Solo coming to shoot him near the end?<br /> A: He was busy trying to figure out how come the kid in the X-wing seemed<br />    so familiar. </p>
<p>Q: Why can Death Star's prison doors be opened without a key of any kind?<br /> A: Everyone aboard the Death Star is on the same side. </p>
<p>Q: Why was Luke carrying around a string with a hook on the end in the<br />    first place?<br /> A: It came with his stormtrooper armor; their equipment belts are sort of<br />    like Swiss Army knives. </p>
<p>Q: Why doesn't Chewie get a medal at the end?<br /> A: Official explanation, from the old Official Star Wars Fan Club: medals<br />    are against his religion. </p>
<p>Q: How does Han consider Chewie? Sometimes he treats him like a human, and<br />    other times like a pet (patting him on the head)?<br /> A: It would seem Lucas couldn't make up his mind. Several early drafts of<br />    the script include descriptions like ""Chewbacca and his master."" I once<br />    read a fan-fiction story that included a conversation between Han Solo<br />    and Harrison Ford. At one point, Ford asked about Han's relationship<br />    with Chewie; the response was, ""Nothing like that, we're just good<br />    friends."" </p>

26384,"<p>To manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  Derived from FROBNITZ.<br /> Usually abbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying ""to frob a<br /> frob"".  See TWEAK and TWIDDLE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK<br /> sometimes connote points along a continuum.  FROB connotes aimless<br /> manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse<br /> search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is<br /> turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it<br /> he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the<br /> screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because<br /> turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.</p>

26429,"<p>A man walks into a bar and says, ''Bartender, give me two shots. One for me and one for my best buddy.'' Bartender says, ''You want them both now or do you want me to wait until your buddy arrives to pour his?'' The guy says, ''Oh, I want them both now. I've got my best buddy in my pocket here.'' He then pulls a little 3 inch man out of his pocket. The bartender asks, ''You mean to say, he can drink that much?'' ''Oh, sure. He can drink it all and then some,'' the man retorted. So, the bartender pours the 2 shots and sure enough, the little guy drinks it all up. ''That's amazing!'' says the bartender. ''What else can he do? Can he walk?'' The man flicks a quarter down to the end of the bar and says, ''Hey, Rodney, go fetch that quarter.'' The little guy runs down to the end of the bar, picks up the quarter and runs back down and gives it to the man. The bartender is in total shock. ''That's amazing!'' he says. ''What else can he do? Does he talk?'' The man looks up at the bartender with a look of surprise in his eye and says, ''Talk? Sure he talks. Hey, Rodney, tell him about that time we were in down in Africa, on safari, hunting and you called that native Witch doctor a dickhead!''</p>

26432,"<p>Remember, smoking doesn�t kill people. People who are trying to quit smoking kill people.</p>

He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are SHOWING because it's a picture of his profile!!

""Well, that's an interesting answer...wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that.""He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file in his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

26449,"<p>Once upon a time, a few years before all those nasty divorces, Her Royal Majesty, the Queen of England and Lady Di were out for a drive in one of the Queen's Range Rovers. Suddenly some armed robbers leaped out of the bushes and stopped the car.'Give us the money' they shouted at the Queen.'But I'm the Queen of England, I have no need for money, thus I never carry any.''Oh, blimey', said the leader of the armed band, and turned to Lady Di.'Give us yer jewels.''But I don't wear my jewels all the time, only on state occasions.'The armed robbers looked fed up when suddenly they heard the sound of wailing sirens approaching.  'Quick, out of the car.  We'll have the Range Rover at least', and with that the robbers drove off.As the Queen and Di are waiting for the police to get there, Di turns to the Queen, and asks: 'So, what did you do to all the cash you had?  You're always loaded.''Ah,' said the Queen, 'I saw the robbers and in the few seconds before they got to the car I rolled up my notes and tucked them into that little place that women have.  Reaching under her skirt, she produced several thousand pounds in notes.'And what did you do with your jewels?  You always wear lots of jewelery, my dear' the Queen says to Di.'Well, like you, in those few seconds before the robbers got to the car, I slipped off my rings, necklaces and tiara, and like you, slipped them into that little place that only women have.' Reaching down, she plucks out her jewelery.They both smile, knowingly at each other.  After sitting quietly for a few moments, the Queen turned to Di, and with all the grace and dignity one should expect of the Queen of the British Empire, said: says 'You know, if Fergie had been with us, we would still have that Range Rover.'</p>

26460,"<p>Dan Quail does not support Viagra. Quote: ""I've been using this stuff for a week and NOTHING! It's the worst suppository I've ever used."" Men taking iron supplements are warned that taking Viagra may cause them to spin around and point north. Rumor has it that when a truck carrying a load of Viagra slid off into the Ohio River, all the lift bridges suddenly went up. New plans are being made to raise the Titanic. Experts plan to pump it full of Viagra, and expect it to raise right up. For years the medical professional has been looking after the ill, to make them better. Now, with Viagra, they're raising the dead! The difference between Niagara and Viagra? Niagara Falls. It's been said that if you take Viagra and Propecia (or use Rogain) at the same time, things work great -- but you look like Don King, afterward. A Viagra delivery truck was high-jacked: The police are looking for two 'hardened criminals'. They expect a stiff penalty under the penal code. Unconfirmed but frequent reports tell us that a man who overdosed on Viagra caused the funeral home problems - they couldn't close his coffin lid for 3 days. Even so, we're told that the funeral home industry is happy about Viagra overdoses: Lots of new stiffs means an upswing in business.</p>

26468,"<p>Dear Sister,</p>
<p>This letter was started by a woman in the hope of bringing relief to other tired and discontented females. Unlike other chain letters,this one does not cost anything. Just send a copy to 5 of your friends who are equally tired and discontented,then bundle up your husband/boyfriend.</p>
<p>Send him to the woman whose name appears at the top of the list and add your name to the bottom of the list. When your name  comes to the top of the list you will receive 16,877 men and one of them is bound to be a hell of a lot better than the one you already have.</p>
<p>Do not break the chain.<br /> One woman broke the chain and got her own bastard back.<br /> At this writing a friend of mine has already received 184 men.<br /> They buried her yesterday,but it took 3 undertakers 36 hours to wipe the smile off her face and 3 days to get her legs together to close the coffin.</p>
<p>Have faith!<br /> Liberated woman...</p>

26480,"<p>Dear Tech Support, </p>
<p>Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a slow down in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 un-installed many other valuable programs such as Romance 9.9, but installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? </p>
<p>Desperate </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>Dear Desperate, </p>
<p>First, keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try to enter the command C:/I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and install Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create SnoringLoudly.WAV files. DO NOT install Mother-In-Law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. </p>
<p>In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9. </p>
<p>Good luck, </p>

<li>So many of our politicians want to be known as miracle workers -- it IS a miracle when they work. But that's not entirely fair. Most do put in a good day's work -- every week.</li>
<li>And look at Clinton, personally responsible for a resurgence of religion in America. Never has the phrase, ""Oh my Dear God !!!"" been heard from so many, and so often, since he took office.</li>
<li>And y'all wonder how these guys get caught in so many scandals ? Hell, haven't you ever heard the expression 'exercise discretion' ? Politicians think it involves some kind of physical effort.</li>
<li>For those not in the US, we can watch a lot of the proceedings on TV now. In fact, that's how I stay so slim. I tune in often and just let my flesh crawl.</li>
<li>As for all these campaign contribution charges and counter-charges, it just proves once again that the United States currently has the very best President and Vice-President that money can buy.</li>
<li>People outside the US often wonder how you become a Republican. Well, two ways generally, most are because their Fathers were before them; others are because their Fathers were Democrats.</li>
<li>Congress polices itself though. One representative banked five times his salary in just two years. He's currently being investigated to see what in the world took him so long.</li>

26512,"<p>A friend and I were standing in line at a fast-food restaurant, waiting to<br /> place our order.</p>
<p>There was a big sign posted. ""No bills larger than $20 will be accepted."" </p>
<p>The woman in front of us, pointing to the sign, remarked, ""Believe me, if I<br /> HAD a bill larger than $20, I wouldn't be eating here.""</p>

26513,"<p>After a very successful career, a former Human Relations guru found herself at the pearly gates. </p>
<p>""Welcome to Heaven,"" said St.Peter. ""Before you get settled in though, it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we've never once had a Human Resources Director make it this far, and we're not really sure what to do with you, so what we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in."" </p>
<p>With that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and went down to hell. The doors opened, and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with - and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up, kissed her and talked about old times. </p>
<p>They played an excellent round of golf, and at night went to the country club, where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil, who was </p>
<p>actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and </p>
<p>waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. </p>
<p>The elevator went up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates, and she found St. Peter waiting for her. ""Now it's time to spend a day in heaven,"" he said. So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a </p>
<p>great time, and before she knew it, her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her and asked her to choose. </p>
<p>The woman paused for a second and then replied, ""Well, I never thought I'd say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."" So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went down-down-down back to Hell. </p>
<p>When the doors of the elevator opened, she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She </p>
<p>saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her. </p>
<p>""I don't understand,"" stammered the woman, ""yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and a country club and we ate </p>
<p>lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now, all there is is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable."" </p>
<p>The Devil looked at her and smiled. ""Yesterday, we were recruiting you, today you're staff.""</p>

26515,"<p>A man sees an advert for a pianist job in a hotel, and is<br /> interested. He aproaches the receptionist in the hotel, and<br /> says, ""I want to see the fucking manager"".  The receptionists<br /> requests the man not to use such language in the hotel, but<br /> tells him he will go and get the manager.<br /> So the receptionist introduces the man to the manager. ""I'm here<br /> for the fucking pianist job"". Once again the man is requesed not<br /> to use such language.<br /> The manager asks if the pianist can play any classical music.<br /> The pianist replays, ""Can I play classical"" and sits down at the<br /> piano and plays the best classical music you've ever heard.<br /> The manager is impressed, and asks for the name of the song, to<br /> which the pianist replys, ""I was sitting in the garden with my<br /> bitch and the moonlight was shining off her nipples"".<br /> The manager is a little bit startled, but continues to ask the<br /> pianist if he could play any blues. The man replys, ""Can<br /> I play blues"" and goes on to play the greatest bluse you've ever<br /> heard. Again the manger asks what the song was called, and the<br /> pianist replys, ""I bent her over the table and rammed her up the<br /> arse"".<br /> Once again the manger was startled, however the pianist was<br /> amazing so he offered the man the job on two conditions. He was<br /> not allowed to speak to any guests, and he wasn't allowed to<br /> introduce any of his songs. The man thought for a while but<br /> finally agreed.<br /> Things were going fine for the first week, until a gorgeous<br /> looking woman entered the restaurant at the hotel. The pianist<br /> wanted to speak to her but at the same time he wanted to keep<br /> his job. So instead he went of to the toilet for a wank. Half<br /> way through he heard the manager call out, ""Where is that<br /> pianist"", so he just stopped what he was doing and ran back to<br /> the piano and started playing again.<br /> A few minutes later the woman approached the pianist and said,<br /> ""do you know your flys are undone, your cocks hanging out and<br /> your dripping cum all over your shoes"", to which the pianist<br /> quickly replys, ""do I know it? I fucking wrote the song!""</p>

26516,"<p>There was an old man whom, though loved by his son, was being put into an old-folks home because the son could not provide the round-the-clock care the old man required.</p>
<p>""Don't leave me here to die alone here!"" the old man said, when the day finally came.</p>
<p>""Now dad,"" said the son, ""we discussed this, and you know its the best thing for you. I'll visit twice a week, and you can always pick up the phone and give me a call.""</p>
<p>So the son left, and the old man was put to bed.  He immediately grabbed the phone and called his son. ""You've got to come get me.  This is a terrible place; the nurses all ignore me, the food's terrible, and I'm so alone!""</p>
<p>""Now Dad, I just left you half an hour ago. How can you tell in only 30 minutes what the place is like? Stay there a few more days, and if it's really that bad, we'll have to work something out.""</p>
<p>So the old man hung up, and eventually found his way to sleep. The next morning, the nurse woke him, and began to give him an in-bed sponge bath. Much to the old man's surprise, the attention caused him to become erect, so the nurse sponged his penis, and then gave him one of the best blowjobs of his life.</p>
<p>As soon as the nurse left, the old man called his son. ""Son, this is one great place you've found for me! The food's great, the company is excellent, and I've never been happier!""</p>
<p>""That's great news, Dad, I hoped you'd come to like the place once you'd given it a chance.""</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, the old man was walking through the television room when he tripped and fell. Another resident of the home came over to the old man, lifted up his robe, and buggered him from behind, mercilessly.</p>
<p>When the old man got back to his room, he immediately grabbed the phone and called his child, ""Son, Son, you've got to get me out of this place! Right Now!""</p>
<p>""But Dad, a few hours ago, you thought this was a great place to be, now, I've got to run over there and get you?""</p>
<p>""Son, you don't understand, I get an erection, maybe, once a year, but I fall down two or three times a day!""</p>

26539,"<p>GRAVITY KILLSA 22-year-old Reston man was found dead yesterday after he tried to use accessory straps (the stretchy little ropes with hooks on each end) to bungee jump off a 70-foot railroad trestle, police said. Fairfax County police said Eric A. Barcia, a fast-food worker, taped a bunch of these straps together, wrapped an end around one foot, anchored the other end to the trestle at Lake Accotink Park, jumped ... and hit the pavement. Warren Carmichael, a police spokesman, said investigators think Barcia was alone because his car was found nearby. ""The length of the cord that he had assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the ground."" Police say the apparent cause of death was ""major trauma"".

26566,"<p>In an issue of Meat &amp; Poultry magazine, editors quoted from ""Feathers,"" the publication of the California Poultry Industry Federation, telling the following story: </p>
<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration has a unique device for testing the strength of windshields on airplanes. The device is a gun that launches a dead chicken at a plane's windshield at approximately the speed the plane flies. The theory is that if the windshield doesn't crack from the carcass impact, it'll survive a real collision with a `ird during flight. </p>
<p>It seems the British were very interested in this and wanted to test a windshield on a brand new, speedy locomotive they're developing. They borrowed FAA's chicken launcher,loaded the chicken and fired. The ballistic chicken shattered the windshield, broke the engineer's chair and embedded itself in the back wall of the engine's cab. </p>
<p>The British were stunned and asked the FAA to recheck the test to see if everything was done correctly. The FAA reviewed the test thoroughly and had one recommendation: Use a thawed chicken.</p>

The angel reappears<br /> and informs the man that God has decided to allow him to take one suitcase with<br /> him. Overjoyed, the man gathers his largest suitcase and fills it with pure gold<br /> bars and places it beside his bed.<br /> Soon afterward the man dies and shows up at the Gates of Heaven to greet St.<br /> Peter.<br /> St. Peter seeing the suitcase says, ""Hold on, you can't bring that in here!""<br /> But, the man explains to St. Peter that he has permission and asks him to<br /> verify his story with the Lord.<br /> Sure enough, St. Peter checks and comes back saying, ""You're right. You are<br /> allowed one carry-on bag, but I'm supposed to check its contents before letting<br /> it through.""<br /> St. Peter opens the suitcase to inspect the worldly items that the man found<br /> too precious to leave behind and exclaims, ""You brought pavement?!""</p>

<p>Pretty soon, when another ape tries to climb the stairs, the other apes all<br /> try to prevent it. Now, turn off the cold water. Remove one ape from the cage<br /> and replace it with a new one. The new ape sees the banana and wants to climb<br /> the stairs. To his horror, all of the other apes attack him. After another<br /> attempt and attack, he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be<br /> assaulted. </p>
<p>Next, remove another of the original five apes and replace it with a new one.<br /> The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked. The previous newcomer takes<br /> part in the punishment with enthusiasm. Again, replace a third original ape with<br /> a new one. The new one makes it to the stairs and is attacked as well. Two of<br /> the four apes that beat him have no idea why they were not permitted to climb<br /> the stairs, or why they are participating in the beating of the newest ape. </p>
<p>After replacing the fourth and fifth original apes, all the apes, which have<br /> been sprayed with cold water, have been replaced. Nevertheless, no ape ever<br /> again approaches the stairs.

26610,"<p>The general was confined to the military hospital for treatment of a minor malady. For almost a week he made a complete nuisance of himself, irritating both staff and the other patients, demanding attention and expecting his every order to be followed immediately. He was in a six-man ward rather than a private room, his meals were too cold or not served to suit his taste, the light needed to be adjusted to his demands, the nighttime activities interfered with his rest and on, and on.One afternoon an orderly entered the room. ""Time to take your temperature, General."" After growling at the orderly, the general opened his mouth to accept the thermometer. ""Sorry, General, but for this test we need your temperature from the other end."" A whole new barrage of verbal abuse followed, but the orderly was insistent that a rectal temperature was what the test called for. The general at last rolled over, bared his rear, and allowed the orderly to proceed. The orderly then told the general, ""Stay exactly like that and don`t move. I'll be back in five minutes to check up on you,"" and withdrew.An hour later, the head nurse entered the room, saw the general with his bare rear in the air and gasped, ""What's going on here?""""Haven't you ever seen someone having their temperature taken?"" the general barked.""Yes I have, General, but with a daffodil?""</p>

26633,"<p>A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a brand-new<br /> BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him.

26652,"<p>MICROSOFT: 'If G.M. had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got one-thousand miles to the gallon.'GENERAL MOTORS: 'Perhaps, but if G.M. had developed technology the same way Microsoft has, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:  1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day. You would just accept this, repair the damage and drive on. 2. Every time the lines were repainted on the road, you would     have to buy a new car.  You would accept this too. 3. Occasionally, but most often during rush-hour or when you are running      late, your car would just die on the freeway for no apparent reason.       Again, you would just accept this, re-start, and drive on. 4. Occasionally, executing a normal maneuver, such as a left turn,     will cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart.  In such      cases you would have to reinstall the engine.    5. Tech support will be available 24x7 via in-car satellite link.     Unfortunately after being on hold for 2 hours the tech will      usually not be able to solve your problem and will recommend      that you buy a new car tomorrow. 6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would be     replaced by a single 'general car default'  warning light.   7. Installing oil or antifreeze which do not carry the GM brand      AND copyright AND trademark will be automatically detected, often     causing the problems listed in items  1, 3, and 4 above and     voiding the warranty. 8. The airbag system would say 'Are you sure?' before going off. 9. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock     you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously     lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grabbed hold     of the radio antenna.   10. G.M. would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of     Rand McNally road maps (now a G.M. subsidiary), even though they     neither need them nor want them.  Attempting to delete this option     would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by fifty     percent or more.  11. G.M. would become a regular target for investigation by the Justice     Department.12. Every time G.M. introduced a new model, car buyers would have to      learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would     operate in the same manner as they did in their old car.13. To replace the oil filter, fuel filter or spark plugs, your mechanic     will have to crawl under the hood, via the trunk.14. Before you can drive your car on the (information) super-highway,     you'll have to make special adjustments by sticking a very long probe     up the tailpipe and executing procedures normally expected of heart     surgeons doing arthroscopic surgeries.15. Accepting free trial offers for AOL gasoline or MSN gasoline will      place two 100-lb bags of sand in your trunk, on top of the two 100-lb      bags of MSN and AOL deadweight sand already there, which GM neglects     to mention when you buy the car. It would require an expensive     major tune-up to remove this dead weight should you decide     to not use those brands of gasoline exclusively.16. From time to time GM will change the terminology used for familiar     parts of the car and invent new words or new definitions for old words.     Thus under GM-Newspeak(TM) your 'defroster' could become the:   'Real-World Visual Basic Interface Re-Integrator(TM)'     16a: New labels like 'Real-World Visual Basic Interface        Re-Integrator(TM)'  would carry a convenient anacronym like        'ReWoViBIRI' which you would have to learn to pronounce in order to        sound hip.    16b: When you encounter these newly invented words in the GM         documentation, you will be expected to already understand what they        mean.  16c: New terms like 'Real-World Visual Basic Interface        Re-Integrator(TM)' and 'ReWoViBIRI' will not appear in the 'GM        Glossary of Technical Terms,' because GM refuses to publish a        Glossary of Technical Terms.    16d: GM will be happy to sell you expensive classes to teach you the        meaning of life, the universe and the definitions of the newly        invented GM-Newspeak(TM) words and terms.     16e: These classes will not feel like the brain washing experienced         in Socialist Re-education camps as reported by former POWs. Much.  16f: Every 2-6 years, concepts like 'Real-World Visual Basic Interface        Re-Integrator(TM)' will be re-named again to something even more        obscure and cryptic like: 'Windscreen Renoberator(TM)'   16g: As the cycling of changing names for technical concepts continues,        sometimes the circle will close and this time the new term will be        (SURPRISE!) 'defroster'    16h: In 2-6 years, the name for the concept formerly known as         'defroster' will again be renamed, this time to something even more        obscure and obtuse... just to keep you alert and on your toes.17.

26657,"<p>MESSAGE FROM THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON TO THE BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE IN LONDON--written from Central Spain, August 1812 </p>
<p>Gentlemen, </p>
<p>Whilst marching from Portugal to a position which commands the approach to Madrid and the French forces, my officers have been diligently complying with your requests which have been sent by H.M. ship from London to Lisbon and thence by dispatch to our headquarters. </p>
<p>We have enumerated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles, and all manner of sundry items for which His Majesty's Government holds me accountable. I have dispatched reports on the character, wit, and spleen of every officer. Each item and every farthing has been accounted for, with two regrettable exceptions for which I beg your indulgence. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the sum of one shilling and ninepence remains unaccounted for in one infantry battalion's petty cash and there has been a hideous confusion as the the number of jars of raspberry jam issued to one cavalry regiment during a sandstorm in western Spain. This reprehensible carelessness may be related to the pressure of circumstance, since we are war with France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise to you gentlemen in Whitehall. </p>
<p>This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request elucidation of my instructions from His Majesty's Government so that I may better understand why I am dragging an army over these barren plains. I construe that perforce it must be one of two alternative duties, as given below. I shall pursue either one with the best of my ability, but I cannot do both: </p>
<p>1. To train an army of uniformed British clerks in Spain for the benefit of the accountants and copy-boys in London or perchance. </p>
<p>2. To see to it that the forces of Napoleon are driven out of Spain. </p>
<p>Your most obedient servant, </p>
<p>Wellington</p>

26675,"<p>Al Davis had put together the perfect Raiders team for '96. The only Thing he was missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools, and he couldn't find a ringer quarterback that would ensure a Super Bowl win. </p>
<p>Then one night, while watching CNN, he saw a war zone in Bosnia. In the background, out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly incredible arm. First, he threw a hand grenade straight into a 15th story window over 200 yards away --ka-boom! Next, he threw another hand grenade into a group of about 10 soldiers a good 110 yards away--ka-blooey! </p>
<p>Then, a car passes going 90 miles an hour-- bulls-eye! Another grenade right into the barely open window. </p>
<p>""I've got to get this guy,"" Al says to himself. ""He has the perfect arm!"" </p>
<p>So he brings him to the states and teaches him the great game of football. Predictably, the young man breaks all NFL records for completed passes, accuracy and touchdowns. The Raiders go on to handily win the Super Bowl. </p>

I was in a hurry to get to work on time so I ran<br /> into the house to get my wife to give me a hand to start the car. I told her to<br /> get into our second car, a prehistoric oversized gas-guzzler, and use it to push<br /> my car fast enough to start it. I pointed out to her that because the VW had an<br /> automatic transmission, it needed to be pushed at least 30 mph for it to start.<br /> She said fine, hoped into her car and drove off.</p>
<p>I sat there fuming wondering what she could be doing.</p>
<p>A minute passed by and when I saw her in the rearview mirror coming at me at<br /> about 40 mph, I realized that I should have been a bit clearer with my<br /> directions.</p>

26715,"<p>Dear Santa,<br /> I understand that one of my colleagues has petitioned you for changes in her contract, specifically asking for anatomical and career changes. </p>
<p>In addition, it is my understanding that disparaging remarks were made about me, my ability to please, and some of my fashion choices. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of some issues concerning Ms. Barbie, and some of my own needs and desires. </p>
<p>First of all, I along with several other colleagues feel Barbie DOES NOT deserve preferential treatmen; the bitch has EVERYTHING! I, along with Joe, Jem, Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy, DO NOT have a dream house, Corvette, evening gowns, and in some cases, the ability to change our hairstyle. I personally have 3 outfits which I am forced to mix and match at great length. My decision to accessorize my outfits with an earring was my decision and reflects my lifestyle choice. </p>
<p>I, too, would like a change in my career. Have you considered ""Decorator Ken"", ""Beauty Salon Ken"", or ""Out of Work Actor Ken""? In addition, there are several other avenues which could be considered such as:""S&amp;M Ken"", ""Green Lantern Ken"", ""Circuit Ken"", ""Bear Ken"", ""Master Ken"". These would more accurately reflect my desires and perhaps open new markets. And as for Barbie needing bendable arms so she can""push me away"", I need bendable knees so I can kick that bitch to the curb. Bendable knees would also be helpful for me in other situations- we've talked about this issue before. </p>
<p>In closing, I would like to point out that any further concessions to the blonde bimbo from Hell will result in action taken by myself and others. </p>
<p>PS. Barbie can forget about having Joe; he's mine, at least that is what he said last night. </p>
<p>Sincerely, Ken</p>

<p>In one particular case, an attractive young maid, from a very poor family was wed to a well-off, but relatively unattractive businessman.</p>
<p>When the wedding night finally came, the couple, at the bride's insistence, stayed in a hotel near her family's home. </p>
<p>Early in the evening, the harried bride came rushing through the door.</p>
<p>""Mother, Mother!"" cried the girl, ""He says that we should sleep together!""</p>
<p>""It's alright, girl, married people sleep together. Now go back before he starts to worry about you.""</p>
<p>""Oh."" said the girl, and returned to her husband who had already begun to disrobe. When she saw his hairy chest, she went running back to her mother.</p>
<p>""Mother, mother, he is taking off his clothes, and he is covered in hair!""</p>
<p>""It's alright girl, men have hair on their bodies, don't let it bother you... Now, get back their before he starts wondering about you.""</p>
<p>When she returns, she finds the man naked for the first time, and sees that he had part of his right foot amputated. She flees, in fright, back to mom.</p>
<p>""Mother, mother, he only has a foot and a half!""</p>
<p>""Stand back, girl!"" says the mother, ""This is a job for a real woman!"" </p>

The commandant was a real mean prick and he was going to shoot his three captives unless their combined dick length was in excess of 20 inches.So the three POWs have their cocks measured and it turned out their combined dick length was 20 inches exactly, so they were spared.Later on the three were talking, and the Australian said ""Well if it wasn't for my 10 inch dick we'd all be dead.""The American says ""Na, if it wasn't for my 8 inch dick then we'd all be dead.""Then the Irishman says ""If I didn't have a hard on, we'd all be dead.""  </p>

26742,"<p>Three men were traveling in rural America when their car came to grief,<br /> whereupon they sought shelter at the nearest farmhouse.</p>
<p>The farmer had two spare beds in the room next to his daughter's room, but<br /> since he had heard all of those stories he informed the men that one of<br /> them would have to sleep in the barn.  One of them, a very polite Hindu<br /> mathematician, immediately volunteered and went out to the barn.  A short<br /> time later there was a knock on the door, and, sure enough, there was the<br /> Hindu, very apologetically explaining that there were cows in the barn, and<br /> because of his religious convictions, he didn't think he could remain there.</p>
<p>A second man, a conservative rabbi, now volunteered and went.  But a short<br /> time later, there was a knock on the door.  Sure enough, he too was back,<br /> explaining that since there was a pig in the barn, he too would be quite<br /> uncomfortable out there.</p>
<p>Whereupon the third man, a practicing lawyer, agreeably proceeded out to the<br /> barn.</p>
<p>In a little while, there was a knock on the door.  And when they went to<br /> answer it, sure enough, there were the cows and the pig.</p>

26751,"<p>A man went to his doctor, seeking help for his terrible addiction to cigars. The doctor was quite familiar with his very compulsive patient, so recommended an unusual and quite drastic form of aversion therapy.</p>
<p>""When you go to bed tonight, take one of your cigars, unwrap it, and stick it completely up your butt. Then remove it, rewrap it, and place it back with all the others, in such a fashion as you can't tell which one it is.

<p>""Thanks doc, I'll try it."" And he did. But three weeks later he came back and saw the doctor again.</p>
<p>""What? My recommendation didn't work? It was supposed to be effective even in the most addictive of cases, such as yours is!"" answered the doctor.</p>

<p>I fight for the chickens and I am fighting for the chickens<br /> right now. I will not give up on the chickens crossing the road!<br /> I will fight for the chickens and I will not disappoint them. </p>
<p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH </p>
<p>I don't believe we need to get the chickens across the road. I<br /> say give the road to the chickens and let them decide. The<br /> government needs to let go of strangling the chickens so they<br /> can get across the road. </p>
<p>SENATOR LIEBERMAN </p>
<p>I believe that every chicken has the right to worship their God<br /> in their own way. Crossing the road is a spiritual journey and<br /> no chicken should be denied the right to cross the road in their<br /> own way. </p>
<p>VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY </p>
<p>Chickens are big-time because they have wings. They could fly if<br /> they wanted to. Chickens don't want to cross the road. They<br /> don't need help crossing the road. In fact, I'm not interested<br /> in crossing the road myself. </p>
<p>RALPH NADER </p>
<p>Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil<br /> tiremakers. Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays<br /> tiremakers to create the need for these roads and then lures<br /> chickens into believing there is an advantage to crossing them.<br /> Down with the roads, up with chickens. </p>

To his surprise, St.<br /> Peter left his desk at the gate and came down the long line to where the lawyer<br /> was standing, and greeted him warmly. Then St. Peter and one of his assistants<br /> took the lawyer by the hands and guided him up to the front of the line, and<br /> into a comfortable chair by his desk. The lawyer said, ""I don't mind all this<br /> attention, but what makes me so special?"" St. Peter replied, ""Well, I've added<br /> up all the hours that you billed your clients, and by my calculation you must be<br /> about 193 years old!""</p>

<p>The word got around and nobody called him that any more. Then one day, a young girl named Blue Bird forgot and said, ""Good morning, Onestone."" </p>
<p>He jumped up, grabbed her, and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night. He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion. </p>
<p>The word got around that Onestone meant serious business. Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away for many years. </p>
<p>Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.  She hugged him and said, ""Good to see you, Onestone."" </p>
<p>Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he screwed her all day, screwed her all night, screwed her all the next day, screwed her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!!!</p>

26806,"<p>Women have more imagination than men. They need it to tell men<br /> how wonderful they are.</p>
<p>Women have their faults. Men have only two. Everything they say.<br /> Everything they do.</p>
<p>A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can<br /> spend. A successful women is one who can find such a man. </p>
<p>Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed. Women somehow<br /> deteriorate during the night. </p>
<p>When women are depressed they either eat or go shopping. Men<br /> invade another country. It's a whole different way of thinking. </p>
<p>A man is a person who will pay two dollars for a one-dollar item<br /> he wants. A woman will pay one dollar for a two-dollar item that<br /> she doesn't want. </p>
<p>When a man gives his opinion, he's a man. When a woman gives her<br /> opinions, she's a b--ch. </p>
<p>Women are the only exploited group in history who have been<br /> idealized into powerlessness. </p>
<p>Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Dogs are a man's best friend.<br /> Now you know which sex is smarter. </p>
<p>Most men's primary fantasy is still, unfortunately, access to a<br /> number of beautiful women. For a man, commitment means giving up<br /> this fantasy. Most women's primary fantasy is a relationship<br /> with one man who either provides economic security or is on his<br /> way to doing so (he has ""potential""). For a woman, commitment to<br /> this type of man means achieving this fantasy. So commitment<br /> often means that a woman achieves her primary fantasy, while a<br /> man gives his up. </p>
<p>It's not true that men prefer foolish women. Rather they prefer<br /> women who can simulate foolishness whenever necessary, which is<br /> the very core of intelligence</p>

<p>The Aussie shows off his big wheat field and the Texan says,<br /> ""Oh! We have wheat fields that are at least twice as large.""</p>

26833,"<p>Office Pranks on Induhviduals<br /> -----------------------------</p>
<p>My favorite prank report from the field:</p>
<p>""A friend of mine who works with MRI machines bet the medical<br /> salesman that he could not toss his wallet through the opening<br /> in the MRI magnet--the one the patients' head goes<br /> through--without having the wallet touch the sides. </p>
<p>The Induhvidual's wallet included all of his credit cards, which<br /> were instantly demagnetized in the process. </p>
<p>Although it cost my friend a soda, the snicker factor made it<br /> well worth the price.""</p>
<p>True Tales of Induhviduals<br /> --------------------------</p>
<p>These true reports were filed by anonymous DNRC operatives:</p>
<p>Sighting #1:</p>
<p>I was busy writing some computer program for one of my classes<br /> and my roommate asked me if he could use my coffee maker. I<br /> said, ""sure.""</p>
<p>The next thing I hear is, ""Hey, where do you put the coffee?"" I<br /> turn to see that he has filled the filter basket with water and<br /> is (unsuccessfully) trying to keep the water in the basket by<br /> plugging the hole at the bottom with his finger. He and the<br /> floor are both covered with water.</p>
<p>[Editor's note: Guess which one of these guys will be a senior<br /> manager someday.]</p>
<p>Sighting #2:</p>
<p>I was at the airport, checking in at the gate, when the airport<br /> employee asked, ""Has anyone put anything in your baggage without<br /> your knowledge?""</p>
<p>I said, ""If it was without my knowledge, how would I know?""</p>
<p>He smiled and nodded knowingly, ""That's why we ask.""</p>
<p>Sighting #3:</p>
<p>The stoplight on the corner buzzes when it is safe to cross the<br /> street. I was crossing with an intellectually challenged<br /> co-worker of mine, when she asked if I knew what the buzzer was<br /> for. I explained that it signals to blind people when the light<br /> is red. She responded, appalled, ""What on earth are blind people<br /> doing DRIVING???""</p>
<p>Sighting #4:</p>
<p>At a goodbye lunch for an old and dear co-worker who is leaving<br /> the company due to ""rightsizing,"" our manager spoke up and said,<br /> ""This is fun. We should have lunch like this more often."" </p>
<p>Not another word was spoken. We just looked at each other like<br /> deer staring into the headlights of an approaching truck.</p>
<p>Sighting #5:</p>
<p>I worked with an Induhvidual who plugged her power strip back<br /> into itself and for the life of her could not understand why her<br /> system would not turn on. </p>
<p>Sighting #6 (a rare ""double sighting""):</p>
<p>A friend had a brilliant idea for saving disk space. He thought<br /> if he put all his Microsoft Word documents into a tiny font<br /> they'd take up less room. When he told me I was with another<br /> friend. She thought it was a good idea too.</p>
<p>Sighting #7 (from Tech Support):</p>
<p>Tech Support: ""How much free space do you have on your hard<br /> drive?""</p>
<p>Induhvidual: ""Well, my wife likes to get up there on that<br /> Internet, and she downloaded ten hours of free space. Is that<br /> enough?""</p>
<p>Sighting #8 (from Tech Support):</p>
<p>Induhvidual: Now what do I do?</p>
<p>Tech Support: What is the prompt on the screen?</p>
<p>Induhvidual: It's asking for ""Enter Your Last Name.""</p>
<p>Tech Support: Okay, so type in your last name.</p>
<p>Induhvidual: How do you spell that? </p>
<p>Sighting #9 (from Tech Support):</p>
<p>We received a support call from a customer who had problems<br /> connecting to some dial-in lines. He said he found a solution to<br /> his connection problems and would like to share it with us. </p>
<p>When he heard his modem retraining upon dialing in, he would<br /> pick up the phone and make a ""Kckgkth"" noise, like a modem, into<br /> the phone. Then he would hang up and get a reliable connection.<br /> He told us he would be glad to record this noise and send it to<br /> us so that our other customers could benefit from it. </p>
<p>After we stopped rolling on the floor laughing, we told him he<br /> was just inserting line noise and was connecting at a lower<br /> speed.</p>

26836,"<p>During a recent publicity outing, Hillary sneaked off to visit a fortune teller of some local repute.  In a dark and hazy room, peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered grave news.</p>
<p>""There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt: Prepare yourself to be a widow.  Your husband will die a violent and horrible death this year.""</p>
<p>Visibly shaken, Hillary stared at the woman's lined face, then at the single flickering candle, then down at her hands.  She took a few deep breaths to compose herself.  She simply had to know.  She met the fortune teller's gaze, steadied her voice, and asked her question. ""Will I be acquitted?""</p>
"
26837,"<p>According to a news report, a certain private school in Victoria,<br /> BC recently was faced with a unique problem. </p>
<p>A number of grade 12 girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom. That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints. </p>
<p>Every night, the maintenance man would remove them and the next day, the girls would put them back. </p>
<p>Finally the principal decided that something had to be done.<br /> She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance man. She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night. </p>
<p>To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required. </p>
<p>He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the mirror with it. </p>
<p>Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirror.</p>

26844,"<p>A doctor died and was being screened for the destination of his soul's eternal afterlife. </p>
<p>Unfortunately he'd been a bit of a lout and greedy to boot, so he wasn't quite certain what to expect. </p>
<p>Upon his arrival at the Pearly Gates, Saint Peter greeted him and informed the Doctor that he would be allowed to choose from one of the doors before him, but that because of his greed and misdeeds, he may find the choices rather disturbing.</p>
<p>Upon opening the first door, he saw fire and brimstone of truly Biblical proportions, a horrifying sight, so he quickly shut the door.</p>
<p>After looking through the second door, he was even more horrified to see various tortured souls ravaged by plague, disease, and other maladies too terrible to mention, while an evil guard stood watch.</p>
<p>Nervously he opened the third door to discover groups of white-coated male physicians, being waited on hand and foot by beautiful young women dressed in little more than nursing caps! </p>
<p>He rushed excitedly back to Saint Peter and said, ""I'll take the third door!""</p>
<p>""Oh, no, I'm afraid that's not possible,"" exclaimed Saint Peter. ""That's NURSE'S Hell!""</p>

26847,"<p>'Resumania' is a term coined by Mr. Robert Half, founder of RHI Consulting's<br /> parent company, to describe the unintentional bloopers that often appear on job<br /> candidates' resumes, job applications and cover letters. Here are some<br /> examples:</p>
<p>'I perform my job with effortless efficiency, effectiveness,<br /> efficacy, and expertise.' (And an eye on the 'e' section of the dictionary,<br /> evidently.)</p>

26850,"<p>An extraordinarily handsome man decided he had the God-given responsibility to marry the perfect woman so they could produce children beyond comparison.</p>
<p>With that as his mission he began searching for the perfect woman.  After a diligent, but fruitless, search up and down the east coast, he started to head west. Shortly thereafter he met a farmer who had three stunning, gorgeous daughters that positively took his breath away. So he explained his mission to the farmer, asking for permission to marry one of them.</p>
<p>The farmer simply replied, ""They're all lookin' to get married, so you came to the right place. Look them over and select the one you want.""</p>
<p>The man dated the first daughter. The next day the farmer asked for the man's opinion.<br /> ""Well"" said the man, "" She's just a weeeeee bit, not that you can hardly notice, but pigeon-toed.""</p>
<p>The farmer nodded and suggested the man date one of the other girls; so the man went out with the second daughter.</p>
<p>The next day, the farmer again asked how things went.<br /> ""Well,"" the man replied, ""She's just a weeeee bit, not that you can hardly tell, cross-eyed.""</p>
<p>The farmer nodded and suggested he date the third girl to see if things might be better. So he did.</p>
<p>The next morning the man rushed in exclaiming,  ""She's perfect, just perfect! She's the one I want to marry!"" So they were wed right away.</p>
<p>Months later the baby was born. When the man visited nursery he was horrified: the baby was the ugliest, most pathetic human you can imagine. He rushed to his father-in-law asking how such a thing could happen considering the parents.</p>
<p>""Well,"" explained the farmer, ""She was just a weeeee bit, not that you could hardly tell, pregnant when you met her.""</p>

26902,"<p>The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by physicists at<br /> Yale's Research Center. The element, tentatively named administratium, has no<br /> protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it does have<br /> one neutron, 125 assistant neutrons 75 vice- neutrons and 11 assistant<br /> vice-neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held<br /> together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of<br /> meson-like particles called morons.</p>
<p>Since it has no electrons, administratium is inert. However, it can be<br /> detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with.<br /> According to the discoverers, a minute amount of administratium caused a<br /> reaction to take over four days to complete, when it would normally occur in<br /> less than one second.</p>
<p>Administratium has a normal life of approximately three years, at which time<br /> it does not actually decay but, instead, undergoes reorganization in which<br /> assistant neutrons, vice-neutrons and assistant vice-neutrons exchange places.<br /> Some studies have shown that the atomic weight usually increases after each<br /> reorganization.</p>
<p>Research at other laboratories indicates that administratium<br /> occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points<br /> such as government agencies, large corporations, universities and hospitals and<br /> can actually be found in the newest, best maintained buildings.</p>
<p>Scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level of<br /> concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is<br /> allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how administratium<br /> can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not<br /> promising.</p>

It originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans too.

26969,"<p>One day, a man had an accident at work, which resulted in him getting his eye gouged out. He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency operation, was told by the doctor that he'd been given a glass eye. The man looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his original eye colour was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged. ''I can't walk around like this!!""""Sir,"" the doctor said, ""there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.''  A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the road before finally hitting a tree.  The man screeched to a halt, and ran down the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye!  As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, noone was about. So the man proceeded to get a screwdriver  and removed one of the deceased man's blue eyes, replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to have the replacement blue eye fitted.  A few days later, the man was driving along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads.  ''Excuse me, sir,"" said the policeman.""Do you know anything about this at all?''''No, constable'', said the man.''Well, we can't figure this out.
