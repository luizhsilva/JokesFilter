12001,"<p>You might be a rednack if...You've ever worn hunter's orange to church. You have barnyard animals living in your house.Every pair of jeans you own has a tobacco can ring worn in one of the rear pockets.Your truck has a bumper sticker that reads, ""Gun control is a steady hand."" Your wife has ever torn her hose on the boogers stuck under the front of the pickup seat.You have ever had a special loaded gun by the back door only for use on possums.You have ever shot a possum on your porch. You don't use a garbage service because it must be placed up near the mail box and you can't see far enough thru the trees to shoot the neighbors' dogs when they get into it.You only go to the dump when you have enough to fill up the pickup. You have more than 500 rounds of ammunition in your house....not including 22 caliber.You have guns in your house that you cannot find. You think a night of fine dining is going to the Snack Bar at Wal-Mart while the automotive department is raising your truck another 8 inches. You think Wal-Mart is expensive.You've got more guns ""On Display"" than Wal-Mart Sporting Goods. You have ever written a check for less than a dollar. Your horse wears shoes, but you don't. It doesn't bother you when you walk through a barn barefooted. You name your twin boys Jack and Daniel. You ask your 10-year old son how to spell a word. Your dog is your alarm clock.</p>

12003,"<p>NASA was interviewing professionals to be sent to Mars. Only one could go, but with one catch - he couldn't return to Earth. </p>
<p>The first applicant, an engineer, was asked how much he wanted to be paid for going. ""One million dollars,"" he answered, ""because I want to donate it to M.I.T."" </p>
<p>The next applicant, a doctor, was asked the same question. He asked for two million. ""I want to give a million to my family,"" he explained, ""and leave the other million to my church."" </p>
<p>The last applicant was a lawyer. When asked how much money he wanted, he whispered in the interviewer's ear, ""Three million dollars."" </p>
<p>""Why so much more than the other two?"" he queried. </p>
<p>""Because, if I get $3 million, I'll give you $1 million, I'll keep $1 million, and we'll send the engineer!""</p>

<p>""It's in the judge's hands now,"" said the lawyer. </p>
<p>""Would it help if I sent the judge a box of cigars?"" </p>
<p>""Oh no! This judge is a stickler or ethical behavior. A stunt like that would prejudice him against you. He might even hold you in contempt of court. In fact, you shouldn't even smile at the judge."" </p>
<p>Within the course of time, the judge rendered a decision in favor of the defendant. As the defendant left the courthouse, he said to his lawyer, ""Thanks for the tip about the cigars. It worked!"" </p>
<p>""I'm sure we would have lost the case if you'd sent them."" </p>
<p>""But I did send them."" </p>
<p>""What?? You did???"" </p>
<p>""Yes. That's how we won the case."" </p>
<p>""I don't understand,"" said the lawyer. </p>
<p>""It's easy. I sent the cigars to the judge, but enclosed the plaintiff's business card.""</p>

12022,"<p>A little boy goes to his dad and asks, ""What is politics?""</p>
<p>Dad says, ""Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the breadwinner of the family, so let's call me capitalism. Your Mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the people. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense,""</p>
<p>So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said.</p>
<p>Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics </p>
<p>now.""</p>
<p>The father says, ""Good son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.""</p>
<p>The little boy replies, ""Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored and the Future is in deep poo.""</p>

I noticed him as I walked by and could tell he had flown before because his seeing eye dog lay quietly underneath the seats in front of him throughout the entire flight. I could also tell he had flown this very flight before because the pilot approached him and, calling him by name, said, ""Keith, we're in Sacramento for almost an hour. Would you like to get off and stretch your legs?""Keith replied, ""No thanks, but maybe my dog would like to stretch his legs.""Picture this ..... all the people in the gate area came to a complete stand still when they looked up and saw the pilot walk off the plane with the Seeing eye dog!

12046,"<p>For all you baseball fans...</p>
<p>Warning: Explicit... </p>
<p>Baseball's Guide to Love </p>
<p>Do you remember middle school/junior high/high school? If so, do you remember talking about 'the bases' with your friends? ""Yeah man, at the dance, X and Y went behind the gym and they got to second base!"" Well that was cool and all, but what the hell was second base? Tongue kissing? Up the shirt? No one was really sure. </p>
<p>Also, the bases tended to get progressively more intense as you got older. What's a person to do? Here, we mourn the passing of using baseball ananlogies to describe sexual activity. But let's face it, there are more than four stages in today's day and age of sex play. So, in the interests of both bringing baseball sex metaphors in line with the complications of modern romance and with standardizing the bases, we present the ""Standardized Guide to the Bases"". </p>
<p>First, let's examine what the bases could have meant in the old days: </p>
<p>-- First Base-- </p>
<p>This was almost always kissing, although one guy I knew thought it meant holding hands. Sometimes it was tongue kissing and sometimes not. </p>
<p>--Second Base-- </p>
<p>Variously this meant tongue kissing, breast feeling, or outside the clothes genital contact. </p>
<p>--Third Base-- </p>
<p>Usually this was a hand down the pants of you or your partner. </p>
<p>--Home Run-- </p>
<p>This was ALWAYS sex, although it was rarely reached in the times when you had to refer to it in terms of bases. </p>
<p>Well that system is ok, if you are a young teenager with a repressed sex drive. But what happens when you reach maturity and new factors enter the equation, such as oral sex? And what about the exact definitions? Well we have attempted to answer such puzzling questions and present without further ado... </p>
<p>Standardized Guide to the Bases! </p>
<p>--On Deck-- </p>

<p>--Double-- </p>
<p>Breasts/chest touched, some clothes off, lots of grabbing and feels </p>
<p>--Triple-- </p>
<p>Most of the clothes off, genital contact, mutual masturbation </p>
<p>--Inside the park home run-- </p>
<p>Oral Sex </p>
<p>--Home Run-- </p>

<p>--Ground Rule Double-- </p>

<p>Now that we've got the basics, let's introduce some terms to better explain all the things that can happen now a days. </p>

<p>OLD WAY- ""We, um, got to third base I guess and then we, um, got like past third base, but not to home plate. I really like her. </p>
<p>NEW WAY- First, there was a triple, then we got an inside the park home run, and I started thinking, it's hall of fame time. </p>
<p>NEW WAY- So there I was with the bases loaded and nobody out, when I balked during the seventh inning stretch and I had to call in a relief pitcher. </p>
<p>Well, there you have it, I hope it has cleared up a lot of the confusion and helps you out.</p>

12048,"<p>A young man had seriously dated three girls and was finally faced<br /> with the dilemma of which to marry.  As a test he gave each of<br /> them one thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The first girl went for a complete hair and face make over, new<br /> clothes, and new shoes.  She returned to show off her new look<br /> saying, ""I want to be at my most beautiful for you.  Why?<br /> Because I love you, dear.""</p>
<p>The second girl returned with new hockey and golf equipment, a<br /> new stereo, VCR, and month's supply of beer saying, ""I bought all<br /> these things for you.  They're my gifts to you, because I love<br /> you so.""</p>
<p>The third girl invested the $1,000 wisely and very quickly<br /> doubled her original amount.  She reinvested the profits which<br /> continued to multiply and returned the first thousand to the<br /> young man saying, ""I have taken your money and made it grow as an<br /> investment in our future together. That's how much I love you, my<br /> dear.""</p>
<p>The young man was very impressed by all of their responses.  He<br /> then gave long and careful consideration and finally married the<br /> one with the biggest breasts.</p>

<p>""How about cunnilingus?"" </p>
<p>""Nope"" </p>
<p>""Kick-start vibrator?"" </p>
<p>""Wakes up the neighbors, but not me."" she complains. </p>
<p>""Hmm, looks like a problem. Wait here."" the doctor says as he walks into the next room. He walks out with a black velvet case and places it on his lap. Her eyes widen as he opens it, revealing its contents. </p>
<p>""What is it"",she gasps. </p>
<p>""It's a VOODOO DICK,"" he proclaims, as he hoists the foot-long, meaty shaft from the case. </p>
<p>""It is VERY powerful, but it can fulfill your every desire. Watch. VOODOO DICK, hand!"" he commands. The dick leaps across his lap into his open palm faster than the eye can see. </p>
<p>""Ooooh"", she sighs. ""VOODOO DICK, case."" The dick returns in a shot to its case. </p>
<p>""You may take this, but you must promise NOT to abuse its power."" </p>
<p>""Certainly, of course, anything you say,"" she sputters as the wetness in her mouth matches the wetness in her panties. So she takes the magic missile with her, thanking the good doctor and hurrying out to her car. But she can't wait to get home, so she prys the lid open on the seat next to her. </p>
<p>""VOODOO DICK, hand!"" she commands. It flies eagerly into her hand. She is amazed by the size of this veiny tool, and quickly removes her underwear. </p>
<p>""VOODOO DICK, pussy!"" she screams, and it obliges. Burying itself inside her in an instant, she gasps with pleasure. </p>
<p>""VOODOO DICK, fuck me."" It begins to thrust in and out. </p>
<p>""VOODOO DICK, faster!"" It quickens the pace while the woman sits in sexual bliss. Unbelievable sensations course through her body. </p>
<p>""VOODOO DICK, harder!"" It pounds away furiously as orgasms begin, one after the other. Soon the woman begins to tire, unaccustomed to this sort of satisfaction. </p>
<p>""VOODOO DICK, stop."" BUT IT WON'T STOP !!!!!! </p>
<p>""VOODOO DICK, stop now!"", she yells. It continues its relentless assault. </p>
<p>""Quit it, VOODOO DICK. That hurts"" It is oblivious to her desires. She finally manages to wrench it from her pussy and throw it out the window. Just as she gets the window rolled up, it is there against the glass, trying to get in. She quickly starts the car and screeches away in terror. 60, 70, 80 mph. The VOODOO DICK hot on (and for) her tail. 90, 100. The woman starts to pull away as the dick fades away behind the last corner. Sirens blare. </p>

<p>The man decided just to buy the Golden Rat, so he pays<br /> for it and leaves.</p>
<p>A rat that was in the shop follows him out, as does a<br /> rat in the alley outside.  Before he's walked a street away, he's being<br /> followed by ten rats, then a hundred, then a thousand.  The man starts to<br /> panic, and starts running away, while more and more rats follow him.  He<br /> ran right across the town, and got himself trapped by the sea.  He<br /> hesitated for a second, then dives off the wharf  and starts swimming.</p>
<p>Looking back, he saw that the rats were still following him, but the<br /> second they hit the water, they turned to stone and sank.  About fifteen<br /> minutes later (well, it takes a while to kill ten thousand rats), the man<br /> swam back to shore, and walked back to the shop.</p>
<p>When he walked in, the<br /> guy behind the counter said ""Ahhhh.  You come back for story about Golden<br /> Rat.""</p>

''Hey, Billy-Bob, ya mind if I ask you what you are doin' walkin' down Main Street wearin' nothin' but your gunbelt and boots?'' ''Well Sheriff,it's a long story.'' ''I ain't going nowhere,'' said the Sheriff. ''Well Sheriff, a couple hours ago I ran into Mary Lou in the saloon. We had ourselves a couple of drinks and then we started to feelin' kinda frisky and Mary Lou said, 'Why don't we go out to the barn?' So we did. Then we started getting real close and cuddin' and smoochin' and Mary Lou said, 'Why don't we go out back and go up to the top of the hill.' So we did. He continued, ''We started cuddlin' and smoochin' some more and the next thing I know, Mary Lou had taken off all her clothes and she suggested that I do the same. So I did, all except my gunbelt and boots. Then Mary Lou laid down on the ground and spread her legs apart and said 'Okay, Billy-Bob, go to town!' And, here I am Sheriff!''</p>

12100,"<p>The husband finally wised up to the fact that his wife was less than faithful.

He sent the following e-mail to his wife's lover: Sir, It has been brought to my attention that for some time now you have been carrying on an affair with my wife. So that we may settle this matter in an intelligent fashion, please be at my office at 3 PM on Friday next. </p>

12101,"<p>A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his graduate<br /> students. It had one question:  ""Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or<br /> endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof.""<br /> Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas<br /> cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant.<br /> One student, however, wrote the following:<br /> ""First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need<br /> to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.<br /> I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not<br /> leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell,<br /> let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of<br /> these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will<br /> go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do<br /> not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all<br /> souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the<br /> number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of<br /> change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the<br /> temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to<br /> expand as souls are added.<br /> This gives two possibilities:<br /> 1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter<br /> Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell<br /> breaks loose.<br /> 2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls<br /> in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.<br /> So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan<br /> during my Freshman year, 'That it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep<br /> with you,' and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in<br /> having sexual relations with her, then 2 cannot be true, and so Hell is<br /> exothermic.""<br /> This student got the only A.</p>

<p>'We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the<br /> circumstances. Inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair.<br /> Kill her!' </p>
<p>The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent<br /> said, 'Then you're not the right man for this job.' </p>
<p>The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into<br /> the room. All was quiet for about five minutes. Then the man came out with tears<br /> in his eyes. 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' </p>
<p>The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.' </p>
<p>Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions to kill<br /> her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot<br /> after another. Then the agents heard screaming, crashing, and banging on the<br /> walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there<br /> stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow, and said, 'This gun is<br /> loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair.'</p>

12124,"<p>This is NOT a true story, but it's a good read. . .A lady in a faded gingham dress and her husband, dressed in a homespun threadbare suit, stepped off the train in Boston, and walked timidly without an appointment into the Harvard University President's outer office. The Secretary could tell in a moment that such backwoods, country hicks had no business at Harvard and probably didn't deserve to be in Cambridge. She frowned. ''We want to see the President,'' the man said softly.''He'll be busy all day,'' the secretary snapped.''We'll wait,'' the lady replied.For hours, the Secretary ignored them, hoping that the couple would finally become discouraged and go away. They didn't: and the Secretary grew frustrated and finally decided to disturb the President, even though it was a chore she always regretted. ''Maybe if they just see you for a few minutes, they'll leave,'' she told him. He sighed in exasperation and nodded. Someone of his importance obviously didn't have the time to spend with them, but he detested gingham dresses and homespun suits cluttering up his outer office.The President, stern-faced with dignity, strutted toward the couple. The lady told him, ''We had a son who attended Harvard for one year. He loved Harvard. He was happy here. But about a year ago, he was accidentally killed and my husband and I would like to erect a memorial to him, somewhere on campus.''The President wasn't touched, he was shocked. ''Madam,'' he said gruffly. ''We can't put up a statue for every person who attended Harvard and died. If we did, this place would look like a cemetery'.''Oh, no,'' the lady explained quickly. ''We thought we would like to give a building to Harvard.''The president rolled his eyes. He glanced at the gingham dress and homespun suit, then exclaimed, ''A building! Do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs? We have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical plant at Harvard.''For a moment the lady was silent. The president was pleased. He could get rid of them now. And the lady turned to her husband and said quietly, ''Is that all it costs to start a University? Why don't we just start our own?'' Her husband nodded..The President's face wilted in confusion and bewilderment.Mr.and Mrs. Leland Stanford walked away, traveling to Palo Alto, California, where they established the university that bears their name, a memorial to a son that Harvard no longer cared about.</p>

<p>If you do encounter 'work' via email or are faced with any 'work' at all, then<br /> to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words 'Sorry...I'm off<br /> to the pub'. The 'work' should automatically be deleted from your brain. </p>

The cowboy hands him a five and says, ""You're on!""The old man looks the cowboy up and down, noticing some cow dung on his boots and flatly states, ""You're from Wyoming.""The cowboy shakes his head and says, ""I'll be darned! You're right!"" and strolls away.A second cowboy approaches the old man and goes through the same routine.Handing him the fiver, he stands and watches as the old man looks him up and down and notices a bit of straw and cow dung on his boots. The old man says, ""You're from Montana!""The cowboy, dejected, walks away.The young man decides he's going to give the old man a run for the money. He goes into the mensroom, takes his boots off, scrubs them, dries them off and puts on a coat of polish. He walks up to the old man, hands over a five dollar bill and says, ""Do your stuff!""The old man looks and looks, up and down, and appears to be befuddled. The young man is now thinking he's gone one up on the old geezer. Finally, the old man says, ""You're from South Dakota!""The young man gets really upset and can't for the life of him figure out how the old guy could know that, so he asks, ""How in the world did you know I'm from South Dakota?""The old man replies, ""By the wool on your zipper!""</p>

12205,"<p>A few years ago, I applied for a job at Kodak.  I made it through all the interviews with flying colours, and the only thing left was the drug test.  I was confident in passing, but there was one slight problem: I have *very* shy kidneys.  I've had to sneak out of the doctor's office on more than one occasion, because I can't ""go"" and fill up a cup on command.  Usually, this is a good thing, as I can go to a concert or football game, drink beer all day, and be fine until I get home, while my friends are standing in line in the bathrooms several times during the same time period.So, to prepare, on the morning I had to take the test, I drank my usual 10-cup pot of coffee, and several large glasses of water, and for the 20-minute trip to Kodak, I filled a plastic gallon jug with water, and finished it off on the way.   Now, Kodak has huge parking lots, each containg hundreds and hundreds of cars, and by the time I got there, the visitor's lots were pretty full, and I had to park way in the back.As soon as I got out of my car, I'm thinking, ""Good, it worked, I think I can go!""  By the time I'd finished the 10-minute walk to the entrance, I was thinking, ""Boy, no problems now, I can *definitely* go!""To get in, I had to go past a security hut.  I told them why I was there, and they told me where to report, about another 10-minute walk, a little ways into the plant.  I had to pass building after building before I got to the right one, every step of the way, becoming actually painful, and before I was there, I was looking at bushes and doorways and the like, thinking, ""Well, if it gets too bad, I could go there, or maybe there, or...""By the time I got to the right building, I was just about in agony. I found the right area, and the receptionist told me to take a seat with about 8 other people.  I sat down, thinking that would help, but 10 seconds later I was up, walking around, trying to read stuff on the wall, anything to keep my mind occuppied, but managing to read 5 or 10 words, and then having to pace again.Finally, I couldn't take it anymore, and after having asked the girl a couple of times how long, I told her, ""look, either you get me in *now*, or I use the bathroom over there, and we reschedule!!"" She said she'd see what she could do, and left.  I went back to sit down, and it took all of 5 seconds before I was up pacing again. She came back a few minutes later, and told me to go on in.When I got to the actual room, there were 4 people standing in line.  I hopped up and down a couple of times, before I passed the others, went to the nurses, and told them I have to go **NOW**!!! They asked the others in line if anyone objected, and they said no, so they said as soon as one of the 2 bathrooms come free, I could go.  I snatched the cup out of his hand, and practically raced down the aisle to the bathrooms and just stood waiting.  It couldn't have been more than 20 seconds or so, but they were some of the most agonizing seconds of my life!!Finally, one of the doors opened, and I nearly flattened some poor girl coming out in my rush to get in.  I closed the door, grabbed my pants, breathed in, and dropped them and then my underwear, and then the world caved in...  I started going.  And going.  And going. I could have knocked down the Berlin wall with the force!   But the problem was, that I couldn't ""grab"" it!!  It was whipping around like one of those Water Wiggle things.  I'm trying like heck to reign it it in, but just couldn't.  I'm dancing around in a circle, with my pants around my ankles, trying to grab it, and it was just about impossible for probably a good 15 seconds.  Finally, I did, and was able to aim in the toilet, just remembering at the end to put a shot or two in the cup to put on the little shelf.   By the time I'd stopped, I was physically spent, and just leaned up against the wall, feeling like I'd just run a marathon...It was then that was able to survey the bathroom.  It was a room, about 7x7, but my god...  I had finished the most intense pee of my life in the john, but before I'd gained control, I'd soaked the entire toilet, the sink, the floor, the walls.  You name it, it was drenched -- including my pants and underwear.  I tried soaking it up with toilet paper (using the whole roll as a sponge), but that was drenched and didn't work that well.  I'd also soaked the extra rolls on the back of the toilet, the paper towel holder, and the extra roll of paper towels.  I went through the garbage, pulling out half-soaked old towels, just trying to make the place semi-presentable, as in the sink and the mirror, but it didn't do much good.  I was just ending up pushing the wet around, so I finally gave up.Steeling myself, I pulled up my wet underwear, then my wet pants, and pulled down my semi-wet shirt as much as possible, and went out. I whipped back up the aisle, thanking the nurse, without slowing down, and out the door as fast as my legs would carry me, imagining what the next person to use that bathroom would encounter. The silver lining:  I got the job!!</p>

12219,"<p>Veteran Pillsbury spokesman Pop N. Fresh died yesterday of a severe yeast<br /> infection. He was 71. Known to friends as Brown-n-Serve, Fresh was an avid<br /> gardener and tennis player. Fresh was buried in one of the largest funeral<br /> ceremonies in recent years. Dozens of celebrities turned out including Mrs.<br /> Butter worth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Aunt Jemima, Betty Crocker,<br /> the Hostess Twinkies, and Skippy. The graveside was piled high with flours as<br /> longtime friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing fresh as a man who<br /> ""never knew how much he was kneaded.""</p>
<p>Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with many<br /> turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough<br /> on half-baked schemes -- conned by those who puttered him up. Still, even as a<br /> crusty old man, he was a roll model for millions. His second wife survives<br /> fresh. They have two children and another bun in the oven. The funeral was held<br /> at 350 for about 20 minutes.</p>

12230,"<p>The following are actual statements found on insurance forms where drivers attempted to summarize the details of an accident in the fewest words possible: </p>
<ul>
<li>Coming home, I drove into wrong house and collided with a tree I don't have. </li>
<li>I thought my window was down, but found it was up when I put my head through it.</li>
<li>The other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intentions. </li>
<li>I collided with a stationary car going the other way.</li>
<li>A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face.</li>
<li>A pedestrian hit me and went under my car.</li>
<li>The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times before I hit him.</li>
<li>I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law and headed over the embankment.</li>
<li>In my attempt to kill a fly, I drove into a telephone pole.</li>
<li>I had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home. As I reached an intersection a hedge sprang up obscuring my vision, and I did not see the other car.</li>
<li>I had been driving for 40 years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident.</li>
<li>I was on my way to the doctor with rear end trouble when my universal joint gave way causing me to have an accident.</li>
<li>As I approached the intersection a sign suddenly appeared in a place where no stop sign had ever appeared before. I was unable to stop in time to avoid the accident. To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.</li>
<li>My car was legally parked as it backed into the other vehicle.</li>
<li>An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car and vanished.</li>
<li>I told the police that I was not injured, but upon removing my hat found that I had a fractured skull.</li>
<li>I was sure the old fellow would never make it to the other side of the curb when I struck him.</li>
<li>The telephone pole was approaching. I was attempting to swerve out of its way when it struck the front end.</li>
<li>I was thrown from the car as it left the road. I was later found in the ditch by some stray cows.</li>
<li>The indirect cause of the accident was a little guy in a small car with a big mouth.</li>
<li>The pedestrian had no idea which direction to run, so I ran over him.</li>

12231,"<p>Scientists at NASA have developed a gun built specifically to launch dead<br /> chickens at the windshields of airliners, military jets and the space shuttle,<br /> all traveling at maximum velocity.</p>
<p>The idea is to simulate the frequent incidents of collisions with airborne<br /> fowl to test the strength of the windshields.</p>
<p>British engineers heard about the gun and were eager to test it on the<br /> windshield of their new high-speed trains. Arrangements were made. But when the<br /> gun was fired, the engineers stood shocked as the chicken hurtled out of the<br /> barrel, crashed into the shatterproof shield, smashed it to smithereens, crashed<br /> through the control console, snapped the engineer's backrest in two and embedded<br /> itself in the back wall of the cabin. </p>
<p>Horrified Britons sent NASA the disastrous results of the experiment, along<br /> with the designs of the windshield, and begged the U.S. scientists for<br /> suggestions.</p>
<p>NASA's response was just three words, ""Thaw the chicken.""</p>

12234,"<p>In a recent contest, The Washington Post asked readers to dream up new elements for the Periodic Table. Among the best of the batch:<br /> Limbaughium Lb<br /> The heaviest known element. It possesses an ever-expanding mass. Very white. Acidic. Emits heat but no light. Instantly polarizes all elements that come in contact with it. Repels protons and electrons; attracts only morons. </p>
<p>With a slick appearance and slimy texture, this element undergoes a series of interesting changes when in hot water. </p>
<p>Canadium Eh<br /> Similar to Americium, but a little denser. Much more rigid. Often called Boron. </p>
<p>Innofensium Pc<br /> Precisely equal numbers of electrons, protons, neutrons, leptons, quarks. Completely inert, utterly useless, but smells like a rose. </p>
<p>Newtium<br /> Extreme irritant. Carries a strong negative charge. Does not possess magnetic properties. Can be purchased cheaply. </p>
<p>Quaylium Vp<br /> Einsteinium it ain't. </p>
<p>Budweisium Ps<br /> Has no taste or smell; is often indistinguishable from water. </p>
<p>Cabmium Cb<br /> Found in abundance, except when needed. Exists in two states, in motion and at rest. When in motion, it cannot be stopped, no matter what you do. Cabmium has a charge associated with it. The charge is variable, and scientists have not determined the formula for calculating it. </p>
<p>Politicium Po<br /> Contains a great deal of gas. Similar to radon in that it can reach lethal concentrations in the House. </p>
<p>Congress Cg<br /> Atomic number 525. Can never be found in a solution. </p>

12235,"<p>A policeman interrogates three blondes who are training to become detectives.</p>
<p>To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first blonde a picture for five seconds and then hides it. ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""</p>
<p>The first blonde answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!""</p>
<p>The policeman says, ""Well, uh, thats because the picture shows his profile.""</p>
<p>Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for five seconds at the second blonde and asks her, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""</p>
<p>The second blonde giggles, flips her hair and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""</p>
<p>The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?! Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""</p>
<p>Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third blonde and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"" He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""</p>
<p>The blonde looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""Hmm,  the suspect wears contact lenses.""</p>
<p>The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know if the suspect wears contacts or not. ""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file.""</p>
<p>He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspects file in his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face. ""Wow! I cant believe it. It's true! The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""</p>
<p>""That's easy,"" the blonde replied. ""He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.""</p>

12237,"<p>A couple had two little boys, ages 8 and 10, who were excessively mischievous. They were always getting into trouble and their parents knew that if any mischief occurred in their town, their sons were probably involved.</p>
<p>The boys' mother heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys. The clergyman agreed, but asked to see them individually.</p>
<p>So the mother sent her 8-year-old first, in the morning, with the older boy to see the clergyman in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The clergyman, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly, ""Where is God?""</p>
<p>They boy's mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there with his mouth hanging open, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>So the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner tone, ""Where is God?""<br /> Again the boy made no attempt to answer.</p>
<p>So the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and bellowed, ""WHERE IS GOD!?""</p>
<p>The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him.</p>
<p>When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, ""What happened?""</p>

<p>Modern Version:</p>
<p>The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house<br /> and laying up supplies for the winter.</p>
<p>The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer<br /> away.</p>
<p>Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and<br /> demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while<br /> others are cold and starving.</p>
<p>CBS, PBS, CNN, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering<br /> grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table<br /> filled with food.</p>
<p>America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a country<br /> of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?</p>
<p>Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries<br /> when they sing ""It's Not Easy Being Green.""</p>

<p>The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and,<br /> having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the<br /> government.</p>
<p>Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a<br /> defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal<br /> judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients. The<br /> ant loses the case.</p>
<p>The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the<br /> ant's food while the government house he is in, which just happens to be the<br /> ant's old house, crumbles around him because he doesn't maintain it.</p>
<p>The ant has disappeared in the snow.</p>
<p>The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house, now<br /> abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once peaceful<br /> neighborhood.</p>

Unaware, he bent over to pick up the keys. That was something the gay man just couldn't resist, so he jumped on him and did his thing.Saint Peter was furious.""If you do that again, you'll go straight to hell! Follow me, we're almost there.""After some more Peter dropped his keys again, and again, the gay man jumped on him. Saint Peter was even more furious than before, but decided to give the gay guy one last chance.Again they walk and for the third time Peter drops his keys, so he bends over and picks them up. The gay guy, having no self control jumps on him. Peter is now fed up and sends the gay guy straight to hell.A few weeks later, Saint Peter goes down to hell for his routine inspection, but this time something is wrong, it is freezing, no fire, no lava and in one corner, he finds the devil lying under a stack of blankets freezing his ass off.""Why is it so god damn cold down here?""Peter asks.""Well, you just try bending down for firewood!!""

<p>VIAGRA CAUSES PANIC ------------------------ WASHINGTON, DC (DPI) -- Viagra, the new pill for impotence approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Friday, is already causing problems across the country. The FDA had said a man would need to by sexually aroused before the drug would work, but apparently failed to consider that most men walk around in a constant state of sexual arousal. Several disasters or near-disasters have already been reported:</p>
<p>FDA Spokesperson Bonnie Thurston commented, ""There's no limit to the damage that this pill could cause. We've got to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands,like President Clinton's, for example, of we could have a potential nuclear mistake.""</p>

12259,"<p>A Drunken Night A guy wakes up in a drunken stupor, opening his eyes he sees<br /> Claudia Schiffer on the bed next to him. He thinks this is a little odd, as he<br /> doesn't remember a thing, let alone going to bed with her. He decides to get up<br /> and get himself a drink from the fridge. He gets to the fridge and opens the<br /> door and is faced with a large suitcase. He takes the suitcase out of the<br /> fridge, puts it on the table and opens it to find $1 Million. This is just a<br /> little too much for the guy who thinks he is losing his mind. He wonders if he<br /> is hallucinating, so he goes to the window and draws back the blind. Outside on<br /> his front lawn is the Klu Klux Klan and dangling from the tree is an open noose,<br /> empty. They appear to be beckoning him and shouting.<br /> Now the guy is really freaked out, he quickly draws the blind and turns<br /> around. </p>
<p>In the corner of his kitchen is a leprechaun, obviously drunk as well. </p>
<p>He asks the leprechaun what is going on. </p>
<p>""Well,"" says the leprechaun, ""I was drunk last night as well, and as I was<br /> crossing the road, I was nearly run down. You ran across the road and pushed me<br /> to safety, so I granted you three wishes in return for saving me."" </p>
<p>""Well, I can guess the first one"" says the guy, ""Supermodel, bed, yeah I got<br /> that one. What about the other two?"" </p>
<p>""The money in the fridge?"" says the leprechaun, ""You asked for a cool<br /> million."" </p>
<p>""And them out there?"" asks the guy, </p>
<p>""You said you wanted to be hung like a black man.""</p>

12284,"<p>After having been commissioned by God to take a survey of how man was doing on Earth, St.  Peter now stood before his boss ready to present his findings.  'Tell me, St.  Peter, what have you found out?'  God asked.  'I'm very sorry to have to tell you this, but the people are behaving in a sinful manner.  There's drugs, alcohol, murders, you name it - a regular Sodom and Gomorra.  But the worst is this new obsession with oral sex. According to my survey, 88% of the population is doing it.  Even four out of five dentists recommend it.  I'm afraid it has reached epidemic proportions.'  'Hmmm,' God said thoughtfully, 'Do you have any recommendations as to what should be done to put an end to this sexual perversion?'  'I think we should send a message to everyone on Earth who engages in oral sex.  The Contents of that message should tell them exactly what will happen to them on judgment day if they do not stop this type of activity.' replied St.  Peter.  'That is an effective solution,' God stated, 'but I think that instead of punishing those who practice oral sex, we should reward those who refrain from it. Let's send a letter that's personally signed by me to each one of these good people.'   Do you know what the letter said?(scroll down) No?  You didn't get one either, huh?</p>

If she doesn't reply move about five feet close and say it again. Keep doing this so that we'll get an idea about the severity of her deafness''. Sure enough, the husband goes home and does exactly as instructed. He starts off about 15 feet from his wife in the kitchen as she is chopping some vegetables and says, ''Honey, what's for dinner?'' He hears no response. He moves about five feet closer and asks again. No reply. He moves five feet closer. Still no reply. He gets fed up and moves right behind her, about an inch away, and asks again, ''Honey, what's for dinner?'' She replies, ''For the fourth time, vegetable stew!</p>

When he enters his house, he doesn't want to wake anyone, sohe takes off his shoes and starts tip-toeing up the stairs. Half-way up the stairs, he falls overbackwards and lands flat on his rear end. That wouldn't have been so bad, except that he had couple of empty pint bottles in his back pockets, and they broke, and the broken glass carved up his buttocks terribly. But, he was so drunk that he didn't know he was hurt. A few minutes later, as he was undressing, he noticed blood, so he checked himself out in the mirror, and, sure enough, his behind was cut up something terrible. Well, he repaired the damage asbest he could under the circumstances, and he went to bed. The next morning, his head was hurting, and his rear was hurting, and he was hunkering under thecovers trying to think up some good story, when his wife came into the bedroom. ""Well, you really tied one on last night,"" she said. ""Where'd you go?"" ""I worked late,"" he said, ""and I stopped off for a couple of beers."" ""A couple of beers? That's a laugh,"" she replied. ""You got plastered last night. Where the heck did you go?"" ""What makes you so sure I got drunk last night, anyway?"" ""Well,"" she replied, ""my first big clue was when I got up this morning and found a bunch of band-aids stuck to the mirror.""</p>

<p>Tim then awoke from his sleep only to find him self in the sky<br /> with clouds all around. Tim was scared and confused, he then<br /> called out, ""Hello?!""

<p>Monday is an awful way to spend 1/7th of your life.<br /> Support bacteria - they're the only culture some people have.<br /> Depression is merely anger without enthusiasm.<br /> Ambition is a poor excuse for not having enough sense to be lazy.<br /> Hard work pays off in the future. Laziness pays off now.<br /> I intend to live forever - so far, so good.<br /> Dancing is a perpendicular expression of a horizontal desire.<br /> If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.<br /> A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking.<br /> Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.<br /> For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism.<br /> No one is listening until you make a mistake.<br /> Success always occurs in private, and failure in full view.<br /> The severity of the itch is proportional to the reach.<br /> Two wrongs are only the beginning.<br /> You never really learn to swear until you learn to drive.<br /> The sooner you fall behind, the more time you'll have to catch up.<br /> A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.<br /> Change is inevitable....except from vending machines.<br /> A fool and his money are soon partying.<br /> Drugs may lead to nowhere, but at least it's the scenic route.</p>

"
12345,"<p>If you happen to end up in a Halloween or horror movie, it is worthwhile to remember a few simple rules to help keep yourself healthy, happy and safe (in other words, not dead).</p>
<p>1. When it appears that you have killed the monster, NEVER check to see if it's really dead.</p>
<p>2. Never read a book of demon summoning aloud, even as a joke.</p>
<p>3. Do not search the basement, especially if the power has gone out.</p>
<p>4. If your children speak to you in Latin or any other language which they should not know, shoot them immediately. It will save you a lot of grief in the long run. However, it will probably take several rounds to kill them, so be prepared. This also applies to kids who speak with somebody else's voice.</p>
<p>5. When you have the benefit of numbers, NEVER pair off or go alone. Hit the first person that says, ""Let's split up.""</p>
<p>6. As a general rule, don't solve puzzles that open portals to Hell. It's just not that fun.</p>
<p>7. Never stand in, on, or above a grave, tomb, or crypt. This would apply to any other house of the dead as well.</p>
<p>8. If you're searching for something which caused a loud noise and find out that it's just the cat, GET OUT OF THERE ANYWAY!</p>
<p>9. If appliances start operating by themselves, do not check for short circuits; just get out.</p>
<p>10. Do not take ANYTHING from the dead.</p>
<p>11. If you find a town which looks deserted, there's probably a good reason for it. Don't stop and look around.</p>
<p>12. Don't fool with recombining DNA technology unless you're sure you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>13. If you're running from the monster, expect to trip or fall down at least twice, more if you are female. Also note that, despite the fact that you are running and the monster is merely shambling along, it's still moving fast enough to catch up with you.</p>
<p>14. If your companions suddenly begin to exhibit uncharacteristic behavior such as hissing, fascination for blood, glowing eyes, increasing hairiness, and so on, kill them immediately.</p>
<p>15. Stay away from certain geographical locations, some of which are listed here: Amityville, Elm Street, Transylvania, Nilbog (you're in trouble if you recognize this one), anywhere in Texas where chain saws are sold, the Bermuda Triangle, or any small town in Maine.</p>
<p>16. If your car runs out of gas at night on a lonely road, do not go to the nearby deserted-looking house to phone for help. If you think that it is strange you ran out of gas because you thought you had most of a tank, shoot yourself instead. You are going to die anyway, and most likely be eaten.</p>
<p>17. Beware of strangers bearing tools. For example: chain saws, staple guns, hedge trimmers, electric carving knives, combines, lawn mowers, butane torches, soldering irons, band saws, or any devices made from deceased companions.</p>
<p>18. If you find that your house is built upon a cemetery, now is the time to move in with the in-laws. This also applies to houses that had previous inhabitants who went mad or committed suicide or died in some horrible fashion, or had inhabitants who performed satanic practices.</p>
<p>19. Dress appropriately. When investigating a noise downstairs in an old house, women should not wear a flimsy negligee. And carry a flashlight, not a candle. Make that two flashlights!</p>
<p>20. Do not mention the names of demons around open flames, as these can flare suddenly. Be especially careful of fireplaces in this regard.</p>
<p>21. Do not go looking for witches in the Maryland countryside.</p>

<p>He steps smartly across the street, walks up behind the little<br /> fellow and, placing his hand kindly on the child's shoulder,<br /> leans over and gives the doorbell a sold ring.</p>
<p>Crouching down to the child's level, the priest smiles<br /> benevolently and asks, ""And now what, my little man?"" To which<br /> the boy replies, ""Now we run!""</p>

12391,"<p>VISITORS: Quickly determine which guest is afraid of dogs. Charge across the room, barking loudly and leap playfully on this person. If the human falls down on the floor and starts crying, lick its face and growl gently to show your concern. </p>
<p>BARKING: Because you are a dog, you are expected to bark. So bark--- a lot. Your owners will be very happy to hear you protecting their house. Especially late at night while they are sleeping safely in their beds. There is no more secure feeling for a human than to keep waking up in the middle of the night and earing your protective bark, bark, bark... </p>
<p>LICKING: Always take a BIG drink from your water dish immediately before licking your human. Humans prefer clean tongues. Be ready to fetch your human a towel. </p>
<p>HOLES: Rather than digging a BIG hole in the middle of the yard and upsetting your human, dig a lot of smaller holes all over the yard so they won't notice. If you arrange a little pile of dirt on one side of each hole, maybe they'll hink it's gophers. There are never enough holes in the ground. Strive daily to do your part to help correct this problem. </p>
<p>DOORS: The area directly in front of a door is always reserved for the family dog to sleep. </p>
<p>THE ART OF SNIFFING: Humans like to be sniffed. Everywhere. It is your duty, as the family dog, to accommodate them. </p>
<p>DINING ETIQUETTE: Always sit under the table at dinner, especially when there are guests, so you can clean up any food that falls on the floor. It's also a good time to practice your sniffing. </p>
<p>HOUSEBREAKING: Housebreaking is very important to humans, so break as much of the house as possible. </p>
<p>GOING FOR WALKS: Rules of the road: When out for a walk with your master or mistress, never go to the bathroom on your own lawn. </p>
<p>COUCHES: It is perfectly permissible to lie on the new couch after all your humans have gone to bed. </p>
<p>PLAYING: If you lose your footing while chasing a ball or stick, use the flower bed to absorb your fall so you don't injure yourself. </p>
<p>CHASING CATS: When chasing cats, make sure you never--- quite--- catch them. It spoils all the fun. </p>
<p>CHEWING: Make a contribution to the fashion industry. ...Eat a shoe.</p>

<p>As he got out, a truck came along, too close to the curb, and completely tore off the driver's door of the Jag. </p>

<p>Before the cop had a chance to ask any questions, the lawyer started screaming hysterically. </p>
<p>His Jag, which he had just picked up the day before, was now completely ruined and would never be the same, no matter how the body shop tried to make it new again.</p>

<p>The interviewer gives him the gun, and tells him to go kill his wife. </p>

12441,"<p>En cierta ocasi�n, una familia inglesa que veraneaba por Escocia en uno de su muchos paseos, observ� una preciosa casita de campo que de inmediato les pareci� adecuada para ocuparla en su pr�ximo veraneo. Indagaron qui�n era el due�o y �ste result� ser un pastor de la iglesia anglicana, al que se dirigieron para pedirle les mostrara la peque�a finca. El propietario amablemente se las mostr� y, tanto por la comodidad del lugar como por su ubicaci�n, fue del agrado de la familia quedando comprometidos a alquilarla para sus pr�ximas vacaciones.</p>
<p>Ya de regreso en Inglaterra, platicando sobre la casa de campo escocesa, la esposa record� que no hab�a visto el W.C., y dado lo practico que son los ingleses, la mujer decidi� escribirle al propietario para preguntarle por el mismo en los siguientes t�rminos:</p>
<p>""Estimado pastor:</p>
<p>Hace unos d�as visitamos su finca con deseos de alquilarla para nuestras vacaciones y, como omitimos enterarnos de un detalle, quiero suplicarle que nos indique d�nde se encuentra el W.C.""</p>
<p>Finaliz� la carta con lo acostumbrado y decidi� enviarla d�nde el pastor. Al recibirla �ste, quien ignoraba que la abreviatura W.C. se refer�a al ba�o, creyendo que se trataba de una capilla anglicana llamada West Chapel, respondi� la carta de esta forma:</p>
<p>""Estimada se�ora:</p>
<p>Tengo el gusto de informarle que el lugar al que se refiere se encuentra a s�lo 12 Km de distancia de las casas. Es un rodeo molesto, sobre todo si se tiene la costumbre de ir con frecuencia, sin embargo, algunas personas llevan comida y permanecen en este sitio todo el d�a, por lo que se recomienda llegar temprano. Algunas personas llegan all� caminando, otras en cami�n o en tranv�a, no obstante, todas llegan en el momento justo. Hay cupo para 400 personas sentadas y 100 de pie. Los asientos est�n forrados de terciopelo marr�n y hay aire acondicionado para evitar bochornos y aglomeraciones. Se sugiere ir temprano para alcanzar lugar. Por cierto, por no hacerlo as� hace diez a�os, mi esposa tuvo que soportar todo el acto de pie y desde entonces no ha vuelto a utilizar tal servicio. Los ni�os se sientan juntos y cantan a coro. A la entrada se les da a todos y cada uno un papel y las personas que no alcanzan la repartici�n pueden usar el papel del compa�ero de asiento, sin embargo, al salir, deben regresar dicho papel para seguir haciendo uso de �l durante todo el mes. Todo lo depositado ah� es para dar de comer a los hu�rfanos del hospicio. Tambi�n hay fot�grafos profesionales que los retratar�n en diversas posturas que ser�n publicadas en los diarios de esta ciudad en la secci�n de sociales, lo que les dar� la oportunidad de conocer a tantas personalidades en estos actos; tambi�n hay magn�ficos micr�fonos para no perder detalle del sonido.</p>
<p>Atentamente, el Pastor"".</p>

After mass he asked the Monsignor how he had done.The Monsignor replied, 'When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.'So, next Sunday he took the Monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got so nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door.1. Sip the vodka; don't gulp.2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not beat his ass.6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late JC.7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook.8. David slew Goliath; he did not kick the crap out of him.9. When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass.10. We do not refer to the cross as the Big T.11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, 'Take this and eat it for it is my body.' He did not say, 'Eat me.'12. The Virgin Mary is not called 'Mary with the cherry'.13. The recommended Grace before a meal is not, 'Rub-a-dub dub, thanks for the grub, yeah God.'14.

He walks up to the elephant, swings the bat, and crunches the elephants balls pretty badly. Needless to say, the elephant jumps, and the owner pays out the $50,<br /> 000. Unfortunately, the owner had barely collected enough to cover the prize, so he ran another contest.</p>
<p>He'd never seen an elephant swing its head back and forth as if to say, ""no."" Same deal as before: $10 per entry, $50,000 prize. Lots of people try and fail. Then the little guy shows up in his limousine again, pulls out his bat, and walks up to the elephant. He says, ""Remember me?"" The elephant nods yes.</p>
<p>The man then holds up his bat and says, ""Want me to use this again?"" The elephant nods his head rather emphatically no....</p>

<p>So, thinking clearly, she set up the device, and as the cars passed the house and broke down, she'd offer the man in the car a place to stay for the night. Then as soon as the man was asleep, he'd be jarred awake by her with his penis in her mouth, and she'd hold a sign up saying ""$50 or I'll bite hard!"". Of course usually the guy would pay and she'd let him go.</p>

12581,"<p>In the sleepy city of Sherrill, N.Y., two unsuspecting adults have found themselves the objects of sleep deprivation research.</p>
<p>James Harden is currently in his tenth month of his study. His subjects, Debbie and Dennis Harden, have tried to foil his research to no avail. ""Ferber"" has failed and so has ""The Family Bed.""</p>
<p>Young James conducts his studies by awakening in the wee hours of the morning, standing up in his crib, and screaming at the top of his lungs. Sometimes, a backrub from Mom will put him back to sleep; but at other times, it takes the formula ritual. Sometimes James is actually hungry but most of the time he just wants to check how his research is going.</p>
<p>Just how far has he gone?  Last week, James woke up too early; his parents were still up watching David Letterman. Dennis looked at his lovely wife and said, ""I can't take this. I'm going to bed.""</p>
<p>Debbie responded, ""If you do that, I will kill you in your sleep."" Dennis went to get the baby.</p>
<p>Any non-Ferber advice or even sympathetic anecdotes are being requested by these strung-out parents. All other babies James age in this area actually sleep through the night and have done so since they were 2 days old. Or their parents are outright liars.</p>

Leroy said ""Romance, that romance shit don't work for black folks and poetry?!?? Man, I can't be saying off no poetry, that shit is for faggots."" Jack disagreed and stressed how romance spiced up his sex life with his wife. Leroy said "" OK, bro, I'll give it try. What should I do?"" Jack said, ""You go to the flower shop, pick up some beautiful flowers. Stop and get a big box of chocolates, and then, when you walk through the door, you make up a poem You need to say something about their how beautiful they are, and explain to them the way you want to make love to them."" Leroy says ""Give me an example."" Jack thinks a moment and says, ""Well, here's one that worked really well for me: ""Beautiful blond hair, eyes like a dove Come here my darling, let's make sweet love."" Leroy says ""OK, that sounds easy, I'll give it a try."" The next day, as Jack walks into the company lunch room, he sees Leroy. Leroy's head is swollen and covered with bruises. Jack rushes over and says ""What happened to you?"" Leroy replies ""I tried your fucking romance bullshit, that's what happened!"" ""What did you do? ""Took your advice, went, got some flowers, stopped and got some candy, walked in the door and recited some poetry."" ""And it didn't work?"" ""Hell, no it didn't work... look at me.

12671,"<p>Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked beans. He loved them, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat  lively reaction on him. </p>
<p>One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it was apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself: </p>
<p>""She'll never go for me carrying on like that,"" so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up baked beans, and shortly after that they got married.</p>
<p>A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down and since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her he would be late because he had to walk. On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him.</p>
<p>Since he still had several miles to walk he figured he would walk off any ill effects before he got home. So he went in and ordered, and before leaving had three extra large helpings of baked beans. </p>
<p>All the way home he putt-putted. He putted down one hill and putt-putted up the next. By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe.</p>
<p>His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, ""Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!""<br /> She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peek.</p>
<p>At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as she was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and she went to answer the phone.</p>
<p>While she was gone he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but ripe as a rotten egg. He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. </p>
<p>He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and  ""rrrriiipppp!"" It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse.<br /> To keep form gagging, he tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would dissipate. Things had just about returned to normal when he felt another urge coming. </p>
<p>He shifted his weight to his other leg and let go. This was a real blue ribbon winner: the windows rattled, the dishes on the table shook and a minute later the flowers on the table were dead. </p>
<p>While keeping an ear tuned  in on the conversation in the hallway and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for the next ten minutes, farting and fanning them each time with his napkin.</p>
<p>When he heard the phone farewells(indicating the end of his loneliness, and freedom) he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it.<br /> Smiling contently, he was the picture of innocence when<br /> his wife walked in.</p>
<p>Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner. After assuring he had not, she removed the blindfold and yelled, SURPRISE!!</p>
<p>To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the  table for his surprise birthday party.</p>

12683,"<p>In downtown Roanoke, at a crowded bus stop, a good friend of mine was waiting for her bus. She's very attractive and was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt  with matching tight leather boots and jacket. As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.</p>
<p>Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again she tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover she still couldn't!</p>
<p>So, a little more embarrassed she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, much to her chagrin she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.</p>
<p>So, with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.</p>
<p>About this time a big burly man that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned to the would-be hero screeching at him ""How dare you touch me!! I don't even know who you are!""</p>
<p>At this, the big guy drawled, ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we were friends!""</p>

12703,"<p>A snake and a rabbit were racing along a pair of intersecting forest pathways<br /> one day, when they collided at the point where the pathways meet. They<br /> immediately began to argue with one another as to who was at fault for the<br /> mishap.<br /> When the snake remarked that he had been blind since birth, and thus<br /> should be given additional leeway, the rabbit said that he, too, had been blind<br /> since birth. The two animals then forgot about the collision and began<br /> commiserating concerning the problems of being blind.<br /> The snake said that his greatest regret was the loss of his identity. He had<br /> never been able to see his reflection in water, and for that reason did not know<br /> exactly what he looked like, or even what he was.<br /> The rabbit declared that he had the same problem. Seeing a way that they could<br /> help each other, the rabbit proposed that one feel the other from head to toe,<br /> and then try to describe what the other animal was.<br /> The snake agreed, and started by winding himself around the rabbit. After a<br /> few moments, he announced, ""You've got very soft, fuzzy fur, long ears, big rear<br /> feet, and a little fuzzy ball for a tail. I think that you must be a bunny<br /> rabbit!""<br /> The rabbit was much relieved to find his identity, and proceeded to return the<br /> favor to the snake. After feeling about the snake's body for a few minutes, he<br /> asserted, ""Well, you're scaly, you're slimy, you've got beady little eyes, you<br /> squirm and slither all the time, and you've got a forked tongue.

12736,"<p>Once upon a time there was a Prince who, through no fault of his own was cast under a spell by an evil witch. The curse was that the Prince could speak only one word each year. However, he could save up the words so that if he did not speak for a whole year, then the following year he was allowed to speak two words. </p>
<p>One day he met a beautiful princess. She had ruby lips, golden hair and sapphire eyes. He fell madly in love. With the greatest difficulty he decided to refrain from speaking for two whole years so that he could look at her and say ""my darling"". But at the end of the two years he wished to tell her that he loved her. So he waited three more years without speaking, bringing the total number of silent years to 5. </p>
<p>But at the end of these five years he realized that he had to ask her to marry him. So he waited ANOTHER four years without speaking. </p>
<p>Finally as the ninth year of silence ended, his joy knew no bounds. Leading the lovely princess to the most secluded and romantic place in that beautiful royal garden the prince heaped a hundred red roses on her lap, knelt before her, and taking her hand in his, said huskily, ""My darling, I love you! Will you marry me?"" </p>
<p>The princess tucked a strand of golden hair behind a dainty ear, opened her sapphire eyes in wonder, and parting her ruby lips, said: ""Pardon?""</p>

He laughs and laughs.<br /> The next morning, he again catches her as she finishes her shower and<br /> grabs her ass and says ""If you firmed this up a bit, you wouldn't<br /> have to keep using your girdle."" Again he laughs and laughs, while<br /> his wife plots her revenge.</p>

They'd claim their toaster was compatible with all brands and styles of bread, but when you got it home you'd discover the Bagel Engine was still in development, the Croissant Extension was three years away and that, indeed, the whole appliance was just blowing smoke! </p>
<p>* If HP made toasters... They would market the Reverse Toaster, which takes in toast and gives you regular bread! </p>
<p>* If IBM made toasters... They would want one big toaster where people bring bread to be submitted for overnight toasting. IBM would claim a worldwide market for five, maybe six toasters. </p>
<p>* If Xerox made toasters... You could toast one-sided or double-sided. Successive slices would get lighter and lighter. The toaster would jam your bread for you. </p>
<p>* If Circuit City made toasters... The staff would sell you a toaster, but not know anything about it. Or you could buy all the parts to build your own toaster. </p>
<p>* If Thinking Machines made toasters... You would be able to toast 64,000 pieces of bread at the same time. </p>
<p>* If Cray made toasters... They would cost $16 million but would be faster than any other single-slice toaster in the world. </p>
<p>* If the Rand Corporation made toasters... It would be a large, perfectly smooth and seamless black cube. Every morning there would be a piece of toast on top of it. Their service department would have an unlisted phone number and the blueprints for the box would be highly classified government documents. The X-Files would have an episode about it. </p>
<p>* If the NSA made toasters... Your toaster would have a secret trap door that only the NSA could access in case they needed to get at your toast for reasons of national security. </p>
<p>* If Sony made toasters... The ToastMan, which would be barely larger than the single piece of bread it is meant to toast, can be conveniently attached to your belt. </p>
<p>* If Timex made toasters... They would be cheap and small quartz-crystal wrist toasters that take a licking and keep on toasting. </p>
<p>* If Fisher Price made toasters... 'Baby's First Toaster' would have a hand-crank that you turn to toast the bread that pops up like a jack-in-the-box. </p>
<p>* If Microsoft made toasters... Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have to buy a toaster. You wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'd still have to pay for it anyway. Toaster '02 would weigh 15,000 pounds (requiring a reinforced steel countertop), draw enough electricity to power a small city, take up 95% of the space in your kitchen, would claim to be the first toaster that lets you control how light or dark you want your toast to be, and would secretly interrogate your other appliances to find out who made them. Everyone would hate Microsoft toasters, but nonetheless would buy them since most of the good bread only works with their toasters. </p>
<p>* If Apple made toasters... It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does, but five years earlier and ten times better!</p>

12791,"<p>An elderly Frenchman was slowly walking down a countryside lane, admiring the beautiful spring day, when over a hedgerow he spotted a young couple, naked, making love in a field.</p>
<p>Getting over his initial shock he said to himself,<br /> 'Ah ze young love, ze springtime, ze air, ze flowers. C'est magnifique!' and continued to watch, remembering good times.</p>
<p>Suddenly he drew in a gasp and said,<br /> 'Mais... Sacre bleu!! Ze woman - she is dead!' and he hurried along as fast as he could to the town to tell Albert, the police chief.</p>
<p>He came, out of breath, to the police station and shouted,<br /> 'Albert... Albert zere is zis man zis woman .. . naked in Farmer Gaston's field making love.'</p>
<p>The police chief smiled and said;<br /> 'Come, come, Henri, you are not so old to not remember ze young love, ze springtime, ze air, ze flowers. Ah, L'amour! Zis is okay.'</p>
<p>'Mais non! You do not understand - ze woman she is dead!'</p>
<p>Hearing this Albert leapt from his seat and rushed out of the station and, the police car being serviced, he ran down to the field, confirmed Henri's story, and ran all the way back nonstop to call the doctor.</p>
<p>'Pierre, Pierre... this is Albert. I was in Gaston's field... zere is a young couple naked 'aving sex.'</p>
<p>To which Pierre replied,<br /> 'Albert, I am a man of science. You must remember, it is spring, ze air, ze flowers. Ah, Uamour! Zis is very natural.'</p>
<p>Albert, still out of breath gasped in reply,<br /> 'Non, you do not understand. Ze woman, she is dead!'</p>
<p>Hearing this Pierre shouted,<br /> 'Mon dieu!' grabbed his black medicine bag, stuffed in his thermometer, stethoscope, and other tools and jumped in the car and drove like a madman down to Gaston's field. </p>
<p>Upon getting there he gave the couple a full medical exam and drove back to Henri and Albert, who were waiting at the station. He got there, went inside, and smiled patiently at the two French-men and said,<br /> 'Ah, mes amis, do not worry. Ze woman, she is not dead. She is English.'</p>
"
12792,"<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>1 - ""What are you thinking?""</p>
<p>The proper answer to this question, of course is, ""I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you."" Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things:</p>
<p>a -  Baseball b -  Football c -  How fat you are d -  How much prettier she is than you e -  How he would spend the insurance money if you died</p>
<p>According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. ""If I wanted you to know,"" Al said, ""I'd be talking instead of thinking.""</p>
<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers:</p>
<p>2 - ""Do you love me?""</p>
<p>The correct answer to this question is, ""Yes."" For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, ""Yes, dear."" Wrong answers include:</p>
<p>a - I suppose so. b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes? c - That depends on what you mean by ""love"". d - Does it matter? e - Who, me?</p>
<p>3 - ""Do I look fat?""</p>
<p>The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, ""No, of course not"" and then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include:</p>
<p>a - I wouldn't call you fat, but I wouldn't call you thin either. b - Compared to what? c - A little extra weight looks good on you. d - I've seen fatter. e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>
<p>4 - ""Do you think she's prettier than me?""</p>
<p>The ""she"" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, ""No, you are much prettier."" Wrong answers include:</p>
<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. b - I don't know how one goes about rating such things. c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality. d - Only in the sense that she's younger and thinner. e - Could you repeat the question?  I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>
<p>5 - ""What would you do if I died?""</p>
<p>Correct answer: ""Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino's Pizza truck that came my way."" This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid exchange:</p>
<p>""Dear,"" said the wife. ""What would you do if I died?"" ""Why, dear, I would be extremely upset,"" said the husband.""Why do you ask such a question?"" ""Would you remarry?"" persevered the wife. ""No, of course not, dear"" said the husband. ""Don't you like being married?"" said the wife. ""Of course I do, dear"" he said. ""Then why wouldn't you remarry?"" ""Alright,"" said the husband, ""I'd remarry."" ""You would?"" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. ""Yes"" said the husband. ""Would you sleep with her in our bed?"" said the wife after a long pause. ""Well yes, I suppose I would."" replied the husband. ""I see,"" said the wife indignantly. ""And would you let her wear my old clothes? ""I suppose, if she wanted to"" said the husband. ""Really,"" said the wife icily. ""And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?"" ""Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do."" ""Is that so?"" said the wife, leaping to her feet. ""And I suppose you'd let her play with my golf clubs, too."" ""Of course not, dear,"" said the husband. ""She's left-handed...""</p>

12818,"<p>This man is convicted of crime and sentenced to do hard time in<br /> prison. The man has never been imprisoned before and is very<br /> scared. He is most terrified from the stories of how new inmates<br /> are raped and used sexually by other prisoners. </p>
<p>As he is being led to his cell the first day, other inmates are<br /> whistling at him and yelling lewd comments. This only<br /> intensifies his worries and concerns about being raped. </p>

<p>The end of the day approaches and still no conversation or<br /> contact from the big, ugly cellmate. The guards announce lights<br /> out, and the place goes almost black. The man is relieved when<br /> still nothing is said and starts to relax a little.</p>

12826,"<p>FOUR strangers traveled together in the same compartment of a European train. Two men and two women faced each other. One woman was a very wealthy and sophisticated 75 year old lady who was decked out in the finest of furs and jewelry. Next to her sat a beautiful young woman, nineteen yrs. old--who looked like something right off the cover of a fashion magazine. Across from the older lady was a man in his late-forties who was a highly decorated Sergeant Major in the Army. And next to the Sergeant Major sat a young private fresh out of boot camp.As these four strangers traveled, they talked and chatted about trivial things until they entered an unlighted tunnel, and there they sat in complete darkness and total silence, until the sound of a distinct kiss broke the silence; following the kiss a loud slap could be heard throughout the cabin. In the ensuing period of silence the four strangers sat quietly with their own thoughts. The older lady was thinking, ""Isn't it wonderful that even in this permissive day and age there are still young women who have a little self-respect and dignity?""The young woman, shaking her head and greatly puzzled, asked herself, ""Why in the world would any man in his right mind want to kiss an old fossil like that when I'm sitting here?""The Sergeant Major, rubbing his sore face, was outraged that any woman could ever think that a man in his position would try to sneak a kiss in the dark.And the private, grinning from ear to ear, was thinking, ""What a crazy and mixed up world this is when a private can kiss the back of his hand and then smack a Sergeant Major in the face and get away with it</p>

<p>This widow had a grown-up daughter<br /> Who had hair of red.<br /> My father fell in love with her,<br /> And soon the two were wed.</p>
<p>This made my dad my son-in-law<br /> And changed my very life.<br /> My daughter was my mother,<br /> For she was my father's wife.</p>
<p>To complicate the matters worse,<br /> Although it brought me joy,<br /> I soon became the father<br /> Of a bouncing baby boy.</p>
<p>My little baby then became<br /> A brother-in-law to dad.<br /> And so became my uncle,<br /> Though it made me very sad.</p>
<p>For if he was my uncle,<br /> Then that also made him brother<br /> To the widow's grown-up daughter<br /> Who, of course, was my step-mother.</p>
<p>Father's wife then had a son,<br /> Who kept them on the run.<br /> And he became my grandson,<br /> For he was my daughter's son.</p>
<p>My wife is now my mother's mother<br /> And it makes me blue.<br /> Because, although she is my wife,<br /> She's my grandmother too.</p>

<p>The father's plan was: ""If our son takes the money, he will be a<br /> businessman, if he takes the bible, he will be a priest--but if he takes<br /> the bottle of whiskey, I'm afraid our son will be a drunkard.""</p>

12847,"<p>One day there was a hippie who got on a bus. The bus was very<br /> crowded and the man took a seat next to a young nun. He was very<br /> attracted to the nun, because she was surprisingly beautiful.<br /> After getting his courage up, he finally said to the nun ""Will<br /> you have sex with me?"" The nun, disgusted, told the bus driver<br /> to stop the bus and she got off. The man was very disappointed<br /> and he moved up to the front of the bus to wait for his stop.<br /> Seeing that the young hippie was upset, the bus driver decided<br /> to help him out. He said to the young man, ""I know that nun.<br /> Every night, she goes to the grave yard at 9:00 to pray at the<br /> grave of her friend. If you go there and pretend that you are<br /> Jesus, there is no way she would turn down God's request. Just<br /> tell her that you are Jesus and ask her to have sex with you.""<br /> This gave the hippie great hope.</p>
<p>That night, he went to the graveyard, and sure enough, there was<br /> the nun. As she kneeled down, he decided to make his move. He<br /> walked over to her, dressed in a white robe with a hood and said<br /> to the nun ""I am Jesus Christ, will you have sex with me?"" Now,<br /> of course the nun could not deny the power of God, so she<br /> agreed. ""I just have one request,"" said the nun, ""it has to be<br /> anal sex, so I can remain a virgin and continue in my<br /> sisterhood."" The disguised hippie agreed and the two had sex.</p>
<p>When they were done, the man thought that it would be funny to<br /> reveal his identity to the nun. He took off his robe, revealing<br /> a tye dyed shirt, ripped jeans, and hemp nacklaces. ""HA HA!! I'm<br /> not Jesus, I'm the hippie!"" He exclaimed.</p>
<p>Much to the young man's surprise, the nun took off her habit,<br /> revealing a gray shirt and gray pants. Laughing, she yelled ""HA<br /> HA! I'm not the nun, I'm the bus driver!""</p>

<p>1. Bullet Proof vests aren't. </p>
<p>2. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.  They also punch, kick and<br /> choke harder too. </p>
<p>3. The speed at which you respond to a fight call is inversely proportional to how long you've been a cop. </p>
<p>4. Tear gas works on cops too, and regardless of wind direction, will always blow back in your face. </p>
<p>5. High speed chases will always proceed from an area of light traffic to an area of extremely heavy traffic. </p>
<p>6. If you know someone who tortures animals and wets the bed, he is either a serial killer or he works for Internal Affairs. </p>
<p>7. Placing a gun back in a shoulder holster with your finger on the trigger will cause you to walk with a limp. </p>
<p>8. Flash hiders don't really. </p>
<p>9. If you have cleared all the rooms and met no resistance, you and your entry team have probably kicked in the door of the wrong house.</p>
<p>10. If a cop swings a baton in a fight, he will hit other cops more often than he will hit the bad guys he swings at. </p>
<p>11. Domestic arguments will always migrate from an area of few available weapons (living room), to an area with many available weapons (kitchen). </p>
<p>12. If you have just punched out a handcuffed prisoner for spitting at you, you are about to become a star on Eyewitness News.</p>
<p>13. Bullets work on veteran cops too.  They also work on weight lifters, martial arts experts, department marksmen, Vice cops, S.W.A.T. jocks, and others who consider themselves immortal. </p>
<p>14. When a civilian sees a blue light approaching at a high rate of speed,<br /> he will always pull into the lane the cop needs to use. </p>
<p>15. If you drive your patrol car to the geometric center of the Gobi Desert, within five minutes a dumb-ass civilian will pull along side you and ask for directions. </p>
<p>16. You can never drive slow enough to please the citizens who don't need a cop, and you can never drive fast enough to please the ones who do. </p>
<p>17. Any suspect with a rifle is a better shot than any cop with a pistol. </p>
<p>18. From behind you, the bad guys can see your night sights as well as you<br /> can. </p>
<p>19. On any call, there will always be more bad guys than there are good guys, and the farther away your back-up, the more there will be.</p>
<p>20. The longer you've been a cop, the shorter your flashlight and your temper gets. </p>
<p>21. Whatever you are about to do, if there is a good chance it will get you killed, you probably shouldn't do it. </p>
<p>22. You should never do a shotgun search of a dark warehouse with a cop whose nickname is ""Boomer"". </p>
<p>23. The better you do your job, the more likely you are to be shot, injured, complained on, sued, investigated, or subpoenaed on your day off. </p>
<p>24. If a large group of drunk bikers is ""holed-up"" in a house, the Department will send one officer in a beat car.  If there is one biker ""holed-up"" in a house, they will send the entire S.W.A.T. Team.</p>

It took him a couple of weeks to find a way to get back at these bullies and when he found out what would get them back, he went all out. </p>
<p>He was on the bus where he normally gets his lunch stolen when he brought out a bottle that had, what looked like, small brown balls in it. He then, making sure no one was looking, secretly took from his pocket some milk duds and started popping them in his mouth as obvious to the rest of the kids as possible making yum yum noises. </p>
<p>The bus bully without asking snatched the jar from Ken's hand and asked ""What's in the bottle that you are making such a big deal of?"" </p>
<p>""Well, they're smart pills."" </p>
<p>""Smart pills?"" the bully asked. They opened the jar and popped a couple of the foreign brown balls in his mouth. ""Pweeuuweppblahhh!!"" he reacted. </p>

12892,"<p>There was once a famous explorer who would travel around the<br /> world videotaping exotic things from around the world. One day,<br /> he decided that he would make a videotape of all the world's<br /> dances. So, he and his film crews spent 5 years roaming around<br /> the world taping any exotic dance they could come across. They<br /> ended up in Australia after videotaping the last dance they had<br /> ever heard of. Suddenly, an old lady comes up to them and says<br /> ""Have you gotten the Butcher dance?""</p>
<p>The explorers did not know what the Butcher dance was, so they<br /> asked the old lady.</p>
<p>""Well, there's a very secretive tribe of Aborigines in the<br /> outback that only do this dance called the Butcher dance once a<br /> year. No human outside of their tribe has ever seen it.""</p>
<p>This excited the explorers greatly. ""Do you know where we can<br /> find this tribe?""</p>
<p>The lady replied ""Yes I do, and if you leave tomorrow, you<br /> should just make it in time. First, you need to travel 2 hours<br /> west into the outback, then 5 hours north. You will come to a<br /> mountain range. You must leave your vehicles at the range. Then,<br /> you climb over the mountain range, which is very treacherous.<br /> Then, you will need to ford a river at the bottom of the<br /> mountains. There should be a tribe of aborigines on the other<br /> side that will guide you to the next tribe for something<br /> valuable in return. They will lead you to a cliff on a plateau.<br /> You must scale down the cliff, and then it is an hour walk<br /> across a desert to a group of small hills, and over those hills<br /> will be the aborigines with the dance you seek.""</p>
<p>Well, the explorer knows that he must get this dance to complete<br /> his taping. So, he and his crew set off. 2 hours west, and then<br /> after 4 hours north, their cars break down, so they're forced to<br /> walk the remaining distance with all their equipment across the<br /> hot landscape. When they finally come to the mountains, 2 of the<br /> group lose their footing and fall to their deaths. They finally<br /> make it over the mountains, but the river has been engorged with<br /> a flood. 1 crewman drowns while he tries to swim across, so the<br /> remaining people are forced to build makeshift rafts. However,<br /> the rafts start to sink, and half of their camera equipment is<br /> lost. They come to the group of aborigines who will guide them<br /> to the next group, and offer them money. They refuse, and the<br /> explorers offer them some of their cameras. The aborigines<br /> refuse that, as well. So, the famous explorer makes his<br /> sacrifice, and offers the only female member of his crew, which<br /> they accept. They are given a guide who leads them to the cliff.<br /> One of the crewmen gets vertigo, and accidentally falls off the<br /> cliff tom his death. The explorer and his one remaining crewman<br /> set off across the desert, and his crewman drops because of heat<br /> stroke. So, the explorer picks up a small camera, and drags his<br /> ragged self across the desert, up the hills, and he can hear<br /> drums!</p>
<p>He pulls himself up the top of the hill, and the drums stop. He<br /> stumbles down to the village elder, and once they have found a<br /> translator, proceeds to ask him when the Butcher dance will take<br /> place.</p>
<p>""I'm very sorry, but we have just finished with our Butcher<br /> dance."" ""Well, can't you please do it again, for me? It's very<br /> important! You don't know what we've been through!"" ""We cannot<br /> do that. It would anger our gods, and we need them to watch over<br /> our livestock and our crops and our water.</p>
<p>So, the explorer heads back to where he started from, and<br /> finally makes it back and resolves to try again next year. So he<br /> spends the year renting out a house in Australia and gathering<br /> everything he'll need. He gets mountain climbing gear, an<br /> inflatable raft, blow-up dolls, and a car repair kit. He takes<br /> all the precautions, and with a new crew, sets off. </p>
<p>When they arrive at the mountains, one of his crew notices a<br /> path in the mountains that wasn't apparent, so they drive<br /> through, and make it to the river, which has dried up. They<br /> cross the dried-up riverbed, and the aborigines have moved away<br /> because of a lack of water. So, they carry on from the memory of<br /> their leader. Midway through the desert, however, one car hits a<br /> rock and tips, and the other car couldn't turn in time, and<br /> there's a horrible accident. By sheer willpower, the explorer<br /> climbs bloodied and beaten from the wreckage, finds one camera<br /> that still works, and stumbles on into the village. He is<br /> immediately recognized by the elder.</p>
<p>""Oh, you! You have come just in time to see the Butcher dance!<br /> We will delay it for a little bit so that you can be healed of<br /> your wounds!"" ""No, I don't want to waste that time. I'll be<br /> fine. Just start the Butcher dance!""</p>
<p>This is the time he's been waiting for two years. Finally, his 7<br /> year work will be complete. He fires up his camera and watches<br /> the dancers as they come out. They form a circle, and start to<br /> sing:</p>
<p>""You butcher right hand in, you butcher right hand out...""</p>

12924,"<p>Dos amigas que no se hab�an visto en mucho tiempo decidieron encontrarse para comer. En la sobremesa conversaron largamente de sus respectivas vidas amorosas.</p>
<p>Una de ellas dijo que realmente no hab�a nadie especial en su vida.</p>

12925,"<p>There once was a man and his family that lived in a little old<br /> village. One day he was driving along and was hit by a<br /> semi-truck. All of his family was killed and he was severely<br /> injured. Because of his injuries and the time it took, he was<br /> fired from his job.</p>
<p>Seeing the bad shape he was in, a group of monks decided to take<br /> him in. They gave him the job of ringing the bell.</p>
<p>One Sunday, while the man was ringing the bell, the rope<br /> snapped. He was so worried about his job that he ran up the<br /> three flights of stairs. Upon reaching the top, he began to hit<br /> the bell with his fists, but it didn't work. So he began to ring<br /> the bell with his head. It made a loud, grand ringing sound.<br /> Unfortunately, the man became dizzy and fell down the bell tower<br /> to his death.</p>
<p>Later that day the police arrived. All of the monks were out to<br /> help answer any question they could. ""Does anyone know this<br /> man's name?"" asked on of the police officers. One of the monks<br /> turned to him and said, ""I don't know his name, but his face<br /> sure rings a bell.""</p>

12928,"<p>An atheist was walking through the woods one day in Alaska, admiring<br /> all that evolution had created. ""What majestic trees! What a powerful<br /> river! What beautiful animals!"" he said to himself. As he was<br /> walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind<br /> him. Turning to look, he saw a 13-foot Kodiak brown bear beginning<br /> to charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could down the path. He<br /> looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was rapidly closing<br /> on him. Somehow, he ran even faster, so scared that tears came to his<br /> eyes. He looked again and the bear was even closer. His heart pounding<br /> in his chest, he tried to run faster yet. But alas, he tripped and<br /> fell to the ground. As he rolled over to pick himself up, the bear was<br /> right over him, reaching for him with its left paw and raising its<br /> right paw to strike him.</p>
<p>""OH MY GOD! ...""</p>
<p>Time stopped.</p>
<p>The bear froze.</p>
<p>The forest was silent.</p>
<p>Even the river stopped moving ...</p>
<p>As a brilliant light shone upon the man; a thunderous voice came from<br /> all around...</p>
<p>""YOU DENY MY EXISTENCE FOR ALL THESE YEARS, TEACH OTHERS THAT I DON'T<br /> EXIST AND EVEN CREDIT CREATION TO SOME COSMIC ACCIDENT. DO YOU EXPECT<br /> ME TO HELP YOU OUT OF THIS PREDICAMENT? AM I TO COUNT YOU AS A<br /> BELIEVER?""</p>
<p>Difficult as it was, the atheist looked directly into the light and<br /> said, ""It would be hypocritical to ask to be a Christian after all<br /> these years, but perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?""</p>
<p>""VERY WELL."" Said God.</p>
<p>The light went out.</p>
<p>The river ran.</p>
<p>The sounds of the forest resumed.</p>
<p>... And the bear dropped down on his knees, brought both paws<br /> together, bowed his head and spoke: ""Lord, thank you for this food<br /> which I am about to receive.""</p>

12929,"<p>The young bride approached her awaiting husband on their wedding night and demanded $20 for their first love making encounter. In his highly aroused state, he readily agreed.</p>
<p>This scenario was repeated each time they made love for the next 30 years,<br /> him thinking it was a cute way for her to buy new clothes, etc.</p>
<p>Arriving home around noon one day, she found her husband in a very drunken state. </p>
<p>Over the next few minutes she heard of the ravages of financial ruin<br /> caused by corporate down-sizing and it's effects on a 50 years old<br /> executive.</p>
<p>Calmly, she handed him a bank book showing deposits and interst for 30<br /> years totalling nearly $1 million dollars. Pointing across the parking lot, she gestured toward the local bank while handing him stock certificates worth nearly $2 million dollars and informing him that he was the largest stockholder in the bank.</p>
<p>She told him that for 30 years she had charged him each time they had sex, and this was the result of her investments.</p>
<p>By now he was distraught and beating his head against the side of the car.</p>
<p>She asked him why the disappointment at such good news and he replied, ""If I had known what you were doing, I would have given you all of my business!""</p>

"
12945,"<p>1. WHY ARE MEN SUCH JERKS?<br /> It's a testosterone thing. Much similar to your PMT thing, we men suffer from testosterone poisoning. Why do you think the average life span of a male is typically 10 years shorter (and it's not just from all the bitching and nagging we have to endure)? Hormone modifies behaviour. We're just misunderstood. </p>
<p>2. WHY DO MEN ALWAYS HAVE TO OGLE AT OTHER WOMEN?<br /> Again, this is a testosterone thing. Do you honestly think that all the testosterone just fell out of our bodies the moment we met you? Besides, women do it as well. Women are just much better at not getting caught. I'm fairly certain it's some sort of photographic memory deal. Women take One quick look and memorize it for later reference. Since men lack this ability, we try to burn it into our memory by staring as much as we can. </p>
<p>3. WHY DO MEN ALWAYS TOUCH THEMSELVES, ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC?<br /> We occasionally need to adjust our little friend and make him happy. It's much like adjusting your bra. Being in public is just an added bonus. </p>
<p>4. WHY DO MEN ALWAYS SAY SUCH STUPID THINGS?<br /> We like to. It's actually a whole lot of fun to see our partner Frustrated by a few simple (and well chosen) words. </p>
<p>5. WHY ARE MEN SO UNCOMMUNICATIVE?<br /> You'd learn to keep your big mouth shut too if every time you open it you get into trouble with your partner. </p>
<p>6. WHY DO MEN HAVE TO ACT LIKE SUCH RETARDS?<br /> Well, we don't actually have to; we do it because we enjoy it. It's the Old fashioned pride in a job well done that's missing in so much of the world nowadays. </p>
<p>7. WHY CAN'T MEN JUST SHARE THEIR FEELINGS?<br /> Do we look like women to you? Why is it so hard to understand that men And women are different? How are we supposed to share how we feel when we have no idea how we feel? Unless we're experiencing some extreme emotion like rage, hatred, disgust, or a brick on our foot, we have no idea how we feel. Personally, I get a headache whenever I try to figure out how I feel. </p>
<p>8. WHY CAN'T MEN CUDDLE MORE (I.E. LIE DOWN AND HUG)?<br /> Please... How many hours do you think there is in a day? We oblige you as much as we can, but who the hell (besides women) can stand lying around for hours on end? We men... Men hunters... Need go roam... Starve in cave...Must go find wildebeest... Now sitting on our arses for hours on end on the other hand is a whole other story. </p>
<p>9. HOW CAN MEN SIT ON THEIR ARSES ALL DAY WITHOUT MOVING?<br /> Men have very powerful sets of sitting muscles developed by evolution that enable us to sit for extended periods of time without getting tired. In prehistoric times, it was often necessary to sit in one spot for extended periods of time while hunting for prey. The more successful hunters were able to sit very still for very extended periods of time there by passing on this ability to their progeny. The fidgety types were all gobbled up by Saber toothed tigers etc. The end result is that almost all modern men are born with this innate ability. </p>
<p>10. WHY CAN'T MEN JUST SAY ""I LOVE YOU?""<br /> Men are taught from a tender young age to be self-sufficient. To say that we love you is equivalent to saying that we need you. Most men consider that a character fault. It's not easy to admit to one's own character faults. </p>
<p>11. WHY DO MEN SAY ""I LOVE YOU"" WHEN THEY HARDLY KNOW ME?<br /> Ho, Ho, Ho... Aren't you special? Well, some men think it's a sure fire way to get into your pants. Surprisingly, it actually still works quite well. </p>
<p>12. WHY DOESN'T MY PARTNER EVER ANSWER ME?<br /> We just simply don't have the energy to answer every single one of your questions. If we think we do not have the answer, or that you will not like the answer, we simply remain quiet and save the energy for other things. </p>
<p>13. WHY WON'T MEN EVER PICK UP AFTER THEMSELVES?<br /> Why should we? It doesn't really bother us that much. Besides, we know damn well you'll pick it up. </p>
<p>14. WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BELCHING AND FARTING?<br /> This usually only occurs after months of courting. It's our way to let youknow that we're comfortable with you. Believe it or not, it's actually asign of affection. Besides, holding it for extended periods of time gives us stomach cramps. </p>
<p>15. WHY DO MEN HATE SHOPPING?<br /> It's an evolutionary thing. Men hunt. Women gather. We just want to go out, kill it, and bring it back. Who wants to spend hours and hours to look at things we have no intention of killing? Err... buying? Squiffy's House of Fun</p>

12948,"<p>Once upon a time, allegedly, in a nice little forest, there lived an orphaned<br /> bunny and an orphaned snake. By surprising coincidence both were blind from<br /> birth. One day, the bunny was hopping through the forest, and the snake was<br /> slithering through the forest, when the bunny tripped over the snake and fell<br /> down. This, of course, knocked the snake about quite a bit. </p>
<p>'Oh, my,' said the bunny, 'I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I've<br /> been blind since birth, so, I can't see where I'm going. In fact, since I'm also<br /> an orphan, I don't even know what I am.'</p>
<p>'It's quite OK,' replied the snake. 'Actually, my story is much the same as<br /> yours. I, too, have been blind since birth, and also never knew my mother. Tell<br /> you what, maybe I could slither all over you, and work out what you are, so at<br /> least you'll have that going for you.'</p>
<p>'Oh, that would be wonderful,' replied the bunny. So the snake slithered all<br /> over the bunny, and said, 'Well, you're covered with soft fur; you have really<br /> long ears; your nose twitches; and you have a soft cottony tail. I'd say that<br /> you must be a bunny rabbit.'</p>
<p>'Oh, thank you! Thank you,' cried the bunny in obvious excitement.</p>
<p>The bunny suggested to the snake, 'Maybe I could feel you all over with my<br /> paw, and help you the same way you've helped me.' So the bunny felt the snake<br /> all over, and remarked, 'Well, you're scaly and smooth, and you have a forked<br /> tongue, no backbone and no balls. I'd say you must be either an accountant, or<br /> possibly someone in senior management.'</p>

Other passengers left their seats and came running over; suddenly the aircraft was rocked by a second blast as yet another engine exploded on the other side. The passengers were in a panic now, and even the stewardesses couldn't maintain order. Just then, standing tall and smiling confidently, the pilot strode from the cockpit and assured everyone that there was nothing to worry about. His words and his demeanor seemed made most of the passengers feel better, and they sat down as the pilot calmly walked to the door of the aircraft. There, he grabbed several packages from under the seats and began handing them to the flight attendants. Each crew member attached the package to their backs. ""Say,"" spoke up an alert passenger, ""Aren't those parachutes?"" The pilot confirmed that they were.The passenger went on, ""But I thought you said there was nothing to worry about?"" ""There isn't,"" replied the pilot as a third engine exploded. ""We're going to get help.""</p>

Then when I called the next day, you could have said that he had fallen off and the vet was working on patching him up.  Then  when I called the third day, you could have said he had passed away.''  The brother thought about it and apologized. ""So how's Mom?"" asked the man.""She's on the roof and won't come down.""</p>

12980,"<p>A noted sex therapist realized that people often lie about the frequency of their encounters, so he devised a test to tell for certain how often someone had sex. To prove his theory, he filled up an auditorium with people, and went down the line asking each person to smile. Using the size of the person's smile, the therapist was able to guess accurately how often each person had sex. The last man in line was grinning from ear to ear.""Twice a day,"" the therapist guessed, but was surprised when the man said no.""Once a day, then?"" Again the answer was no.""Twice a week?"" ""No."" ""Twice a month?"" ""No."" When the doctor asked, ""Once a year?"" the man finally said yes. The therapist was angry that his theory hadn't worked with this individual, and he asked the man, ""What the heck are you so happy about?"" The man answered, ""TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT!""</p>

12982,"<p>Computer novices may feel like they're alone these days, but some of the following calls to IBM's help center show there are plenty of people out there who still are inching onto the information superhighway. After a caller gave a technician her PC's serial number, he scanned a database of registered users and responded, ""I see you have an Aptiva"" desktop unit. Before he could say another word, the caller shrieked and said she'd be right back. When the customer returned, the technician asked if she was all right. The caller responded: ""Had I realized you could see me, I never would have telephoned in my bathrobe.""<br /> A customer who had just received a laptop computer asked about the power-saving feature known as ""hibernate."" Would this hibernate device work in the spring and summer, the caller asked. </p>
<p>Another caller explained she had received a gift of software on 5.25-inch diskettes, but she had only a 3.5-inch disk drive on her computer. The technician said she had two options: Get a second disk drive, or use 3.5-inch diskettes. The customer called back later, now complaining that her disk drive was making a terrible noise. And this despite the fact that she was using a 3.5-inch diskette, she said. After a bunch of questions, the technician determined the caller had used a pair of scissors to trim the 5.25-inch diskettes to fit the 3.5-inch drive. </p>
<p>A caller, perplexed that his new desktop computer - the one that was supposed to do everything short of bringing on world peace - was doing nothing, cried out for help. No problem, the IBM technician said. First, open a ""window"" to launch a specific program. The conversation continued, and the caller asked a few moments later if it might be all right to close the window. Why, the IBM technician asked. Because, the caller responded, it was getting very chilly.</p>

12983,"<p>By Barbara Florio GrahamFrom McCall's, June, 1983I read every diet I can get my hands on.  I even follow their suggestions.  But eventually, inevitably, I always get fat again.  Now, at last, I've found The Answer.  After living for almost 14 years with a man who never gains an ounce no matter what I serve him, I've found out what it is that keeps him thin: He thinks differently.  The real difference between fat and thin people is that thin people:avoid eating popcorn in the movies because it gets their hands greasy;split a large combination pizza with three friends;think Oreo cookies are for kids;nibble cashews one at a time;think that doughnuts are indigestible;read books they have to hold with both hands;become so absorbed in a weekend project they forget to have lunch;fill the candy dish on their desks with paper clips;counteract the midafternoon slump with a nap instead of a cinnamon Danish;exchange the deep-fryer they received for Christmas for a clock-radio;lose their appetites when they're depressed;think chocolate Easter bunnies are for kids;save leftovers that are too skimpy to use for another meal in order to make interesting soups;throw out stale potato chips;will eat only Swiss or Dutch chocolate, which cannot be found except in a special store;think it's too much trouble to stop at a special store just to buy chocolate;don't celebrate with a hot-fudge sundae every time they lose a pound;warm up after skiing with black coffee instead of hot chocolate and whipped cream;try all the salads at the buffet, leaving room for only one dessert;find iced tea more refreshing than an ice-cream soda;get into such interesting conversations at cocktail parties that they never quite work their way over to the hors-d'oeuvre table;have no compulsion to keep the candy dish symmetrical by reducing the jelly beans to an equal number of each color;think that topping brownies with ice cream makes too rich a dessert;bring four cookies into the TV room instead of a box;think banana splits are for kids.</p>

12987,"<p>When Apollo Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, he not only said his famous ""One Small Step for Man, One Giant Leap for Mankind"" statement, but followed it by several remarks - usual  communication traffic between him, the other astronauts and Mission Control. Before  he re-entered the lander, he made the enigmatic remark ""Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.""</p>
<p>Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut; however, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian nor American space programs. Over the years, many people have questioned him as to what the  ""Good luck, Mr. Gorsky"" statement meant.</p>
<p>On July 5, in Tampa Bay, FL, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26 year old question to Armstrong. He finally responded.</p>
<p>It seems that Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Armstrong felt he could answer the question: ""When I was a kid, I was playing baseball with my brother in the backyard. He had hit a fly ball which landed in front of my neighbors' bedroom window. The neighbors were Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky.  As I leaned down to pick up the ball, I heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, ""Oral sex? Oral sex you want? You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!""</p>

The agent<br /> scoured a map of the state of New York and finally offered, ""You<br /> don't mean Buffalo, do you?""</p>

12997,"<p>The wealthy wife of a very successful Jewish businessman went to the portrait artist for her first sitting. The portrait, a gift for her husband. She explained to the artist what she wanted: ""You should paint me like I am. These little wrinkles, you put them on your canvas. The lines under my eyes, the flab on my arms, the turn in my nose, and the mole on my cheek, they all stay....BUT on my hands you put lots of rings with big diamonds and emeralds and bright jewels. Around my neck you put chains of gold and diamonds. Do you understand?"" </p>
<p>The artist looked at her in earnest and asked why she should want such detail of real life in her physical appearance, but adorn herself with the phony jewelry. </p>
<p>She replied: ""When I die my husband will re-marry. The new wife, she should go crazy looking for the jewels"".</p>

12999,"<p>Dave works hard at the plant and spends most evenings bowling or playing basketball at the gym. His wife thinks he is pushing himself too hard, so for his birthday she takes him to a local strip club.</p>
<p>The doorman at the club greets them and says, ""Hey, Dave, how ya doin?""</p>
<p>His wife is puzzled and asks if he's been to this club before. ""Oh no,"" says Dave. ""He's on my bowling team.""</p>
<p>When they are seated, a waitress asks Dave if he'd like his usual Budweiser. His wife is becoming uncomfortable and says, ""You must come here a lot for that woman to know you drink Budweiser"".</p>
<p>""No, honey, she's in the Ladies Bowling League. We share lanes with them.""</p>
<p>A stripper comes over to their table and throws her arms around Dave. ""Hi Davey,"" she says, ""Want your usual table dance?""</p>
<p>Dave's wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club. Dave follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her and she starts screaming at him.</p>
<p>The cabby turns his head and says, ""Looks like you picked up a real bitch tonight, Dave.""!</p>
