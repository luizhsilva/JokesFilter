<p>what her parents are doing.... </p>

<p>the morning. At breakfast she asks her mother, ""Mommy, what's sex?"" </p>
<p>""Sex happens when a man and woman get married,"" her mother replies. ""The </p>
<p>man puts his penis into the woman's vagina and they make a baby."" </p>
<p>The little girl thinks for a minute and says, ""Mommy, last night I saw you </p>
<p>with Daddy's penis in your mouth! What do you get when you do that?"" </p>
<p>Her mother smiles and says, ""Jewelry!""</p>

13003,"<p>One afternoon, three close friends named Hercules, Sleeping Beauty and Don<br /> Juan, sat by the river contemplating their lives. </p>
<p>Bold and arrogant, Hercules exclaimed that he was surely the strongest person<br /> in the world. </p>
<p>""That may be true"", said Sleeping Beauty, ""But I am better because I am<br /> obviously the most beautiful person in the world."" </p>
<p>Don Juan laughed at both of them and said that without a doubt, he must be the<br /> greatest person alive simply because he had been with the most women. </p>
<p>After several hours of argument, they decided to consult a Guru for the truth. </p>
<p>First, Hercules went into Guru's cave. A few moments later he came out with<br /> a massive grin on his face. The Guru had said that he was, in fact, the<br /> strongest person in the world. He was very pleased. </p>
<p>Sleeping beauty came out of the cave with a lovely smile: ""It is true! I AM<br /> the most beautiful woman in the world!"" </p>
<p>Moments later a distraught Don Juan came stomping out of the cave: ""Who the<br /> hell is Bill Clinton!!???""</p>

13015,"<p>An Indian chief had three wives, each of whom was pregnant. The first gave birth to a boy. The chief was so elated he built her a teepee made of deer hide. A few days later, the second gave birth, also to a boy. The chief was very happy. He built her a teepee made of antelope hide. The third wife gave birth a few days later, but the chief kept the details a secret. He built this one a two story teepee, made out of a hippopotamus hide. The chief then challenged the tribe to guess what had occurred. Many tried, unsuccessfully. Finally, one young brave declared that the third wife had given birth to twin boys. ""Correct,"" said the chief. ""How did you figure it out?"" The warrior answered, ""It's elementary. The value of the squaw of the hippopotamus is equal to the sons of the squaws of the other two hides.""</p>

13022,"<p>A general store owner hires a young female clerk with a penchant for very short skirts. One day a young man enters the store, glances at the clerk, and glances at the loaves of bread behind the counter. 'I`d like some raisin bread, please,' the man says politely.The clerk nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, located on the very top shelf. The man, standing almost directly beneath her, is provided with an excellent view.As the clerk retrieves the bread, a small group of male customers gather around the young man, looking in the same direction. Pretty soon each person is asking for raisin bread, just to see the clerk climb up and down.After a few trips the clerk is tired and irritated. She stops and fumes at the top of the ladder, glaring at the men standing below. She notices an elderly man standing amongst the throng. 'Is yours raisin too?' the clerk yells testily.'No,' croaks the feeble old man....'But it's startin' to twitch.'Bonus Joke: If a case of the clap spreads, is it called applause?</p>

13037,"<p>So you want a day off. Let's take a look at what you are asking for. There are<br /> 365 days per year available for work. There are 52 weeks per year in which you<br /> already have 2 days off per week, leaving 261 days available for work. Since you<br /> spend 16 hours each day away fron work, you have used up 170 days, leaving only<br /> 91 days available. You spend 30 minutes each day on coffee break which counts<br /> for 23 days each year, leaving only 68 days available. With a 1 hour lunch each<br /> day, you used up another 46 days, leaving only 22 days available for work. You<br /> normally spend 2 days per year on sick leave. This leaves you only 20 days per<br /> year available for work. We are off 5 holidays per year, so your available<br /> working time is down to 15 days. We generously give 14 days vacation per year<br /> which leaves only 1 day available for work and I'll be darned if you are going<br /> to take that day off!</p>

13055,"<p>Saint Peter is doing his thing , minding the Gates of Heaven , when he notices that the Gates are getting a bit shabby and shopworn and in need of repair. </p>
<p>He goes outside to the line of people waiting to come ""in"" and asks ""ARE THERE ANY CONTRACTORS HERE?"" </p>
<p>Three guys step foreward.........<br /> A Black Man, an Italian, and a Jew. </p>
<p>Peter asks the three to inspect the Gates and then give a price ,with a breakdown. </p>
<p>First, the Black guy goes over and looks at the Gates.<br /> ""I think $900.00 should do it"" he says.<br /> ""That would be $300. for materials, $300. for labor , and $300 for me""<br /> ""Great "",says Peter </p>
<p>Next the Italian guy inspects the Gates.<br /> He takes a long time ,pouring over every bit of what he surveys, then comes back to St. Peter and tells him that ""These are the most wonderful, beautiful Gates!! They were almost certainly constructed in Italy, probably Florence , in the Renaissance! Pure Works of Art!"" The price...$3,000. I'll need $1000 for materials, $1,000 for the finest Italian craftsmen and $1,000 for my profit"" ""OK""<br /> ""Thanks"" says Peter and now the Jew. </p>
<p>He quickly surveys the Gates and returns to Peter. </p>
<p>""The price is $2,900...<br /> That's $1,000 for you, $1,000 for me , and we hire the colored guy!</p>

<p>And of course we have to mention Clinton because he's a factor while all this<br /> is going on. Clinton is of course Toto, because throughout all this he's trying<br /> to get up into Dorothy's skirt.</p>

13059,"<p>One day, there was a red hotel run by Mrs. Red.  On that day,<br /> she had three boarders; Mr. Orange, Mr. White, and Mrs. Blue.<br /> Each of the  boarders had a red room with a red door, a red<br /> keyhole, etc.  That day, Mr. Orange left his room to request a<br /> maid.  He went out the red door, down the red steps, through the<br /> red rec room, through the red dining room, through the red<br /> kitchen, up the red stairs and opened the red door to Mrs. Red's<br /> room to ask for a maid.  He was granted the wish and returned to<br /> his red room going out the red door, down the red steps, through<br /> the red kitchen, through the red dining room, through the red<br /> rec room, and up the red steps.  Next, Mr. White wanted to<br /> request a special meal.  He went out the red door, down the red<br /> steps, through the red rec room, through the red dining room,<br /> through the red kitchen, up the red stairs and opened the red<br /> door to Mrs. Red's room to ask for a special meal.  He was<br /> granted the wish and returned to his red room going out the red<br /> door, down the red steps, through the red kitchen, through the<br /> red dining room, through the red rec room, and up the red steps.<br /> Next, Mrs. Blue wanted to complain about the absence of hot<br /> water in her bathroom.  She went out the red door, down the red<br /> steps, through the red rec room, through the red dining room,<br /> through the red kitchen, up the red stairs and opened the red<br /> door to Mrs. Red's room to complain about the water.  The water<br /> was fixed and she returned to her red room going out the red<br /> door, down the red steps, through the red kitchen, through the<br /> red dining room, through the red rec room, and up the red steps.<br /> The next morning, breakfast time came.  Mr. Orange came down the<br /> red stairs, through the red dining room, through the red rec<br /> room to the red kitchen.  He got out a red bowl, a red spoon,<br /> some red milk, and red Cheerios.  He poured the red milk and the<br /> red Cheerios into the red bowl and used the red spoon to eat<br /> every bit.  When he was finished, he washed the red bowl and the<br /> red spoon.  He put the red Cheerios and the red milk where they<br /> belonged.  He went back through the red dining room, the red rec<br /> room, up the red stairs, and back to his red room.  Next, Mr.<br /> White came down for breakfast.  He came down the red stairs,<br /> through the red dining room, through the red rec room to the red<br /> kitchen.  He got out a red bowl, a red spoon, some red milk, and<br /> red Frosted Flakes.  He poured the red milk and the red Frosted<br /> Flakes into the red bowl and used the red spoon to eat every<br /> bit.  When he was finished, he washed the red bowl and the red<br /> spoon.  He put the red Frosted Flakes and the red milk where<br /> they belonged.  He went back through the red dining room, the<br /> red rec room, up the red stairs, and back to his red room.<br /> Finally, Mrs. Blue wanted breakfast.  She came down the red<br /> stairs, through the red dining room, through the red rec room to<br /> the red kitchen.  She got out a red bowl, a red spoon, some red<br /> milk, and red Cheerios.  She poured the red milk and the red<br /> Cheerios into the red bowl and used the red spoon to eat every<br /> bit.  When she was finished, she washed the red bowl and the red<br /> spoon.  She put the red Cheerios and the red milk where they<br /> belonged.  She went back through the red dining room, the red<br /> rec room, up the red stairs, and back to her red room.  The<br /> moral of this story is that two out of three people prefer<br /> Cheerios over Frosted Flakes.</p>

13082,"<p>Once upon a time there lived a woman in Brampton who had a maddening passion for baked beans. She loved them, but unfortunately they always gave her a very embarrassing, and somewhat lively reaction. When it became apparent that she and her boyfriend would marry she thought to herself, ''He is such a sweet and gentle man but I don't think he can live with my problems.'' So she decided to make the supreme sacrifice and give up beans.A year later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country, she called her husband and told him she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she could walk off any ill effect by the time she reached home. So she stopped at the diner, and before she knew it she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted.Upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her, exclaming delightedly, ''Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight.'' He then blindfolded her then led her to a chair at the table. Just as he was about to remove the blindfold the phone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold till he came back. Then he went to answer the phone.The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted the weight to one leg, and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelt like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk coming froma pulp mill. She took a napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cabbage cooking. Keeping her ears turned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signed the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with the napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contently to herself, she was the picture of innocence when her husband returned. Apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removes the blindfold to reveal twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a first Happy Anniversary!</p>

So the old man, as a favour to his best friend, went to the pet store and talked the owner into letting him use a female parrot for one night for the fee of 40 dollars. He took the female home, put it into the cage with his parrot, covered the cage and went to bed. He was awoken in the middle of the night to the female parrot screaming she was being killed. He ran out and pulled the cover off the cage. There he saw his male parrot ripping all the feathers off of the female. ""What are you doing?"" the old man screamed. The parrot replied, ""Are you kidding, for 40 dollars, I at least want the bitch naked!!""</p>

13097,"<p>Seems there was this nasty biker riding his Harley down the icy highway one<br /> cold day in Colorado, when he spotted a cat lying in the middle of the road.<br /> The biker thought to himself,  ""I'll cut that cat in two,""  and he bore down on<br /> it hard. </p>
<p>As he got closer, though, he suddenly realized that it was not a cat, but a<br /> large piece of metal lying in the road.  Too late!  His front wheel plowed into<br /> it and he was sent flying over the handlebars and onto the road at 80 MPH. </p>
<p>When he arrived in Hell, the person welcoming the new arrivals was the Devil<br /> himself.  As the Devil shook the ex-biker's hand, he asked mockingly,  ""So, how<br /> do you like it here?"" </p>
<p>The bad-ass biker replied,  ""Man, this is one COOL place!"" </p>
<p>The old Devil was just a little miffed at this upstart, so he decided to crank<br /> up the thermostat a notch.  The next day, the Devil sought out the biker and<br /> asked,  ""So, how do you like it now?"" </p>
<p>The biker responded by saying,  ""This is great!  Reminds me of those drug runs<br /> to Sonora during the hot afternoons in August."" </p>
<p>Naturally, the Devil was only more angered, and cranked the heat up as far as<br /> it could go.  The next day, Hell was unbelievable.  Even some demons were<br /> melting into the floor.  The Devil again found the biker, and asked how he was<br /> holding up.  Undaunted, the biker proclaimed, ""It's almost as hot as the time I<br /> beat and robbed those vacationers out in Death Valley.  I love it!"" </p>
<p>By now the Devil was just furious, so he turned the thermostat all the way<br /> down.  Way down!  As far down as could ever be imagined. The next morning, he<br /> tracked down the biker again and asked,  ""OK smart-ass, how do you like it NOW?"" </p>
<p>With icicles hanging from every part of his body, the biker shivered and<br /> chattered,  ""W-w-w-what h-h-hhappened, d-d-d-did the Broncos f-f-finally w-w-win<br /> the Super Bowl?""</p>

<p>He thinks it was just a figment of his imagination and drives on without a second thought. Soon, he sees another sign that says, 'Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution 8 km' and realizes that these signs are for real. When he drives past a third sign saying, 'Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution Next Right' his curiosity gets the better of him and he pulls into the drive.</p>
<p>On the far side of the parking lot is a sombre stone building with a small sign next to the door saying, 'Sisters of Mercy'. </p>

13168,"<p>Recently, on an outing with my scout troop, the question came up of when the new millenium will begin--January 1st 2000 or 2001.</p>
<p>So the Scoutmaster explained that each century begins with year ""1"" and ends with year ""100""-thus the reason why the 20th century began at the start of 1901 and will end at the close of 2000.</p>
<p>To illustrate his point, he gathered 15 berries and asked the boys how many he had.<br /> Each boy correctly answered ""15"".</p>
<p>His next question was, ""Now which berry is number '0'?""<br /> To which one boy blurted out, ""The one that isn't there!""</p>

13180,"<p>A family of three lived in a small farm: the parents and a kid.</p>
<p>One day dad went off to work and mom told the boy what his<br /> chores were for that day: First feed the pigs, then put the<br /> chickens back in the cage, and then let the cows out in the<br /> field to graze.</p>
<p>The boy went out to feed the pigs. He was in a very bad mood for<br /> having to do such stupid chores, but he didn't want to disobey<br /> his mom so he fed the pigs like he should; but he hit them with<br /> sticks and grumbled to himself. Next he went to put the chickens<br /> in their cage; but while putting them into the cage he started<br /> kicking and yelling at them. And last he went to let the cows<br /> out in the field; since he was still in a bad mood he started<br /> chasing the cows and yelling at them.</p>
<p>Mom saw all this happen and when the boy came back from his<br /> chores she told him, ""I saw the way you threw stuff at the pigs,<br /> so for a week you don't get any bacon for breakfast. I also saw<br /> the way you kicked and yelled at the chickens so for one week no<br /> eggs or chicken. I also saw the way you chased the cows while<br /> putting them out in the field, so no hamburgers for you for a<br /> week.""</p>
<p>Later that day, the dad came home from a terrible day at work.<br /> As the dad walked up to the house he almost tripped over the<br /> cat. ""Damn cat!"" So he kicked it really hard.</p>
<p>The boy turned to his mom and asked, ""Should I tell him or<br /> should you?""</p>

<p>""Well, turn on the office light then.""<br /> ""I can't."" </p>

13204,"<p>There was this young couple who have dated since high school, but they have never had sex, because the boy's mother always told him that what a woman has between her legs has teeth. For obvious reasons the boy was always afraid to venture down there. </p>
<p>They finally marry, and on their wedding night, the young groom walks out of the bathroom to find his new bride dressed in a very sexy negligie and lying invitingly on the bed. She says to him, ""Oh honey, here's the moment we've been waiting for. It is time to consummate our marriage."" </p>
<p>He is apparently flustered, and says, ""Oh, no....I'm not going down there!"" </p>
<p>The confused bride asks, ""Why?"". </p>
<p>He turned to her and said, ""Well, my mother always told me that what a woman has between her legs, has teeth."" </p>
<p>The bride laughed and said, ""That's nonsense, let me show you."" </p>
<p>So, she whips off her negligie, spreads her legs open, and pulls her pussy lips apart and says, ""See honey, no teeth"" </p>

<p>The other organ I have for you is called a penis. It will allow you to reproduce your now intelligent life form and populate this planet. Eve will be very happy that you now have this organ to give her children.</p>
<p>Adam, very excited, exclaimed, ""These are great gifts you have given to me. What could possibly be bad news after such great tidings?</p>
<p>""God looked upon Adam and said with great sorrow, ""The bad news is that when I created you, I only gave you enough blood to operate these organs one at a time.""</p>

13216,"<p>Memo to: The members of the Kansas Board of Education</p>
<p>From: God</p>
<p>Re: Your decision to eliminate the teaching of evolution as science.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support. Much obliged.</p>
<p>Now, go forth and multiply. Beget many children. And yea, your<br /> children shall beget children. And their children shall beget<br /> children and their children's children after them. And in time the<br /> genes that have made you such pinheads will be eliminated through<br /> natural selection. Because that is how it works.</p>
<p>Listen, I love all my creatures equally, and gave each his own special<br /> qualities to help him on Earth. The horse I gave great strength. The<br /> antelope I gave great grace and speed. The dung beetle I gave great<br /> stupidity, so he doesn't realize he is a dung beetle. Man I gave a<br /> brain.</p>
<p>Use it, okay?</p>
<p>I admit I am not perfect. I've made errors. (Armpit hair--what was I<br /> thinking?) But do you Kansans seriously believe that I dropped half-a-<br /> billion-year-old trilobite skeletons all over my great green Earth by<br /> mistake? What, I had a few lying around some previous creation in the<br /> Andromeda galaxy, and they fell through a hole in my pocket? You<br /> were supposed to find them. And once you found them, you were supposed<br /> to draw the appropriate, intelligent conclusions. </p>
<p>That's what I made you for: To think.</p>
<p>The folks who wrote the Bible were smart and good people. Mostly, they<br /> got it right. But there were glitches. Imprecision�s. For one thing,<br /> they said that Adam and Eve begat Cain and Abel, and then Cain begat<br /> Enoch. How was that supposed to have happened? They left out Tiffany<br /> entirely! Well, they also were a little off on certain elements of<br /> timing and sequence. So what? You guys were supposed to figure it all<br /> out for yourselves, anyway. When you stumble over the truth, you are<br /> not supposed to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and proceed on as<br /> though nothing had happened. If you find a dinosaur's toe, you're not<br /> supposed to look for reasons to call it a croissant. You're not big,<br /> drooling idiots. For that, I made dogs. Why do you think there are no<br /> fossilized human toes dating from a hundred million years ago? Think<br /> about it.</p>
<p>It's okay if you think. In fact, I prefer it. That's why I like<br /> Charlie Darwin. He was always a thinker. Still is. He and I chat<br /> frequently. I know a lot of people figure that if man evolved from<br /> other organisms, it means I don't exist. I have to admit this is a<br /> reasonable assumption and a valid line of thought. I am in favor of<br /> thought. I encourage you to pursue this concept with an open mind, and<br /> see where it leads you. That's all I have to say right now, except<br /> that I'm really cheesed off at laugh tracks on sitcoms, and the NRA,<br /> and people who make simple declarative sentences sound like questions? </p>
<p>Oh, wait. There's one more thing.</p>
<p>Did you read in the newspapers yesterday how scientists in Australia<br /> dug up some rocks and found fossilized remains of life dating back<br /> further than ever before? Primitive, multicolor animals on Earth<br /> nearly 3 billion years ago, when the planet was nothing but roiling<br /> muck and ice and fire. And inside those cells was . . . DNA.<br /> Incredibly complex strands of chemicals, laced together in a scheme so<br /> sophisticated no one yet understands exactly how it works. I wonder<br /> who could have thought of something like that, back then.</p>
<p>Just something to gnaw on.</p>

He weaited several seconds more to make his point and then swiftly jabbed the alligator in both eyes with his fingers.<br /> The alligator flipped over on his back, jumped up, and ran into the corner of the office, glaring angrily at the sergeant-major.<br /> ''That, you 'orrible bunch, is what we in the Paras call COMMITMENT. Now which one of you 'orrible little men is ready to demonstrate his COMMITMENT?''<br /> There was much shuffling of feet and murmuring until finally one young lad stepped forward.

13235,"<p>New Rules<br /> Dear Employee:</p>
<p>As a result of the reduction of money budgeted for department areas, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel.</p>
<p>Under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.</p>
<p>This program will be known as SLAP (Sever Late-Aged Personnel). Employees who are SLAPPED will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company.</p>
<p>SLAPPED employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This review phase of the program is called SCREW.</p>
<p>SCREW (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers). All employees who have been SLAPPED and SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management.</p>
<p>This appeal is called SHAFT (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination).</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be SLAPPED once, SCREWED twice, but may be SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate.</p>
<p>If an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel's Early Severance) or CLAP (Combined Lump sum Assistance Payment).</p>
<p>As HERPES and CLAP are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received HERPES or CLAP will no longer be SLAPPED or SCREWED by the company.</p>
<p>Management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our:</p>
<p>Special High Intensity Training (SHIT). We take pride in the amount of SHIT our employees receive. We have given our employees more SHIT than any company in this area. If any employee feels they do not receive enough SHIT on the job, see your immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>Your supervisor is specially trained to make sure you receive all the SHIT you can stand.</p>
<p>And, once again, thanks for all your years of service with us.</p>

""Do you smoke?""""Yeah, I smoke,"" says the little old gal. ""I smoke 4 packs of cigarettes a day and a couple of cigars while I'm shooting pool."" The biker is impressed and asks, ""Well, have you ever been picked up by the Fuzz?""The little old lady thinks for a moment, then she says, ""No,never been picked up by the fuzz. But I have been swung around by my nipples a few times!""</p>

<p>Only one man sat motionless among the ensuing forest of raised hands. When asked what he would do, he replied that he would be quite content to stay aboard. With his team's software, he said, the plane was unlikely to taxi as far as the runway let alone take off.</p>

13254,"<p>IF AIRLINES SOLD PAINT . . .</p>
<p>Customer: Hi. How much is your paint?<br /> Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends on quite a lot of things.</p>
<p>Customer: Can you give me a guess? Is there an average price?<br /> Clerk: Our lowest price is $12 a gallon, and we have 60 different prices up to $200 a gallon.</p>
<p>Customer: What's the difference in the paint?<br /> Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.</p>
<p>Customer: Well, then I'd like some of that $12 paint.<br /> Clerk: When do you intend to use the paint?</p>
<p>Customer: I want to paint tomorrow. It's my day off.<br /> Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.</p>
<p>Customer: When would I have to paint to get the $12 paint?<br /> Clerk: You would have to start very late at night in about 3 weeks. But you will have to agree to start painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until at least Sunday.</p>
<p>Customer: You've got to be *&amp;%^#@* kidding!<br /> Clerk: I'll check and see if we have any paint available.</p>
<p>Customer: You have shelves FULL of paint! I can see it!<br /> Clerk: But it doesn't mean that we have paint available. We sell only a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price per gallon just went to $16. We don't have any more $12 paint.</p>
<p>Customer: The price went up as we were talking?<br /> Clerk: Yes, sir. We change the prices and rules hundreds of times a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with your paint yet, we just decided to change. I suggest you purchase your paint as soon as possible. How many gallons do you want?</p>
<p>Customer: Well, maybe five gallons. Make that six, so I'll have enough.<br /> Clerk: Oh no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy paint and don't use it, there are penalties and possible confiscation of the paint you already have.</p>
<p>Customer: WHAT?<br /> Clerk: We can sell enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do the bedroom, you will lose your remaining gallons of paint.</p>
<p>Customer: What does it matter whether I use all the paint? I already paid you for it!<br /> Clerk: We make plans based upon the idea that all our paint is used, every drop. If you don't, it causes us all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>Customer: This is crazy!! I suppose something terrible happens if I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!<br /> Clerk: Oh yes! Every gallon you bought automatically becomes the $200 paint.</p>
<p>Customer: But what are all these, ""Paint on sale from $10 a liter"" signs?<br /> Clerk: Well that's for our budget paint. It only comes in half-gallons. One $5 half-gallon will do half a room. The second half-gallon to complete the room is $20. None of the cans have labels, some are empty and there are no refunds, even on the empty cans.</p>
<p>Customer: To hell with this! I'll buy what I need somewhere else!<br /> Clerk: I don't think so, sir. You may be able to buy paint for your bathroom and bedrooms, and your kitchen and dining room from someone else, but you won't be able to paint your connecting hall and stairway from anyone but us. And I should point out, sir, that if you paint in only one direction, it will be $300 a gallon.</p>
<p>Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $200!<br /> Clerk: That's if you paint around the room to the point at which you started. A hallway is different.</p>
<p>Customer: And if I buy $200 paint for the hall, but only paint in one direction, you'll confiscate the remaining paint.<br /> Clerk: No, we'll charge you an extra use fee plus the difference on your next gallon of paint. But I believe you're getting it now, sir.</p>
<p>Customer: You're insane!<br /> Clerk: Thanks for painting with United.</p>

Go take a long, cold shower and pray for forgiveness.""  The dancer then proceeds to dance her sensuous dance around the third candidate. Slowly around him she dances, now devoid of all of her veils, but the third candidate remains unmoved.

Now, go and join your weaker  brethren in the shower."" *Ting-a-ling* goes the bell...</p>

13284,"<p>Some years ago, a New Orleans lawyer sought a direct Veterans Administration loan for a client. He was told that the loan would be approved if he could provide proof of clear title to the property offered as collateral. </p>
<p>The title for the property in question was complicated and he spent a considerable amount of time reviewing all pertinent documents back to 1803. Satisfied with the depth and expanse of his examination, he submitted the information to the VA. </p>
<p>He soon received a reply from the VA.: ""We received your letter today enclosing application for a loan for your client, supported by abstract of title. The application forms are complete, but you have not cleared the title before the year 1803. Therefore, before full review and possible approval can a be accorded the application, it will be necessary that the title be cleared back before that year."" </p>
<p>Annoyed, the lawyer wrote the V.A.: ""Your letter regarding titles in case #9378329 received. I note that you wish titles extended further back than I have presented. Your attention is invited to the following information to update your records for the property prior to 1803: </p>
<p>a) I was unaware that any educated person would not know that the United States gained clear title to Louisiana from France in 1803. This title transfer was a result of a real estate transaction known as The Louisiana Purchase. </p>
<p>b) France gained clear title to Louisiana by right of conquest from Spain under the Treaty of San Ildefonso (1800). </p>
<p>c) The land came into the possession of Spain by right of discovery in 1492 by a sailor named Christopher Columbus. He was acting on behalf of Isabella, Queen of Spain, and had her permission to claim newly discovered lands for Spain. </p>
<p>d) The good Queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles - almost as careful as the V.A.- took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before authorizing the voyage. </p>
<p>e) The Pope is a servant of God; God created the world. </p>
<p>f) Therefore, I believe that it is safe to presume that God created title that part of the world called Louisiana and thus was the original holder of the property in question.</p>

13301,"<p>A nun was sitting at a window in her convent one day... when she was handed a letter from home. Upon opening it a $10 bill dropped out. She was most pleased at receiving the gift from her home folks, but as she read the letter her attention was distracted by the actions of a shabbily dressed stranger who was leaning against a post in front of the convent. She couldn't get him off her mind and, thinking that he might be in financial difficulties, she took the $10 bill and wrapped it in a piece of paper, on which she had written, 'Don't despair, Sister Eulalia,' and threw it out of the window to him. He picked it up, read it, looked at her with a puzzled expression, tipped his hat and went off down the street. The next day she was in her cell saying her beads when she was told that some man was at her door who insisted on seeing her.She went down and found the shabbily dressed stranger waiting for her.

13304,"<p>Cleaner Polishes Off Patients.</p>
<p>South African Health - Pelonomi Hospital<br /> Date: 26 July 1996 10:08</p>
<p>""For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead<br /> patient in the same bed every Friday morning"" a spokeswoman for<br /> the Pelonomi Hospital (Free State, South Africa) told reporters.<br /> ""There was no apparent cause for any of the deaths, and extensive<br /> checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible<br /> bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues.""  ""However,<br /> further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths.<br /> It seems that every Friday morning a cleaner would enter the<br /> ward, remove the plug that powered the patient's life support<br /> system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go<br /> about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would<br /> plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the<br /> patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams<br /> and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.</p>
<p>""We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in<br /> question.  Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department<br /> is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there<br /> should be no repetition of this incident. The inquiry is now<br /> closed.""</p>

13354,"<p>A town in Poland had only one cow and it stopped giving milk. The<br /> townspeople did a little research and discovered they could get a cow from<br /> Moscow for 2000 rubles - or one from Minsk for only 1000 rubles. So,<br /> naturally, --- they got the cow from Minsk.</p>
<p>It was a great cow: had a wonderful disposition, and gave lots of milk and<br /> lots of cream. Everybody loved it dearly. The people decided they would<br /> mate the cow and get more cows like it, and then they would never have to<br /> worry about their milk supply again.</p>
<p>So they got a bull and led the cow and the bull into the pasture. When the<br /> bull came in from the right to mount the cow, the cow moved to the left.<br /> When the bull moved in to mount the cow from the left, the cow moved to the<br /> right. This went on all day.</p>
<p>Finally, in desperation, the people decided to go ask the rabbi what to do.<br /> After all he was very wise.</p>
<p>They told him the story. ""Rabbi, we've tried all day to mate our cow. When<br /> the bull moves in from the right the cow moves left and when the bull moves<br /> in from the left the cow moves to the right. What do we do?""</p>
<p>The Rabbi thought a moment and asked, ""Did you buy this cow from Minsk?""</p>
<p>""Rabbi!"" they replied as one, ""You are so wise! We never said we bought the<br /> cow from Minsk. How did you know that?"" </p>

<p>I sit so quietly in class<br /> Until I feel this pain of gas<br /> Which stabs intestines large and small:<br /> ""I hope that there's an empty stall!""</p>
<p>Or I can be in bed at nine<br /> And dreaming of a girl so fine<br /> When I awake! A siren wails<br /> From in my gut and my entrails!</p>
<p>In either case I must agree<br /> I always have to shit and pee!<br /> But why? For now I'll contemplate....<br /> ....And urinate and defecate!</p>
<p>If I can just ignore the smell,<br /> I'll try my best to do them well.<br /> Now to avoid those accidents,<br /> Pull down your pants, you gals and gents.</p>
<p>Unsnap the top, unzip the fly,<br /> And let them fall down past your thigh,<br /> And plant your butt cheeks on the seat,<br /> And--Oh my God! My heart is weak!</p>
<p>This seat's an iceberg, minus ten!<br /> As cold as liquid nitrogen!<br /> This morning cold is just the worst,<br /> But at least I get to use it first!</p>
<p>And now here comes the easy part:<br /> You must fire off a warning fart<br /> To let them know the bombs will fall--<br /> Forget about the other stall!</p>
<p>Let Nature do the rest; sit back<br /> And let the shit fall out your crack!<br /> It's fecal matter--hey, goodbye!<br /> Exit out my bottom eye!</p>
<p>And while I'm here, I might as well<br /> Excrete my urine, what the hell!<br /> It takes one minute for a piss,<br /> But just be sure that you don't miss!</p>
<p>Don't hit the walls or hit the doors.<br /> The janitors hate yellow floors.<br /> Now get your strength back; you'll be strong.<br /> When all that stress and strain is gone,</p>
<p>You'll have to wipe your fundament<br /> And clean the excess excrement!<br /> Just use that roll of mini towels,<br /> Protects your hands and cleans your bowels....</p>
<p>Unless the stuff's just too damn soft<br /> And rips so easily enough<br /> That fingers go right straight on through,<br /> Then my poor hand gets smeared with doo!</p>
<p>I want some stuff that's strong and fair,<br /> That lets me know that it was there<br /> A couple hours after use,<br /> So nothing gets left hanging loose.</p>
<p>Yes, toilet paper--that's the stuff!<br /> And damn, I hope I've got enough<br /> For one wipes, two wipes, three wipes, four!<br /> Five wipes, six wipes, seven, more!</p>
<p>Now push the handle; it goes down<br /> Into the sewer underground<br /> To give the sewer rats a treat.<br /> It's good enough for them to eat!</p>
<p>Or it will help the grass to rise,<br /> But now, I must zip up my fly,<br /> Do up my pants, connect my belt.<br /> I must admit, I haven't felt<br /> This good since this time yesterday!<br /> My shitting then went A-OK!</p>
<p>Now some clean people wash their hands.<br /> But me? Hell no! I'll take the chance!<br /> I must rush off to get some lunch,<br /> Some finger food that I can munch!</p>
<p>Oh crap! My ode is almost done.<br /> The time sure flies when you have fun.<br /> I hope you loved my words so true<br /> About a thing we all must do.</p>

13383,"<p>Two men in a bar are discussing their wives, when one admitted he had killed<br /> his that very morning.</p>
<p>""Why did you do it?"" asked the other.</p>

<p>With that the two of them left the bar and walked to a house, they went to<br /> the garden, and there was a fresh mound of earth, with a woman's ass<br /> sticking out the top.  </p>

13385,"<p>A phone company puts an ad in the paper that they are recruiting workers. The next day, two groups of workers show up- a crew of five Italian men and a crew of five blonde women. </p>
<p>The company cannot decide who to give the job to, so they give them a test. The company boss says, ""Each crew will receive a telephone pole that they must install into the ground. Whoever is able to hammer it in first, they will get the job."" </p>
<p>Both groups agree that this is a fair test, so off they go in the Company trucks with the long telephone poles sticking out the back. </p>
<p>A few hours pass, and finally, at 5:00, the Italian crew returns. ""YAY!!"" they shout. ""We came back first, we get the job!!"" </p>
<p>""Good work, men,"" says the boss, ""However, we must wait until the other crew comes back to make sure that the reason they're delayed is not because of traffic, or that the truck broke down."" </p>
<p>""Fine, no problem,"" say the men. </p>
<p>An hour passes, two hours pass, three hours. Finally, at 12:00, the Blonde crew arrive. All the group is flushed and breathing hard, as if they had just gone through harsh labor. </p>

13411,"<p>TO: Public Release</p>
<p>RE: Organizational Changes at the North Pole </p>
<p>The recent announcement that Donner and Blitzen have elected to<br /> take the early reindeer retirement package has triggered a good<br /> deal of concern about whether they will be replaced, and about<br /> other restructuring decisions at the North Pole. Streamlining<br /> was necessary due to the North Pole's loss of dominance of the<br /> season's gift distribution business. Home shopping channels and<br /> mail order catalogs have diminished Santa's market share. He<br /> could not sit idly by and permit further erosion of the profit<br /> picture. </p>
<p>The reindeer downsizing was made possible through the purchase<br /> of a late model Japanese sled for the CEO's annual trip.<br /> Improved productivity from Dasher and Dancer, who summered at<br /> the Harvard Business School, is anticipated. Reduction in<br /> reindeer will also lessen airborne environmental emissions for<br /> which the North Pole has received unfavorable press. I am<br /> pleased to inform you that Rudolph's role will not be disturbed.<br /> Tradition still counts for something at the North Pole.<br /> Management denies, in the strongest possible language, the<br /> earlier leak that Rudolph's nose got that way, not from the<br /> cold, but from substance abuse. Calling Rudolph ""a lush who was<br /> into the sauce and never did pull his share of the load"" was an<br /> unfortunate comment, made by one of Santa's helpers and taken<br /> out of context at a time of year when he is known to be under<br /> executive stress. </p>
<p>As a further restructuring, today's global challenges require<br /> the North Pole to continue to look for better, more competitive<br /> steps. Effective immediately, the following economy measures are<br /> to take place in the ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" subsidiary: </p>
<p>The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree never turned<br /> out to be the cash crop forecasted. It will be replaced by a<br /> plastic hanging plant, providing considerable savings in<br /> maintenance; </p>
<p>The two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not<br /> cost effective. In addition, their romance during working hours<br /> could not be condoned. The positions are therefore eliminated; </p>
<p>The three French hens will remain intact. After all, everyone<br /> loves the French; </p>
<p>The four calling birds were replaced by an automated voice mail<br /> system, with a call waiting option. An analysis is underway to<br /> determine who the birds have been calling, how often and how<br /> long they talked; </p>
<p>The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of<br /> Directors. Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could<br /> have negative implications for institutional investors.<br /> Diversification into other precious metals as well as a mix of<br /> T-bills and high technology stocks appear to be in order; </p>
<p>The six geese-a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer<br /> be afforded. It has long been felt that the production rate of<br /> one egg per goose per day is an example of the decline in<br /> productivity. Three geese will be let go, and an upgrading in<br /> the selection procedure by personnel will assure management that<br /> from now on every goose it gets will be a good one; </p>
<p>The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in<br /> better times. The function is primarily decorative. Mechanical<br /> swans are on order. The current swans will be retrained to learn<br /> some new strokes and therefore enhance their outplacement; </p>
<p>As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under<br /> heavy scrutiny by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the<br /> workforce is being sought. The more militant maids consider this<br /> a dead-end job with no upward mobility. Automation of the<br /> process may permit the maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring or<br /> a-mulching; </p>
<p>Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number. This function<br /> will be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no<br /> longer do the steps; </p>
<p>Ten Lords-a-leaping is overkill. The high cost of Lords plus the<br /> expense of international air travel prompted the Compensation<br /> Committee to suggest replacing this group with ten out-of-work<br /> congressmen. While leaping ability may be somewhat sacrificed,<br /> the savings are significant because we expect an oversupply of<br /> unemployed congressmen this year; </p>
<p>Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple<br /> case of the band getting too big. A substitution with a string<br /> quartet, a cutback on new music and no uniforms will produce<br /> savings which will drop right down to the bottom line; </p>
<p>We can expect a substantial reduction in assorted people, fowl,<br /> animals, and other expenses. Though incomplete, studies indicate<br /> that stretching deliveries over twelve days is inefficient. If<br /> we can drop ship in one day, service levels will be improved.<br /> Regarding the lawsuit filed by the attorney's association<br /> seeking expansion to include the legal profession (""thirteen<br /> lawyers-a-suing) action is pending. </p>
<p>Lastly, it is not beyond consideration that deeper cuts may be<br /> necessary in the future to stay competitive. Should that happen,<br /> the Board will request management to scrutinize the Snow White<br /> Division to see if seven dwarfs is the right number.</p>

13417,"<p>Bill Gates dies in a car accident. He finds himself in purgatory, being sized up by St. Peter. </p>
<p>''Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before in your case; I'm going to let you decide where you want to go.'' </p>
<p>Bill replied, ''well, what's the difference between the two?'' </p>
<p>St. Peter said, ''I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision.'' </p>
<p>''Fine, but where should I go first?'' </p>
<p>''I'll leave that up to you.'' </p>
<p>''Okay then,'' said Bill, ''Let's try Hell first.'' </p>
<p>So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of bikini-clad women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about.The sun was shining; the temperature perfect. He was very pleased. </p>
<p>''This is great!'' he told St. Peter. ''If this is hell, I REALLY want to see heaven!'' </p>
<p>''Fine,'' said St. Peter, and off they went. </p>
<p>Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell. </p>
<p>Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision. </p>
<p>''Hmmm. I think I'd prefer Hell,'' he told St. Peter. </p>
<p>''Fine,'' retorted St. Peter, ''as you desire.'' </p>
<p>So Bill Gates went to Hell. </p>
<p>Two weeks later, St. Peter decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall, screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned and tortured by demons. </p>
<p>''How's everything going?'' he asked Bill. </p>
<p>Bill responded, with his voice filled with anguish and disappointment, ''This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the beautiful beaches, the scantily-clad women playing in the water?!???'' </p>
<p>''That was the demo,'' replied St. Peter.</p>

While they were in the<br /> meeting, Deeper was asked to keep himself busy, and so he went<br /> to the classroom of his homeroom teacher where she was grading<br /> papers. She was dressed in a tight blouse and a mini skirt, and<br /> just the sight of her made him hard, so he walked over to her<br /> and turned her chair toward him. He told her, ""God, you make me<br /> hard. Feel my dick!""</p>
<p>Shocked, she said no, but he told her that his parents were<br /> meeting with the principal and that if she didn't, he'd tell on<br /> her, and then the principal would fire her. So fearing for her<br /> job, she reached out and grabbed the bulge at his pants. He<br /> moaned and told her to get naked. Again, she was shocked and<br /> refused, but again he threatened her that the principal would<br /> fire her, and so she agreed and got naked. He smiled and got<br /> naked himself. Kissing her and throwing her onto the desk, he<br /> started pounding away at her, and she was moaning and gasping<br /> with the best orgasm of her life when his parents walked into<br /> the room. They all screamed in unison, ""DEEPER!"" and he looked<br /> up at them and said, ""I'M TRYING!""</p>

13433,"<p>As ham sandwiches go, it was perfection. A thick slab of ham, a fresh bun, crisp lettuce, and plenty of expensive, light brown, gourmet mustard. The corners of my jaw aching in anticipation, I carried it to the picnic table in our backyard, picked it up with both hands but was stopped by my wife suddenly at my side. ''Hold Johnny (our six-week-old son) while I get my sandwich,'' she said. I had him balanced between my left elbow and shoulder and was reaching again for the ham sandwich when I noticed a streak of mustard on my fingers. I love mustard. I had no napkin. I licked it off. It was not mustard. No man ever put a baby down faster. It was the first and only time I have sprinted with my tongue protruding. With a washcloth in each hand I did the sort of routine shoeshine boys do, only I did it on my tongue. Later (after she stopped crying from laughing so hard) my wife said, ''Now you know why they call that mustard 'Poupon.'''</p>

13434,"<p>Jesus and Moses were going to Bellevue from Seattle one day to<br /> do a little shopping. Heading east, I-90 was a mess - four lanes<br /> of bumper-to-bumper traffic, not budging. ""Come with me,"" Moses<br /> said, ""I think I know how to handle this.""</p>
<p>So they hopped out of the car and headed down to the edge of the<br /> water. Moses raised his arms and the waters parted, and they<br /> walked across under the bridge. ""Wow, Moses,"" Jesus said, ""I'd<br /> never have thought of that."" </p>
<p>Several hours later, loaded down with Nordstrom bags, they were<br /> heading back to pick up their car on the other side of the<br /> bridge. As they approached the edge of the water, Jesus said,<br /> ""Let me do it this time."" He set his packages down, took a<br /> breath, and began walking across the surface of the water. About<br /> 50 feet out, though, he suddenly sunk!</p>
<p>He swam back to shore, spluttering and frustrated. ""Jesus,""<br /> Moses began, ""I think...""</p>
<p>Jesus shook his head impatiently. ""I can do this,"" he muttered<br /> to himself. ""I've done it before."" He turned around and headed<br /> out across the water again, this time only making it about 20<br /> feet before he sank a second time. He splashed back up on shore,<br /> shaking his head. ""I don't understand. This time, it has to<br /> work."" He turned to start across again.</p>
<p>""Jesus,"" Moses interrupted, ""I don't know how to tell you this,<br /> but there's just no way you're going to walk on water with those<br /> holes in your feet.""</p>

13462,"<p>A great pianist was driving down a road when he saw a bar with a sign saying �MUSICIAN WANTED�. Being the hotshot he was, he walked in and offered to fill the void. So, the bartender told him to give a demo. So, the pianist went over to the piano and began to play.<br />  The song was phenomenal, and the bartender was very impressed. The bartender promptly asked, �What was the name of that song?� The pianist smiled and said �What the hell is that on my dick?� The bartender was taken aback but told the pianist to play another song. This song was even better than the last, and the bartender was Very impressed.<br />  Slightly reluctant he asked, �Was that song�s name?� The pianist said, �Them Tits is Fucking Huge!� The bartender was perplexed, but sighed and said, � You can play at my bar but you can�t announce the name of your songs.� One night the pianist is playing at a bar and he decides to spice it up a bit with performances during the songs. He�s doing flips, cartwheels, and such, but in the middle of one song he does the splits and rips his pants from the upper crotch to the lower ass, and like all good musicians, he wasn�t wearing underwear.<br />  Strangely, he keeps playing as if nothing happened. A bit later a woman stands up and shouts � Don�t ya know yer balls is hangin� out?� The pianist whips around and says, �Not only don�t I know it, I wrote it!�</p>

13468,"<p>Two doctors were in a hospital hallway one day complaining about Nurse Nancy. </p>
<p>""She's incredibly mixed up,"" said one doctor. ""She does everything absolutely backwards. Just last week, I told her to give a patient 2 milligrams of morphine every 10 hours. She gave him 10 milligrams every 2 hours. He damn near died on us!"" </p>
<p>The second doctor said, ""That's nothing. Earlier this week, I told her to give a patient an enema every 24 hours. She tries to give him 24 enemas in one hour! The guy damn near exploded!"" </p>
<p>Suddenly, they hear this blood-curdling scream from down the hall. </p>
<p>""Oh my God!"", said the first doctor, ""I just realised I told Nurse Nancy to prick Mr. Smith's boil!""</p>

13469,"<p>Jerry is watching the end of an intense baseball game when his wife taps him on the shoulder and asks, 'Honey, could you fix the front steps? They're ready to collapse.' </p>
<p>He sighs and says, 'After the game, Flo.' </p>
<p>Flo grinds her teeth. She nearly broke her neck climbing those stupid stairs and all he cares about is his stupid baseball game. 'Well, could you fix the light in the hall? It's been flickering for weeks.' </p>
<p>He sighs and says, 'Darn it, Flo, I'm a sports fan, not an electrician. Call Joe Burkes to fix it.' </p>
<p>Flo counters: 'Can you fix the fridge door, then? It won't shut.' </p>
<p>Jerry turns to talk to her and misses the game-winning homer. He turns back to the screen and sees people celebrating and carrying on. He wants to swear. Instead he says, 'You want me to fix the fridge? Who do I look like, the Maytag Repairman?' </p>
<p>She opens her mouth and he hushes her silent. 'I need to cool down,' he says. 'I'm going out.' </p>
<p>Jerry goes to his favorite watering hole and drinks for about an hour. After a couple beers, he starts to feel guilty about treating Flo so poorly. He returns home and notices the front steps have been repaired. He walks into the hall and sees the hall light working perfectly. He opens the fridge to grab a beer. The fridge door has been fixed, too. </p>
<p>He finds his wife and says, 'Honey, how'd you fix all this stuff?' </p>
<p>She smiles and says, 'After you left, I sat outside and cried. This nice young man was passing by and asked what was wrong. I told him. He offered to fix everything for me. All I had to do in return was make love to him or bake him a cake. </p>
<p>Jerry nodded, appreciatively. 'What kind of cake did you bake?' </p>

13487,"<p>One day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish.</p>
<p>About that time, a businessman came walking down the beach, trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family.</p>
<p>""You aren't going to catch many fish that way,"" said the businessman to the fisherman, ""you should be working rather than lying on the beach!""</p>
<p>The fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, ""And what will my reward be?""</p>
<p>""Well, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!"" was the businessman's answer.</p>
<p>""And then what will my reward be?"" asked the fisherman, still smiling.</p>
<p>The businessman replied, ""You will make money and you'll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish!""</p>
<p>""And then what will my reward be?"" asked the fisherman again.</p>
<p>The businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman's questions. ""You can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!"" he said.</p>
<p>""And then what will my reward be?"" repeated the fisherman.</p>
<p>The businessman was getting angry. ""Don't you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!""</p>
<p>Once again the fisherman asked, ""And then what will my reward be?""</p>
<p>The businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, ""Don't you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won't have a care in the world!""</p>
<p>The fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, ""And what do you think I'm doing right now?""</p>

13488,"<p>Five surgeons are discussing who makes the best patients on the operating table.</p>
<p>The first surgeon says, ""I like to see accountants on my operating table, because when you open them up, everything inside is numbered.""</p>

<p>The fourth surgeon chimes in: ""You know, I like construction workers...those guys always understand when you have a few parts left over at the end, and when the job takes longer than you said it would.""</p>
<p>But the fifth surgeon shut them all up when he observed: ""You're all wrong. Politicians are the easiest to operate on. There's no guts, no heart, and no spine, and the head and butt are interchangeable.""</p>

13503,"<p>There were once 3 men who lived in jail. One was rather stupid,<br /> one was a bit more clever, and one was the cleverest (the clever<br /> man). They were all guilty of their convicted crimes but decided<br /> to escape. </p>
<p>During the escape they had to cross one large field. The clever<br /> man crossed it by crawling behind a hedgerow, the slightly<br /> clever man ran across, and the stupid man carelessly strode<br /> across the field, whistling ten green bottles (sitting on a<br /> wall), and taking his time.</p>
<p>Now, two lesbians owned this field, and hearing the whistling,<br /> stopped the men. ""You have been trespassing"" they both said in<br /> unison. ""...and for that you shall be punished."" The Lesbians,<br /> not knowing that these men had just escaped from jail said, ""We<br /> shall now legally (this was in Indonesia) remove your genitiles<br /> in a manner according to your job.""</p>
<p>The dumb man, not thinking said- ""Oh yes, I'm a butcher!""-- they<br /> sliced his penis off like ham.</p>
<p>The slightly clever man was about to say that he was a chemist,<br /> but with thought that the lesbians might be in possession of<br /> sulphuric acid (remember that this was in Indonesia) said, ""I'm<br /> a Lumberjack"" - he wanted the pain to be quick.... and so it<br /> was. Just in one single chop.</p>
<p>The lesbians were enjoying this, and with smug faces (otherwise<br /> known as the Anne Robinson from Watchdog face) turned to the<br /> clever man, who said-with an equally smug face- ""Oh me....I test<br /> lollipops.""</p>

13519,"<p>A successful businessman flew to Vegas for the weekend to gamble. He lost the<br /> shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of<br /> his round trip ticket -- If he could just get to the airport he could get<br /> himself home. So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab<br /> waiting.</p>
<p>He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to<br /> send the driver money from home, he offered him his credit card numbers, his<br /> drivers license number, his address, etc. but to no avail. The cabbie said<br /> (adopt appropriate dialect), ""If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell<br /> out of my cab!"" So the businessman was forced to hitch-hike to the airport and<br /> was barely in time to catch his flight.</p>
<p>One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his<br /> financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty<br /> good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride<br /> back to the airport.</p>
<p>Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his<br /> old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. The<br /> businessman thought for a moment about how he could make theguy pay for his lack<br /> of charity, and he hit on a plan.</p>
<p>The businessman got in the first cab in the line, ""How much for a ride to the<br /> airport, "" he asked? ""Fifteen bucks, "" came the reply. ""And how much for you to<br /> give me a blowjob on the way?"" ""What?! Get the hell out of my cab."" The<br /> businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same<br /> questions, with the same result.</p>
<p>When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked<br /> ""How much for a ride to the airport?"" The cabbie replied ""fifteen bucks."" The<br /> businessman said ""ok"" and off they went. Then, as the drove slowly past the long<br /> line of cabs the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs up sign to each<br /> driver.</p>

13524,"<p>If you have raised kids (or been one), and gone through the pet syndrome including toilet-flush burials for dead goldfish It's a long story but one that will have you laughing out LOUD!! </p>
<p>Overview: I had to take my son's hamster to the vet. Here's what happened: </p>
<p>Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was something wrong with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room. ""He's just lying there looking sick,"" he told me, ""I'm serious, Dad. Can you help?"" </p>
<p>I put my best hamster-healer look on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do. (Call my wife.) </p>
<p>""Honey,"" I called, ""come look at the hamster!"" ""Oh, my gosh,"" my wife diagnosed after a minute. ""She's having babies."" ""What?"" My son demanded. </p>
<p>""But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!"" </p>
<p>I was equally outraged. ""Hey, how can that be?! I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce!"" I accused my wife. ""Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?!"" She inquired. (I actually think she had the gall to say this sarcastically.) </p>
<p>""No, but you were supposed to get two boys!"" I reminded her (in my most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth together). ""Yeah, Bert and Ernie!"" My son agreed. ""Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know,"" she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm, ya think?) </p>
<p>By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. ""Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience,"" I announced. ""We're about to witness the miracle of birth."" </p>
<p>""OH, Gross!"" They shrieked. </p>
<p>""Well, isn't THAT just great! What are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?"" My wife wanted to know. (I really do think she was being snotty here, too. Don't you?) </p>
<p>We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. ""We don't appear to be making much progress,"" I noted. </p>
<p>""It's breech,"" my wife whispered, horrified. ""Do something, Dad!"" My son urged. ""Okay, okay."" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gingerly tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results. </p>
<p>""Should I call 911?"" My eldest daughter wanted to know,"" Maybe they could talk us through the trauma."" (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?) </p>
<p>""Let's get Ernie to the vet,"" I said grimly. </p>
<p>We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in hislap. ""Breathe, Ernie, breathe,"" he urged. </p>
<p>""I don't think hamsters do Lamaze,"" his mother noted to him. (Women can be so cruel to their own young. I mean what she does to ME is one thing, but this boy is of her womb.) </p>
<p>The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass. ""What do you think, Doc, a c-section?"" I suggested scientifically. My son appeared impressed by my observation. </p>
<p>""Oh, very interesting,"" he murmured. ""Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?"" I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside. </p>
<p>""Is Ernie going to be okay?"" My wife asked. ""Oh, perfectly,"" the vet assured us. </p>
<p>""This hamster is not in labor. In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen Ernie is a boy."" </p>
<p>""What?"" </p>
<p>""You see, Ernie is a young male AND occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um .... er ... masturbate, just the way he did, lying on his back."" He blushed, glancing at my wife. ""Well, you know what I'm saying, Mr. Cameron."" </p>
<p>We were silent, absorbing this. </p>
<p>""So Ernie's just ... just ... excited?""! My wife offered. </p>
<p>""Exactly,"" the vet replied, relieved that we understood. More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle. And laugh. And then even laugh loudly! </p>
<p>""What's so funny?"" I demanded, knowing, but not believing that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless manliness. Tears were now running down her face. </p>
<p>""It's just ... that ... I'm picturing you pulling on its ... its teeny little ..."" she gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more. </p>
<p>""That's enough,"" I warned. </p>
<p>We thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be okay. </p>
<p>""I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad,"" he told me. </p>
<p>""Oh, you have NO idea,"" my wife agreed, once again collapsing into laughter. </p>
<p>Enough said.</p>

<p>4. There was some mix-up with a woman's room. The clerk (or whatever they are called on ships) was trying to remedy the situation. He asked, ""Would you like an inside cabin or an outside cabin?"" She replied, ""Well, it looks like it might rain today. I'd better get an inside cabin."" </p>
<p>5. Two women were sitting by the pool, and one asked what kind of water they fill the pool with -- fresh water or sea water? The cruise director answered, ""Sea water."" ""Oh, that explains why it's so rough today."" </p>

<p>""Nonsense,"" said the President, ""its just a clock."" Ashley<br /> agreed and the president lead her into the oval office where<br /> they were alone. As he closed the door he dropped his pants and<br /> pulled out his cock.</p>
<p>Ashley gasped. ""Oh! That's not the Presidential<br /> clock......that's the Presidential...cock!"" to which the<br /> president responded:</p>

The Air Force started a full FBI<br /> background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. </p>
<p>By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost<br /> and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying<br /> ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of<br /> his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading,<br /> and sent him on his way. </p>
<p>The next day, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed<br /> up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane... only this time there were<br /> two people in the plane. </p>
<p>The same pilot jumped out and said, ""Do anything you want to me, but my wife<br /> is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!""</p>

<p>16. Life is one big competition. If someone is better than you at anything, either pretend it's not true or kick some ass.</p>
<p>17. Lie.</p>
<p>18. Do NOT make decisions about relationships. If you are backed into a corner and must make a decision, stall. If you still must come up with an answer, leave yourself a loophole for escape. For example:  Question: ""Honey, will you take me out for a romantic dinner?""<br /> Answer: ""Yes, if you can guess how many sperm I produce daily.""</p>

<p>32. When you tell a girl about your past, it's good to say, ""God, I was such a pimp back then.""</p>
<p>33. Here's a good trick. Tell a girl that you're going to leave and when you come back you want her naked and sprawled out on the bed.  Leave and go into her dad's room and tell him he should go check on his daughter. Then drive like hell.</p>
<p>34. The best sex position is you, lying face up. . .  and twenty girls on top.</p>
<p>35. Practice your blank stare.</p>
<p>36. If you're ever forced to show emotion, just pick a random emotion, like rage, lust and insanity, and display them at random, inconvenient times. You won't be asked to do it again.</p>
<p>37. If you are asked to do something you REALLY don't want to do, first try your manly best to get out of it. If that doesn't work, go ahead and do what you were asked to do, but complain that you don't know howto do it and continuously ask questions on how to do each little part. If no one rushes in to do it for you yet, finish the job in the most half-assed way you possibly can and then say ""See???? I told you I couldn't do it."" Eventually people will stop asking you to do things.</p>

<p>He was buying some fishing hooks and I told him that he would probably need some stronger line to go with those hooks.

13579,"<p>Continuing the current trend of large-scale mergers and acquisitions, it was<br /> announced today at a press conference that Christmas and Hanukkah will merge. An<br /> industry source said that the deal had been in the works about 1300 years. While<br /> details were not available at press time, it is believed that the overhead cost<br /> of having twelve days of Christmas and eight days of Hanukkah was becoming<br /> prohibitive for both sides. By combining forces, we're told, the world will be<br /> able to enjoy consistently high-quality service during the Fifteen Days of<br /> Chrismukah, as the new holiday is being called. </p>
<p>Massive layoffs are expected, with lords a-leaping and maids a-milking being<br /> the hardest hit. As part of the conditions of the agreement, the letters on the<br /> dreidel, currently in Hebrew, will be replaced by Latin, thus becoming<br /> unintelligible to a wider audience. </p>
<p>Also, instead of translating to ""A great miracle happened there,"" the message<br /> on the dreidel will be the more generic: ""Miraculous stuff happens."" In<br /> exchange, it is believed that Jews will be allowed to use Santa Claus and his<br /> vast merchandising resources for buying and delivering their gifts. </p>
<p>One of the sticking points holding up the agreement for at least three hundred<br /> years was the question of whether Jewish children could leave milk and cookies<br /> for Santa even after having eaten meat for dinner. A breakthrough came last<br /> year, when Oreos were finally declared to be Kosher. All sides appeared happy<br /> about this. </p>
<p>Fortunately for all concerned, he said, Kwanzaa will help to maintain the<br /> competitive balance. He then closed the press conference by leading all present<br /> in a rousing rendition of ""Oy Vey, All Ye Faithful.""</p>

The second man yells<br /> down, Hey, no screwing!<br /> They yell back, We're not screwing!<br /> A few minutes later they start to put driftwood into the stone circle. Again<br /> the second man yells down, Hey, no screwing!<br /> Again they yell back, We're not screwing!<br /> Later they are putting palm leaves on the roof of their shack to patch leaks.<br /> Once again the second man yells down, Hey, I said no screwing!<br /> They yell back, We're not screwing!<br /> Eventually the shift is over and the second man climbs down from the tower to<br /> be replaced by the husband. He's not even halfway up before the wife and her new<br /> friend are hard at it. The husband looks out from the tower and says,<br /> ""Son-of-a-gun.

13617,"<p>DAY 752 - My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from shredding the occasional piece of furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant and cough it up on the carpeting.<br /> DAY 761 - Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded, must try this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite chair... must try this on their bed (again). </p>
<p>DAY 762 - Slept all day so that I could annoy my captors with sleep depriving, incessant pleas for food at ungodly hours of the night. </p>
<p>DAY 765 - Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body, in attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was ... Hmmm. Not working according to plan . </p>
<p>DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. This time however it included a burning foamy chemical called ""shampoo."" What sick minds could invent such a liquid? My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth and the tiny bit of flesh under my claws. </p>
<p>DAY 771 - There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event.

13624,"<p>Stage 1 - SMART This is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject in the known Universe. You know you know everything and want to pass on your knowledge to anyone who will listen. At this stage you are always RIGHT. And of course the person you are talking to is very WRONG. This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are SMART.<br /> Stage 2 - GOOD LOOKING This is when you realize that you are the BEST LOOKING person in the entire bar and that people fancy you. You can go up to a perfect stranger knowing they fancy you and really want to talk to you. Bear in mind that you are still SMART, so you can talk to this person about any subject under the sun. </p>
<p>Stage 3 - RICH This is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world. You can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have an armored truck full of money parked behind the bar. You can also make bets at this stage, because of course, you are still SMART, so naturally you win all your bets. It doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are RICH. You will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are the BEST LOOKING person in the world. </p>
<p>Stage 4 - BULLET PROOF You are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone especially those with whom you have been betting or arguing. This is because nothing can hurt you. At this point you can also go up to the partners of the people who you fancy and challenge to a battle of wits or money. You have no fear of losing this battle because you are SMART, you are RICH and hell, you're BETTER LOOKING than they are anyway! </p>
<p>Stage 5 - INVISIBLE This is the Final Stage of Drunkenness. At this point you can do anything because NO ONE CAN SEE YOU. You dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you. You are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you. You can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still SMART you know all the words.</p>

WHOA!""<br /> After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight<br /> attendant on a Northwest flight announced:� Please take care when opening the<br /> overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as heck<br /> everything has shifted.""<br /> From a Southwest Airlines employee....""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to<br /> YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull<br /> tight. It works just like every other seatbelt, and if you don't know how to<br /> operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised.<br /> In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure margarine cups will descend<br /> from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If<br /> you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting<br /> with theirs. If you are traveling with more than one small child...pick your<br /> favorite.<br /> Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but we'll<br /> try to have them fixed before we arrive.<br /> Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest<br /> Airlines.""<br /> ""Your seats cushions can be used for flotation, and in the event of an<br /> emergency water landing, please paddle to shore and take them with our<br /> compliments.""<br /> Once on a Southwest flight, the pilot said, ""We've reached our cruising<br /> altitude now, and I'm turning off the seat belt sign. I'm switching to<br /> autopilot, too, so I can come back there and visit with all of you for the rest<br /> of the flight.""<br /> ""Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead<br /> area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting<br /> children or other adults acting like children.""<br /> ""As you exit the plane, make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything<br /> left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do<br /> not leave children or spouses.""<br /> ""Last one off the plane must clean it.""<br /> And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased to have some of<br /> the best flight attendants in the industry...Unfortunately; none of them are on<br /> this flight...!""<br /> Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City:<br /> The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, ""That was quite a bump and I<br /> know what y'all are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airline's<br /> fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendants' fault...it<br /> was the asphalt!""<br /> Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a<br /> particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach the Captain really<br /> had to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on<br /> the PA and announced, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain<br /> in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what's left<br /> of our airplane to the gate!""<br /> Another flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask you<br /> to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.""<br /> An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship<br /> into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first<br /> officer to stand at the door while the Passengers exited, smile, and give them a<br /> ""Thanks for flying XYZ airline."" He said that in light of his bad landing, he<br /> had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would<br /> have a smart comment. Finally everyone had gotten off except for this little old<br /> lady walking with a cane. She said, ""Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?"" ""Why<br /> no Ma'am,"" said the pilot, ""what is it?"" The little old lady said, ""Did we land<br /> or were we shot down?""<br /> After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant came on<br /> with, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Capt. Crash and<br /> the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate. And,<br /> once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open<br /> the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.""<br /> Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you<br /> folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go<br /> blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of<br /> us here at US Airways.""</p>

13669,"<p>Yes, I'm tired. For several years I've been blaming it on iron-poor blood,<br /> lack of vitamins, air pollution, water pollution, saccharin, obesity, dieting,<br /> yellow wax build-up, and a dozen other maladies that make you wonder if life is<br /> really worth living. </p>
<p>But now I find out, tain't that. I'm tired because I'm<br /> overworked. </p>
<p>The population of this country is 200 million. Eighty-four million are<br /> retired. That leaves 116 million to do the work. </p>
<p>There are 75 million in school, which leaves 41 million to do the work. Of<br /> this total, there are 22 million employed by the government. </p>
<p>That leaves 19 million to do the work. Four million are in the Armed Forces,<br /> which leaves 15 million to do the work. </p>
<p>Take from that total the 14,800,000 people who work for State and City<br /> Government and that leaves 200,000 to do the work. There are 188,000 in<br /> hospitals, so that leaves 12,000 to do the work. </p>
<p>Now there are 11,998 people in prisons. That leaves just two people to do the<br /> work. You and me. And you're sitting there reading this. No wonder I'm tired.</p>

13671,"<p>A pilot was flying a small charter plane<br /> There was a pilot flying a small single engine charter plane, with a couple of very important executives on board. He was coming into the Seattle airport through thick fog with less than 10 miles visibility when his instruments went out. He began circling around looking for a landmark. </p>
<p>Finally, a small opening in the fog appears and he sees a tall building with a guy working alone on the fifth floor. He banks the plane around, rolls down the window and shouts to the guy, ""Hey where am I?"" to which the man replies, ""You're in an airplane."" </p>
<p>The pilot rolls up the window, executes a 275 degree turn and proceeds to perform a perfect blind landing on the airport runway 5 miles away. Just as the plane stops, so does the engine as the fuel has run out. </p>
<p>The passengers are amazed and one asks how he did it. ""Quite easy,"" replies the pilot, ""I asked the guy in that building a simple question. The answer he gave me was 100 percent correct but absolutely useless, therefore, that must be Microsoft's support office and from there the airport is just five miles due East.""</p>

13675,"<p>An old wizard was walking through a park when he came upon two statues. One statue was male and the other was female. They were positioned on opposite ends of the park, facing each other with their arms extended out as if to embrace. The wizard stood there for a long time examining their sad facial expressions until he got an idea.         He immediately opened up his bag of tricks and cast a spell on the statues to bring them to life. Once the statues realized they were human, they quickly ran up to him. The wizard, being very pleased with himself, told the statues that they could finally be together as a couple but there was one condition. He said, ''Go off and experience with each other whatever you've wanted to do for all these years but you must be back within a half an hour before the spell wears off.''          Wasting no time, they quickly ran off into the bushes. The wizard, with great pride, sat down on a park bench and waited patiently. Fifteen minutes later the two statues came walking back to him.         The wizard, with great shock exclaimed, ''For over a hundred years you both have bore your passions and now that you have your chance, you come back after only fifteen minutes? Go back to the bushes and continue what you were doing before you lose your only chance!''        With that in mind the female turns to the male and exclaims, ''The old man's right. But this time you hold down the pigeons and I'll crap on them!''</p>

The minute somebody turns it on, I go to the library and read a book.I have had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.If I held you any closer I would be on the other side of you.I must confess, I was born at a very early age.I don't care to belong to a club that accepts people like me asmembers.It is better to have loft and lost than to never have loft at all.I was married by a judge. I should have asked for a jury.Either he's dead or my watch has stopped.Remember men, we're fighting for this woman's honour; which is probably more than she ever did.Women should be obscene and not heard.After his introduction on a music/variety show, Groucho and the hostboth sat down at center stage.  Host: 'I'm a big fan of yours, Groucho.'  Groucho: 'If it gets any hotter in here I could use a big fan.'Do you think I could buy back my introduction to you?Time wounds all heels.Why was I with her? She reminds me of you. In fact, she reminds me more of you than you do!Behind every successful man is a woman, behind her is his wife.As soon as I get through with you, you'll have a clear case for divorceand so will my wife.Well, art is art, isn't it? Still, on the other hand, water is water!And east is east and west is west and if you take cranberries and stewthem like apple-sauce they taste much more like prunes than rhubarbdoes. Now, uh... Now you tell me what you know.Marry me and I'll never look at another horse!I married your mother because I wanted children, imagine my disappointment when you came along.Whatever it is,... I'm against it.A woman is an occasional pleasure but a cigar is always a smoke.If I told you that you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?Quote me as saying I was misquoted.</p>

13705,"<p>At a Christmas party in Melbourne last year the staff decided to pull a joke on their boss who had a habit of playing serious practical jokes on everyone else.When he went to the toilet, they went through his wallet and found his Lotto ticket.  Then, they wrote down his numbers and called over the waitress to set up a little prank.She came back half an hour later and asked if anyone wanted to know the night's Lotto numbers, then proceeded to read them out loud before setting the numbers on the table. The boss looked at the numbers, then casually pulled out his wallet and compared them.  He became really silent, put his wallet back in his jacket and sat down again breathing really rapidly, and looking totally blown away. After a couple of minutes he pulled out his wallet and Lotto ticket again, and checked the numbers, very carefully.  Then, he sculled his drink, stood up on his chair and shouted out to the whole room: 'I just want to let you all know something.  I've been having an affair with my secretary for months.  I don't like any of you, and I have hated working for this company.  You can all go to Hell, 'cos I've just won a shit-load of money, and I'm leaving!'End of job. End of marriage.End of story.</p>

13742,"<p>Jesus and Satan were having an ongoing argument about who was better on his<br /> computer. They had been going at it for days, and God was tired of hearing all<br /> of the bickering.<br /> Finally God said, ""Cool it. I am going to set up a test that will run two<br /> hours and I will judge who does the better job.""<br /> So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away. They mouse. They<br /> did spreadsheets. They wrote reports. They sent faxes. They sent e-mail. They<br /> sent out e-mail with attachments. They downloaded. They did some genealogy<br /> reports. They made cards. They did every known job. But ten minutes before their<br /> time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain<br /> poured and, of course, the electricity went off.<br /> Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the<br /> underworld. Jesus just sighed. The electricity finally flickered back on and<br /> each of them restarted their computers.<br /> Satan started searching frantically, screaming ""It's gone! It's all gone! I<br /> lost everything when the power went out!""<br /> Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past<br /> two hours. Satan observed this and became irate.<br /> ""Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?""<br /> God shrugged and said, ""Jesus saves.""</p>

I say we boycott all<br /> chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal<br /> media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like ""the<br /> other side."" That chicken should not be free to cross the road.<br /> It's as plain and simple as that.</p>
<p>KEN STARR:<br /> I intend to prove that the chicken crossed the road at the<br /> behest of the President of the United States of America in an<br /> effort todistractlaw enforcement officials and the American<br /> public from the criminal wrongdoing our highest elected official<br /> has been trying to cover up. As a result, the chicken is just<br /> another pawn in the president's ongoing and elaborate scheme to<br /> obstruct justice an undermine the rule of law. For that reason,<br /> my staff intends to offer the chicken unconditional immunity<br /> provided he cooperates fully with our investigation.<br /> Furthermore, the chicken will not be permitted to reach the<br /> other side of the road until our investigation and any</p>
<p>Congressional follow-up investigations have been completed.(We<br /> also are investigatingwhetherSid Blumenthal has leaked<br /> information to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, alleging the chicken to<br /> be homosexual in an effort to discredit any useful testimony the<br /> bird may have to offer, or at least to ruffle his feathers.)</p>

<p>FREUD:<br /> The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed<br /> the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.</p>
<p>BILL GATES:<br /> I have just released eChicken 98, which will not only cross<br /> roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and<br /> balance your checkbook and Internet Explorer is an inextricable<br /> part of eChicken.</p>

13785,"<p>For my birthday this year my wife purchased me a week of private lessons at the local health club. Though still in great shape from when I was on the varsity chess team in high school, I decided it was a good idea to go ahead and try it. I called and made reservations with someone named Tanya, who said she is a 26-year-old aerobics instructor and athletic clothing model. </p>
<p>My wife seemed very pleased with how enthusiastic I was to get started. They suggested I keep an ""exercise diary"" to chart my progress. </p>
<p>Day 1. </p>
<p>Started the morning at 6:00 AM. Tough to get up, but worth it when I arrived at the health club and Tanya was waiting for me. She's something of a goddess, with blond hair and a dazzling white smile. She showed me the machines and took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill. She seemed a little alarmed that it was so high, but I think just standing next to her in that outfit of hers added about ten points. Enjoyed watching the aerobics class. Tanya was very encouraging as I did my sit ups, though my gut was already aching a little from holding it in the whole time I was talking to her. This is going to be GREAT. </p>
<p>Day 2. </p>
<p>Took a whole pot of coffee to get me out the door, but I made it. Tanya had me lie on my back and push this heavy iron bar up into the air. Then she put weights on it, for heaven's sake! Legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made it the full mile. Her smile made it all worth while. Muscles ALL feel GREAT. </p>
<p>Day 3. </p>
<p>The only way I can brush my teeth is by laying the tooth brush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I am certain that I have developed a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was OK as long as I didn't try to steer. I parked on top of a Volkswagen. Tanya was a little impatient with me and said my screaming was bothering the other club members. The treadmill hurt my chest so I did the stair monster. Why would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by the invention of elevators? Tanya told me regular exercise would make me live longer. I can't imagine anything worse. </p>
<p>Day 4. </p>
<p>Tanya was waiting for me with her vampire teeth in a full snarl. I can't help it if I was half an hour late, it took me that long just to tie my shoes. She wanted me to lift dumbbells. Not a chance, Tanya. The word ""dumb"" must be in there for a reason. I hid in the men's room until she sent Lars looking for me. As punishment she made me try the rowing machine. It sank. </p>
<p>Day 5. </p>
<p>I hate Tanya more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. If there was any part of my body not in extreme pain I would hit her with it. She thought it would be a good idea to work on my triceps. Well I have news for you Tanya - I don't have triceps. And if you don't want dents in the floor don't hand me any barbells. I refuse to accept responsibility for the damage, YOU went to sadist school, YOU are to blame. The treadmill flung me back into a science teacher, which hurt like crazy. Why couldn't it have been someone softer, like a music teacher, or social studies? </p>
<p>Day 6. </p>
<p>Got Tanya's message on my answering machine, wondering where I am. I lacked the strength to use the TV remote so I watched eleven straight hours of the weather channel. </p>
<p>Day 7. </p>
<p>Well, that's the week. Thank goodness that's over. Maybe next time my wife will give me something a little more fun, like a gift certificate for a root canal.</p>

13788,"<p>There was a farmer who raised watermelons. He was doing pretty well, but he was disturbed by some local kids who would sneak into his watermelon patch at night and eat his watermelons. After some careful thought, he came up with a clever idea that he hopes will scare the kids away for sure: He makes up a sign and posts it in the field.</p>
<p>That night the kids show up and see this sign which says, ""Warning: One of the watermelons in this field has been injected with cyanide.""</p>
<p>The kids run off and make up their own sign which they post next to the farmer's sign.</p>
<p>The next day, the farmer shows up to look over his field. He notices that no watermelons are missing but that there's now a sign next to his. He drives over to take a look. It says, ""Now there are two.""</p>

He was looking in the bird section when he noticed that<br /> he only had $20 bucks.  Just then he saw a sign.  It said<br /> ""Parrot only $20 dollars""<br /> Bob went up to the counter and asked the guy behind it why the<br /> parrot was only $20 dollars. ""Well you see,"" the guy said, ""this<br /> parrot is really really old and only sings 2 songs.  One if you<br /> light a match under his left foot and one if you light a match<br /> under his right foot.""  So then Bob went up too the parrot and<br /> lit a match under his left foot.  The bird started to sing<br /> ""Jingle Bells."" Then he lit a match under his right leg.  The<br /> bird started to sing ""Rudolph the red nose reindeer.""  Bob went<br /> back to the counter and asked, ""What's this birds name?""<br /> ""Chet,"" the guy replied.  ""Okay then what would happen if you<br /> lit a match underneath Chet's balls?""  Bob asked.  ""I don't know<br /> I've never tried it.""<br /> So Bob went back to the bird and lit a match underneath his<br /> balls.

13811,"<p>Three bulls heard via the grapevine that the rancher was going to bring yet another bull onto the ranch, and the prospect raised a discussion among them.</p>
<p>First Bull: ""Boys, we all know I've been here 5 years. Once we settled our differences, we agreed on which 100 of the cows would be mine. Now, I don't know where this newcomer is going to get HIS cows, but I ain't givin' him any of mine.""</p>
<p>Second Bull: ""That pretty much says it for me, too. I've been here 3 years and have earned my right to the 50 cows we've agreed are mine. I'll fight 'em till I run him off or kill 'im, but I AM KEEPIN' ALL MY COWS.""</p>
<p>Third Bull: ""I've only been here a year, and so far you guys have only let me have 10 cows to ""take care of"". I may not be as big as you fellows (yet) but I am young and virile, so I simply MUST keep all MY cows.""</p>
<p>They had just finished their big talk when an eighteen-wheeler pulls up in the middle of the pasture with only ONE ANIMAL IN IT: the biggest Son-of-Another-Bull these guys had ever seen! At 4700 pounds, each step he took toward the ground strained the steel ramp to the breaking point.</p>
<p>First Bull: ""You know, it's actually been some time since I really felt I was doing all my cows justice, anyway. I think I can spare a few for our new friend.""</p>
<p>Second Bull: ""I'll have plenty of cows to take care of if I just stay on the opposite end of the pasture from HIM. I'm certainly not looking for an argument.""</p>
<p>They look over at their young friend, the 3rd bull, and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns, and snorting -- the bull's equivalent of an Ape's beating his chest or Man's bone-chilling, war-like cry of ""Stay away from my Woman, Vato!!</p>
<p>First Bull: ""Son, let me give you some advice real quick. Let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it.""</p>
<p>Third Bull: ""Hell , Mister, he can have ALL MY COWS.<br /> I'm just making sure he knows I'M a bull!""</p>

13845,"<p>A guy with leprosy wins tickets to see the world series. But when he gets<br /> there, he has trouble finding a seat because pieces of him are peeling and<br /> flaking off, and he's very concerned about grossing out the other fans. </p>
<p>The leper wanders through the bleachers looking for a seat where his grotesque<br /> appearance won't disturb anyone else. Finally he finds an open seat where he<br /> might be able to watch the game. He asks the man in the adjoining seat if it<br /> would be okay to sit there. </p>
<p>The man answers, ""Yeah. Just sit down, shut up, and watch the game."" </p>
<p>The leper sits down and adds, ""As you can see, I have leprosy. If it disturbs<br /> you, I will move."" </p>
<p>""It doesn't bother me. Just shut up, and watch the game."" </p>
<p>A while later, during the fourth inning, the man suddenly vomits. Frothy beer,<br /> hot dogs, and peanuts are splattered everywhere. </p>
<p>Seeing this, the leper gets up and says, ""Thank you for allowing me to sit<br /> next to you, but I can see that my appearance has caused you to get sick. I will<br /> find another place to sit."" </p>
<p>""It's NOT you. Just sit down, shut up, and watch the game."" </p>
<p>So the leper sits back down. But during the sixth inning, the man begins to<br /> vomit again. This time it is projectile vomitus. A powerful blast of beer and<br /> pretzels shoots out from the man's mouth and nose until his stomach is<br /> completely emptied. </p>
<p>Seeing this, the leper gets up and says, ""Thank you for allowing me to sit<br /> next to you, but I can see that my appearance has caused you to get sick. I will<br /> find another place to sit."" </p>
<p>""Really, it's NOT you. Just sit down, shut up, and watch the game."" </p>
<p>So the leper sits back down. But during the seventh inning, the man begins to<br /> vomit again. This time it is the dry heaves. The leper feels absolutely awful at<br /> the sight of this man suffering. And once again, the leper offers to leave. </p>
<p>But the man insists, ""Really, it's NOT you."" </p>
<p>So the leper asks, ""Well if it's not me that is making you so sick, then what<br /> is?"" </p>
<p>""It's that guy behind you. He keeps dipping his nachos in your back.""</p>

13847,"<p>A guy dies and goes to heaven. It's a slow day for St. Peter, so, upon passing the entrance test, St. Peter says, ""I'm not very busy today, why don't you let me show you around?"" The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the offer. </p>
<p>St. Peter shows him all the sights - the golf course, the reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a HUGE room full of clocks. The guy asks, ""What's up with these clocks?"" </p>
<p>St. Peter explains, ""Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged."" The guy thinks this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks are going faster than others. He asks why is that? </p>
<p>St. Peter explains, ""Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds his clock."" </p>
<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, ""What's the story with that clock?"" </p>
<p>""Oh, that,"" St. Peter replies, ""That's President Clinton's clock. We decided to use it as a fan.""</p>

<p>The man is shocked, ""No way!""</p>
<p>""No, it's true. A friend of mine knows her personally.""</p>
<p>The man is dissapointed that such a fine looking woman is in fact a man.<br /> But at the same time, he is curious. He tells his mates that he is going<br /> to find out what sex he/she really is.</p>
<p>So the man goes up to the ""woman"" and strikes up a converstaion. They hit<br /> it off really well. And the man is loving it because this woman is even<br /> better looking up close. Before long the man suggests that he drives them<br /> out to a secluded spot and get to know each other. The woman agrees.</p>
<p>They drive to the woods and are getting hot and heavy in the back of the<br /> car. They continue the ""clothes on"" making out for a while, until the<br /> woman gets out of the car, explaining that she has to answer to the call<br /> of nature.</p>
<p>""This is my chance,"" thinks the man, ""I'll follow her and find out what<br /> sex she is."" So he walks into the woods ducking behind trees in case he is<br /> seen, until he sees the woman standing with something long dangling<br /> between her legs.</p>
<p>""Damn! She's got a dick!"" he thinks, ""She's a man."" The man is outraged<br /> and races towards her, dives down and grabs the thing between her legs.</p>
<p>""Oh my gosh!"" The woman cries, ""I didn't know you were following me!""</p>
<p>""And I didn't know you were taking a shit!"" The man replies.</p>

13856,"<p>One evening, an Indian walked into the old western town near the out skirts of his village. When he got to main street he headed straight for the whorehouse. When he got to the whorehouse he walked up to a woman there and he held out a small bag of gold and said, ""me have money, me want woman."" She looked him up and down and said, ""Boy, you need to know how to make love to a woman, before getting with one of my girls. Come back when you have some experience."" The Indian left and walked out of the town back to his village.

When he stepped inside the whorehouse, the same older woman greeted him... He then held out his bag of gold and proclaimed, ""Me have money, me want woman, me have experience.""

Right then a very beautiful woman walked around the corner, took him by the hand and walked him upstairs to a room. Once they were there, they both proceeded to take of each other's clothes.

She looked at him puzzled and then bent over as the Indian requestedThen the Indian WHAKED her on the ass with the 2x4.She screamed and jumped up and demanded.

13861,"<p>This is a collection of actual student bloopers collected by teachers from 8th grade through college.</p>
<p>Ancient Egypt was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in hydraulics. They lived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of their children, Cain, asked, ""Am I my brother's son?""</p>
<p>Moses led the Hebrew slaves to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread which is bread made without any ingredients. Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. He died before he ever reached Canada.</p>
<p>The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we wouldn't have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a female moth.</p>
<p>Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice. They  killed  him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock. After  his  death, his career suffered a dramatic decline.</p>
<p>In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits, and threw the java.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king. Dying, he gasped out: ""Tee hee, Brutus.""</p>
<p>Another story was William Tell, who shot an arrow through an apple while standing on his son's head.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth was the ""Virgin  Queen."" As a queen she was a success. When she exposed herself before her troops  they all shouted, ""hurrah.""</p>
<p>It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Gutenberg invented removable type and the Bible. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes and started smoking. And Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper.</p>

13866,"<p>MIDDLETOWN, Connecticut (AP) -- A woman charged with causing a fatal car crash in 1999 says that she couldn't have been behind the wheel because she was performing a sex act on the driver at the time. </p>
<p>Heather Specyalski, 33, was charged with second-degree manslaughter in the crash that killed businessman Neil Esposito. Prosecutors alleged that she was driving Esposito's Mercedes-Benz convertible when it veered off the road and hit several trees. </p>
<p>But Specyalski claims that Esposito was driving, she was performing oral sex on him at the time, said her attorney, Jeremiah Donovan. He noted that Esposito's pants were down when he was thrown from the car. </p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Robert L. Holzberg ruled Tuesday that Specyalski can proceed with the defense, despite objections by the prosecutor. </p>
<p>""A defendant has a right to offer a defense no matter how outlandish, silly or unbelievable one might think it will be,"" Holzberg said. He added: ""No one ever told me in law school that we'd be having these kinds of conversations in open court."" </p>
<p>Assistant State's Attorney Maureen Platt said the defense is flawed. </p>
<p>""His pants could have been down because he was mooning a car he was drag racing,"" Platt said. ""His pants could have been down because he was urinating out of a window. His pants could have been down because he wasn't feeling well."" </p>
<p>Also Tuesday, Holzberg denied Donovan's motion to use gender as grounds to eliminate jurors. Donovan had argued that women would be biased and more likely to convict.</p>

13890,"<p>If you have raised kids (or been one), and gone through the pet<br /> syndrome, including toilet-flush burials for dead goldfish, the<br /> story below will have you laughing out LOUD!!!</p>
<p>My husband had to take my son's hampster to the vet.  Here's<br /> what happened:</p>
<p>Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell my husband<br /> there was ""something wrong"" with one of the two hampsters he<br /> holds prisoner in his room.</p>
<p>""He's just lying there looking sick"", he said.  ""I'm serious<br /> Dad, can you help?""</p>
<p>He put his best hampster-healer expression on his face and<br /> followed our son into his bedroom.  One of the little rodents<br /> was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed.  He immediately<br /> knew what to do.</p>
<p>""Honey"", he called, ""come look at the hampster!""</p>
<p>""Oh my gosh!""  I realized after a minute.  ""She's having babies!""</p>
<p>""What?""  our son demanded.  ""but their names are Bert and Ernie,<br /> Mom!""</p>
<p>My husband was euqally outraged.  ""Hey, how can that be?  I<br /> thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce""  He accused me.</p>
<p>""Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?""  I<br /> enquired. (being totally sarcastic)</p>
<p>""No, but you were supposed to get two boys!""  He reminded me (in<br /> his best loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting his teeth)</p>
<p>""Yeah, Bert and Ernie"" our son agreed.</p>
<p>""Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know.""<br /> I informed him. (again with the sarcasm)</p>
<p>By now, the rest of the family had gathered to see what was<br /> going on.</p>
<p>I shrugged, and decided to make the best of it.</p>
<p>""Kids, this is going to be a woundrous experience!""  I<br /> announced.  ""We're about to witness the miracle of birth.""</p>
<p>""OH, GROSS!!!"" They shrieked.</p>
<p>""Well, isn't THAT just great!  What are we going to do with a<br /> litter of tiny little hampster babies?""  My husband wanted to<br /> know.  (Being totally snotty)</p>
<p>We peered at the patient.  After much struggling, what looked<br /> like a tiny foot appeared briefly, vanishing a scant second<br /> later.</p>
<p>""We don't appear to be making much progress.""  My husband noted.</p>
<p>""It's breech!"" I whispered, horrified.</p>
<p>""Do something, Dad!""  our son urged.</p>
<p>""Okay, okay!""  Squeamishly, he reached in and grabbed the foot<br /> when it next appeared, giving it a gingerly pull, but it<br /> vanished again with the same results.</p>
<p>""Should I call 911?""  our eldest daughter wanted to know.<br /> ""Maybe they could talk us through the trauma.""</p>
<p>""Let's get Ernie to the vet.""  My husband said grimly.</p>
<p>We drove to the vet with our son holding he cage in his lap.</p>
<p>""Breath, Ernie, breath,"" he urged.  </p>
<p>""I don't think hampsters do Lamaze."" I said to him.  (I think my<br /> husband thought I was being cruel to my own son, being cruel to<br /> my husband was one thing, but to the one that I carried for 9<br /> months is another.  HE was wrong, I was just pointing out the<br /> obvious!)</p>
<p>The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the<br /> little animal through a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>""What do you think, Doc, a c-section?""  My husband suggested<br /> very scientifically.</p>
<p>""Oh, very interresting,"" he murmured.</p>
<p>""Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a<br /> moment?""  </p>
<p>I gulped, nodding for our son to step out.</p>
<p>""Is Ernie going to make it?""  I asked.</p>
<p>""Oh, perfectly,"" the vet assured us.</p>
<p>""This hamspter is not in labour.  In fact, that isn't EVER going<br /> to happen...Ernie is a boy!""</p>
<p>""WHAT!?""</p>
<p>""You see, Ernie is a young male.  And occasionally, as they come<br /> into maturity, like most male species, they<br /> um.....er.....masturbate.  Just the way he did, lying on his<br /> back.""</p>
<p>He blushed, glancing at me.</p>
<p>""Well, you know what I'm saying Mr. Cameron.""</p>
<p>We were silent, absorbing this.  ""So Ernie's just excited?""  I<br /> offered.</p>
<p>""Exactly,"" the vet replied, relieved that we understood.</p>
<p>More silence.</p>
<p>Then, I started to giggle, and then laugh and continue to laugh<br /> loudly.</p>
<p>""What's so funny?""  My husband demanded, while tears started<br /> rolling down my face from laughing so hard.</p>
<p>""It's just....that...I'm picturing you pulling on<br /> it's...it's...teeny little...""  I gasped for more air to bellow<br /> with laughter once more.</p>
<p>""That's enough!""  He warned.</p>
<p>We thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hampter<br /> and our son back into the car.  He was glad everything was going<br /> to be okay.</p>
<p>""I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad.""  our<br /> son told my husband.</p>
<p>""Oh, you have NO idea, son,"" I agreed, collapsing into laughter<br /> once again.</p>

13895,"<p>BUTTERBALL TURKEY TALK-LINE 'GREATEST HITS'(or, 'Memorable Moments in Talk-Line History;' or, 'Out of the Mouths of.... Turkey Trauma Victims')Over the years, the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line staff have had their share of memorable calls -- inquiries that stand out from the crowd because they're heartwarming or amusing. We asked some of the veteran staff members to tell us their favorites; plus, we rounded up a bunch of our own personal favorites from the Talk-Line archives. Its hard to beat the call from a trucker who planned to cook his Thanksgiving turkey on the engine of his truck ('Will it cook faster if I drive faster?'), but some of these come pretty close. Warning: do not attempt to adjust your screen -- these are real incidents, true stories -- from the front lines!* Home alone, a Kentucky woman was in the doghouse when she called the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line. While preparing the turkey, her Chihuahua jumped into the bird's body cavity and couldn't get out. She tried pulling the dog and shaking the bird, but nothing worked. She and the dog became more and more distraught. After calming the woman down, the Talk-Line home economist suggested carefully cutting the opening in the cavity of the turkey wider. It worked and Fido was freed!* Birdie, eagle and turkey? Roasting a turkey doesn't have to interfere with the daily routine, so said a retired Floridian. He called 'Turkey Central' for turkey grilling tips while waiting to tee off from the 14th hole.* Taking turkey preparation an extra step, a Virginian wondered, 'How do you thaw a fresh turkey?' The Talk-Line staffer explained that fresh turkeys aren't frozen and don't need to be thawed.* Don't wait until the last minute! On Thanksgiving Day, a Georgian woman took the 'Be prepared' motto to heart. She had just agreed to host Thanksgiving Dinner and called the Talk-Line a year ahead of time for turkey tips.* Happy Thanksgiving, President Clinton! A Southern woman called to comment, 'On Thanksgiving Day, the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line is more important than the President. He can take the day off, but the Talk-Line staff can't.' (The Butterball Turkey Talk-Line is open Thanksgiving Day, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Central Standard Time.)* Thanksgiving Dinner on the run. A woman called 1-800-323-4848 to find out how long it would take to roast her turkey. To answer the question, the Talk-Line home economist asked how much the bird weighed. The woman responded, 'I don't know, it's still running around outside.'* Tofu turkey? No matter how you slice it, Thanksgiving just isn't Thanksgiving without turkey. A restaurant owner in California wanted to know how to roast a turkey for a vegetarian menu.* White meat, anyone? A West Coast woman took turkey preparation to extremes by scrubbing her bird with bleach. Afterward, she called the Talk-Line to find out how to clean off the bleach. To her dismay, she was advised to dispose of the turkey.* A young girl called on behalf of her mother who needed roasting advice. To provide approximate roasting times, the home economist asked what size the turkey was. Without asking her mother the little girl paused, then replied, 'Medium.'* A novice turkey-cooking chef wanted to know if the yellow netting and wrapper around the turkey should be removed before roasting. Envisioning a melted plastic turkey blob, the home economist responded, 'Yes,' then offered complete roasting directions.</p>

13911,"<p>One bright, beautiful Sunday morning, everyone in tiny Jonestown wakes up early and goes to their local church. Before the service starts, the townspeople sit in their pews and talk about their lives and their families.Suddenly, at the altar, Satan appears!! Everyone starts screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in their determined efforts to get away from Evil Incarnate. Soon, everyone is evacuated from the church except for one man, who sit calmly in his pew, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy is in his presence. This confuses Satan a bit. Satan walks up to the man and says, ""Hey, don't you know who I am?"" The man says, ""Yep, sure do.""Satan says, ""Well, aren't you afraid of me?"" The man says, ""Nope, sure ain't.""Satan, perturbed, says, ""And why aren't you afraid of me?"" The man says, ""Well, I've been married to your sister for 25 years.""</p>

<p>""We are starting to learn more about Osama bin Laden. For his birthday one year, somebody gave him a $4 Timex. We know that. He is married to the daughter of a guy named Mullah Muhammed Omar. I think her name is Tiffany Omar. Insiders say that the marriage is not working out. Apparently they are living in separate caves.""<br /> � David Letterman</p>

<p>""There are now rumors that the Taliban has been poisoning the food we have been dropping. We should make a deal with the people of Afghanistan. We'll taste your food, you check our mail.""<br /> � Jay Leno</p>
<p>""People are wondering what will happen to Afghanistan when we're finished fighting there. I'm sure there are plans to rebuild the country, and a lot of times with rebuilding comes a name change. These are some possible name changes the government has been mulling over: Halfghanistan, Pothole-istan, Jenniferanistan, Assbackwardstan, Bye-bye-Talibanstan, Ass-Kicked-istan.""<br /> � Jay Leno</p>

<p>""We are getting more and more insight into the life of Osama bin Laden.

Regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as I do, in spite of yourself.'And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam. And it was a good animal. And God was pleased. And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and it wagged its tail. And Adam said, 'Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom and I cannot think of a name for this new animal.' And God said, 'No problem. Because I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you his name will be a reflection of my own name, and you will call him Dog.'And Dog lived with Adam and was a companion to him and loved him. And Adam was comforted. And God was pleased. And Dog was content and wagged his tail.After a while, it came to pass that Adam's guardian angel came to the Lord and said, 'Lord, Adam has become filled with pride. He struts and preens like a peacock and he believes he is worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed taught him that he is loved, but perhaps too well.'And the Lord said, 'No problem. I will create for him a companion who will be with him forever and who will see him as he is. The companion will remind him of his limitations, so he will know that he is not always worthy of adoration.'And God created Cat to be a companion to Adam. And Cat would not obey Adam. And when Adam gazed into Cat's eyes, he was reminded that he was not the Supreme Being. And Adam learned humility.And God was pleased. And Adam was greatly improved. And Dog was happy. And Cat didn't give a shit one way or the other.</p>

13945,"<p>BONN, Germany (Reuter) -- Thousands of Germans are keeping unfortunate surnames such as Kotz (Vomit), Moerder (Murder), Brathuhn (Roast chicken) and even Hitler, even though they could legally change them, a magazine reported Sunday.</p>

13947,"<p>Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked beans. He loved them, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him. One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it was apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself, ""She'll never go for me carrying on like that,"" so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up his beloved baked beans, and shortly after, that they got married. It was his birthday a few months later and, on the way home from work, his car broke down. Since they lived in the country, the man called his wife and told her he would be late because he had to walk. On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk, he figured he could walk off any ill effects before he got home. So he went in and ordered, and before leaving had three extra large helpings of baked beans. All the way home he 'putt-putted'. He 'putted' down one hill and 'putt-putted' up the next. By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe. His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, ""Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!"" She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peek. At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as she was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and she went to answer the phone. While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but ripe as a rotten egg. He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and 'rrriiiipppp!' It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms awhile, hoping the smell would dissipate. Things had just about returned to normal when he felt another urge coming. He shifted his weight to his other leg and let go. This was a real blue-ribbon winner; the windows rattled, the dishes on the table shook and, a minute later, the flowers on the table were dead. While keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway, and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for the next ten minutes, farting and fanning them each time with his napkin. When he heard his wife saying goodbye (indicating the end of his loneliness, and freedom) he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner. After assuring her he had not, she removed the blindfold and yelled, ""Surprise!!!"" To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise birthday party.</p>

13950,"<p>A language instructor was explaining to her class that French nouns, unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically designated as masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>Things like 'chalk' or 'pencil,' she described, would have a gender association although in English these words were neutral. Puzzled, one student raised his hand and asked, ""What gender is a computer?"" </p>
<p>The teacher wasn't certain which it was,and so divided the class into two groups and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. One group was comprised of the women in the class, and the other, of men. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendation.</p>
<p>The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to in masculine gender because:<br /> 1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br /> 2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.<br /> 3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.<br /> 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.</p>
<p>The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender because:<br /> 1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.<br /> 2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br /> 3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br /> 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories.</p>

<p>Finally God said, ""Pipe down now, Satan. I am going to set up a test that will run two hours and I will judge who does the better job.""</p>
<p>So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away. They moused. They did spreadsheets. </p>
<p>They wrote reports. They sent faxes. They sent e-mail. They sent out e-mail with attachments. </p>
<p>They downloaded. They did some genealogy reports. They made cards. They did every known job. </p>
<p>But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.</p>
<p>Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every bad word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed. The electricity finally flickered back on and each of them restarted their computers.</p>
<p>Satan started searching frantically, screaming ""It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!""</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. </p>

The redhead, feeling sudden guilt for having bet on such an incident, turns to the blonde and tells her that she does not need to pay the $50.""No, a bet's a bet,"" the blonde replies, ""I owe you $50 dollars.""The redhead, feeling even more guilty, replies ""No, you don't understand, I saw the 3:00 edition, so I knew how it was going to turn out.""""That's okay,"" the blonde replies, ""I saw it earlier too, but I didn't think he'd do it again.""</p>

13981,"<p>One day the different parts of the body were having an argument to see which should be in charge.</p>
<p>The brain said ""I do all the thinking so I'm the most  important and I should be in charge.""</p>
<p>The eyes said ""I see everything and let the rest of you know where we are, so I'm the most important and I should be in charge.""</p>
<p>The hands said ""Without me we wouldn't be able to  pick anything up or move anything. So I'm the most important and I should be in charge.""</p>
<p>The stomach said ""I turn the food we eat into energy for the rest of you. Without me, we'd starve. So I'm the most important and I should be in charge.""</p>
<p>The legs said ""Without me we wouldn't be able to move anywhere. So I'm the most important and I should be in charge.""</p>
<p>Then the rectum said ""I think I should be in charge.""</p>
<p>All the rest of the parts said ""YOU?!? You don't do  anything! You're not important! You can't be in charge.""</p>
<p>So the rectum closed up. </p>
<p>After a few days, the legs were all wobbly, the  stomach was all queasy, the hands were all shaky, the eyes were all watery, and the brain was all cloudy. They all agreed that they couldn't take any more of this and agreed to put the rectum in charge.</p>
<p>The moral of the story?</p>
<p>You don't have to be the most important to be in charge, just be an asshole!</p>

13985,"<p>The finals of the National Poetry Contest last year came down to two finalists. One was a Duke University Law School graduate from an upper crust family; well-bred, well-connected, and all that goes with it. The other finalist was a redneck from Southeast Alabama A&amp;M.</p>
<p>The rules of the contest required each finalist to compose a four-line poem in one minute or less, and the poem had to contain the word ""Timbuktu"".</p>
<p>The Duke graduate went first. About thirty seconds after the clock started he jumped up and recited the following poem:</p>
<p>Slowly across the desert sand<br /> Trekked the dusty caravan.<br /> Men on camels, two by two<br /> Destination-Timbuktu.</p>
<p>The audience went wild!!! How, they wondered, could the redneck top that?! The clock started again and the redneck sat in silent thought. Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited:</p>
<p>Tim and me, a-huntin' went.<br /> Met three whores in a pop-up tent.<br /> They was three, we was two,<br /> So I bucked one and Timbuktu.</p>

13988,"<p>A travelling ventriloquist on the road in between jobs decided to practice his craft before his next show. He stopped at a farmhouse and approached the farmer who lived there. ""Hello there, Mr. Farmer, I was just passing by and I was wondering if I might speak to your dog.""</p>
<p>The farmer replied, ""Well, you know, dogs don't talk.""</p>
<p>The ventriloquist said, ""You'd be surprised what a dog might tell you. Can I speak with him?""</p>
<p>The farmer, eyeing the ventriloquist suspiciously, called his dog.</p>
<p>""Hi there, Mr. dog,"" said the ventriloquist. ""How does the farmer treat you?"" To which the dog replied, ""Oh, he's great! He throws a stick for me, scratches my belly, and I just love him!!""</p>
<p>Needless to say, the farmer was dumfounded. Wanting to see if he could fool the farmer again, the ventriloquist asked if he could speak with the farmer's horse.</p>
<p>""Well, you know, horses don't talk.""</p>
<p>Again the ventriloquist said, ""You'd be surprised what a horse might tell you."" So the farmer brought out his horse. ""Say, Mr. Horse, how does the farmer treat you?"" asked the ventriloquist. The horse then replied, ""Oh, I think he's great. He feeds me oats, he puts a blanket over me at night, and I just love him!""</p>
<p>Again the farmer was amazed. Wanting to try his luck a third time, the ventriloquist said, ""Mr. Farmer, would you like to hear what the sheep has to say about you?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" declared the farmer, ""Sheep lie, ya' know.""</p>

13993,"<p>After having their 11th child, an Alabama couple decided that<br /> was enough. So, the husband went to his doctor and told him that<br /> he and his wife didn't want to have any more children.</p>
<p>The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a<br /> vasectomy that could fix the problem. The doctor instructed him<br /> to go home, get a cherry bomb (fireworks are legal in Alabama),<br /> light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear<br /> and count to 10.</p>
<p>The Alabamian said to the doctor, ""I may not be the smartest<br /> man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can<br /> next to my ear is going to help me.""</p>
<p>So, the couple drove to Georgia to get a second opinion. The<br /> Georgia physician was just about to tell them about the<br /> procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed that they were from<br /> Alabama. This doctor instead told the man to go home and get a<br /> cherry bomb, light it, place it in a beer can, hold it to his<br /> ear and count to 10.</p>
<p>Figuring that both doctors couldn't be wrong, the man went home,<br /> lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can. He held the can up<br /> to his ear and began to count. </p>
<p>""1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . . . "", at which point he paused, placed the<br /> beer can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand.</p>

13995,"<p>A visiting professor at the University of Alabama is giving a<br /> seminar on the supernatural.  To get a feel for his audience, he asks: ""How<br /> many people here believe in ghosts?""<br />   About 90 students raise their hands.""Well that's a good start. Out of<br />  those of you who believe in ghosts, do any of you think you've ever<br />  seen a ghost?""<br />   About 40 students raise their hands. ""That's really good.  I'm<br /> really glad you take this seriously. Has anyone here ever talked to a<br /> ghost?""<br />   15 students raise their hands. ""That's a great response.  Has anyone<br />  here ever touched a ghost?""<br />   3 students raise their hands. ""That's fantastic.  But let me ask<br /> you one question further... Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?""<br />   One student in the back raises his hand. The professor is astonished.<br />  He takes off glasses, takes a step back, and says,  ""Son, all the years<br />  I've been giving this lecture, no one has ever claimed to have slept<br />  with a ghost. You've got to come up here and tell us about your<br /> experience.""<br />   The redneck student (remember, this is Alabama) replies with a nod and<br />  begins to make his way up  to the podium.  The professor says,<br />  ""Well, tell us what it's like to have sex with a ghost.""<br />  The student replies,  ""Ghost?!?  Damn, I thought you said 'goats.'""</p>

""O.K"" The man said, ""Now you can<br /> see the clock on the wall over there.""</p>
