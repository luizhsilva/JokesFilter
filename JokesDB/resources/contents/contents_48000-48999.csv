<p>Miss Smythe gasped, then said freezingly, ""Mr. Perkins, I don't think that is a proper question to ask me. I assure you my parents will hear of this!"" With that she sat down red-faced.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Mr. Perkins called on Miss Johnson and asked the same question.</p>
<p>Miss Johnson, with composure replied, ""The pupil of the eye, in dim light.""</p>

48006,"<p>The Pope met with the College of Cardinals to discuss a proposal from Shimon Peres, the former leader of Israel. ""Your holiness,"" said one of the Cardinals, ""Mr. Peres wants to determine whether Jews or Catholics are superior, by challenging you to a golf match."" The Pope was greatly disturbed, as he had never held a golf club in his life. ""Not to worry,"" said the Cardinal, ""we'll call America and talk to Jack Nicklaus. We'll make him a Cardinal, he can play Shimon Peres... We can't lose!"" Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made and, of course, Jack was honored and agreed to play. The day after the match, Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the Pope of his success in the match. ""I came in second, your Holiness,"" said Nicklaus. ""Second?!!"" exclaimed the surprised Pope. ""You came in second to Shimon Peres?!!"" ""No,"" said Nicklaus, ""second to Rabbi Woods.""</p>

48009,"<p>The Geography of a Woman<br /> ------------------------<br /> Between the ages of 18 - 21 a woman is like Africa or Australia. She is half discovered, half wild and naturally beautiful with bushland around the fertile deltas.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 21 - 30 a woman is like America or Japan. Completely discovered, very well developed and open to trade especially with countries with cash or cars.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 30 - 35, she is like India or Spain. Very hot, relaxed and convinced of its own beauty.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 35 - 40 a woman is like France or Argentina. She may have been half destroyed during the war but can still be a warm and desirable place to visit.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 40 - 50 she is like Yugoslavia or Iraq. She lost the war and is haunted by past mistakes. Massive reconstruction is now necessary.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 50 - 60 she is like Russia or Canada. Very wide, quiet and the borders are practically unpatrolled but the frigid climate keeps people away.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 60 - 70 a woman is like England or Mongolia. With a glorious and all conquering past but alas no future (a bit like Tony Blair, maybe Blair's a women really).</p>
<p>After 70, they become Albania or Afghanistan. Everyone knows where it is, but no one wants to go there.</p>

48022,"<p>A man was driving home after a hard days drinking in a English<br /> country pub. He was doing 80 mph down a narrow lane when he saw<br /> two Welsh men walking up the lane towards him. They saw him<br /> coming towards them at high speed and tried to get out of his<br /> way. Unfortunatly for them the driver decided that they would<br /> make good targets. He aimed his car directly at them and BANG,<br /> he hit them. The first was thrown over a nearby hedge into a<br /> farmer's field, the second smashed through his windscreen.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later a police car turned up at the scene. The<br /> police man got out of his car and asked the driver what had<br /> happened. He tried to explain that he had only been doing 30 mph<br /> and had tried to avoid the Welsh men but they jumped out in<br /> front of his car and he could not avoid them. The police man was<br /> having none of this and asked again what had happened. The<br /> driver then replied that he had been doing 50mph and had a<br /> couple of pints to drink. He had seen the Welsh men but only too<br /> late and he had tried but failed to avoid them. The police man<br /> was still suspisious, the driver was stinking of alcahol and<br /> sluring his words, so he asked again.</p>
<p>This time the driver said that he had had about 10 pints, been<br /> doing 80 mph, saw the Welsh men and meant to hit them.</p>
<p>The police man replied that he would do the man who had smashed<br /> through the windscreen for breaking and entering and the man in<br /> the field for leaving the scene of the crime and let the driver<br /> go.</p>

48026,"<p>25 rules for Women to follow:</p>
<p>1. Sports Center starts at 11:00 PM and runs an hour. This is a great time to pay bills, put laundry in the dryer or talk to your sister. Do not bother me!!</p>
<p>2. Two hot dogs and a beer at a baseball game DO, in fact, constitute going out to dinner.</p>
<p>3. Unlike you, we essentially want to dress just exactly like all our friends. Thus, you need not go much further than the Gap, J. Crew, Banana Republic or the local Patagonia store.</p>
<p>4. If we see you in the morning and at night, why call us at work? </p>
<p>5. Butthead is the smart one.</p>
<p>6. Is it too much to ask to have the bra match the underwear? </p>
<p>7.  You probably don't want to know what we're thinking about.</p>
<p>8. Silence does not need to be filled with discussions about ""us"" and ""the relationship.""</p>
<p>9. Things you can help with: the Sunday crossword, yard work, the dishes, cleaning, and grocery shopping.</p>
<p>10. Things you should let us do alone: figuring out where we are, watching anything on TBS, playing cards, smoking cigars and picking out the beer.</p>
<p>11. Socks never constitute a gift. </p>
<p>12. Department stores and malls were designed so that when you want to look at bed linen, shower curtains or handbags, there are always some speakers, tires or sporting equipment nearby.</p>
<p>13. We don't know anything about handbags. Don't even ask. </p>
<p>14. We DID water the plants. They died anyway. Nobody knows why this happens.</p>
<p>15. Even if you think he's cute, Kevin Costner can't act.</p>
<p>16. Of course, neither can Elle McPherson, but she had the good sense to make the movie ""Sirens"" rather than ""Waterworld.""</p>
<p>17. Curley is the bald one.</p>
<p>18. Compromise does not mean that we abandon our position in favor of yours.</p>
<p>19. Sports Illustrated is a better magazine than Cosmopolitan. Just accept that.</p>
<p>20. It is neither in your interest nor ours to take The Quiz together.</p>
<p>21. Unless you are willing to follow the careers of Mo Vaughn, Cal Ripken, David Robinson, Michael Jordan, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chris Farley, don't expect us to know what Helen Gurley Brown, Hilary Clinton, Naomi Wolf or your mother are up to.</p>
<p>22. Sex on a weeknight is generally welcome. Three hours of post-coital conversation is not.</p>
<p>23. Dinner out is a pretty good birthday present. Two tickets to a ball game are even better.</p>
<p>24. No, you can't have the remote control.</p>
<p>25. If you must take us with you into Victoria's Secret, never, ever leave us alone. All the old fat ladies make mean faces at us and only add to our discomfort.</p>

48028,"<p>A guy dies and goes to heaven. It's a slow day for St. Peter, so, upon passing the entrance test, St. Peter says, ""I'm not very busy today, why don't you let me show you around?"" </p>
<p>The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the offer. St. Peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a huge room full of clocks.</p>
<p>The guy asks, ""What's up with these clocks?""</p>
<p>St. Peter explains, ""Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged."" </p>
<p>The guy thinks that this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks are going faster than others. He asks why that is? </p>
<p>St. Peter explains, ""Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds his clock.""</p>
<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, ""What's the story with that clock?""</p>
<p>""Oh, that,"" St. Peter replies, ""That's OJ Simpson's clock. We decided to use it as a fan.""</p>

48042,"<p>A language instructor was explaining to her class that in French, nouns  unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically designated as  masculine or feminine.""House,"" in French, is feminine-""la mansion.""   ""Pencil,"" in French, is masculine - ""le crayon.""  One puzzled student asked, ""...What gender is computer?..."" The teacher  did not know, and the word wasn't in her French dictionary.  So for fun she split the class into two groups appropriately enough, by   gender, and asked them to decide whether ""computer"" should  be a   masculine or feminine noun. Both groups were required to give four  reasons for their recommendation.  The men's group decided that computers should definitely be of the  feminine gender (""la computer""), because:  1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic;  2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is     incomprehensible to everyone else;  3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long-term  memory for      possible later retrieval; and 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself      spending half your pay check on accessories for it.  The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be masculine  (""le computer""), because:  1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on;  2. They have a lot of data but they are still clueless;  3. They are supposed to help you solve problems but half the time they     ARE the problem; and 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if  you'd  waited a     little longer, you could have gotten a better model.  The women won.</p>

48049,"<p>Top Ten Reasons Why God Created Eve 10. God was worried that Adam would frequently become lost in the Garden. 9. God knew that one day Adam would require someone to locate and hand him the remote. 8. God knew Adam would never go out and buy himself a new fig leaf when his wore out and would therefore need Eve to buy one for him. 7. God knew Adam would never be able to make a doctor's, dentist, or haircut appointment for himself. 6. God knew Adam would never remember which night to put the garbage on the curb. 5. God knew if the world was to be populated, men would never be able to handle the pain and discomfort of childbearing. 4. As the Keeper of the Garden, Adam would never remember where he left his tools. 3. Apparently, Adam needed someone to blame his troubles on when God caught him hiding in the garden. 2. As the Bible says, It is not good for man to be alone. And finally, the Number 1 reason why God created Eve... 1. When God finished the creation of Adam, He stepped back, scratched his head, and said, ""I can do better than that!""</p>

<p>So, the husband goes on for the rest of the day without a single<br /> word from his wife. Right after dinner he gets asked again:<br /> ""Honey , can you fix the toilet? It is overflowing.""</p>
<p>Now, obviously mad the husband replies: ""I told you I am NOT a<br /> Plumber!""</p>
<p>The next day when the husband comes home his wife meets him at<br /> the door and starts to lavish him with kisses.</p>
<p>She finally stops and she tells her husband that the most<br /> increadible thing happened to her: ""Well, this really georgous<br /> man moved in next door and he fixed everything for me.... Well,<br /> there was one of two forms of payment--I could have made mad<br /> passionate love to him or I could have made him a cake.""</p>
<p>The husband looks at his wife and asks: ""So, what kind of cake<br /> did you bake him?""</p>

48099,"<p>Oral Sex Oral Argument  Will the justices know it when they see it?'But Ginsburg suggested Lewinsky may say she and Clinton engaged in an act other than intercourse. 'What's the president's definition of sex?' he asked in an interview minutes after Clinton's statement.'--USA Today, Jan. 27, 1998Justice O'Connor: I am trying to get my mind around this theory, Counselor.Mr. Bennett: Yes, Your Honor.Justice O'Connor: You say it was not sex? Though the affidavit and counsel all attest that she ... did as the affidavit attests?Mr. Bennett: Your honor, we are proposing that not everything that looks like sex is sex and that some things that do not look like sex are in fact sex. To me, ministering to a person's toes in a particular way does not look like sex, but I am reliably told it is sex. On the other hand, say you visit your doctor and your doctor fingers your anatomy, to find lumps or sores or whatever. That's not sex.Justice Kennedy: Sorry, Mr. Bennett, are you suggesting that your client was being checked for testicular cancer?Mr. Bennett: Not exactly, Your Honor. We are saying that a mere sexlike act does not, prima facie, constitute sex. Sometimes it is something else. My client allowed himself to be attended to in a very particular fashion but, as you have seen, it was for his health.Justice Thomas: I have had that operation, and it works. [Image]  Mr. Bennett: Yes, Your Honor. Now, it  would have been sex had it been something  else--say, a procreative type of act. All  major religions categorize that type of  act as sex, which is why they oppose it  except in very particular circumstances.  But the type of act that my client was  engaged in--no, he was not lying when he  said he had not had sex, or else every  woman in the country is having an affair  with her gynecologist. Justice Scalia: I don't believe that  women actually enjoy these gynecological  examinations. There's a difference, isn't  there? Mr. Bennett: Your honor, we maintain that  my client also did not enjoy the  particular operations in which the young  woman assisted him. Justice Scalia: 'Assisted him'? Mr. Bennett: Well, he could not do it by  himself, could he? Justice Thomas: Some people can!  [Image]  Justice Scalia: If this was a necessary  medical act, for his well-being and so  forth, why didn't he go to his doctor to  have it done? Mr. Bennett: I take your point, Your  Honor, but have you seen his doctor? Justice Scalia: No, but I thought he  needed an 'assistant,' not a sex object.  That's your point, isn't it? If he needed  a sex object, then it was sex, wasn't it? [Image]  Mr. Bennett: If you will bear with me,  Your Honor, he needed a sex object to  help him with a sexlike but nonsexual  act. It is in the nature of this  particular operation to require the  assistance of a person who is, shall we  say, physically qualified. Justice Rehnquist: So he could not have  had, say, a middle-age man do it for him? Mr. Bennett: No, sir, not as I understand  the matter. Justice Breyer: How about a younger man?  Say, a 21-year-old college wrestler who  has worked up a good sweat? That might  work, mightn't it? Mr. Bennett: Your honor, we may be losing  sight of the point, which is that even if  he did go to such a person for this  particular operation, and the operation  was successful, then of course that also  would not have been sex.  [Image] Justice Stevens: Look, his wife could do it, couldn't she?Mr. Bennett: Your honor, she in fact did do it, but that also was not sex. It was not the procreative-type act, and the procreative-type act is what defines sexual relations within the context of matrimony. Moreover, she has not done it very much lately.Justice Scalia: So what he was doing with the young woman, these 'treatments' ... that would have been adulterous nonsex?Justice O'Connor: Honestly, Counselor, I have never heard a more amazing argument in my life. Surely you can't maintain that his looking after this particular health need, as you call it, which is so highly pleasurable, is like having kidney dialysis or getting an enema?Mr. Bennett: Your honor, he did not take pleasure in it. We have stipulated to that effect on numerous occasions and under oath. It was not enjoyable for him, except insofar as it was a purely physical release. It was a treatment for him. Of course, the release of any physical pressure is always pleasurable in some sense--for instance, when the [Illustration by Robert Neubecker]summons of nature is answered after a particularly long period of time--but it was not done for pleasure. [Image]  Justice Souter: What if someone else did  it with her? I mean, would that be sex,  in the government's view, or does this  rule apply only to him? I mean, what if  she treated the vice president? Mr. Bennett: That would depend on how  much that person needed it. My  understanding is that the vice president  does not need it or do it, but if he did  it, it would be sex, because he can get  along just fine without it. Justice Kennedy: So how are we supposed  to be so sure that your client has this  sort of intense medical-type need, as  distinct from, I don't know--an ordinary  sexual-type need? I mean, you want us to  take his word for it, is that it, plus  these expert witnesses you've corralled? Mr. Bennett: Your honor, if this had been  something less than an essential  medical-type need, do you think he would  have been so thoughtless as to risk his  office and his place in history merely  for sex? Justice Kennedy: No. That would be  implausible. [Image] Jonathan Rauch is a national  correspondent of National Journal in  Washington. Illustrations by Robert Neubecker.  [Image]</p>

48111,"<p>A doctor, a lawyer and a mathematician were discussing the relative merits of having a wife or a mistress.</p>
<p>The lawyer says, ""For sure a mistress is better. If you have a wife and want a divorce, it causes all sorts of legal problems.</p>

"
48113,"<p>Relationships:<br /> When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled 'All Men Are Idiots.' Then she will get on with her life. A mail has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3 am on a Sunday morning, he will call and say, 'I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I'll never forgive you, and hate you, and you're a total floozy. But I want you to know that there's always a chance for us.' This is known as the 'I Hate You, I Love You' drunken phone call and 99 percent of all men have made it at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need.</p>
<p>Sex:<br /> Women prefer 30 to 40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30 to 40 seconds of foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.</p>
<p>Maturity:<br /> Women mature much faster than men do. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.</p>
<p>Magazines:<br /> Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women's magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman's body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.</p>
<p>Bathrooms:<br /> A man has five items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.</p>
<p>Groceries:<br /> A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampetts' car on The Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10?items?or?less lane.</p>
<p>Cats:<br /> Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.</p>
<p>Offspring:<br /> Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.</p>
<p>Dressing Up:<br /> A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.</p>
<p>Laundry:<br /> Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a van and take his mountain of clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by reruns of old American sitcoms.</p>
<p>Eating Out:<br /> When the bill comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it's only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.</p>
<p>Mirrors:<br /> Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror. Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any, shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, bald boyfriend's/father's heads.</p>
<p>Menopause: When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, biological Changes. Nature provokes a uniform reaction in men. He buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.</p>
<p>Richard Gere:<br /> Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because lie reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.</p>
<p>Madonna:<br /> Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.</p>
<p>Toys:<br /> Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical. Examples of men's toys: little miniature TVs. Cell phones. Complicated juicers and blenders. Graphic equalizers. Small robots that serve cocktails on command. Video games. Anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least six big batteries to operate.</p>
<p>Locker Rooms:<br /> In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about one thing in the locker room: sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.</p>
<p>Movies:<br /> Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man. Men will only show their arse, because arse size doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>Jewelry:<br /> Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that's it. Any more than that and he will look like a lounge singer named Ramone.</p>
<p>Time:<br /> When a woman says she'll be ready to go out in five more minutes, she's using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football game just has five minutes left. Neither of them is counting time outs, commercials, or replays.</p>
<p>Friends:<br /> Women on a 'girls' night out' talk the whole time. Men on a 'boys' night out' say about 20 words all night, most of which are 'Pass the chips' or 'Got am more beer?'</p>
<p>Toilets:<br /> Men use toilets for purely biological reasons. Women use toilets as social lounges. Men in toilets will never speak a word to each other. Women who've never met will leave a toilet giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, 'Hey Tom, I, was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?'</p>

48115,"<p>A general store owner hires a young female assistant with a penchant for very short skirts. </p>

48130,"<p>A kilted Scotsman was walking down a country path after finishing off<br /> considerable amount of whisky at a local pub. As he staggered down the road, he<br /> felt quite sleepy and decided to take a nap, with his back against a tree.<br /> As he slept, two young lasses walked down the road and heard the Scotsman<br /> snoring loudly. They saw him, and one said, ""I've always wondered what a<br /> Scotsman wears under his kilt.""<br /> She boldly walked over to the sleeping man, raised his kilt, and saw what<br /> nature had provided him at his birth.<br /> Her friend said, ""Well, he has solved a great mystery for us, now! He must be<br /> rewarded!"" So, she took a blue ribbon from her hair, and gently tied it around<br /> what nature had provided the Scotsman, and the two walked away.<br /> Several minutes later, the Scotsman was awakened by the call of nature, and<br /> walked around to the other side of the tree to relieve him. He raised his<br /> kilt...and saw where the blue ribbon was tied. After several moments of<br /> bewilderment, the Scotsman said...<br /> "" I dinna know where y'been lad...but its nice ta'know y'won first prize!""</p>

48131,"<p>It seems when God was making the world, He called man over and bestowed<br /> upon him twenty years of normal sex life. Man was horrified, ""Only twenty<br /> years of normal sex life?"" But the Lord was adamant that was all man could<br /> have.</p>
<p>Then the Lord called the monkey and gave him 20 years. ""But I don't need<br /> 20 years,"" he protested, ""ten's plenty for me."" Man spoke up eagerly, ""Can<br /> I have the other 10?"" The monkey graciously agreed.</p>
<p>Then the Lord called the lion and gave him 20 years. And the lion, like<br /> the monkey, wanted only 10. Again the man spoke up, ""Can I have the other<br /> 10?"" The lion said of course he could.</p>
<p>Then came the donkey and he was given 20 years. But like the others, ten<br /> was sufficient. And again man pleaded, ""Can I have the other 10?"" The<br /> donkey said yes he could.</p>
<p>This explains why man has 20 years of normal sex life, plus 10 years of<br /> monkeying around, 10 years of lion about it and 10 years of making an ass<br /> out of himself.</p>

He's so successful in fact, in the last year he was able to give a good friend a brand new home as a gift.""</p>
<p> The second man, not to be outdone, allows how his son began his career as a car salesman, but now owns a multi-line dealership. ""He's so successful, in fact, in the last six months he gave a friend two brand new cars as a gift."" </p>

<p>""To tell the truth, I'm not very pleased with how my son has turned out, he replies. ""For fifteen years, he's been a hairdresser, and I've just recently discovered he's a practicing homosexual.

48148,"<p>A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that there<br /> was a fortune in horse racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the<br /> races. However at the local auction, the going price for horses was so high that<br /> he ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it, he might<br /> as well go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in<br /> third! The next day the local paper carried this headline: �PREACHER'S ASS<br /> SHOWS�<br /> The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race<br /> again, and this time it won.

The paper headline read: �BISHOP SCRATCHES<br /> PREACHER'S ASS�<br /> This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the<br /> donkey. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. The paper<br /> headline the next day read: �NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN� the Bishop fainted. He<br /> informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to<br /> a farmer for $10.00. Next day the headline read: �NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00�<br /> This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the<br /> donkey, lead it to the plains where it could run wild and free.

<p>Unfortunately, the executive found himself unable to perform.</p>
<p>Limp as a dish rag!</p>
<p>On his first night home, the executive walked from the shower into the bedroom to find his wife covered in a rumpled bathrobe, her hair curled, her face creamed, munching candy loudly while she pored through a movie magazine.</p>
<p>Then, without warning, he felt the onset of a magnificent erection.</p>
<p>Looking down at his penis, he snarled, ""Why you ungrateful, mixed-up son of a bitch. Now I know why they call you a prick!""</p>

48189,"<p>A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon<br /> arrival the doctor said that he had invented a machine that would transfer a<br /> portion of the labor pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it<br /> out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the knob at 10% for<br /> starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had<br /> ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine, so<br /> he asked the doctor to bump the machine up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the<br /> machine to 20%. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and pulse and<br /> was amazed at how well he was doing. At 50% the husband was still holding up<br /> fine, since this was obviously helping out his wife he encouraged the doctor to<br /> transfer all of the pain.<br /> The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband<br /> were absolutely thrilled. Everything was great until they got home and found the<br /> mailman dead on their porch.</p>

48221,"<p>El peque�o ten�a seis a�os y, como otros ni�os de su edad, era muy curioso. El hab�a estado oyendo a los mayores acerca del noviazgo y se preguntaba como ser�a eso. Un d�a le pregunt� a su mam�, quien impresionada le dijo que para que entendiera lo que era el noviazgo se escondiera detr�s de las cortinas de la sala y observara a su hermana mayor con su novio. A la ma�ana siguiente le relat� a su mam� lo que hab�a visto:</p>
<p>Mi hermana y su novio se sentaron y hablaron por un largo rato. Entonces, �l apag� casi todas las luces y comenz� a abrazarla y besarla; yo pens� que se estaba enfermando porque su cara se estaba poniendo muy rara. Su novio debi� pensar lo mismo porque puso su mano dentro de la blusa de mi hermana para sentirle el coraz�n, pero al parecer ten�a problemas para encontr�rselo.</p>
<p>Yo pens� que �l tambi�n se estaba enfermando porque hubo un momento en que los dos se quedaron sin respiraci�n. El deb�a tener fr�o en su mano derecha porque la puso bajo la falda de mi hermana. Entonces ella empeor� porque se deslizaba por todo el sof�; �ten�a fiebre! Yo s� que ten�a fiebre porque ella dec�a que se sent�a muy caliente y que no pod�a m�s. </p>
<p>Al momento descubr� la causa de la enfermedad: era un enorme gusano que se le hab�a metido al novio de mi hermana en el pantal�n. El lo agarr� con la mano para que no se le escapara. Cuando mi hermana lo vi� se asust� mucho. Sus ojos se agrandaron y dijo que era el m�s grande que jam�s hab�a visto. Ella se enfureci� y trat� de matar al enorme gusano a puros mordiscos. De golpe ella hizo un sonido raro y dej� caer al gusano, me imagino que la mordi�. Entonces lo agarr� con las manos para sujetarlo mejor, mientras el novio sacaba un tubito de goma de una cajita y se lo puso sobre la cabeza al maldito gusano para que ya no mordiera a mi hermana. Ella se recost� y abri� las piernas de forma que pudiera aplicarle una llave de tijera al enorme gusano. El novio le ayud� a aprisionar al gusano y se form� una pelea de los mil demonios. </p>
<p>Ella empez� a brincar y a gritar como loca y por poco rompen el sof�. Me imagino que iban a matar al gusano aplast�ndolo entre los dos. Despu�s de un rato dejaron de moverse y dieron un suspiro porque estaban cansados de tan tremenda batalla. El novio se levant�. Estaban seguros de haber matado al gusano. Yo supe que el gusano estaba muerto porque colgaba inm�vil y parte de los sesos le sal�an por la cabeza. Mi hermana y su novio estaban agotados por la pelea, entonces, para descasar se acariciaron.</p>
<p>Pero no, el gusano no estaba muerto, �estaba vivo! Brinc� de nuevo y por poco los sorprende. De suerte que mi hermana lo vio y lo atac� ayudada por su novio en una terrible pelea. Esta vez mi hermana trat� de matar a este gusano inmortal sent�ndose encima de �l. Despu�s de varios minutos de lucha lograron matarlo. Esta vez s� estaba muerto porque el novio de mi hermana le arranc� el pellejo y lo arroj� por el inodoro.</p>
<p>Yo creo que los gusanos tienen siete vidas como los gatos y esto del noviazgo, la verdad, se me hace muy peligroso.</p>

<p>The were having a great time. Every day, they would wake up<br /> early and collect berries for their breakfast, then they would<br /> compare cases they'd worked on, then they might take a walk in<br /> the woods or play a round of golf. But, one day, as they were<br /> picking berries, a male bear and female bear came by. The male<br /> said to his wife ""I think the one on the left looks really<br /> tasty."" So, he gobbled up the Czech lawyer whole.</p>
<p>The other lawyer ran to his house and phoned Animal Control and<br /> told them to come over to shoot a bear that had eaten his<br /> friend. They cmae as fast as they could, and the frantic lawyer<br /> told them everything.</p>
<p>""My friend had flown in from the Czech Republic, and he was just<br /> staying here with me, and we were picking berries, when these<br /> bears came by and one of them ate him!""</p>
<p>""Okay, just calm down sir, which bear was it?"" asked one of the<br /> Animal Control specialists. ""The boy bear!"" screamed the lawyer.</p>
<p>So, the specialist took aim, and shot the female bear dead.</p>
<p>""What are you doing? I told you that it was the male bear!""<br /> asked the lawyer.</p>
<p>The Animal Control specialist looked at the lawyer and said<br /> ""Yeah, who ever trusts a lawyer when they say the Czech is in<br /> the male?""</p>

<p>Only nerds e-mailed in high school. (Cool kids hadn't heard of it.) </p>

<p>In high school, if you screw up you can usually sweet-talk your way out of it. In college, you're lucky to ever talk with the professor. </p>
<p>In high school, fire drills are planned by the administration. In college, by the drunk frat boys on their way home when the bars close. </p>
<p>In college, any test consists of a larger percentage of your grade than your high school final exams ever did. </p>
<p>In high school, when the teacher said, ""Good morning,"" you mumbled back. In college, when the professor says, ""Good morning,"" you write it down. </p>
<p>In high school, freshman guys hit on senior girls. In college, senior guys hit on freshman girls. </p>
<p>In college, weekends start on Thursday. </p>
<p>In college, it's much more difficult to figure out the course schedule of the man/woman you have a crush on, in order to figure out where he/she will be walking around campus and at what time to find them there. </p>
<p>Once you've obtained the information described in #16, it's much more time-consuming to run between classes to that place where you know he/she will be in order to ""just happen to bump into him/her."" </p>
<p>In college, there's no one to tell you not to eat pizza three meals a day. </p>
<p>In college, your dad doesn't pay for dates. </p>
<p>In high school, it never took 3 or 4 weeks to get money from Mom and Dad. </p>
<p>College men are cuter than high school boys (or college woman are developed). </p>
<p>College women are legal. </p>
<p>In college, when you miss a class (or two or three), you don't need a note from your parents saying you were skip....uh, sick that day. </p>
<p>In high school, you can't go out to lunch because it's not allowed. In college, you can't go out to lunch because you can't afford it. </p>
<p>In college, you can blow off studying by writing lists like this.</p>

48251,"<p>A young woman visited her doctor complaining of a bed wetting problem. The doctor asked her the usual questions and then asked her to go behind the screen and remove her clothes.She was a bit shocked, but went ahead anyway. When she was undressed he asked her to stand on her hands in front of and facing a full length mirror. The young woman was even more shocked, but if I would help solve her problem she thought she had better do what the doctor said. As soon as she was in position the doctor asked her to open her legs and when she did, he put his head between them and rested his chin right on her private parts. After a few moments and some very positive 'yes, yes' type noises the doctor instructed her to get dressed again.After she had, the doctor sat her down and informed her that the main cause of her problem was just that she was drinking far too much liquid before going to bed.""So what did the exercise in front of the mirror tell you?"" ""Well,"" he replied, ""my wife is right, a beard would suit me""</p>

"
48271,"<p>Dear Sirs,I am responding to your letter denying the deduction for two of the three dependents I claimed on my 1994 Federal Tax return. Thank you. I have questioned whether these are my children for years. They are evil and expensive.<br /> It's only fair that since they are minors and not my responsibility that the government (who evidently is taxing me more to care for these waifs) knows something about them and what to expect over the next year. You may apply next year to reassign them to me and reinstate the deduction. This year they are yours!</p>
<p>The oldest, Kristen, is now 17. She is brilliant. Ask her. I suggest you put her to work in your office where she can answer people's questions about their returns. While she has no formal training, it has not seemed to hamper her knowledge of any other subject you can name. Taxes should be a breeze.Next year she is going to college. I think it's wonderful that you will now be responsible for that little expense. While you mull that over keep in mind she has a truck. It doesn't run at the moment so you have the immediate decision of appropriating some Department of Defense funds to fix the vehicle or getting up early to drive her to school. Kristen also has a boyfriend. Oh joy. While she possesses all the wisdom of the universe, her alleged mother and I have felt it best to occasionally remind her of the virtues of abstinence. This is always uncomfortable and I am quite relieved you will be handling this in the future. </p>
<p>Patrick is 14. I've had my suspicions about this one. His eyes are a little close together for normal people. He may be a tax examiner himself one day if you do not incarcerate him first. In February I was awakened at three in the morning by a police officer who was bringing Pat home. He and his friends were TP'ing houses. In the future would you like him delivered to the local IRS office or to Ogden, UT? Kids at 14 will do almost anything on a dare. His hair is purple. Permanent dye, temporary dye, what's the big deal? Learn to deal with it. You'll have plenty of time as he is sitting out a few days of school after instigating a food fight. I'll take care of filing your phone number with the vice principal. Oh yes, he and his friends have raging hormones. This is a house of testosterone and it will be much more peaceful when he lives in your home. DO NOT leave any of them unsupervised with girls, explosives, inflammables, inflatable, vehicles, or telephones. (I'm sure that you will find telephones a source of unimaginable amusement, and be sure to lock out the 900 and 976 numbers])</p>
<p>Heather is an alien. She slid through a time warp and appeared quite by magic one year. I'm sure this one is yours. She is 10 going on 21. She came from a bad trip in the sixties. She wears tie-dyed clothes, beads, sandals,and hair that looks like Tiny Tim's. Fortunately you will be raising mt taxes to help offset the pinch of her remedial reading courses. Hooked On Phonics is expensive so the schools dropped it. Good news! You can buy it yourself for half the amount of the deduction that you are denying! It's quite obvious that we were terrible parents (ask the other two) so they have helped raise this one to a new level of terror. She cannot speak English.Most people under twenty understand the curious patois she fashioned out of valley girls/boys in the hood/reggae/yuppie/ political doublespeak. I don't. The school sends her to a speech pathologist who has her roll her R's. It added a refreshing Mexican/Irish touch to her voice. She wears hats backwards, pants baggy and wants one of her ears pierced four more times.There is a fascination with tattoos that worries me but I am sure that you can handle it. Bring a truck when you come to get her, she sort of ""nests""in her room and I think that it would be easier to move the entire thing than find out what it is really made of.</p>
<p>You denied two of the three exemptions so it is only fair you get to pick which two you will take. I prefer that you take the youngest, I still go bankrupt with Kristen's college but then I am free. If you take the two oldest then I still have time for counseling before Heather becomes a teenager. If you take the two girls then I won't feel so bad about putting Patrick in a military academy. Please let me know of your decision as soon as possible as I have already increased the withholding on my W-4 to cover the $395 in additional tax and made a down payment on an airplane.</p>
<p>Yours Truly,""Bob""</p>
<p>Note: The taxpayer in question was allowed the deductions.</p>

An obvious continuity gaffe.* Although the movie purports to be in Kansas, several scenes are obviously filmed on a Hollywood sound stage.* The scene where the teacher rides past Dorothy's bedroom window in the midst of a tornado is physically impossible.* When the characters sing you can hear music accompanying them but there are no radios or musicians in the area!* For a land to exist ""over the rainbow"" it would have to be lighter than air, and as Dorothy was already shown to be composed of solid matter, how come she didn't fall back down to earth?* Some of the so-called ""munchkins"" are obviously children wearing fake facial hair and grown up clothes.* The ""yellow brick road"" is not really yellow as much as it is golden. And there is some speculation that it isn't really made of brick either. (Thanks to the International Brick Layers Union for providing that piece of information.)* Scarecrows are inanimate objects moved solely by the wind. They can not move at will, much less dance.* A ""tin man"" is a slang term for an aluminum siding salesman. The movie portrays the salesman as an actual tin man. And what's with the ax? Someone in the research department should've gotten fired over this flub.* Lions growl. They do not talk. There is no recorded evidence of one talking, ever. Perhaps the filmmaker's were thinking of the Biblical Balaam's ass, which is the only recorded incident of an animal actually speaking coherent sentences.* Lions are also quadrupeds, meaning they walk on all fours. The ""lion"" in the movie is obviously a man in a suit trying to pass himself off as the real thing.* As for the ruby red slippers, well, despite the sure protestations from some of our lady-folk here, shoes do not have magical powers.* The witch views the goings on through her crystal ball. A purely fictional device. Obviously special effects created the scenes she was supposed to be watching in the ball. (Note: While there is a device on the market called ""The Magic 8 Ball,"" which is a genuine fortune telling device, this is not the type of ball employed in the scene just mentioned.)* Monkeys do not have wings, and cannot fly.* The witch flies on a broom and skywrites with it as well. Again, an invented fiction that would make Oliver Stone proud.* Trees cannot talk, nor can they ""throw"" apples. Once an apple is ripe, however, it may fall onto the ground directly beneath it.* Although there are many scenes with trees in them, not once does Toto mark his territory on them. This goes against common sense and ruins the believability of the movie.* For that matter no character in the entire movie goes to the bathroom. Although the ""tin man"" does leak at one point it's tears that overflow, not urine.* Perhaps the biggest goof of all: Everything the characters went to the wizard to receive, THEY ALREADY HAD! The Scarecrow wanted a brain, YET HE DEVISED THE PLAN TO GET INTO THE CASTLE! The Tin Man wanted a heart YET HE CRIED TEARS OF SADNESS! The lion wanted courage, YET HE'S THE ONE WHO FOUGHT THE CROCODILES! (In an alternate, never-before-seen version currently in a locked vault in Ted Turner's Montana ranch.)* Also, did anybody note that the same characters playing the tin man, scarecrow, lion, Mr. Oz, and the wicked witch, were also playing the farm hands, fortune teller and teacher? Obviously a sign of a low budget, since the meager makeup on their alternate characters wasn't enough to make their faces look much different.* Continuity flub: At one point Toto is played by a small sheep, but only for a few frames. I forget which scene this is in, but once seen it's obviously a sheep stand-in.</p>

When he came home<br /> he saw that the porch light was fixed, the refrigerator worked,<br /> and the car's tire was replaced.  He saw his wife sitting down<br /> at the kitchen table and said, ""Awww, honey, you called a<br /> repairman after I left? You are so sweet.""  The wife replied,<br /> ""Well, no.  After you left I sat on the porch steps and started<br /> crying.  A handsome young man came by the house and saw me.  He<br /> asked why I was crying and I said all these things were broken<br /> and no one would fix them.  Then he said that he would fix them<br /> for me if I would either bake him a cake or fuck him.""  Her<br /> husband asked, ""Oh, well what kind of cake did you for him bake<br /> him, honey?""  To that the wife looked at her husband and asked,<br /> ""What do I look like to you, Betty Crocker?""</p>

With a stream of crisp commands, he had the decks buzzing with men and<br /> soon, the ship had left port and was streaming out of the channel.</p>
<p>The ensign's efficiency has been remarkable. In fact, the deck was abuzz with<br /> talk that he had set a new record for getting a destroyer under way. The ensign<br /> glowed at his accomplishment and was not all surprised when another seaman<br /> approached him with a message from the captain.</p>
<p>He was, however, a bit surprised to find that it was a radio message, and he<br /> was even more surprised when he read, ""My personal congratulations upon<br /> completing your underway preparation exercise according to the book and with<br /> amazing speed.

48291,"<p>One bright, beautiful Sunday morning, everyone in the tiny town of Johnstown<br /> got up early and went to the local church. Before the service started, the<br /> townspeople were sitting in their pews and talking about their lives, their<br /> families, etc. Suddenly, Satan appeared at the front of the church. Everyone<br /> started screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in a<br /> frantic effort to get away from the evil incarnate.<br /> Soon everyone is evacuated from the church except for one elderly gentleman<br /> who sat calmly in his pew, not moving, seemingly oblivious to the fact that<br /> God's ultimate enemy is in his presence. </p>
<p>Now this confused Satan a bit, so he walked up to the man and said, ""Hey!<br /> Don't you know who I am?"" </p>
<p>The man replied, ""Yep, sure do."" </p>
<p>Satan asked, ""Aren't you afraid of me?"" </p>
<p>""Nope, sure ain't,"" said the man. </p>
<p>Satan was a little perturbed at this and queried, ""Why aren't you afraid of<br /> me?"" </p>
<p>The man calmly replied, ""I've been married to your sister for 25 years.""</p>

<p>A kilted Scotsman was walking down a country path after finishing off a considerable amount of whiskey at a local pub. As he staggered down the road, he felt quite sleepy and decided to take a nap, with his back against a tree.</p>
<p>As he slept, two young lasses walked down the road and heard the Scotsman snoring loudly. They saw him, and one said, ""I've always wondered what a  Scotsman wears under his kilt.""</p>
<p>She boldly walked over to the sleeping man, raised his kilt, and saw what nature had provided him at his birth.</p>
<p>Her friend said, ""Well, he has solved a great mystery for us, now!<br /> He must be rewarded!"" So, she took a blue ribbon from her hair, and gently tied it around what nature had provided the Scotsman, and the two walked away.</p>
<p>Some time later, the Scotsman was awakened by the call of nature, and walked around to the other side of the tree to relieve himself. He raised his kilt...and saw where the blue ribbon was tied.</p>
<p>After several moments of bewilderment, the Scotsman said...<br /> ""I don't know where y'been lad...but it's nice ta'know y'won first prize!""</p>

He's wearing his normal jeans and a T-shirt. The zoo is not very busy this morning.As they walk through the ape exhibit, they pass in front of a very large hairy gorilla. Noticing the girl, the gorilla goes ape. (No pun intended)He jumps up on the bars, and holding on with one hand (and 2 feet), he grunts and pounds his chest with his free hand. He is obviously excited at the pretty lady in the wavy dress.The husband, noticing the excitement, thinks this is funny. He suggests that his wife teases the poor fellow some more. The husband suggests she pucker her lips, wiggle her bottom at him, and play along.She does, and Mr. Gorilla gets even more excited, making noises that would wake the dead.Then the husband suggests that she let one of her straps fall to show a little more skin.She does, and Mr. Gorilla is about to tear the bars down.""Now try lifting your dress up your thighs and sort of fan it at him."" he says.... this drives the gorilla absolutely crazy and now he's doing flips.Then the husband grabs his wife by the hair, rips open the door to the cage, flings her in with the gorilla and slams the cage door shut.""Now, tell HIM you have a headache.""</p>

48344,"<p>Ah, the things that drop into my mailbox... A fellow who manages one of the Y2K compliance projects at a major US-based multinational corporation reports the following  (lightly edited to protect sources):   Apparently [a large food retail chain in Britain] with highly   automated regional distribution centers was starting to receive    canned goods with expiration dates running past 2000.  So, at the same time as they were receiving shipments of   tinned tomatoes with shelf lives until '05 (which were   being shuffled into storage bins by their automated pallet   system), their automated 'expired goods' system was scanning   the new stuff, thinking they had gone bad 92 years ago, pulling them,   and putting them on to lorries which then took them to the dump.  [...] after trashing the 'expired' tins, the automated system placed   an order to the supplier to replace them.  Apparently some guy at the warehouse noticed this but didn't want to say   anything [...]  It was only when the tomato company's sales rep said something   like, 'Jeez, you guys are selling a lot of our tinned tomatoes   lately,' that they caught on.</p>

48352,"<p>Diary of a California couple who move to the east coast to<br /> escape the earthquakes.</p>
<p>Jan. 24 - It's starting to snow. The first snow we've seen in<br /> years. The wife and I took our hot buttered rums and sat by the<br /> window watching the snow flakes drift down, clinging to the<br /> trees and covering the ground, it was beautiful.</p>
<p>Jan 25 - We awoke to a lovely blanket of crystal white snow<br /> covering the landscape. What a fantastic sight! Every tree and<br /> shrub was covered with a beautiful white mantle. I shoveled snow<br /> for the first time in years and loved it. I did both the<br /> driveway and our sidewalk. Later, the city snowplow came along<br /> and accidentally covered up our driveway and compacted the snow<br /> from the street, but the driver smiled and waved, and I waved<br /> back and shoveled it again.</p>
<p>Jan. 26 - It snowed an additional 5 inches last night and the<br /> temperature dropped to around 11 degrees.But we love it here.<br /> Several limbs on the trees and shrubs snapped due to the weight<br /> of the snow. I shoveled our driveway again. Shortly afterwards,<br /> the city snowplow came by and did his trick again. Much of the<br /> snow is now brownish gray.</p>
<p>Jan. 27 - Warmed up enough during the day to create some slush,<br /> which soon became ice when the temperature dropped again. Bought<br /> snow tires for both cars. Fell on my ass in the driveway,<br /> $145.00 for the physical therapist, but nothing broken. More<br /> snow and ice expected.</p>
<p>Jan. 28 - Still cold. Sold the wife's car and bought 4x4 in<br /> order to get her to work. Slid into a guardrail and did<br /> considerable amount of damage to the right rear quarter panel.<br /> Had another 8 inches of white shit last night. Both cars covered<br /> with salt and crud. More shoveling in store for me today. That<br /> damn snowplow came by twice today.</p>
<p>Jan. 29 - Eight degrees outside. More fucking snow. Not a tree<br /> or shrub on our property that has not been damaged. Power was<br /> off most of the night. Tried to keep from freezing to death with<br /> candles and a kerosene heater, which tipped over and nearly<br /> burned the house down. I managed to put out the flames, but<br /> suffered second degree burns on my hands and lost all my<br /> eyebrows and eyelashes. Car slid on ice on the way to the<br /> emergency room and was totaled.</p>
<p>Jan. 30 - Mother fucking shit keeps coming down! Have to put on<br /> all the clothes we have just to get to the fucking mailbox. If I<br /> ever catch the son-of-a-bitch that drives that fucking snowplow,<br /> I'll chew his chest and rip out his heart. I think he hides<br /> around the corner and waits for me to finish shoveling, then<br /> comes down the street about 100 mph and buries our driveway<br /> again! Power still off. Toilet froze and part of the roof has<br /> started to cave in.</p>
<p>Jan. 31 - Six more fucking inches of fucking snow and fucking<br /> ice and god knows what other kind of white shit fell last night.<br /> I wounded the fucking snowplow asshole with an snow shovel, but<br /> he got away. The wife left me for the 4x4 salesman, the car<br /> won't start and I think I'm going snow-blind. I can't move my<br /> toes, haven't seen the sun in 6 fucking weeks, and there's more<br /> snow predicted.</p>
<p>Wind chill: 22 fucking degrees below zero. I'm moving back to<br /> California.</p>

Thinking that it would be best to get it over with quickly, she took out Earl's old Army pistol and made the decision to shoot herself in the heart since it was so badly broken in the first place. </p>
<p>Not wanting to miss the vital organ and become a vegetable and burden to someone, she called her doctor's office to inquire as to just exactly where the heart would be. ""On a woman,"" the doctor said, ""your heart would be just below your left breast."" </p>
<p>Later that night, Mildred was admitted to the hospital with a gunshot wound to her left knee.</p>

48364,"<p>Before the inauguration, George W. was invited to a 'get acquainted' tour<br /> of the White House. After drinking several glasses of iced tea, he asked<br /> President Clinton if he could use his personal bathroom. He was astonished to<br /> see that the President had a solid gold urinal! That afternoon, George W. told<br /> his wife, Laura, about the urinal.<br />      ""Just think,"" he said, ""when I am President, I'll have my own personal<br /> gold urinal!"" Later, when Laura had lunch with Hillary at her tour of the White<br /> House, she told Hillary how impressed George had been with his discovery of the<br /> fact that, in the President's private bathroom, the President had a gold urinal.<br /> That evening, Bill and Hillary were getting ready for bed. Hillary turned to<br /> Bill and said, ""Well, I found out who peed in your saxophone.""</p>

48365,"<p>A man and his wife had been stranded on a deserted island for many years. The<br /> morning following a bad storm, a new guy (homer) washes up on the shore. Homer<br /> and the wife are very attracted to each other right away, but realize certain<br /> protocols will have to be observed. The husband, however, is very glad to see<br /> homer there.<br /> ""Now we will be able to have three people doing 8-hour shifts in the<br /> watchtower, rather than two people doing 12-hour shifts."" </p>
<p>Homer is only too happy to help and in fact volunteers to do the first shift.<br /> He climbs up the tower and stands watch, observing the ocean horizon for any<br /> ships. Soon the husband and wife start placing stones in a circle in order to<br /> make a fire to cook supper. Homer yells down: ""hey, no f******!""<br /> They couple looks at each other and yells back: ""we're not f******!"" </p>
<p>A few minutes later they start to put driftwood into the stone circle. Again<br /> homer yells down: ""hooey, no f******!""<br /> Again they yell back, ""we're not f******!"" </p>
<p>Later they are putting palm leaves on the roof to their shack to patch leaks.<br /> Once again homer yells down from high above: ""hey, I said no f******!!""<br /> ""We said we're not f******!!"" </p>
<p>Finally the shift is over, homer climbs down from the tower, and the husband<br /> starts to climb up. He�s only halfway up when the wife and homer are screwing<br /> their brains out. </p>
<p>Once at the top, the husband looks out from the tower and says: ""son-of-a-gun.<br /> From up here it does look like they're f******.""</p>

48382,"<p>In a recent contest, The Washington Post asked readers to dream up new<br /> elements for the Periodic Table. Among the best of the batch:</p>
<p>Limbaughium (Lb) - The heaviest known element. It possesses an<br /> ever-expanding mass. Very white. Acidic. Emits heat but no<br /> light. Instantly polarizes all elements that come in contact with<br /> it. Repels protons and electrons; attracts only morons.</p>
<p>Billclintium (Bc) - With a slick appearance and slimy texture, this<br /> element undergoes a series of interesting changes when in hot water.</p>
<p>Canadium (Eh) - Similar to Americium, but a little denser. Much more<br /> rigid. Often called Boron.</p>
<p>Innofensium (Pc) - Precisely equal numbers of electrons, protons,<br /> neutrons, leptons, quarks.  Completely inert, utterly useless, but<br /> smells like a rose.</p>
<p>Newtium (Nt) - Extreme irritant. Carries a strong negative<br /> charge. Does not possess magnetic properties. Can be purchased<br /> cheaply.</p>
<p>Quaylium (Vp) - Einsteinium it ain't.</p>
<p>Budweisium (Ps) - Has no taste or smell; is often indistinguishable<br /> from water.</p>
<p>Cabmium (Cb) - Found in abundance, except when needed. Exists in two<br /> states, in motion and at rest. When in motion, it cannot be stopped,<br /> no matter what you do.  Cabmium has a charge associated with it. The<br /> charge is variable, and scientists have not determined the formula<br /> for calculating it.</p>
<p>Politicium (Po) - Contains a great deal of gas. Similar to radon in<br /> that it can reach lethal concentrations in the House.</p>
<p>Congress (Cg) - Atomic number 525. Can never be found in a solution.</p>
<p>Snot (Sn) - Bonds forever with corduroy.</p>
<p>Kryptonite (S) - Kills Superman. That's it. That's all it does.</p>

"
48387,"<p>From the Geek:</p>
<p>1. When IT say they're coming right over, log out and go for<br /> coffee. It's no problem for us to remember 700 network passwords.</p>
<p>2. When you call us to have your computer moved, be sure to<br /> leave it buried under half a ton of postcards, baby pictures,<br /> stuffed animals, dried flowers, bowling trophies and children's<br /> art. We don't have a life, and we find it deeply moving to catch<br /> a fleeting glimpse of yours.</p>
<p>3. When IT send you an e-mail with high importance, delete it at<br /> once. We're probably just testing out the public groups.</p>
<p>4. When an IT professional is eating lunch at his desk, walk<br /> right in and spill your guts out and expect him to respond<br /> immediately. We exist only to serve and are always ready to<br /> think about fixing computers.</p>
<p>5. When an IT professional is at the water cooler or outside<br /> having a smoke, ask him a computer question. The only reason why<br /> we drink water or smoke at all is to ferret out all those users<br /> who don't have email or a telephone line.</p>
<p>6. Send urgent email ALL IN UPPERCASE. The mail server picks it<br /> up and flags it as a rush delivery.</p>
<p>7. When you call a helpdesk engineer's direct line rather than<br /> the helpdesk number, press 5 to skip the greeting that says he's<br /> on holiday for a week, record your message, and wait exactly 24<br /> hours before you send an email straight to the director because<br /> no one ever returned your call. You're entitled to common<br /> courtesy.</p>
<p>8. When the photocopier doesn't work, call computer support.<br /> There's electronics in it, right?</p>
<p>9. When you're getting a NO DIAL TONE message at home, call the<br /> helpdesk. We can even fix telephone problems from here.</p>
<p>10. When something's wrong with your home PC, dump it on a chair<br /> in IT. Leave no name, no phone number, and no description of the<br /> problem. We love a good mystery.</p>
<p>11. When you have a helpdesk engineer on the phone walking you<br /> through changing a setting; read the paper. We don't actually<br /> mean for you to DO anything; we just love to hear ourselves talk.</p>
<p>12. When we offer you training on the upcoming OS upgrade, don't<br /> bother. We'll be there to hold your hand after it is done.</p>
<p>13. When the printer won't print, re-send the job at least 20<br /> times. Print jobs frequently just disappear into the cosmos for<br /> no reason.</p>
<p>14. When the printer still won't print after 20 tries, send the<br /> job to all 68 printers in the office. One of them is bound to<br /> work.</p>
<p>15. Don't use online help. Online help is for wimps.</p>
<p>16. If you're taking night classes in computer science, feel<br /> free to go around and update the network drivers for yourself<br /> and your co-workers. We're grateful for the overtime when we<br /> have to stay until 2:30am fixing them.</p>
<p>17. When you have an IT bod fixing your computer at a quarter to<br /> one, eat your lunch in his face. We function better when<br /> slightly dizzy .</p>
<p>18. Don't ever thank us. We love this AND we get paid for it!</p>
<p>19. When a helpdesk engineer asks you whether you've installed<br /> any new software on this computer, lie. It's nobody's business<br /> what you've got on your computer.</p>
<p>20. If the mouse cable keeps knocking down the framed picture of<br /> your dog, lift the computer and stuff the cable under it. Mouse<br /> cables were designed to have 45 lbs. of computer sitting on top<br /> of them.</p>
<p>21. If the space bar on your keyboard doesn't work, blame it on<br /> the network/mail upgrade. Keyboards work much better with half a<br /> pound of muffin crumbs, nail clippings, and big sticky drops of<br /> Coke under the keys.</p>
<p>22. When you get the message saying ""Are you sure?"" click on<br /> that 'Yes' button as fast as you can. Hell, if you weren't sure,<br /> you wouldn't be doing it, would you?</p>
<p>23. Feel perfectly free to say things like ""I don't know nothing<br /> about that computer crap"". It never bothers us to hear our area<br /> of professional expertise referred to as crap.</p>
<p>24. When you need to change the toner cartridge, call the<br /> helpdesk. Changing a toner cartridge is an extremely complex<br /> task, and Hewlett-Packard recommends that it be performed only<br /> by a professional engineer with a master's degree in nuclear<br /> physics.</p>
<p>25. When something's the matter with your computer, ask your<br /> secretary to call the help desk. We enjoy the challenge of<br /> having to deal with a third party who doesn't know anything<br /> about the problem.</p>
<p>26. When you receive a 30-meg movie file, send it to everyone as<br /> a high-priority mail attachment. We've got plenty of disk space<br /> and processor capacity on that mail server.</p>
<p>27. Don't even think of breaking large print jobs down into<br /> smaller chunks. God forbid somebody else might get a chance to<br /> squeeze into the queue.</p>
<p>28. When you bump into an IT bod in the supermarket on a<br /> Saturday, ask a computer question. We work 24/7, even while at<br /> the supermarket on weekends.</p>
<p>29. If your son is a student in computer science, have him come<br /> in on the weekends and do his projects on your office computer.<br /> We'll be there for you when his illegal copy of Visual Basic 6.0<br /> makes your Access database flip out.</p>
<p>30. When you bring us your own no-brand home PC to repair for<br /> free at the office, tell us how urgently we need to fix it so<br /> your son can get back to playing DOOM. We'll get right on it<br /> because we have so much free time at the office.</p>

48388,"<p>A herd of buffalo can move only as fast as the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first.&nbsp;This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular culling of the weakest members.</p>
<p>In much the same way the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells.&nbsp;Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.</p>

48395,"<p>Bill's all excited about his new rifle. So, he goes bear hunting<br /> in Alaska. The first bear he sees is a little brown bear, and he<br /> kills it with his first shot. There is a tap on his shoulder,<br /> and he turns around to see a big black bear. </p>
<p>The black bear says ""You've got 2 choices. One, I maul you to<br /> death or Two, we have sex."" Bill bends over for the bear. </p>
<p>He's sore for 2 days, but he recovers and vows revenge. Bill<br /> heads out on another trip to Alaska and he finds the black bear<br /> and kills him. At that moment there is a tap on his shoulder. A<br /> huge grizzly is standing right behind him. The grizzly says,<br /> ""That was a big mistake. You've got 2 choices, Either I maul you<br /> to death or we have sex."" Bill bends over. </p>
<p>He survives, but he's really hurting and takes quite a bit of<br /> time to recover. He's outraged. Sure enough, he heads back to<br /> Alaska and finds the grizzly and shoots him at point blank<br /> range. There's a tap on his shoulder. He turns around to find an<br /> enormous polar bear, and the polar bear says, ""You don't really<br /> come here for the hunting, do you?""</p>

48396,"<p>A policeman was interrogating 3 blondes who were training to become<br /> detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first<br /> blonde a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. ""This is your suspect, how<br /> would you recognize him?"" </p>
<p>The first blonde answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast, because he only<br /> has one eye!"" </p>
<p>The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture shows his<br /> profile."" </p>
<p>Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5<br /> seconds at the second blonde and asks her,""This is your suspect, how would you<br /> recognize him?"" </p>
<p>The second blonde giggles, flips her hair and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to<br /> catch because he only has one ear!"" </p>
<p>The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two? Of course<br /> only one eye and one ear are showing,because it's a picture of his profile!! Is<br /> that the best? Answer you can come up with? </p>
<p>Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third blonde<br /> and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize<br /> him?"" He quickly adds""<br /> . . . Think hard before giving me a stupid answer."" </p>
<p>The blonde looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""Hamm . . .<br /> the suspect wears contact lenses."" </p>
<p>The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn�t know<br /> himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. ""Well, that's an interesting<br /> answer . . . wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get<br /> back to you on that."" </p>
<p>He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the<br /> Suspect file in his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.<br /> ""Wow! I can't believe it...it's TRUE! The suspect does in fact wear contact<br /> lenses. Good work!<br /> How were you able to make such an astute observation?"" </p>
<p>""That's easy,"" the blonde replied. ""He can't wear regular glasses, because he<br /> only has one eye and one ear.</p>

As he's drinking one drink and the green man is drinking the other, an Englishman down the bar who has had a few too many drinks says ""Hey, what's that little green thing down there?""  The green man runs down the bar gives the Englishman a raspberry, SPLBLBLBLT!, right in the face and runs back to the Irishman. The Englishman mops himself off and says to the Irishman, ""Hey, what is that thing, anyway?""  The Irishman replies, ""Have some respect. He's a leprechaun."" ""Oh, all right."" the Englishman says sullenly. They all go back to drinking beer. An hour or so later, the Englishman is really plastered. ""Boy, that leprechaun is ugly!"" he says. The leprechaun runs down the bar and gives the Englishman a raspberry again- SPLBLBLBLBT! This time the Englishman is really mad! ""Tell that leprechaun that if he does that again I'll cut his pecker off!"" he shouts.  ""You can't do that"" says the Irishman. ""Leprechauns don't have peckers.""

"
48406,"<p>How to Argue and Win Every Time</p>
<p>I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an<br /> argument on any topic, against any opponent. People know this and steer clear of me at parties. Often, as a sign of their great respect, they don't even invite me. You too can win arguments. Simply follow these rules:</p>
<p>*Drink liquor.</p>
<p>Suppose you are at a party and some hotshot intellectual is expounding on the economy of Peru, a subject you know nothing about. If you're drinking some health-fanatic drink like grapefruit juice, you'll hang back, afraid to display your ignorance, while the hotshot enthralls your date. But if you drink several large martinis, you'll discover you have STRONG VIEWS about the Peruvian economy. You'll be a WEALTH of information. You'll argue forcefully, offering searing insights and possibly upsetting furniture. People will be impressed. Some may leave the room.</p>
<p>*Make things up.</p>
<p>Suppose, in the Peruvian economy argument, you are trying to prove that Peruvians are underpaid, a position you base solely on the fact that YOU are underpaid, and you'll be damned if you're going to let a bunch of Peruvians be better off. DON'T say: ""I think Peruvians are underpaid."" Say instead: ""The average Peruvian's salary in 1981 dollars adjusted for the revised tax base is $1,452.81 per annum, which is $836.07 before the mean gross poverty level.""</p>
<p>NOTE: Always make up exact figures.</p>
<p>If an opponent asks you where you got your information, make THAT up too. Say: ""This information comes from Dr. Hovel T. Moon's study for the Buford Commission published on May 9, 1982. Didn't you read it?"" Say this in the same tone of voice you would use to say, ""You left your soiled underwear in my bathroom.""</p>
<p>*Use meaningless but weighty-sounding words and phrases.</p>
<p>Memorize this list:</p>
<p>Let me put it this way<br /> In terms of<br /> Vis-a-vis<br /> Per se<br /> As it were<br /> Qua<br /> So to speak</p>
<p>You should also memorize some Latin abbreviations such as ""Q.E.D."", ""e.g."", and ""i.e."" These are all short for ""I speak Latin, and you don't.""</p>
<p>Here's how to use these words and phrases. Suppose you want to say, ""Peruvians would like to order appetizers more often, but they don't have enough money.""</p>
<p>You never win arguments talking like that. But you WILL win if you say, ""Let me put it this way. In terms of appetizers vis-a-vis Peruvians qua Peruvians, they would like to order them more often, so to speak, but they do not have enough money per se, as it were. Q.E.D.""</p>
<p>Only a fool would challenge that statement.</p>
<p>*Use snappy and irrelevant comebacks.</p>
<p>You need an arsenal of all-purpose irrelevant phrases to fire back at your opponents when they make valid points. The best are:</p>
<p>You're begging the question.<br /> You're being defensive.<br /> Don't compare apples to oranges.<br /> What are your parameters?</p>
<p>This last one is especially valuable. Nobody (other than engineers and policy wonks) has the vaguest idea what ""parameters"" means.</p>
<p>Here's how to use your comebacks:</p>
<p>You say: As Abraham Lincoln said in 1873...<br /> Your opponent says: Lincoln died in 1865.<br /> You say: You're begging the question.<br /> You say: Liberians, like most Asians...<br /> Your opponent says: Liberia is in Africa.<br /> You say: You're being defensive.</p>
<p>*Compare your opponent to Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>This is your heavy artillery, for when your opponent is obviously right and you are spectacularly wrong. Bring Hitler up subtly. Say, ""That sounds suspiciously like something Adolf Hitler might say,"" or ""You certainly do remind me of Adolf Hitler.""</p>
<p>So that's it. You now know how to out-argue anybody. Do not try to pull any of this on people who generally carry weapons.</p>

48409,"<p>Last night I played a blank tape at full blast. The mime next door went nuts. If a person with multiple personalities threatens suicide, is that considered a hostage situation? Just think how much deeper the ocean would be if sponges didn't live there. I went for a walk last night and my kids asked me how long I'd be gone. I said, 'The whole time.' So what's the speed of dark? After eating, do amphibians need to wait an hour before getting OUT of the water? Why don't they just make mouse-flavored cat food? If you're sending someone some Styrofoam, what do you pack it in? I just got skylights put in my place. The people who live above me are furious.Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections? Do they have reserved parking for non-handicapped people at the Special Olympics? Is it true that cannibals don't eat clowns because they taste funny? If it's tourist season, why can't we shoot them? Isn't Disney World a people-trap operated by a mouse? Whose cruel idea was it for the word `lisp' to have an 's' in it? How come 'abbreviated' is such a long word? If it's zero degrees outside today and it's supposed to be twice as cold tomorrow, how cold is it going to be? Why do you press harder on a remote control when you know the battery is dead? Why are they called buildings when they're already finished? Shouldn't they be called builts? Why are they called apartments when they're all stuck together? Why do banks charge you a 'non-sufficient funds' fee on money they already know that you don't have? If the universe is everything, and scientists say that the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? What would a chair look like if your knees bent the other way? If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to see it, do the other trees make fun of it? Why is a carrot more orange than an orange? When two aeroplanes almost collide, why do they call it a near miss? It sounds like a near hit to me! Do fish get cramps after eating? Why are there five syllables in the word 'monosyllabic'? Why do scientists call it 'research' when they are looking for something new? If vegetarians eat vegetables, what do humanitarians eat? When I erase a word with a pencil, where does it go? Why is it that when a door is open, it's ajar, but when a jar is open, it's not a door? Tell a man that there are 400 billion stars and he'll believe you. Tell him a bench has wet paint and he has to touch it. How come Superman could stop bullets with his chest, but always ducked when someone threw a gun at him? Why is it fake lemon juice contains mostly artificial ingredients, but dishwashing liquid contains real lemons?Why do we wait until a pig is dead to 'cure' it? Why do we wash bath towels? Aren't we clean when we use them? Why do we put suits in a garment bag and put garments in a suitcase? Why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the bottle? Do Roman paramedics refer to IVs its '4s'? What do little birdies see when they get knocked unconscious? Why doesn't Tarzan have a beard? If man evolved from monkeys and apes, why do we still have monkeys and apes? Should you trust a stockbroker who's married to a travel agent? Is boneless chicken considered to be an invertebrate? Do married people live longer than single people do, or does it just SEEM longer? I went to a book store and asked the saleswoman, 'Where's the self-help section?' She said if she told me it would defeat the purpose. If all those psychics know the winning lottery numbers, why are they all still working? Isn't the best way to save face to keep the lower part shut?</p>

48418,"<p>A young man wished to purchase a gift for his new sweetheart's birthday, as they had not been dating very long. After careful consideration, he decided a pair of gloves would strike the right note... romantic, but not too personal.Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to Sears and bought a pair of white gloves.The younger sister purchased a pair of panties for herself. During the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties.Without checking the contents, he sealed the package and mailed it to his sweetheart along with this note:Darling, I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. If it had not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears short ones that are easy to remove.These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled; I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart.I wish I was there to put them on you for the first time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away, as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year. I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night.All my love, JimmieP.S. - The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing.</p>

48431,"<p>An Irishman visited a local tavern and ordered three beers.  When the  bartender served him the beers, he lined them up on the bar and began  drinking one at a time. Once he had finished the 3 beers, he ordered another  round.  The bartender offered to the man that he would be glad to draw the  beers for him individually so that they would remain cold and fresh.The Irishman replied that he had spent many years drinking beers with his two  brothers and he cherished those memories.  One of his brothers had been  transferred to the Far East and the other to London.  By pretending that his  brothers were still drinking with him, he was able to reminisce and enjoy  himself.  The bartender accepted this explanation and, each time the Irishman  came to the bar, he continued to serve him the beers in this fashion.One day the Irishman came in and ordered only two beers.  The bartender was  concerned and offered his condolences, thinking that, perhaps one of the  brothers had passed away.  ""Oh, no',"" replied the Irishman, ""...they're doing  just fine...it's just that I gave up drinking for lent.""</p>

48435,"<p>A man lost two buttons from his shirt and put them in his pants pocket. But<br /> the pocket had a hole, so the buttons fell into his shoe.<br /> Unfortunately, the shoe sole also had a hole, so he lost the buttons. Since<br /> pockets with holes, holes without buttons, and shoe soles with holes are<br /> useless, the man ripped the buttonholes out of his shirt and the pocket from his<br /> pants and tossed them in the trash along with the soles of his shoes. After<br /> looking in a mirror at the holes in his clothing, he decided to toss his clothes<br /> in the trash as well.<br /> A policeman observed all this and asked the man for identification. The man<br /> produced a document that he was an ordained minister of the gospel. So, of<br /> course, the policeman promptly escorted him to a mental institution.<br /> The minister protested violently, asking why he was receiving such unjust<br /> treatment.<br /> ""Look, it's the best place for you now,"" the policeman replied, ""Anyone<br /> claiming to be a preacher, but who doesn't save souls or wear holy clothes has<br /> probably lost his buttons.""</p>

The Lord says to the cat ""you lived a<br /> good life and if there is any way I can make your stay in heaven<br /> more comfortable, please let me know."" The cat thinks for a<br /> moment and says ""Lord, all my life I have lived with a poor<br /> family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor."" The Lord stops<br /> the cat and says, ""say no more."" And a wonderful fluffy pillow<br /> appears.</p>
<p>A few days later 6 mice are killed in a tragic farming accident<br /> and go to heaven. Again there is the Lord there to greet them<br /> with the same offer. The mice answer, ""All of our lives we have<br /> been chased. We have had to run from cats, dogs and even women<br /> with brooms. Running, running, running; we're tired of running.<br /> Do you think we could have roller skates so we don't have to run<br /> anymore?"" The Lord says, ""Say no more."" and fits each mouse with<br /> beautiful new roller skates.</p>
<p>About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds<br /> him snoozing on the pillow. The Lord gently wakes the cat and<br /> asks him, ""How are things since you are here?"" The cat stretches<br /> and yawns and replies, ""It is wonderful here. Better than I<br /> could have ever expected. And those 'Meals On Wheels' you've<br /> been sending by are theeeeeeeee best!!!""</p>

48440,"<p>How NOT to behave in your Doctor's Office                  -----------------------------------------OK, We all go the doctor for our aches, pains worries and some of us just to have someone to listen to our problems. Guess What, doctors are human too, so here are is a guide of what to do and not to do    Code of Ethical Patient Behavior   (The Patient's 'HYPOCRATIC' Code')1. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR DOCTOR TO SHARE YOUR DISCOMFORT    They've already heard it before. Just sit back and take the pain2. BE CHEERFUL AT ALL TIMES    If you make your doctors unhappy, they might just make a slip    with the needle as they are inserting it into your butt.3. TRY TO SUFFER FROM THE DISEASE FOR WHICH YOU ARE BEING TREATED    Remember that your doctor has a professional reputation to uphold.    It wouldn't look to good if you are smiling when the medical books    indicate you should be wincing4. IT'S STILL SEXUAL HARRASSMENT    Even if you're babes, your sustained and repeated come-ons to     pay in 'trade' are still harrassment.5. NEVER ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS DOING OR WHY HE IS DOING    Hey, 4 years of medical school, 4 - 7 years in residency and another    one or two in fellowships have already made it impossible for your     doctorto speak normal English anyway.6. SUBMIT TO NOVEL EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT READILY    Though the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting     research paper will surely be of widespread interest, and you     might even become famous in a medical textbook, or if you really     complain enough, have a procedure named after you.7. PAY YOUR MEDICAL BILLS PROMPTLY AND WILLINGLY    See #2, Keep you doctor happy..8. NEVER DIE WHILE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S PRESENCE OR UNDER HIS DIRECT CARE    Really bad form9. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR SMELLING LIKE THAT... YES WE DO SMELL YOU...     TAKE A BATH    Your treatment room can't be used for others for the rest of    the day and you almost killed the doctor.10. FARTING IS NOT 'NATURAL AND ORDINARY' JUST CAUSE YOU'RE WITH A DOCTOR     You may likely be told you need a referral to a 'specialist' .       11. IT TURNS OUT THE NURSES DO NOT WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU     It's a shame but true...</p>

48474,"<p>Cross my heart this happened to someone. This guy lives in Westchester, NY and goes to school at Ithaca College. For two years, he has wanted to ask a certain girl (who is also from Westchester and also goes to Ithaca) out on a date, but has never had the courage.<br /> Finally, one day over the summer, he sees her at home and musters up the courage to ask her out. She accepts, and they make dinner plans for Saturday night. </p>
<p>Friday night, this guy goes out with all of his buddies, and drinks like Prohibition is coming back. </p>
<p>Saturday, he is in such bad shape that he can't make it through twenty minutes without either throwing up or using the bathroom. After several hours of this, he is able to stop throwing up, but he is still running to the toilet every 20 minutes. He doesn't want to cancel the date, because he's afraid he won't ever talk to her again. </p>
<p>So they meet in Westchester, and take the train to New York City (about a 30 minute ride). They get to the restaurant, and he excuses himself during the appetizers to use the bathroom. They enjoy the rest of the appetizers without interruption, but he has to go back again during the entrees. </p>
<p>They decide to get dessert. During dessert, our hero feels another rumbling, but doesn't want to look like a complete bathroom freak, so he holds it. After a few minutes, the rumbling subsides, but he still has a bit of gas stored up. </p>
<p>He decides to let this little bit of gas fly right there at the table (discreetly, of course). Unfortunately, this little bit of gas came with another little surprise. ""Oh crap,"" he thinks (and feels). Instead of running to the bathroom right away, our hero immediately leans on the arms of his chair to keep from sitting on this surprise. He maintains this yoga position for the rest of dessert, trying to figure out what to do before his tan pants (a) start to smell, or (b) start to show stains on the outside. He quickly pays for dinner and they leave the restaurant. Oh, by the way, he is walking like a cowboy. </p>
<p>On the way to the train station, they pass the Gap. </p>
<p>Do you mind if I run in and buy a sweater that I was looking at last week?"" he asks. </p>
<p>""No problem, I'd like to look around too,"" she replies. They go into the Gap. Fortunately, at the Gap, men's fashions are on the right, women's fashions are on the left. They split up. </p>
<p>Our hero grabs the first sweater within reach, and hurries back to the khakis. After selecting a pair that most closely resemble his current outfit, he brings both items to the register. His eyes are on his date (still on the other side of the store) to make sure that she doesn't see him buying the pants. He doesn't even want the sweater, so he says through clenched teeth (just in case his date can read lips from 40 feet away) ""Just the pants."" ""What?"" asks the Gap girl. </p>
<p>""Just the pants!"" (Eyes still trained on his date.) Gap girl: ""Oh, OK."" </p>
<p>He pays for the pants and walks over to his date; then they leave the store. They board the train just before it leaves the station and find two seats in the middle of the car. Without sitting down, our hero excuses himself and walks to the bathroom in the back of the car. He gets to the bathroom as the train departs, and quickly rips off his pants and boxer shorts. He rolls them into a ball and throws them out the window. After cleaning himself off, he opens the Gap bag and pulls out...just the sweater.</p>

48498,"<p>NEW ELEMENT DISCOVEREDThe heaviest element known to science was discovered recently by physicists at the Worldwide Research Lab in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The element, tentatively named Administratium, has no protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it does have 1 neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called morons.Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert. However, it can be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of Administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete, when it would normally occur in less than one second.Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately 3 years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead, undergoes a reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons change places. Some studies have shown that the atomic weight actually increases after each reorganization.Research at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as government agencies, large corporations, universities, and most organizations who employ more than 10 people. It can actually be found in the newest, best maintained buildings.Scientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any positive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.</p>

48508,"<p>THIS JOKE DIRECT FROM BAGHDAD before the Gulf War             - Submitted by one of the world's top experts on Iraq now temporarily in Washington, D. C --------------------------------------------------------An unemployed Iraqi was hanging out on Abu Nawas street in Baghdad recovering from a hangover and started to become very hungry. He looked around and saw no food in the street so he decided he would have to ask for a handout.He passed a liquor store and knew that the owner was a religious Christian, so he searched around for a few hours and finally found a picture of Jesus on the cross to try to ingratiate himself to the man.So the guy walked into the store and said 'My friend, I am a poor homeless man and am very hungry. In the memory of Jesus - and here he took out the picture of Jesus on the Cross - would you please be so kind and help me?'The shop owner responded. 'My poor friend, The lord has been good to me so here is a dinar (about $3 at the time) I hope this will help you get a warm meal.'Rather than buying food, the man passed a local bar and walked in to find a drink.  Over time, his dinar evaporated into alcohol and he found himself in a drunken stupor on the bank of the Tigris River, just off Abu Nawas Street. He woke up 2 days later, now even hungrier than before, and realized how stupid he had been. He decided that he would go back to the kind liquor store owner.Unfortunately, he lost his picture of Jesus and spent several hours looking around for it. To no avail, he just could not find it. The only thing he could find was a recent photo of Saddam Hussein on the wall. So he picked it up and walked back to the store.The store owner greeted him and the man said, 'My friend, you were so kind before. Now I ask you again if you can help me in the name of our glorious leader, The 'Historical Necessity', 'the Defender of our country, May The Lord protect and defend him '(and he pulls out the photo) of 'Saddam Hussein.'The merchant hands him over a 'Dirham' (approximately 5 Cents at the time) The guy was confused and asked, 'How come when I came here 2 days ago, and I showed you a picture of Jesus on the cross, you were very gracious and gave me a dinar ($3), and now when I show you a photo of our glorious leader Saddam Hussein, May The Lord protet and defend hime, you only give me a DIRHAM ($.05)?So the merchant responds, 'If you bring me Saddam Hussein like this - spreading his arms wide to emulate the cross - I would give you a dinar as well.'</p>

The cop likes this idea, so the first thing he thinks of he tells the man.""How about Susie,"" the cop suggests.""Susie, I like it. Come back tomorrow for you're drink,"" said the man.The cop returns to the ghetto the next day. The guy is sitting on the curb again.""What about Susie?""the cop asked.""The man answered,"" I thought about it and I decided I didn't like it.I'll give you two drinks if you come up with a better name"" The cop thought for a moment and said"" Susie's Legs"" The man agreed and told the cop to come back tomorrow for his free drinks.The next day the cop returns, and sure enough the bar is there, but it doesn't open for another 10 minutes. He waits in his car. A young teen asks the cop what he was doing just sitting in his car. the cop replies,"" I'm waiting for Susie's Legs to open so I can get my free drinks.""</p>

We will be glad to allow you to work  through your  lunch hour and subsequently leave one hour early, provided  your share  of the work is done enough.    YOUR OWN DEATH:  This will be accepted as an excuse. However, we require at  least two  weeks notice as it is your duty to train your own  replacement.    RESTROOM USE:  Entirely too much time is being spent in the restroom. In  the  future, we will follow the practice of going in alphabetical  order.  For instance, all employees whose names begin with 'A' will  go from  8:00 to 8:10, employees whose names begin with 'B' will go  from 8:10  to 8:20 and so on. If you're unable to go at your allotted  time, it  will be necessary to wait until the next day when your turn  comes  again. In extreme emergencies employees may swap their time  with a  coworker. Both employees' supervisors in writing must  approve this  exchange. In addition, there is now a strict 3-minute time  limit  in the stalls.

She appeared well-to-do, chic, and very intelligent.Thinking to make an impression, Mr. Playboy showed her some etchings, first editions, etc. He then offered her some wine, asking whether she preferred sherry or port.""Oh, sherry by all means!"" she replied.""Sherry is like the nectar of the gods. Just looking at it in this crystal-like decanter fills me with the anticipation of a heavenly thrill. When the stopper is removed and the beautiful liquid is poured into the glass and I inhale the delicious tangy aroma, I'm lifted on the wings of ecstasy. As I taste the magic potion, my whole being thrills and glows, it seems like a thousand violins throb in my ears, and I'm carried into another world.""""Port, on the other hand, makes me fart.""</p>

<p>Superman decided to fly over to Wonder Woman's house and see what was going on over there. He landed on her balcony, looked in the bedroom window and saw her lying on her back on the bed.

<p>To: Premier Dung</p>
<p>From: President Bush</p>
<p>The United States is truly sorry that your nation is not capable of training your pilots to fly without striking other aircraft. We are also sorry that you people lack the honor to respect the international laws governing collision avoidance between aircraft when flying in international airspace. </p>
<p>We further regret that you cannot be trusted to respect the integrity of sovereign aircraft forced to land on your soil after your inept pilot forced a collision. We truly regret the state of incompetence demonstrated by the People's Dictatorship of China.</p>
<p>That being said, you are holding our servicemen hostage, illegally. You are holding our aircraft, illegally. I am sorry to inform you that all your Ambassadors, aides, businessmen, and students currently residing in the United States will have their visas revoked at midnight tonight. </p>
<p>I am also sorry to inform you that all Chinese assets in the United States are frozen. I am sorry to inform Beanie Baby collectors that all imports from the PDC will be halted. All foreign aid monies to the PDC and all IMF etc., funds are cancelled.</p>
<p>I am not sorry to announce, however, that sales of advanced technology military equipment to the Republic of Taiwan will be accelerated. Nor am I sorry to announce that two additional carrier battle groups will be assigned to patrol the waters off the coasts of the PDC. I'm sure I can think of more things to do if I don't have my airmen and airplane returned by midnight, tonight.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>

"
48665,"<p>Fun things to do in a final that does not matter (i.e. you are going to fail the class completely no matter what you get on the final exam) </p>
<p>1. Bring a pillow. Fall asleep (or pretend to) until the last 15 minutes. Wake up, say ""oh geez, better get cracking"" and do some gibberish work. Turn it in a few minutes early. </p>
<p>2. Get a copy of the exam, run out screaming ""Andre, Andre, I've got the secret documents!!"" </p>
<p>3. If it is a math/science exam, answer in essay form. If it is long answer/essay form, answer with numbers and symbols. Be creative. Use the integral symbol. </p>
<p>4. Make paper airplanes out of the exam. Aim them at the instructor's left nostril. </p>
<p>5. Talk the entire way through the exam. Read questions aloud, debate your answers with yourself out loud. If asked to stop, yell out, ""I'm SOOO sure you can hear me thinking."" Then start talking about what a jerk the instructor is. </p>
<p>6. Bring cheerleaders. </p>
<p>7. Walk in, get the exam, sit down. About five minutes into it, loudly say to the instructor, ""I don't understand ANY of this. I've been to every lecture all semester long! What's the deal? And who the hell are you? Where's the regular guy?"" </p>
<p>8. Bring a Game Boy (or Game Gear, etc...). Play with the volume at max level. </p>
<p>9. On the answer sheet (book, whatever) find a new, interesting way to refuse to answer every question. For example: I refuse to answer this question on the grounds that it conflicts with my religious beliefs. Be creative. </p>
<p>10. Bring pets. </p>
<p>11. Run into the exam room looking about frantically. Breathe a sigh of relief. Go to the instructor, say ""They've found me, I have to leave the country"" and run off. </p>
<p>12. Fifteen minutes into the exam, stand up, rip up all the papers into very small pieces, throw them into the air and yell out ""Merry Christmas."" If you're really daring, ask for another copy of the exam. Say you lost the first one. Repeat this process every fifteen minutes. </p>
<p>13. Do the exam with crayons, paint, or fluorescent markers. </p>
<p>14. Come into the exam wearing slippers, a bathrobe, a towel on your head, and nothing else. </p>
<p>15. Come down with a BAD case of Turet's Syndrome during the exam. Be as vulgar as possible. </p>
<p>16. Do the entire exam in another language. If you don't know one, make one up! For math/science exams, try using Roman numerals. </p>
<p>17. Bring things to throw at the instructor when s/he's not looking. Blame it on the person nearest to you. </p>
<p>18. As soon as the instructor hands you the exam, eat it. </p>
<p>19. Walk into the exam with an entourage. Claim you are going to be taping your next video during the exam. Try to get the instructor to let them stay, be persuasive. Tell the instructor to expect a percentage of the profits if they are allowed to stay. </p>
<p>20. Every five minutes, stand up, collect all your things, move to another seat, continue with the exam. </p>
<p>21. Turn in the exam approximately 30 minutes into it. As you walk out, start commenting on how easy it was. </p>
<p>22. Do the entire exam as if it was multiple choice and true/false. If it is a multiple choice exam, spell out interesting things (DCCAB. BABE. etc..). </p>
<p>23. Bring a black marker. Return the exam with all questions and answers completely blacked out. </p>
<p>24. Get the exam. Twenty minutes into it, throw your papers down violently, scream out ""Fuck this!"" and walk out triumphantly. </p>
<p>25. Arrange a protest before the exam starts (i.e. Threaten the instructor that whether or not everyone's done, they are all leaving after one hour to go drink) </p>
<p>26. Show up completely drunk. (Completely drunk means at some point during the exam, you should start crying for mommy). </p>
<p>27. Every now and then, clap twice rapidly. If the instructor asks why, tell him/her in a very derogatory tone, ""the light bulb that goes on above my head when I get an idea is hooked up to a clapper. DUH!"" </p>

48675,"<p>A young blonde female stock broker was bored with her BMW.  It lacked individuality and besides, every other broker in the office had one.  She fancied something a bit more individual, perhaps an MG convertible. She visited a local car dealer and saw a beautiful Jaguar XK140 convertible.  It was wonderfully restored and she fell in love with it's gorgeous lines and red paint.  An empty cheque stub later and off she was, tearing down the leafy country lanes enjoying her beautiful new car.  Her long blonde hair was flowing in the wind, music blaring from the stereo, what could possibly be better?  What could possibly go wrong?As that thought crossed her mind, there was a splutter from the engine and the car slowly coasted to a stop.  She got out and lifted the bonnet and concluded that she didn't have a bloody clue as to what was wrong. She grabbed her pocket phone and called the AutoClub. A short while later a bright shiny yellow tow truck pulled up behind her. 'That's a lovely car,' says the mechanic.  'What seems to be the matter?' Well, it just conked out I'm afraid.''Let me have look.'  He set to work and ten minutes later the engine was purring like a cat again. 'Thank goodness,' she said. 'What was the matter ?''Simple really, just crap in the carburetor,' he replied.Looking shocked she asked, 'Oh, OK. How many times a week do I have to do that?'</p>

With still 200 miles to go and the coffee<br /> running out, he needed something to keep him awake.

<p>He picked up the hitchhiker, drove down the road for about 15<br /> minutes when the hitchhiker pull out a gun and said ""stop the<br /> truck"". The truck driver got out with the hitchhiker and was<br /> then informed that they were going for a walk. They walked about<br /> 1 mile into the woods when the hitchhiker ordered the truck<br /> driver to take off all of his clothes. Once undressed, the truck<br /> driver was hog-tied and the hitchhiker grabbed his clothes, ran<br /> back to the truck and took off.</p>
<p>The poor truck driver was laying there, buck naked and hog-tied,<br /> when he began to slither back out to the highway.

48701,"<p>One morning the Pope awoke in his bed chamber in the Vatican. To his surprise,<br /> he noticed that he had woken up with a massive erection. Perplexed, he called on<br /> his personal physician.<br /> ""Doctor, this should not be possible,"" he said, ""I'm the Pope, and I'm<br /> celibate! I haven't had one of these for 30 years!"" </p>
<p>The doctor's reply was, ""Well, father, this is a natural phenomenon for all<br /> men, and it will happen even to you from time to time"". </p>
<p>The Pope exclaimed ""But you must do something about this! I have mass in an<br /> hour, and this thing isn't going away!"" </p>
<p>The doctor replied ""You have two options ... either I can administer an<br /> injection to your penis to make the problem go away, which will hurt and make<br /> you feel ill, or you can just quietly go into the toilet over there and relieve<br /> yourself."" </p>
<p>Fearing the injection, the Pope elects the second option. Unbeknown to him, a<br /> paparazzi photographer has sneaked into the Vatican, and just as the Pope<br /> reaches that point of no return, up pops the photographer and begins snapping<br /> away. The Pope immediately summons his security guards, who arrest the<br /> photographer, and begin to beat him up. </p>
<p>The paparazzo shouts out, ""Hey, I thought you were a Christian organization!<br /> What has happened to your forgiveness?"" </p>
<p>Upon refection, the pope agrees with the photographer, and relents, saying<br /> ""Yes, my son, you are right, we shall release you. Unfortunately, we cannot<br /> return your camera, as we cannot allow the scandal of what is contained on the<br /> film to be seen in the outside world."" </p>
<p>Never slow to take an opportunity, the photographer replies, ""But this is how<br /> I make my living! If you take my camera, I'll lose the money I could have sold<br /> the photographs for!"" </p>
<p>The Pope, feeling guilty, agrees. ""Very well, we will compensate you. How<br /> about $100,000?"" </p>
<p>Ecstatic, the man agrees, and is soon on his way. The Pope meanwhile attends<br /> confession, and the whole story comes out. For his penance, he is therefore<br /> ordered to walk three times around St. Peter's, with the offending camera around<br /> his neck. Out on his walk, he meets a Japanese tourist: </p>
<p>""Ah, so, very nice Japanese camera you got there, Mr. Pope,"" says the man,<br /> ""how much you pay for it?"" </p>
<p>""Being the Pope, I cannot tell a lie,"" he replies, ""I must confess that I paid<br /> $100,000 for it."" </p>
<p>""Ah,"" says the Japanese gentleman, ""look like someone saw you coming!""</p>

48708,"<p>Noted Dough Boy Dies</p>
<p>Veteran Pillsbury spokesman Pop N. Fresh died Wednesday of a severe<br /> yeast infection  He was 71.  He was buried Friday in one of the biggest<br /> funerals in years.  Dozens of celebrities turned out including Mrs.<br /> Butterworth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty Crocker, and the<br /> Hostess Twinkies   The graveside was piled high with flours, as longtime<br /> friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who<br /> ""never knew he was kneaded"".</p>
<p>Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with<br /> turnovers.  He was not considered a smart cookie, and wasted much of<br /> his dough on half-baked schemes.  Still, even as a crusty old man, he<br /> was a roll model to millions.  Fresh is survived by his second wife.<br /> They had two children, and...<br /> one in the oven.</p>

48710,"<p>Russian Vodka</p>
<p> A Russian is strolling down the street in Moscow and kicks a bottle<br />  laying in  the street. Suddenly out of the bottle comes a genie.<br />  The Russian is stunned and the Genie says, ""Hello Master, I will grant<br />  you one wish, anything that you want.""</p>
<p> The Russian begins thinking, ""Well I really like drinking vodka.""<br />  Finally the Russian says, ""I wish to drink vodka whenever I want, so make me piss<br />  vodka.""</p>
<p> The Genie grants him his wish. When the Russian gets home he gets a<br />  glass out of the cupboard and pisses into it. He looks at the glass and it's<br />  clear. Looks like vodka. Then he smells the liquid. Smells like vodka. So<br /> he takes a taste and it is the best vodka that he has ever tasted.</p>
<p> The Russian yells to his wife, ""Natasha, Natasha, come quickly."" She<br />  comes running down the hall and the Russian takes another glass out of the cupboard<br />  and pisses into it. He tells her to drink, that it is vodka. Natasha is reluctant but goes ahead and takes a sip. It is the best vodka that<br /> she has ever tasted. The two drink and party all night.</p>
<p> The next night the Russian comes home from work and tells his wife to<br />  get two glasses out of the cupboard. He proceeds to piss in the two glasses.<br />  The result is the same, the vodka is excellent and the couple drink until<br /> the sun comes up.</p>
<p>Finally, Friday night comes and the Russian tells his wife to grab one<br /> glass from the cupboard and we will drink vodka. She gets the glass but asks him<br /> ""Boris, why do we only need one glass?""</p>
<p>Boris raises the glass and says, ""Because tonight my love, you drink from the bottle.""</p>

""Welcome your holiness, your dedication and<br /> unselfishness in serving your fellow man during your life has earned you<br /> great stature in heaven.

<p>""You are also granted an open door policy and may at your own discretion<br /> meet with any heavenly leader, including the Father without prior<br /> appointment.""</p>
<p>""Is there anything which your holiness desires?""</p>
<p>""Well, yes,"" the Pope replied. ""I have often pondered some of the<br /> mysteries which have puzzled and confounded theologians through the ages.<br /> Are there perhaps any transcripts which recorded the actual conversations<br /> between God and the prophets of old? I would love to see what was actually<br /> said, with-out the dimming of memories over time.""</p>
<p>Saint Peter immediately ushered the Pope to the heavenly library and<br /> explained how to retrieve the various documents. The Pope was thrilled and<br /> settled down to review the history of man's relationship with God.</p>
<p>Two years later a scream of anguish pierced the stacks of the library.<br /> Immediately several of the Saints and Angels came running. There they<br /> found the Pope pointing to a single word on a parchment, repeating over<br /> and over, ""There's an 'R', there's an 'R'--it's celibRate, not celibate!""</p>

48733,"<p>1.  Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control are not natural. </p>
<p>2.  Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people cannot get legally married because the world needs more children. </p>
<p>3.  Obviously gay parents will raise gay children because straight parents only raise straight children. </p>
<p>4.  Straight marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears's 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful. </p>
<p>5.  Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and it hasn't changed at all: women are property, Blacks can't marry Whites, and divorce is illegal. </p>
<p>6.  Gay marriage should be decided by the people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of minorities. </p>
<p>7.  Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are always imposed on the entire country. That's why we only have one religion in America. </p>
<p>8.  Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people makes you tall. </p>
<p>9.  Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage license. </p>
<p>10.  Children can never succeed without both male and female role models at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children. </p>
<p>11.  Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to cars or longer lifespans. </p>
<p>12.  Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a ""separate but equal"" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages will for gays &amp; lesbians.</p>

<p>My opinions are my wife's, and she says I'm damn lucky to have them.</p>
<p>My other wife is beautiful.</p>
<p>My wife and I have a perfect understanding; I don't try to run her life and I don't try to run mine.</p>
<p>My wife doesn't care what I do away from home, as long as I don't enjoy it.</p>
<p>My wife has a split personality, and I hate both of them.</p>
<p>My wife ran off with my best friend last week. Gawd, I miss him!</p>
<p>My wife says if I go fishing one more time she's going to leave me.  Gosh, I'm going to miss her.</p>
<p>My wife submits and I obey; she always lets me have her way.</p>
<p>Not all men are fools. Some are bachelors.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the only place a single woman can find the best man is at a wedding.</p>
<p>One of the safest ways to assure a happy marriage is to be sure that the wife is a treasure and the husband a treasury.</p>
<p>Please remember that Brandy makes you Randy, Whiskey makes you Frisky, but it's a good stiff Johnny Walker that makes you Pregnant.</p>
<p>Remember, is it as easy to marry a rich woman as a poor woman.</p>

<p>Single people die earlier. Marriage is healthier. If you're looking for a long life and a slow death, get married.</p>
<p>Some women marry men thinking they'd be real comforters, only to discover they were merely wet blankets.</p>
<p>Sorry I can't make your wedding, I'm half full under the table.</p>
<p>Sorry I cannot be at wedding...please send me a photo of the bride and groom mounted.</p>
<p>Suicide is belated acquiescence in the opinion of one's wife's relatives.</p>
<p>Take an interest in your husband's activities: hire a detective.</p>
<p>Take heed from those who know Tie you nightie to your toes Close your eyes, hold your nose Then see how it goes...</p>
<p>The average person's life consists of 20 years of their mother asking them where they're going, 40 years of having their spouse ask the same question, and in the end, all the mourners wonder, too.</p>
<p>The bonds of matrimony are a good investment only when the interest is high and sustained.</p>
<p>The cooing stops with the honeymoon; the billing goes on forever.</p>
<p>The days just before marriage are like a snappy introduction to a tedious book.</p>
<p>The difference between marriage and death?  Dead people are free.</p>

<p>Santa, in his angry state, ignored it. There was another knock. Santa was in no mood for all of this. When the knock came again, Santa --filled with rage-- threw open the door.</p>
<p>Standing there was a little angel who said, ""Hi Santa!<br /> What do you want me to do with this Christmas Tree?""<br /> Hence...the story of the Angel atop the tree.</p>

48756,"<p>There once was a little bread shop not too far from a school. An<br /> extremely voluptuous, beautiful, long-legged blonde girl, who<br /> always wore very short skirts, worked behind the counter. One<br /> day after school, a boy stopped in at the little bread shop to<br /> get some raisin bread for his mother. The raisin bread was kept<br /> on the top shelf behind the counter, so the blonde girl had to<br /> climb a ladder to get at it. When the young boy looked up, he<br /> was thrilled and amazed at the sight of the blonde girl in her<br /> short skirt.</p>

I have bad news and good news.""<br /> The man, taken back, asks hesitantly, ""What's the bad news?""<br /> ""The bad news is your wife has lost all use of both arms and both legs. She<br /> will likely be on a respirator for the rest of her life.""<br /> ""Heavens, Doc, what's the good news?""<br /> The doctor replies, ""I'm kidding. She's dead.""<br /> One day, Paul complained to his friend, ""You know, my elbow is killing me. I<br /> guess I should see a doctor.""<br /> ""Don't do that!"" said his friend. ""There's a computer at the drug store that<br /> can diagnose anything, quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply feed the<br /> computer a sample of your urine and it will diagnose your problem for only<br /> bucks.""<br /> Paul figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample<br /> and walked to the drug store. Then, he poured the urine sample into the computer<br /> and deposited bucks. The computer started making some noise and a number of<br /> lights started flashing. After a brief moment, out popped a small slip of paper<br /> which read:<br /> 'You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy labor. It<br /> will be better in two weeks.'<br /> That evening, while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it<br /> would change medical science forever, Paul began to wonder if the computer could<br /> be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a<br /> stool sample from his pet dog, and urine samples from both his wife and<br /> daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the mix.<br /> The next day, Paul returned to drug store and poured the sample into the<br /> computer. Next, he deposited bucks. The computer started making some noise and a<br /> number of lights started flashing. After a brief moment, out popped a small slip<br /> of paper which read:<br /> 'Your tap water is too hard... getting a water softener. Your dog has<br /> ringworm... bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. Your daughter is using<br /> cocaine... put her in a rehab clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls and<br /> they aren't yours... get a lawyer. And, if you don't stop jerking off, your<br /> tennis elbow will never get better.'</p>

48783,"<p>Dear Santa: We're worried about you.</p>
<p>From your rosy red cheeks to your legendary girth to your all-night sleigh ride around the world, you may be at risk for diseases, maladies, mishaps and lawsuits that send chills through our Santa-loving hearts. The latest warning comes from the National Rosacea Society in Barrington, Ill.</p>
<p>Dermatologist Dr. Jerome Litt says you have ""a clear-cut case of rosacea,"" a skin condition that also affects millions of Americans, particularly at middle age. Unable to examine you personally, the good doctor based his finding on a well-circulated report that your ""cheeks were like roses, (your) nose like a cherry.""</p>
<p>Sadly, many observers conclude that red-skin condition comes from hitting the Christmas-punch bowl a little too hard. Sadder still, rosacea can be aggravated by holiday stress, hot chocolate and overexertion -- all things you may encounter this time of year. The one bright note in Litt's message is that certain antibiotics can help, and he advises you to see a North Pole dermatologist. But the news about you facial tint is only our latest source of concern.</p>
<p>A careful examination of what we know about you and your lifestyle raises a host of other trouble signs:</p>
<p>OBESITY: Frankly, Santa, this may be your biggest area of concern. Studies show overweight men have more than double the normal risk of heart attacks and increased chances of many other diseases. We've seen the pictures; we've noticed you in the malls. And we've heard that your tummy shakes ""like a bowlful of jelly"" when you chuckle. On this, we'll take part of the blame. All these years, we've set out milk and cookies on Christmas Eve. With 102 million homes in the U.S. alone, even if 1 in 100 homes put out two cookies and a cup of milk, that would make and overnight snack of 2 million cookies and 63,750 gallons of milk. Maybe it's time for Mrs. Claus to get you a NordicTrack or a Thighmaster. But be sure to have the old ticker checked out before you start an exercise regimen.</p>
<p>PIPE SMOKING: You've been pictured with a pipe, and even though an apologist in The New York Times once claimed it's only a prop, a witness who encountered you in his home said ""the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath."" According to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, pipe and cigar smokers have twice a nonsmoker's risk for lung cancer, four times the risk for larynx cancer and two to three times the risk for cancers of the mouth and esophagus. Even if the pipe's just a prop, it might be a good idea to lose it. Remember, you're not just a saint, you're a role model.</p>
<p>STRESS: Dealing with Christmas wishes from millions of kiddies could certainly put one on the emotionsl hot seat. And anxiety can surpass even smoking as a risk for certain heart problems. On this point, though, we have some good news: A medical news service says laughter -- as evidenced by your trademark ""Ho, ho, ho"" -- is one of the best stress-busters.</p>
<p>SOOT: We admire your ability to slip up and down the average chimney, an opening about 12 inches by 16 inches. But creosote flakes on the chimney walls are toxic and can lead to respiratory problems. Brent Rigby of Emerald City Chimney Sweeps in Kirkland said his people never actually go into a chimney, and wear protective masks when they reach up through the fireplace to vacuum the soot.</p>
<p>RSI (REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY): Cards and letters by the bagful arrive on your doorstep through regular mail, but this year we've noticed you're also receiving -- and answering -- e-mail on at least four Internet addresses, including one based in Seattle, santa@cyberspace.com.</p>
<p>We applaud your move onto the information superhighway, with this caution: too much keyboard work can result in painful injuries to the hands, wrists and arms.</p>
<p>DEER MITES: Close, continuous contact with your trusty reindeer means if they get mites, so might you, says Dr. David DuClos, a veterinary dermatologist in Lynnwood. Watch out for itchy rashes, and keep the deer out of your bed.</p>
<p>FROSTBITE, HYPOTHERMI<br /> A: You usually bundle up, and that's good. A Weather Service satelilite recently showed the temperature at the North Pole was 13 below zero, and high winds are common. Exposure to such conditions can cause frostbite in minutes.</p>
<p>MALL THUGS: You spend a lot of time in shopping malls, so you already know things are getting a little tough out there. Try not to walk back to your sleigh at night alone.</p>
<p>MEMORY TROUBLE: It's been said that you make a list, then check it twice. Just being careful, or developing a little memory problem?</p>
<p>SAD (SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER): This time of year, there is virtually no daylight at the North Pole, and a lack of sunlight can trigger depression in some people. Maybe a full-spectrum light would help keep you jolly.</p>
<p>VIRAL INFECTIONS: A young witness saw you kissing Mommy underneath the mistletoe last night. You know this is colds and flu season, don't you?</p>
<p>SLEIGH ACCIDENTS: We've seen plenty of pictures of you in that sleigh, but never with a seat belt, and we'd sure hate to see you get hurt. By the way, when you cruise through Seattle this year, be sure to cover the load.</p>
<p>JET LAG: Fatigue, dizziness and insomnia are all dangers that travelers face when they cross through several times zones. And few travelers cross all 24 of them in a night, like you do.</p>
<p>SKYJACKERS: OK, you've been lucky so far, but they're out there.</p>
<p>Knowing all the dangers you face makes us feel that much more fortunate that you're still faithfully delivering the goodies to good boys and girls every Christmas.</p>
<p>But you might want to try to reduce some of those risks before your insurance company decides to boost your rates. Which reminds us: You DO have insurance, don't you?</p>

48784,"<p>There were four students taking organic chemistry at university They did so well on all the quizzes, mid-terms, labs and essays that each had an 'A' so far for the semester. </p>
<p>These four friends were so confident with the finals approaching that the weekend before they decided to go back to their home town and party with some friends there.</p>
<p>They had a great time. However, after all the hard partying, they slept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to town until early Monday morning the morning of their final exam.</p>
<p>Rather than taking the final then, they decided to find their professor AFTER the exam and explain to him why they missed it. </p>
<p>They explained that they had gone home to do some study for the weekend with the plan to come back in time for the exam. </p>
<p>But unfortunately, they had a flat tyre on the way back, didn't have a spare, and couldn't get help for a long time. As a result, they had only just arrived now!</p>
<p>The professor thought it over and then agreed they could make up their final exam the following day. </p>
<p>The four were elated and relieved. They studied hard that night - all night - and went in the next day at the time the professor had told them. </p>
<p>He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. The first problem was worth five points. It was something simple about free radical formation. </p>
<p>'Cool,' they all thought in their separate rooms, 'this is going to be easy.' </p>
<p>Each finished the problem and turned the page. </p>
<p>On the second page was written, 'Question 2 (for 95 points): Which tyre?'</p>

48788,"<p>Here is the report on our SCIENTIFIC CORRECTNESS SURVEY. The question was: </p>
<p>Is faster-than-light travel possible? </p>
<p>This survey drew an onslaught of opinions. </p>
<p>The vote was a landslide (72%) for the YES side. Thus, another controversy is put to rest. Henceforth, it will be scientifically correct to believe that faster-than-light travel is possible. </p>
<p>Opinions ranged from positive to negative, and from simple (""Yes"") to hideously complex. While the results are interesting, the variety of methods used to obtain them is dazzling.<br /> * * *<br /> Some readers used fuzzy logic:<br /> I have never really believed that light actually goes at the speed of light. Have we any proof? I worked out that it should go at root two times the speed of light (c) making the constant itself irrelevant.<br /> --Graeme Winter<br /> * * *<br /> Other readers used higher-level fuzzy logic:<br /> This is an interesting question, coincidentally I was driving through a Minnesota blizzard last week when my wife told me to slow down because I was 'over driving my headlights.' I was so excited I almost spilled my coffee because I thought that she meant I was traveling faster than the speed of light, but then I realized that she meant that because of the poor conditions, the stopping distance for my car was greater than my visibility.<br /> --Don Berryman<br /> * * *<br /> One reader used tangential logic:<br /> Since light has yet to dawn on school boards here in Texas, we are unable to answer this question.<br /> --Julia Frugoli<br /> * * *<br /> Some took a theoretical bent: </p>
<p>Yes, but no matter what the destination, you always arrive at night.<br /> --Dick Baker </p>
<p>My fraternity brother Charles Jones (MIT '63) created a faster- than-light vehicle in 1960. A beam of light is reflected in a mirror. Approaching the mirror, the light's velocity is (+)c. After reflection it is -c. Ergo at the instant of reflection, its velocity is 0. When the vehicle passes the mirror, it goes faster than light.<br /> --A. D. Snider<br /> * * *<br /> Others relied on advanced theories:</p>
<p>Faster than light travel IS possible but only if you are facing backwards.<br /> --Charles Belair </p>
<p>It depends on how fast the light is going.<br /> --Michael Castleman<br /> * * *<br /> Some readers cited empirical evidence: </p>
<p>Of course. It is demonstrated every week in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". They also demonstrate crystal power, telepathy, reversal of the polarity of neutron fluxes in starboard power couplings, and other facets of modern science.<br /> --Stephen Trier </p>
<p>No. No no no no no no. Most people think Star Trek has solved the problem of faster-than-light travel. I am much more fascinated by Star Trek's solution to the sound-in-a-vacuum problem.<br /> --Karen Lingel </p>
<p>""Yes!"" E-mail uses delivery through electrical circuits, therefore traveling at the speed of light (one of the reasons for its popularity over the historically traditional US Postal ""Service""). America OnLine uses these same electrical circuits. It is well known that almost anything travels faster than AOL these days.<br /> --G. Borochoff<br /> * * *<br /> Not everyone relied on intellectual arguments. Two readers, Charlie Cerf and Peter Thorp, sent in variants of the same classical argument:<br /> There was a young lady called Bright<br /> who could travel much faster than light.<br /> She departed one day<br /> in a relative way<br /> and returned on the previous night<br /> * * *<br /> Practical experience, too, was useful in solving the question:</p>
<p>Of course faster-than-light travel is possible. However, the probability that your luggage will wind up at the wrong destination increases as the cube of the velocity.<br /> --Bob O'Hara </p>
<p>Yes. Faster than light travel is possible and can be readily demonstrated by making the mistake of having two dates show up at your place at the same time. I've done this and witnessed first hand the flight, which happens so fast that you can't see it.<br /> --P. Hughes </p>
<p>Yes, but tickets must be purchased at least three weeks in advance and a Saturday night stay is required.<br /> --Kristina Pawlikowski </p>
<p>After my cat decided it was play time at AM, he was forcefully accelerated from the bed. Quickly, his velocity reached the of light resulting in a mid-air white hot flash of spontaneous combustion (matter to energy.) Conversely, all internal energies (neuroelectrical, biochemical, etc.) were converted to matter. A strange ash covered the room, very similar to scoopable litter. The other possibility is that he landed on my camera equipment and has been hiding ever since.<br /> --Don Copeland<br /> * * *<br /> Finally, one response defied categorization: Of course, as a physics teacher I tell my students that faster- than-light travel is impossible, but that's just to crush their spirits.<br /> --LaNelle Ohlhausen</p>

Reluctantly he agrees, and a few weeks later comes out of hospital feeling very depressed. To cheer himself up he decides to buy himself some new clothes. As he walks into the shop the assistant asks him if he would like some new shoes. The man replies yes and without asking the assistant brings the man the correct size pair off shoes. The man is perplexed by this so the shopkeeper explains that he can gauge his shoe size by experience alone. The assistant then asks the man if he would like a new shirt, and once again brings him a shirt with the right collar size without asking. Amazed; the man is asked if he would like some new underwear, the shop assistant brings him a pair of briefs with a waist size of 32 inches. The man laughs and says, "" Aha I knew I would catch you out, I have been a size 30 inch waist for the past 5 years"" The shop keeper replies ""No sir that is far too tight, they will push your balls against your spine and give you terrible headaches!""</p>

48833,"<p>In a hospital's Intensive Care Unit, patients always died in the same bed, on Sunday morning, at about 11:00 a.m., regardless of their medical condition.</p>
<p>This puzzled the doctors and some even thought it had something to do with the supernatural.</p>
<p>No one could solve the mystery as to why the deaths occurred around 11:00 a.m. on Sunday, so a worldwide team of experts was assembled to investigate the cause of the incidents.</p>
<p>The next Sunday morning, a few minutes before 11:00 a.m., all of the doctors and nurses nervously waited outside the ward to see for themselves what the terrible phenomenon was all about.</p>
<p>Some were holding wooden crosses, prayer books, and other holy objects to ward off the evil spirits.</p>
<p>Just when the clock struck 11:00, Pookie Johnson, the part-time Sunday sweeper, entered the ward and unplugged the life support system so he could use the vacuum cleaner.</p>

48834,"<p>On a farm out in the country lived a man and a woman and their three sons. Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow was lying dead in the field. The situation looked hopeless to her--how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself. When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank. She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair.But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and the cow to you."" The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river.Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river. The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river.The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in. And there he also met the mermaid.""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row."" The young son replied, ""Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?"" The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said,""Why not THIRTY times in a row?""Finally, she said, ""Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect health."" Then the young son asked, ""Wait! How do I know that thirty times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?""</p>

48836,"<p>One bright sunny day, a beautiful blonde girl was cruising the countryside in her new, shiny red sports car. Suddenly, she jammed on the brakes, and she brought the car to a sideways, screeching halt. She quickly jumped out of the car, and ran up the road a little way, to where she began fuming in anger.</p>
<p>For there, about 40 feet in front of her, in the middle of the road, were two other beautiful young blondes, sitting in a rowboat. One was on the middle seat, straining her arms and pulling for all she was worth on a set of oars, while the other was in the bow of the boat shouting through a megaphone, ""Stroke! Stroke!""</p>
<p>So infuriated was the first blonde at these two and their foolishness, that she began pacing back forth on the pavement, throwing gravel and dirt at them from her place on the road, and she screamed at the top of her lungs,  ""You two are so stupid, and if I could swim, I'd come out there and kick both your behinds!!""</p>

48837,"<p>There were three pious monks.  These monks were so pious, in fact, that<br /> the head abbot decided one day to reward their devotion by granting<br /> them each one day of sin, on the condition that they confess their<br /> activities to him at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So, the day cometh, and the three monks go off into the night to<br /> indulge in all manner of sin.</p>
<p>The first monk saunters in at 1:00 in the morning, and tries to sneak<br /> upstairs to bed.  But the head abbot, who was waiting up for the three,<br /> stopped him and demanded that he relate his doings.</p>
<p>""No, head abbot,"" the first monk said, ""it's too evil for me to admit!""</p>
<p>""The deal was for you to tell me everything you did, otherwise you will<br /> not receive absolution!""  said the abbot.</p>
<p>So the first monk agreed to tell what he did.  ""I - I - I drank!  And I<br /> did all manner of drugs!  And I smoked tea bags and old polyester ties,<br /> and I snorted coffee whitener....""</p>
<p>""Enough!""  said the head abbot, enraged.  ""Those are evil sins, but I<br /> promised to forgive you.  Go out back, drink some Holy Water, say some<br /> prayers and you will be forgiven in the morning.""</p>
<p>The first monk thankfully went off to follow the abbot's instructions.</p>
<p>The second monk wanders in at 2:00 AM.  ""What did you do last night?""<br /> demanded the head abbot.</p>
<p>""I can't say!  It's much too evil!""</p>
<p>""The agreement was that you must tell me everything you did!""</p>
<p>""Okay,"" agreed the second monk.  ""I had all manner of sex.  I had sex<br /> with young girls, young boys, small furry quadrupeds, large species of<br /> flora, my CD player...""</p>
<p>""Enough!""  cried the head abbot.  ""That is a truly great sin.  But I<br /> promised to give you absolution.  Go out back and drink some Holy<br /> Water.  Then say some prayers and you will be forgiven in the morning.""</p>
<p>The second monk sauntered off to do just that.</p>
<p>And the third and final monk crawls in at 3:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>""What,"" asks the head abbot, ""did you do this evening?""</p>
<p>""No, head abbot, it's too great a sin to admit.  I cannot tell!""</p>
<p>""The agreement, monk!  You must tell me!""</p>
<p>The third monk bowed his head and nodded.  ""All right, head abbot.  Last<br /> night I...I...""</p>
<p>""Yes?""</p>

48838,"<p>MARS AIR FORCE DENIES STORIES OF UFO CRASHValles Marineris (MPI) - A spokesthing for Mars Air Force denounced as false rumors that an alien space craft crashed in the desert, outside of Ares Vallis on Friday.  Appearing at a press conference today, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser, stated that 'the object was, in fact, a harmless high-altitude weather balloon, not an alien spacecraft'.The story broke late Friday night when a major stationed at nearby Ares Vallis Air Force Base contacted the Valles Marineris Daily Record with a story about a strange, balloon-shaped object which allegedly came down in the nearby desert, 'bouncing' several times before coming to a stop, 'deflating in a sudden explosion of alien gases'.  Minutes later, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser contacted the Daily Record telepathically to contradict the earlier report.General Rgrmrmy The Lesser stated that hysterical stories of a detachable vehicle roaming across the Martian desert were blatant fiction, provoked by incidences involving swamp gas.  But the general public has been slow to accept the Air Force's explanation of recent events, preferring to speculate on the 'other-worldly' nature of the crash debris.  Conspiracy theorists have condemned Rgrmrmy's statements as evidence of 'an obvious government cover-up', pointing out that Mars has no swamps.</p>

48851,"<p>During one of a professer's routine classes, he decided to raise<br /> a controversial subject:</p>
<p>He stood in front of his class and said: ""Can anyone hear God?<br /> Can anyone see God? Can anyone smell God?"" After a long pause,<br /> the professor concluded: ""Because none of you can hear, see, or<br /> smell God, I conclude that there is no God.""</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, one particularly potent student stood up.<br /> ""May I address the class directly?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""Yes, you may,"" the professor replied.</p>
<p>The student went to the front of the class and began: ""Can<br /> anyone hear the professor's brain? Can anyone see the<br /> professor's brain? Can anyone smell the professor's brain?""<br /> After a particularly uneasy and long pause, the student<br /> finished: ""Because none of you can hear, see, or smell the<br /> professor's brain, I conclude that the professor has no brain.""</p>

48863,"<p>There were three people stranded on an island, a brunette, a redhead, and a blonde.  The brunette looked over the water to the mainland and estimated about 20 miles to shore.  So she announced, ""I'm going to try to swim to shore.""  So she swam out five miles, and got really tired.  She swam out ten miles from the island, and she was too tired to go on, so she drowned.The second one, the redhead, said to herself, ""I wonder if she made it.  I guess it's better to try to get to the mainland than stay here and starve."" So she attempts to swim out.  The redhead had a lot more endurance than the brunette, as she swam out 10 miles before she even  got tired.  After 15 miles, she was too tired to go on, so she drowned.So the blonde thought to herself, ""I wonder if they made it! I think I'd better try to make it, too.""  So she swam out 5 miles, ten miles, fifteen miles, and finally nineteen miles from the island.  The shore was just in sight, but she said, ""I'm too tired to go on!""  So she swam back.</p>

The camel refused by running away. So he caught up to it again and<br /> goes on it again.<br /> Finally after riding the camel through the whole desert the man came to a<br /> road. There was a broken down car with three big cheated beautiful blondes<br /> sitting in it.<br /> He went up to them and asked the women if they needed any help.<br /> The hottest girl said,""If you fix our car we will do anything you want.""<br /> The man luckily knew a thing or two about cars and fixed it in a flash.<br /> When he finished are three girls asked, ""How could we ever repay you Mr.""<br /> After thinking for a short while he replied,� Could you hold my camel?""</p>

48871,"<p>There's a guy who owns a parrot which never talks. </p>
<p>So he goes to the pet shop to get some advice. </p>
<p>The pet shop owner says he knows exactly what the problem is. </p>
<p>""Your parrot has too much hook in it's beak, what you have to do is file its beak back and it will be able to talk just fine. </p>
<p>You've got to be careful not to file it too far though, because if you take too much off the bird will drown the first time it has a drink."" </p>
<p>The parrot owner asks how much the pet shop guy charges to do this beak modification and he says $100. </p>
<p>So the parrot fancier decides he'll do it himself. </p>
<p>A week or so later they bump into one another in the street. </p>
<p>The pet shop guy enquires, ""How is your parrot, is it talking yet?"" </p>
<p>The parrot owner says, ""The parrot's dead."" </p>

So after a while he asks her if she would like to receive the best tongue sex of her life. </p>
<p>She eagerly accepts, but the guy tells her it is to be from his pet frog Freddo. By this time the beauty is getting pretty tipsy and insists on seeing the frog first. So the guy gets him out and presses just behind the jaw of the frog to make him flop his tongue out. At the sight of the size of the tongue the beauty can't wait and just about tears the guys arm off getting him and the frog to her appartment, where she immediately undresses and lays spread eagle on the bed awaiting Freddo and his tongue. </p>
<p>The guy places Freddo between her legs and repeats ""lick-her"" several times. A few minutes pass and nothing, he repeats ""lick-her"", still no response from Freddo. </p>
<p>Before the beauty can complain again, the guy picks up Freddo and says, ""This is the last time I show you how this is done!""</p>

48875,"<p>Stage 1 - SMART      This is when you suddenly become an expert on every       subject in the known Universe. You know you know        everything and want to pass on your knowledge to        anyone who will listen. At this stage you are always        RIGHT. And of course the person you are talking to is        very WRONG. This makes for an interesting argument        when both parties are SMART.      Stage 2 - GOOD LOOKING      This is when you realise that you are the BEST        LOOKING person in the entire bar and that people        fancy you. You can go up to a perfect stranger        knowing they fancy you and really want to talk to you.       Bear in mind that you are still SMART, so you can        talk to this person about any subject under the sun.       Stage 3 - RICH      This is when you suddenly become the richest person        in the world. You can buy drinks for the entire bar        because you have an armoured truck full of money        parked behind the bar. You can also make bets at this       stage, because of course, you are still SMART, so        naturally you will win all your bets. It doesn't        matter how much you bet 'cos you are RICH. You will        also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because       now you are the BEST LOOKING person in the world.       Stage 4 - BULLET PROOF      You are now ready to pick fights with anyone and        everyone especially those with whom you have been        betting or arguing. This is because nothing can hurt        you. At this point you can also go up to the partners       of the people who you fancy and challenge to a battle        of wits or money. You have no fear of losing this        battle because you are SMART, you are RICH and hell,        you're BETTER LOOKING than they are anyway!      Stage 5 - INVISIBLE      This is the Final Stage of Drunkenness. At this point        you can do anything because NO ONE CAN SEE YOU. You        dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy        because the rest of the people in the room cannot see        you. You are also invisible to the person who wants       to fight you. You can walk through the street singing        at the top of your lungs because no one can see or        hear you and because you're still SMART you know all        the words.</p>

He had not had sex in so long, since his girlfriend broke up with him.  While trying figure out a way to get rid of his erection, He walked out of the house and saw the sheep in the field.  Suddenly, he got a wonderful idea and started to run down to the sheep, unbuttoning his pants as he went.  Then, the sheep dog cut him off, growling and barking.  The dog would not let him pass and get to the sheep.  The boy gave up and went about his chores.  The next day, the boy woke up and tried to sneak down to the sheep.  But the dog once again would not let him get rid of them.  Then, the third day, the boy heard someone screaming for help.  He went down to the pond and saw a beautiful women  drowning in the water.  He dove in and saved her life.  When she caught her breath, she told him, ""you saved my life.  To repay you, I'll do anything for you, anything at all.""

He took her hand and lead her up to the farm.  He took her hand, looked into her beautiful eyes and asked, ""would you mind holding this dog for me?""</p>

I thought to myself, this guy's a jackass, there sure a lot of jackasses in this world. I noticed he had a ""For Sale"" sign in the back window of his car. I wrote down the number. Then I hunted for another place to park. </p>
<p>A couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my desk. I had just gotten off the phone after calling 555-4863 and yelling, ""You're jackass!"" </p>
<p>(It's really easy to call him now since I have his number on speed dial.) </p>
<p>I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black Camaro lying on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy,too. After a couple rings someone answered the phone and said, ""Hello."" </p>
<p>I said, ""Is this the man with the black Camaro for sale?"" </p>
<p>""Yes, it is."" </p>
<p>""Can you tell me where I can see it?"" </p>
<p>""Yes, I live at 2104 East 34th street. It's a yellow house and the car's parked right out front."" </p>
<p>I said, ""What's your name?"" </p>
<p>""My name is Don H."" </p>
<p>""When's a good time to catch you, Don?"" </p>
<p>""I'm home in the evenings."" </p>
<p>""Listen Don, can I tell you something?"" </p>
<p>""Yes,"" </p>
<p>""Don, you're a jackass!"" </p>
<p>And I slammed the phone down. After I hung up I added Don H's number to my speed dialer. </p>
<p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- </p>
<p>For a while things seemed to be going better for me. Now when I had a problem I had two jackasses to call. Then after several months of calling the jackasses and hanging up on them, it just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with a solution. </p>
<p>First, I had my phone dial Jackass #1. </p>
<p>A man answered nicely saying, ""Hello."" </p>
<p>I yelled ""You're a jackass!"", but I didn't hang up. </p>
<p>The jackass said, ""Are you still there?"" </p>
<p>I said, ""Yeah."" </p>
<p>He said, ""Stop calling me."" </p>
<p>I said, ""No."" </p>
<p>He said, ""What's your name, Pal?"" </p>
<p>I said, ""Don H."" </p>
<p>He said ""Where do you live?"" </p>
<p>""2104 East 34th Street. It's a yellow house and my black Camaro's parked out front."" </p>
<p>""I'm coming over right now, Don. You'd better start saying your prayers."" </p>
<p>""Yeah, like I'm really scared, Jackass!"" and I hung up. </p>
<p>Then I called Jackass #2. </p>
<p>He answered, ""Hello."" </p>
<p>I said, ""Hello, Jackass!"" </p>
<p>He said, ""If I ever find out who you are..."" </p>
<p>""You'll what?"" </p>
<p>""I'll kick your butt."" </p>
<p>""Well, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now Jackass!"" </p>
<p>And I hung up. Then I picked up the phone and called the police. I told them I was at 2104 East 34th Street and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as he got home. Another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war going on down W. 34th Street. </p>
<p>After that I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to watch the whole thing. Glorious!</p>
<p>If you want to watch two Jackasses kicking the crap out of each other in front of 6 squad cars and a police helicopter, I taped it off the evening news</p>

48948,"<p>A big city, Colorado, lawyer went duck hunting in rural Texas. He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence. As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing.The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell into this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it.""The old farmer replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here.""The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own.""The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we do things in Texas. We settle small disagreements like this with the Texas Three-Kick Rule."" The lawyer asked, ""What is the Texas Three-Kick Rule?""The Farmer replied, ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up."" The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom.The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second kick nearly wiped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on his belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up.The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get to his feet and said, ""Okay, you old coot! Now, it's my turn!""The old farmer smiled and said, ""No, I give up. You can have the duck!""</p>

48976,"<p>This truck driver hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers stops for a beer. As he approaches the bar, he sees a big sign on the door saying:</p>
<p>""Nerds Not Allowed -- Enter At Your Own Risk!""</p>
<p>He goes in and sits down. The bartender comes over to him.<br /> ""You smell kind of nerdy. What do you do for a living?""</p>
<p>""I drive a truck, and the smell is just from the computers I'm hauling.""</p>
<p>""Okay, truck drivers are not nerds,"" he says and serves him a beer. As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in with tape around his glasses, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver is totally shocked.</p>
<p>""Why did you do that?""</p>
<p>""Not to worry, the nerds are overpopulating Silicon Valley and are in season now. You don't even need a license.""</p>
<p>The truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads back onto the freeway. Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, grabbing up the computers.They are all engineers, accountants, and programmers wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen!</p>
<p>He can't let them steal his whole load. So, remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, felling several of them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop.</p>
<p>""What's wrong? I thought nerds were in season,"" says the truck driver.<br /> ""Well, sure,"" says the patrolman. ""But you can't bait 'em!""</p>

48994,"<p>Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Heaven, God was missing for six days.</p>
<p>(Of course, we know God is never missing, but this is a story.)</p>
<p>Eventually, Michael, the Archangel, found him resting on the seventh day.</p>
<p>He inquires of God, ""Where have you been?""</p>
<p>God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction and proudly pointed downward through the clouds. ""Look, Michael, look what I've made.""</p>
<p>Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, ""What is it?""</p>
<p>""It's a planet,"" replied God, ""and I've put life on it. I'm going to call it earth and it's going to be a great place of balance.</p>
<p>""Balance?"" inquired Michael, still confused.</p>
<p>God explained, pointing to different parts of the earth, ""For example, Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while Africa is going to be poor.</p>
<p>The Middle East over there will be a hot spot,"" God continued, pointing to different countries. ""This one will be extremely hot and while this one will be very cold and covered with ice.""</p>
<p>The Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to a large land mass with oceans as it borders and said, ""What's that one?""</p>
<p>""Ah,"" said God, ""that's Florida, the most glorious place on earth. There are beautiful beaches, rivers, lakes, and climate. The people from Florida are going to be modest, intelligent, and humorous, and they are going to be found traveling the world.</p>
<p>They will be extremely sociable, hardworking, and high achieving people, and they will be known throughout the world as diplomats and carriers of peace.""</p>
<p>Michael gasped in wonder and admiration, but then exclaimed, ""What about balance, God? You said there would be balance! Everyone and everything seems so totally perfect in this place you call Florida!""</p>
<p>God replied wisely, ""Wait until you see the idiots I'm sending down from the North every winter!""</p>

When he arrives, she seductively signals that he should bring his face close to hers. When he does so, she begins to gently caress his beard which is full and bushy. ""Are you the manager?"" she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands."" ""Actually, no"" he replies. ""Can you get him for me - I need to speak to him?"" she asks, running her hands up beyond his beard and into his hair. ""I'm afraid I can't"" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. ""Is there anything I can do?"" ""Yes there is. I need you to give him a message"" she continues huskily, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently. ""Tell him"" she says ""that there is no toilet paper or hand soap in the ladies room.""</p>
