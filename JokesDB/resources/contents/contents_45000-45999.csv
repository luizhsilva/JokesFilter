The song leader then stood very cautiously and announced with a smile, ""For our closing song, let us sing Hymn # 365: ""Shall We Gather at the River.""</p>

45007,"<p>Taken from ""A Hotel Is A Funny Place"", ""A Hotel Is A Place"", copyright 1972 and 1985 by Shelly Berman with permission.<br /> Dear Maid,<br /> Please do not leave any more of those little bars of soap in my bathroom since I have brought my own bath-sized Imperial Leather. Please remove the six unopened little bars from the shelf under the medicine chest and another three in the shower soap dish. They are in my way.<br /> Thank you,<br /> S. Berman<br /> -----------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Room 635,<br /> I am not your regular maid. She will be back tomorrow, Thursday, from<br /> Her day off. I took the 3 hotel soaps out of the shower soap dish as you requested. The 6 bars on your shelf I took out of your way and put on top of your Kleenex dispenser in case you should change your mind. This leaves only the 3 bars I left today which my instructions from the management are to leave 3 soaps daily. I hope this is satisfactory.<br /> Kathy, Relief Maid<br /> -------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Maid - I hope you are my regular maid.<br /> Apparently Kathy did not tell you about my note to her concerning the<br /> little bars of soap. When I got back to my room this evening, found you<br /> had added 3 little Camays to the shelf under my medicine cabinet. I am<br /> going to be here in the hotel for two weeks and have brought my own<br /> bath-size Imperial Leather, so I won't need those 6 little Camays, which are on the shelf.<br /> They are in my way when shaving, brushing teeth, etc. Please remove them.<br /> S. Berman<br /> -------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Mr. Berman,<br /> The assistant manager, Mr. Kensedder, informed me this morning that you called him last evening and said you were unhappy with your maid service. I have assigned a new girl to your room. I hope you will accept my apologies for any past inconvenience. If you have any future complaints, please contact me so I can give it my personal attention.<br /> Call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.<br /> Thank you.<br /> Elaine Carmen<br /> Housekeeper<br /> -------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Miss Carmen,<br /> It is impossible to contact you by phone since I leave the hotel for<br /> business at 7:45 AM and don't get back before 5:30 or 6PM. That's the<br /> reason I called Mr. Kensedder last night. You were already off duty.<br /> I only asked Mr. Kensedder if he could do anything about those little Bars of soap.<br /> The new maid you assigned me must have thought I was a new check in<br /> today, since she left another 3 bars of hotel soap in my medicine cabinet,<br /> along with her regular delivery of 3 bars on the Bathroom shelf. In just<br /> 5 days here I have accumulated 24 little bars of soap.<br /> Why are you doing this to me?<br /> S. Berman<br /> ------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Mr. Berman,<br /> Your maid, Kathy, has been instructed to stop delivering soap to your room and remove the extra soaps. If I can be of further assistance, please call extension 1108 between 8 AM and 5PM.<br /> Thank you,<br /> Elaine Carmen,<br /> Housekeeper<br /> -------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Mr. Kensedder,<br /> My bath-size Imperial Leather is missing. Every bar of soap was taken<br /> from my room, including my own bath-size Imperial Leather. I came in<br /> late last night and had to call the bellhop to bring me 4 little<br /> Cashmere Bouquets.<br /> S. Berman<br /> -------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Mr. Berman,<br /> I have informed our housekeeper, Elaine Carmen, of your soap problem. I cannot understand why there was no soap in your room since our maids are<br /> instructed to leave 3 bars of soap each time they service a room.<br /> The situation will be rectified immediately. Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience.<br /> Martin L. Kensedder<br /> Assistant Manager<br /> --------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Mrs. Carmen,<br /> Who the hell left 54 little bars of Camay in my room? I came in last<br /> Night and found 54 little bars of soap. I don't want 54 little bars of<br /> Camay. I want my one damn bar of bath-size Imperial Leather. Do you<br /> realise I have 54 bars of soap in here? All I want is my bath-size<br /> Imperial Leather. Please give me back my bath-size Imperial Leather.<br /> S. Berman<br /> ---------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Mr. Berman,<br /> You complained of too much soap in your room, so I had them removed.<br /> Then you complained to Mr. Kensedder that all your soap was missing, so<br /> I personally returned them The 24 Camays which had been taken and the 3<br /> Camays you are supposed to receive daily. I don't know anything about<br /> the 4 Cashmere Bouquets. Obviously your maid, Kathy, did not know I had<br /> returned your soaps, so she also brought 24 Camays plus the 3 daily Camays. I don't know where you got the idea this hotel issues bath-size Imperial Leather.<br /> I was able to locate some bath-size Ivory which I left in your room.<br /> Elaine Carmen<br /> Housekeeper<br /> ----------------------------------------------------<br /> Dear Mrs. Carmen,<br /> Just a short note to bring you up-to-date on my latest soap inventory.<br /> As of today I possess:<br /> - On the shelf under the medicine cabinet -<br /> 18 Camay in 4 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2.<br /> - On the Kleenex dispenser - 11 Camay in 2 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 3.<br /> - On the bedroom dresser - 1 stack of 3 Cashmere Bouquet, 1 stack of 4 hotel-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks of 4.<br /> - Inside the medicine cabinet - 14 Camay in 3 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2.<br /> - In the shower soap dish - 6 Camay, very moist.<br /> - On the northeast corner of the tub - 1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used.<br /> - On the northwest corner of the tub - 6 Camays in 2 stacks of 3.<br /> Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks are<br /> neatly piled and dusted. Also, please advise her that stacks of more<br /> than 4 have a tendency to tip.<br /> May I suggest that my bedroom windowsill is not in use and will make an excellent spot for future soap deliveries. One more item, I have purchased another bar of bath-size Imperial Leather which I am keeping in the hotel vault in order to avoid further misunderstandings.<br /> S. Berman</p>

45013,"<p>It seems a pastor from Maine skipped services one Sunday to go bear hunting in the mountains. As he turned the corner along the path, he and a bear collided. The pastor stumbled backwards, slipped off the trail, and began tumbling down the mountain with the bear in hot pursuit. Finally the pastor crashed into a boulder, sending his rifle in one direction and breaking both legs.<br /> As the bear closed in, the pastor cried out in desperation, ""Lord, I'm sorry for what I have done. Please forgive me and save me Lord, please make that bear a Christian."" </p>
<p>Suddenly the bear skidded to a halt at the pastor's feet, fell to its knees, clasped its paws together and said, ""God, bless this food which I am about to receive.""</p>

45021,"<p>'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE IMPEACHMENT<br />  December 17, 1998 </p>
<p> 'Twas The Night Before Impeachment, when all through the House,<br />  All the Congress was stirring, even Conyers, the louse.<br />  The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care,<br />  In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair. </p>
<p> The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds,<br />  While visions of perjury danced in their heads.<br />  And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap,<br />  Had just settled in for a long evening's nap. </p>
<p> When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter<br />  They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter.<br />  When what to their wondering eyes should appear<br />  But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer. </p>
<p> With a Presidential address, so lively and quick,<br />  They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick!<br />  More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came,<br />  And he whistled and shouted and called them by name: </p>
<p> ""Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let's forget about The Vixen!<br />  On Barney! On Maxine! I'm no Richard Nixon!!!""<br />  ""From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall,<br />  Now dash away, dash away, dash away all !!!"" </p>
<p> And then the Republicans heard on the roof<br />  The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br />  As they scratched their heads and were turning around<br />  The resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound. </p>
<p> No longer was he eating from his humble pie,<br />  While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky.<br />  A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq,<br />  It looked once again like Slick Willie was back. </p>
<p> His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!<br />  His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.<br />  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br />  And the hair on his head was as white as the snow. </p>
<p> The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth,<br />  And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.<br />  He had a broad face and a little round belly<br />  That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly. </p>
<p> He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf,<br />  And the Republicans wept, in spite of themselves.<br />  And a wink of his eye and a twist of his head<br />  Soon gave them to know they had something to dread. </p>
<p> He spoke the right words and went straight to his work<br />  Hard to believe that an Intern once called him ""The Jerk.""<br />  And shaking his finger and thumbing his nose,<br />  By ""Wagging The Dog,"" up the polls he rose. </p>
<p> He turned to his spinmeisters and gave them a whistle,<br />  Then they cheered-on Slick Willie as he launched another missile.<br />  They all heard him exclaim, with Impeachment out of sight,<br /> ""Happy Ramadan to all, and to all a good night.""</p>

45025,"<p>While most companies refrain from allowing consumption of alcohol on the premises, there are some good arguments for changing that policy. Reasons for allowing drinking at work include: </p>
<p>1. It's an incentive to show up. </p>
<p>2. It reduces stress. </p>
<p>3. It leads to more honest communications. </p>
<p>4. It reduces complaints about low pay. </p>
<p>5. It cuts down on time off because you can cure hangovers, from the night before, with another drink. </p>
<p>6. Employees tell management what they think, not what management wants to hear. </p>
<p>7. It helps save on heating costs in the winter. </p>
<p>8. It encourages carpooling. </p>
<p>9. Increases job satisfaction because if you have a bad job you don't care. </p>
<p>10. It eliminates vacations because people would rather come to work. </p>
<p>11. It makes fellow employees look better. </p>
<p>12. It makes the cafeteria food taste better. </p>
<p>13. Bosses are more likely to hand out raises when they are wasted. </p>
<p>14. Salary negotiations are a lot more profitable. </p>

45032,"<p>A man takes the day off work and decides to go out golfing . . .<br /> . . . He is on the second hole when he notices a frog sitting next to the<br /> green. He thinks nothing of it and is about to shoot when he hears, ""Ribbit 9<br /> Iron.""</p>
<p>The man looks around and doesn't see anyone. Again, he hears, ""Ribbit<br /> 9 Iron."" He looks at the frog and decides to prove the frog wrong, puts the club<br /> away, and grabs a 9 iron.</p>
<p>Boom! He hits it 10 inches from the cup. He is shocked. He says to the frog,<br /> ""Wow that's amazing. You must be a lucky frog, eh?</p>
<p>The frog replies, ""Ribbit Lucky frog.""</p>
<p>The man decides to take the frog with him to the next hole. ""What do you think<br /> frog?"" the man asks.<br /> ""Ribbit 3 wood.""</p>
<p>The guy takes out a 3 wood and, Boom! Hole in one. The man is befuddled and<br /> doesn't know what to say. By the end of the day, the man golfed the best game of<br /> golf in his life and asks the frog, ""OK where to next?""</p>
<p>The frog replies, ""Ribbit Las Vegas.""<br /> They go to Las Vegas and the guy says, ""OK frog, now what?""<br /> The frog says, ""Ribbit Roulette.""<br /> Upon approaching the roulette table, the man asks, ""What do you think I should<br /> bet?""<br /> The frog replies, ""Ribbit $3000, black 6."" Now, this is a million-to-one shot<br /> to win, but after the golf game the man figures what the heck. Boom! Tons of<br /> cash comes sliding back across the table.</p>
<p>The man takes his winnings and buys the best room in the hotel. He sits the<br /> frog down and says, ""Frog, I don't know how to repay you.</p>
<p>You've won me all this money and I am forever grateful.""</p>
<p>The frog replies, ""Ribbit Kiss Me."" He figures why not, since after all the<br /> frog did for him, he deserves it. With a kiss, the frog turns into a gorgeous<br /> 15-year-old girl. ""And that, your honor, is how the girl ended up in my room.<br /> So help me God or my name is not William Jefferson Clinton.""</p>

<p>Days later, a relative called about the picture, laughing<br /> hysterically and suggesting I take a closer look.

45047,"<p>'Twas the Night Before Christmas: Politically Correct Version </p>
<p>'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...<br /> How to live in a world that's politically correct?<br /> His workers no longer would answer to ''Elves'',<br /> ''Vertically Challenged'' they were calling themselves.<br /> And labor conditions at the north pole<br /> Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.<br /> Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,<br /> Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.<br /> And equal employment had made it quite clear<br /> That Santa had better not use just reindeer.<br /> So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,<br /> Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!<br /> The runners had been removed from his sleigh<br /> The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.<br /> And people had started to call for the cops<br /> When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.<br /> Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.<br /> His fur trimmed red suit was called ''Unenlightened.''<br /> And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,<br /> Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose<br /> And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,<br /> Demanding millions in over-due compensation.<br /> So, half of the reindeer were gone and his wife,<br /> Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,<br /> Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,<br /> Demanding from now on her title was Ms.<br /> And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion<br /> That making a choice could cause so much commotion.<br /> Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,<br /> Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.<br /> Nothing that might be construed to pollute.<br /> Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.<br /> Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.<br /> Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.<br /> Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.<br /> Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.<br /> No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.<br /> Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.<br /> And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,<br /> Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.<br /> For they raised the hackles of those psychological<br /> Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.<br /> No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt<br /> Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.<br /> Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe<br /> And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.<br /> So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed<br /> He just could not figure out what to do next.<br /> He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,<br /> But you've got to be careful with that word today.<br /> His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground<br /> Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.<br /> Something special was needed, a gift that he might<br /> Give to all without angering the left or the right.<br /> A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,<br /> Each group of people, every religion<br /> Every ethnicity, every hue,<br /> Everyone, everywhere...even you.<br /> So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...<br /> ''May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth.''</p>

'I would love to be able to get to the top of yonder tree', sighed the pheasant, 'but I haven't got the energy'.'Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?' replied the bull. 'They're packed with nutrients'.The pheasant pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. And so on.Finally, after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Whereupon he was spotted by a farmer who dashed into the farmhouse, emerged with a shotgun, and shot the pheasant right out of the tree.The Moral of the Story: Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.</p>

45071,"<p>1.  In the beginning GOD created the Bit and the Byte. And from those he<br />     created the Word.</p>
<p>2.  And there were two Bytes in the Word; and nothing else existed. And God<br />     separated the One from the Zero; and he saw it was good.</p>
<p>3.  And God said - Let the Data be; And so it happened. And God said - Let<br />     the Data go to their proper places. And he created floppy disks and<br />     hard disks and compact disks.</p>
<p>4.  And God said - Let the computers be, so there would be a place to put<br />     floppy disks and hard disks and compact disks. Thus God created<br />     computers and called them hardware.</p>
<p>5.  And there was no Software yet. But God created programs; small and big.<br />     And told them - Go and multiply yourselves and fill all the Memory.</p>
<p>6.  And God said - I will create the Programmer; And the Programmer will<br />     make new programs and govern over the computers and programs and Data.</p>
<p>7.  And God created the Programmer; and put him at Data Center; And God<br />     showed the Programmer the Catalog Tree and said You can use all the<br />     volumes and subvolumes but DO NOT USE Windows.</p>
<p>8.  And God said - It is not Good for the programmer to be alone. He took a<br />     bone from the Programmer's body and created a creature that would look<br />     up at the Programmer; and admire the Programmer; and love the things<br />     the Programmer does; And God called the creature: the User.</p>
<p>9.  And the Programmer and the User were left under the naked DOS and it<br />     was Good.</p>
<p>10. But Bill was smarter than all the other creatures of God. And Bill<br />     said to the User - Did God really tell you not to run any programs ?</p>
<p>11. And the User answered - God told us that we can use every program and<br />     every piece of Data but told us not to run Windows or we will die.</p>
<p>12. And Bill said to the User - How can you talk about something you did<br />     not even try. The moment you run Windows you will become equal to God.<br />     You will be able to create anything you like by a simple click of your<br />     mouse.</p>
<p>13. And the User saw that the fruits of the Windows were nicer and easier<br />     to use. And the User saw that any knowledge was useless - since Windows<br />     could replace it.</p>
<p>14. So the User installed the Windows on his computer; and said to the<br />     Programmers that it was good.</p>
<p>15. And the Programmer immediately started to look for new drivers. And<br />     God asked him - What are you looking for? And the Programmer answered<br />     -I am looking for new drivers because I can not find them in the DOS.<br />     And God said - Who said you need drivers? Did you run Windows? And the<br />     Programmer said - It was Bill who told us to !</p>
<p>16. And God said to Bill - Because of what you did you will be hated by<br />     all the creatures. And the User will always be unhappy with you. And<br />     you will always sell Windows.</p>
<p>17. And God said to the User - Because of what you did, the Windows will<br />     disappoint you and eat up all your Resources; and you will have to use<br />     lousy programs; and you will always rely on the Programmer's help.</p>
<p>18. And God said to the Programmer - Because you listened to the User you<br />     will never be happy. All your programs will have errors and you will<br />     have to fix them and fix them to the end of time.</p>
<p>19. And God threw them out of the Data Center and locked the door and<br />     secured it with a password.</p>

45090,"<p>Here's Martha Stewart's Etiquette Guide for Rednecks!</p>
<p>1. Never take a beer to a job interview.<br /> 2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.<br /> 3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.<br /> 4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.<br /> 5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is still considered tacky to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home.<br /> ***************************</p>
<p>DINING OUT</p>
<p>1. When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup,and pour slowly so as not to ""bruise"" the fruit of the vine.<br /> 2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your fingers covering the label.<br /> **********************</p>
<p>ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME</p>
<p>1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist.<br /> 2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table...no matter how good his manners are.<br /> ***********************</p>
<p>PERSONAL HYGIENE</p>
<p>1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.<br /> 2. Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days. However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of good money.<br /> 3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.<br /> ****************</p>
<p>DATING (Outside the Family)</p>
<p>1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.<br /> 2. Be aggressive. Let her know you're interested:  ""I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago.""<br /> 3. Establish with her parents what time she is expected back.Some will say 10:00 PM; Others might say ""Monday."" If the latter is the answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.<br /> **********************</p>
<p>THEATER ETIQUETTE</p>
<p>1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately after the movie has ended.<br /> 2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven they can't hear you.<br /> ***********************</p>
<p>WEDDINGS</p>
<p>1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.<br /> 2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.<br /> 3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.<br /> 4. Though uncomfortable, say ""yes"" to socks and shoes for this special occasion.<br /> *******************</p>
<p>DRIVING ETIQUETTE</p>
<p>1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles;  Even if the  gun is loaded, and the deer is in sight.<br /> 2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires always has the right of way.<br /> 3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.<br /> 4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer.<br /> 5. Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.</p>

45092,"<p>There were two old boys from Alabama who love to fish, and they wanted to do some ice fishing. They'd heard about it up in Canada, and they took off up there. The lake was frozen nicely. They stopped just before they got to the lake at a little bait shop and got all their tackle. One of them said, ""We're going to need an ice pick.""</p>
<p>So they got that, and they took off. In about two hours, one of them was back at the shop and said, ""We're going to need another dozen ice picks.""</p>
<p>Well, the fellow in the shop wanted to ask some questions, but he didn't. He sold him the picks, and the old boy left.</p>
<p>In about an hour, he was back. Said, ""We're going to need all the ice picks you've got.""</p>
<p>The bait man couldn't stand it any longer. ""By the way,"" he asked, ""how are you fellows doing?""</p>

<p>Linda Burnett,  23, a resident of San Diego, was visiting her in-laws and while there, went to a nearby supermarket to pick up some groceries. Several people noticed  her sitting in her car with the windows rolled up and with her eyes closed, with both hands behind the back of her head. One customer who had been at the store for a while became concerned and walked over to the car. He noticed that Linda's eyes were now open, and she looked very strange. He asked her if she was okay, and Linda replied that she'd been shot in the  back of the head, and had been holding her brains in for over an hour. The  man called the paramedics, who broke into the car because the doors were locked and Linda refused to remove her hands from her head. When they finally got in, they found that Linda had a wad of bread dough on the back of her head. A Pillsbury biscuit canister had exploded from the heat, making a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot, and the wad of dough hit her in the back of her head. When she reached back to find out what it was, she felt the dough and thought it was her brains. She initially passed out, but quickly recovered and tried to hold her brains in for over an hour until someone noticed and came to her aid.</p>

45130,"<p>I have only one firm belief in the American political system, and that is this: God is a Republican and Santa Claus is a Democrat. </p>
<p>God is an elderly or, at any rate, middle-aged male, a stern fellow, patriarchal rather than paternal and a great believer in rules and regulations. He holds men strictly accountable for their actions. He has little apparent concern for the material well-being of the disadvantaged. He is politically connected, socially powerful and holds the mortgage on literally everything in the world. God is difficult. God is unsentimental. It is very hard to get into God's heavenly country club. </p>
<p>Santa Claus is another matter. He's cute. He non-threatening. He's always cheerful. And he loves animals. He may know who's been naughty and who's been nice, but he never does anything about it. He gives everyone everything they want without thought of a quid pro quo. He works hard for charities, and he's famously generous to the poor. Santa Claus is preferable to God in every way but one: There is no such thing as Santa Claus.</p>

45150,"<p>So Mischievous One, you now have your very own Viking.  Did you know that care and handling of a Viking is a serious undertaking?  Not to mention the large amounts of meat, beer and mead needed, you also have to be an expert on cleaning furs, on them and around them!Beards are comb-able, but usually have food stuck in them, not to mention the odd small bird nest.  Hair can be braided, and if the beard is likewise long, a few braids can be done to minimize the number of small furry and feathery critters that move in.  This can be a good thing for you to try, but he may resist until you show him that the braids can be woven into spectacular knotwork patterns!Remove clothing before brushing the hair of your Viking.  Any resemblance to a bear is coincidental, and leave his father's heritage and mother's preferences out of the conversation.  Vikings are touchy about their heritage.  Being descended from a bear is not a bad thing for Vikings. Now those furs that he is dressed in!  Were they tanned properly?  Do they have an interesting odor?  Are they still alive and kicking? Insure they are quite dead before attempting cleaning.  Remove all insect life and dirt using a brush and beat the hung skin with a carpet whacker to loosen the deeply set dust and dirt.  Oh, and you should remove the skins from you Viking before beating them.  If the skins need washing, remember to use a mild soap and lanolin for the fur along with neatsfoot oil for the skin to prevent drying out. Another thing to consider with your Viking is to convince him to wear cloth under those skins.  Cloth is easier to clean and it resists those pests that like to climb into your bed with you!  Never give your Viking knitted undergarments, socks or caps as they are a sign that your affection is wavering!  Unless of course you are sending a signal, then you may accompany this signal with a 2x4 of appropriate length.  Use the 2x4 with the trademark side away from your Viking's head to reduce the chance of breakage, and take a full swing to get your Viking's full attention.  Removal of the helm is optional, but recommended, as you may damage the helm. The cloth you use on your Viking should be a heavy cotton such as Trigger or tent canvas.  Anything less is a waste of time and money as Vikings are notoriously hard on cloth.  If you Viking is camping, keep a fire extinguisher ready, especially if your Viking smokes.  They never learn to pull a branch from the fire to light their tobacco and are always catching their beards on fire (another reason to braid that beard and hair). Making love with a Viking is a major event for a Lady, well worth the effort!  First, remove all weaponry from him.  A good compromise is to leave the axe beside the bed and the knives on the nightstand.  Never allow him to 'Just keep one!', as it will invariably end up in your derriere at the most inopportune moment when he is not worried about why you are screaming!  Be firm here.  Speaking of firm, warm is good. So when you strip him of all of those furs, they make dandy floor coverings in front of the fire place or on the bed to keep warm. Never overlook an opportunity like that!  Oh, and you should try to keep you Viking from drinking too much before bed time.  This is probably going to be difficult, but I will leave the methods for this to your fertile and mischievous imagination!So have fun with your Viking, and remember to make sure he learns to swim, keeps his boat clean, and polishes his weapons carefully!</p>

When he gets there, Satan greets him and tells him that he will be there for all eternity, but, because of the way he behaved on earth while living, he gets to choose the type of punishment he will receive.Satan escorts him around and they come to a room where Newt Gingrich is stretched out on a rack, screaming in agony as the wheel is turned. Clinton says, ""Nope, I don't think I'd like that kind of punishment."" So they go on to the next room.There was Bob Dole, tied to a long pole and suspended over a large tub of raw sewage. He is lowered into the tank until completely submerged. After a few minutes he is lifted out of the tank, gasping and fighting for breath. As soon as he gets his breath back, he's lowered again. ""uh-uh!"" says Clinton. ""That's not for me.""Finally they come to a room where Kenneth Starr is hanging from the wall by his thumbs. His pants are down around his ankles, and Monica Lewinsky is performing oral sex on him. Clinton says ""OK, if I have to be punished forever, I'll go for that way.""Satan says, ""Fine. . . that will be your punishment for the next billion years. Monica! Your replacement is here!""</p>

45227,"<p>Q:  Do I have to be married to have fax?<br /> A:  Although married people fax quite often, there are many single people who fax complete strangers every day.</p>
<p>Q:  My parents say they never had fax when they were young and were only allowed to write memos to each other until they were 21. How old do you think someone should be before they can fax?<br /> A:  Faxing can be performed at any age, once you learn the correct procedures.</p>
<p>Q:  If I fax something to myself, will I go blind?<br /> A:  Certainly not, as far as we can see.</p>
<p>Q:  There is a place on our street where you can go and pay to fax. Is this legal?<br /> A:  Yes. Many people have no other outlet for their fax drives and must pay a 'professional' when their need to fax becomes too great.</p>
<p>Q:  Should a cover always be used before faxing?<br /> A:  Unless you are really sure of the one you are faxing, a cover should be used to insure safe fax. </p>

"
45248,"<p>CHOCOLATEChocolate is God's way of reminding men how inadequate they are. I am vividly confronted with this fact every time my wife and I go out to a restaurant. When it gets to dessert, my wife usually orders the most chocolate-saturated dessert possible: It's the one called 'Unstoppable Double-Fudge Chocolate Mudslide Explosion' or some such thing.I always wonder why anyone would want to eat anything that promises a catastrophic natural disaster in your mouth.The dark brown monstrosity arrives at the table, and my wife takes the first bite. Before the fork is even removed from her mouth, a small moan escapes her lips. Her eyes, previously perfectly aligned, first cross slightly and then faze completely, pupils dilating in pure chocolate pleasure before the eyelids clamp down in ecstasy. The hand not holding the fork clenches into a fist and starts pounding the table. The silverware rattles.After about six minutes of this, she finally manages to swallow the bite, realign her eyes, and take the next shuttle back from whatever transcendental plane she's been visiting. Slowly, her sphere of consciousness expands to include me, her husband, her life-long mate, her presumed partner in all things ecstatic.'Hey, this is pretty good,' she'll say. 'You want some?'No, I don't. I want nothing to do with an object that does to my wife in one bite what I've worked for an entire relationship to achieve. It wouldn't do any good, anyway. Men just don't have the same relationship with chocolate that women do. It's not even close. I wandered around the office today and asked men - 'Chocolate. Your thoughts?' - and the result was always the same. First, a confused look as to why they're being asked about something so trivial, and then some lame, obvious statement: 'Uuh... it's brown?'Ask women the same question, and you get responses like 'The ONLY food group,' 'ESSENTIAL to life as we know it,' and the ultimate casual swipe at every member of the Y-chromosome brigade, 'Better than sex.' Ouch. Some women will try to make up for that last one by quickly adding that chocolate is supposed to be an aphrodisiac. Uh-huh. Chocolate certainly increases desire; problem is the desire is usually for more chocolate. The best a guy can do is buy a box of chocolates and hope he'll be considered somewhere between the cherry truffle and the strawberry nougat.Don't get me wrong. Guys like chocolate just fine; it's just not essential to life as we know it. Respiration is essential to life as we know it; chocolate is simply one of those nice little bonuses you get.  We won't usually pass it up if it's offered, but I don't know too many guys who would get substantially worked up if it were to suddenly disappear from the face of the earth (ironic in a way, as back in the days of the Aztecs, only men were allowed to have the stuff). When I eat a chocolate dessert, I enjoy it, yes. My world view doesn't narrow to include only the plate that it's on.Maybe we're missing something. On the other hand, we don't have to pick up our silverware from the floor after we're done with our tiramisu.Life is about trade-offs like that. All I know is that come Valentine's Day, chocolate will be among the things I offer my wife. I can't truly appreciate it, but I can truly appreciate what it does for her. Which is close enough.</p>

Why don't you try playing doctor for an hour?'...That's what I do,""  said Irving. ""Sounds great,"" Morris replied, ""but how do you make it last for an hour?""

45254,"<p>Two ship captains were sitting at the bar one night getting good and lit when one turned to the other and said, ""You know what gets me, though,  is these damn sailors! Oh sure, they're fine for the first few weeks, but on those three-month trips at sea they start getting pretty hard up. With all the whacking off going on, it's a wonder any work is getting done, and it's making a mess all over the ship. I don't know what to do!""The other captain smiles knowingly at his companion.""Oldest trick in the book. You take the crew and divide them into two teams. Then you buy about 50 barrels and put them on the ship. You tell the crew that the team that fills the most barrels wins a bag of gold.""""Well that's a great way to keep the ship clean, but then I'm out a bag of gold every trip!""""Not so,"" replied the other captain.""After you get back to port, take all the barrels together and sell them to the wax factory to make into candles. You make a tidy profit every time.""The captain pondered this and the next day, he took his friend's advice and divided the crew, bought a bunch of barrels, and set off to sea. Before long, the crew took to the new system and began filling barrel after barrel. When they finally reached port, the captain sold the barrels for a huge profit. 'This is great,' thought the captain, 'before long, I'll be able to buy a new boat!'This went on, voyage after voyage. Then one day, the ship happened back to that very first port. Coming down the gangplank, the captain was surprised to see the cops waiting for him. As they slapped the cuffs on him, the captain cried out, ""What's the meaning of this?!""""You sick bastard,"" replied the cop.""Remember all those barrels you sold to the candle factory last time you passed through town?""""Sure,"" said the captain.""What about 'em?!""""Well, they made them into candles, sold them to the convent, and now all the nuns are pregnant!""</p>

45256,"<p>A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in 9 holes before he had to head home. Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone. Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him. </p>
<p>To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green. After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, ""You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree."" With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay. The old man offered one more comment, ""Of course, when I was your age that pine tree was only 3 feet tall.""</p>

45283,"<p>As you are aware, ships have long been characterized as being<br /> female (e.g., ""Steady as she goes"" or ""She's listing to<br /> starboard, Captain!"")</p>
<p>Recently, a group of computer scientists (all males) announced<br /> that computers should also be referred to as being female. Their<br /> reasons for drawing this conclusion follow:</p>
<p>Five reasons to believe computers are female:</p>
<p>1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.</p>
<p>2. The native language they use to communicate with other<br /> computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.</p>
<p>3. The message ""Bad command or file name"" is about as<br /> informative as, ""If you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm<br /> certainly not going to tell you.""</p>
<p>4. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory<br /> for later retrieval.</p>
<p>5. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself<br /> spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.</p>
<p>However, another group of computer scientists, (all female)<br /> think that computers should be referred to as if they were male.<br /> Their reasons follow:</p>
<p>Five reasons to believe computers are male:</p>
<p>1. They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.</p>
<p>2. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the<br /> time they ARE the problem.</p>
<p>3. As soon as you commit to one you realize that, if you had<br /> waited a little longer, you could have obtained a better model.</p>

"
45284,"<p>When you're 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: ""Just because you've reached middle age, that doesn't mean you shouldn't take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it.""</p>
<p>This is the voice of Satan.</p>
<p>I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales.</p>
<p>I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. ""I'll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets"" is a typical breakfast order for me these days.</p>
<p>This is because I went snowboarding.</p>
<p>For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough.</p>
<p>These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, ""Cool.""</p>
<p>People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together.</p>
<p>We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill).</p>
<p>If anybody asks if you're OK, you say, ""I'm just catching my breath!"" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you're going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you're planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw.</p>
<p>At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance.</p>
<p>So I thought I'd take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing.</p>
<p>In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range.</p>
<p>Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can't stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you.</p>
<p>Skiers hate snowboarders. It's a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc.</p>
<p>Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd.</p>
<p>I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope.</p>
<p>Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who's going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.)</p>
<p>We learned snowboarding via a two step method:</p>
<p>STEP ONE: Watching Brad do something.</p>
<p>STEP TWO: Trying to do it ourselves.</p>
<p>I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics.</p>
<p>I'd struggle to my feet, and I'd be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot.</p>
<p>""Keep your knees bent!"" Brad would yell, helpfully.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that whatever sport you're trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if THAT would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, ""FORGET MY KNEES! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE GRAVITY CHUNKS!""</p>
<p>Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me.</p>
<p>If I hadn't gotten out of there, they'd have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding.</p>

45289,"<p>Caring for floppy disks</p>
<p>ORIGAMI<br /> Art of paper folding. In order to obtain a nice and effectiveness result, put the floppy in the disk drive after folding it several times in different directions. With a little luck, you should be able to get it jammed. Now, ask yourself. How can your disk get damaged if you can't even get it out of the drive?</p>
<p>SMOKE<br /> Use cigarettes or anything that could be burnt. When you are smoking, blow directly to your disk. In that way, you will be able to destroy it soon, and if you are lucky, damage the drive as well.</p>
<p>PIRANHAS<br /> If you don't have any at home, you can use a stapler, a clip, or simply write down on the disk label with a hard point pencil or pen. This wonderful method of ""caring"" for disks also often gives you a pretty bite-like design on the remaining pieces of the disk.</p>
<p>MAGNETS<br /> They are wonderful. You can find them in the telephone, in some paper weights, and stuck on the frige door. If you can't find any, you can leave the floppies on the printer or on your display for a while, making sure that they are on.</p>
<p>MAIL<br /> Put a disk in an envelope and don't write any warning on it; then mail it to someone, and that's all.</p>
<p>MAGIC TOUCH<br /> Touch your floppy. As much as you can. If you have marmelade or butter in your fingers, better. Your floppy will acknowledge it.</p>
<p>DON'T USE ANY ENVELOPE<br /> Archive them wihtout their envelope, piled under a lot of papers and manuals.</p>
<p>DON'T MAKE BACKUPS<br /> Of course, if you don't have any security copy, you won't have to worry about how to destroy them once you have lost the original.</p>
<p>SUPREME STUPIDITY<br /> It is the best way of destroying floppies. If you practice it regularly, you'll find new methods to add to this list.</p>

45290,"<p>This is a true story. There was a student who had not been doing<br /> very well in calculus, and he needed an extremely good grade on<br /> the finals to pass the course. The finals took place in a huge<br /> lecture hall, and there were about 1000 students taking the test<br /> at the same time. The teacher supervising the students to make<br /> sure nobody cheated was not very well liked. He had a bad<br /> temper, and he always had an annoyed expression on his face.<br /> This particular student did not do very well on tests when he<br /> was being rushed, and the mean professor was up there screaming<br /> out how much time they had left, and pacing the lecture hall<br /> like a madman, glancing at everyone's paper as he walked by.<br /> Naturally, this bothered the student, and he was doing a rather<br /> bad job on the test. </p>
<p>When the teacher screamed that time was up, he kept working. The<br /> teacher didn't bother to stop him after all of the other<br /> students had left. He just sat at the desk at the back of the<br /> lecture hall neatly stacking the test papers. Finally, an hour<br /> later, the student finished. He walked up to the desk, which had<br /> 3 piles of test papers on it, each very neatly stacked, and<br /> about 3 feet tall. The student handed the teacher his paper. The<br /> teacher said, ""Sorry, you're an hour late. You have failed both<br /> the test and the course. You must repeat it."" The student asked,<br /> ""Do you know who I am?"" To which the professor responded ""No,<br /> and I don't care either."" The student said, ""I didn't think so.""<br /> and with those words, lifted one of the stacks halfway, shoved<br /> his paper in, and dropped the rest of the stack on it, leaving<br /> it perfectly stacked as it had been before. He then walked out<br /> of the lecture hall.</p>

<p>Finally after a period of deep and intense thought, one of the men got an<br /> idea. He went to a hot dog stand, bought a hot dog, and went to a bar to begin<br /> drinking.

The man with the hot dog opened his zipper and put the wiener through<br /> the opening. He had his friend get down and start sucking on it. The bartender<br /> cursed them and made them leave.

<p>'Twas The Night Before Impeachment, when all through the House, </p>
<p>All the Congress was stirring, even Conyers, the louse. </p>
<p>The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care, </p>
<p>In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair. </p>
<p>The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds, </p>
<p>While visions of perjury danced in their heads. </p>
<p>And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap, </p>
<p>Had just settled in for a long evening's nap. </p>
<p>When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter </p>
<p>They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter. </p>
<p>When what to their wondering eyes should appear </p>
<p>But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer. </p>
<p>With a Presidential address, so lively and quick, </p>
<p>They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick! </p>
<p>More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came, </p>
<p>And he whistled and shouted and called them by name: </p>
<p>""Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let's forget about The Vixen! </p>
<p>On Barney! On Maxine! I'm no Richard Nixon!!!"" </p>
<p>""From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall, </p>
<p>Now dash away, dash away, dash away all!!!"" </p>
<p>And then the Republicans heard on the roof </p>
<p>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. </p>
<p>As they scratched their heads and were turning around </p>
<p>The resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound. </p>
<p>No longer was he eating from his humble pie, </p>
<p>While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky. </p>
<p>A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq, </p>
<p>It looked once again like Slick Willie was back. </p>
<p>His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry! </p>
<p>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry. </p>
<p>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, </p>
<p>And the hair on his head was as white as the snow. </p>
<p>The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth, </p>
<p>And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath. </p>
<p>He had a broad face and a little round belly </p>
<p>That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly. </p>
<p>He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf, </p>
<p>And the Republicans wept, in spite of themselves. </p>
<p>And a wink of his eye and a twist of his head </p>
<p>Soon gave them to know they had something to dread. </p>
<p>He spoke the right words and went straight to his work </p>
<p>Hard to believe that an Intern once called him ""The Jerk."" </p>
<p>And shaking his finger and thumbing his nose, </p>
<p>By ""Wagging The Dog,"" up the polls he rose. </p>
<p>He turned to his spinmeisters and gave them a whistle, </p>
<p>Then they cheered-on Slick Willie as he launched another missile. </p>
<p>They all heard him exclaim, with Impeachment out of sight, </p>
<p>""Happy Ramadan to all, and to all a good night.""</p>

45306,"<p>A husband and wife, out enjoying a round of golf, were<br /> about to tee off on the third hole, which was lined with<br /> beautiful homes. The wife hit her shot and the ball began<br /> to slice - her shot was headed directly at a very large<br /> plate glass window. Much to her surprise, the ball smashed<br /> through the window and shattered it into a million pieces.<br /> They felt compelled to see what damage was done and drove<br /> off to see what happened.

<p>""Oh, why yes I am. In fact, I am so grateful I will grant<br /> you two wishes, and the third I will keep for myself,"" the<br /> man replied. </p>
<p>The husband and wife agreed on two wishes - one was for a<br /> scratch handicap for the husband, to which the wife readily<br /> agreed. The other was for an income of $1,000,000 per year<br /> forever. </p>

45330,"<p>BETTER HOLD ON TO THOSE PANTIES...THEY COULD COME IN HANDY</p>
<p>A repeat offender got a life sentence for a small-time shoplifting caper in<br /> Jupiter, Florida. The man stole $49.73 worth of boxer shorts, panties, a sports<br /> bra and some cigarette lighters from a Wal-Mart store. His fatal mistake was<br /> flashing a knife at a security guard -- which turned his petty theft into a<br /> felony. Since the man had been released from prison less than three years ago,<br /> Florida's repeat offender law required the judge to send him away for life<br /> without the possibility of parole.</p>
<p>INSULT TO INJURY</p>
<p>An unemployed sanitation worker in Miami is also facing life in prison -- for<br /> shooting himself in the privates. In a drunken stupor, the man reached for a<br /> pistol he had hidden in his pants. The gun went off, and the bullet struck the<br /> man in the... nuggets. At first, he told officers someone else had shot him, but<br /> changed his story after paramedics found the shell casing in his underwear. Cops<br /> ruled the shooting accidental, but the man was charged with a concealed weapons<br /> violation and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The maximum sentence<br /> for those crimes is normally 15 years but, because the man has a record as a<br /> violent career criminal, a Miami prosecutor is asking the judge to send him away<br /> for life. The man's public defender calls that ""ridiculous,"" and says the man's<br /> injury is punishment enough.</p>
<p>HEY -- WHAT ABOUT MY ACCOMPLICE?</p>
<p>A luckless thief pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery of a convenience<br /> store in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. The thief told a passerby he was going to rob<br /> the store, gave the man a dollar, and asked him to go inside and buy a scarf to<br /> hide his identity during the crime. The bystander took the dollar, went inside<br /> the store... and called the police.</p>
<p>OOPS! OF THE WEEK</p>
<p>A thief in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina has learned a valuable lesson: if<br /> you're going to steal restaurant equipment, be sure to remove pictures of the<br /> original owner's grandchildren before setting the stuff up in your own<br /> restaurant. John Ubbing, owner of Giovanni's Pizzeria in Calabash, North<br /> Carolina, lost an assortment of pizza-making equipment in a March robbery. A<br /> refrigerator stolen in the heist later turned up inside the Myrtle Beach<br /> restaurant -- where cops found pictures of Ubbing's grandchildren still stuck to<br /> the side of it. The owner of the second restaurant was arrested.</p>
<p>I TOLDJA COMPUTERS WERE RUINING AMERICA!</p>
<p>During a high school break-in in Plymouth, North Carolina, two burglars found<br /> a camera in one of the classrooms and amused themselves by taking pictures of<br /> each other committing the crime. When they couldn't figure out how to get the<br /> film out of the camera, they concluded it wasn't loaded and left it behind. The<br /> men apparently didn't realize they'd been fooling around with a digital camera<br /> that stores pictures on a computer disk. Investigators downloaded the snapshots<br /> to a computer and got a complete photographic record of the break-in. The<br /> suspects were quickly arrested.</p>
<p>I THOUGHT THIS'D BE THE LAST PLACE THEY'D LOOK...!</p>
<p>A Nevada fugitive wanted on fraud charges was arrested in Connecticut after he<br /> blew his cover by applying for a job... as a police officer. The Connecticut<br /> cops discovered the man's fugitive status during a standard background check. He<br /> had passed both the written and agility tests before being found out. Police<br /> called the man in to headquarters under the guise of getting his fingerprints,<br /> and served him with an arrest warrant instead.</p>
<p>AND FINALLY...</p>
<p>Admitting his 0-4 records are not impressive ""on paper,"" trainers announced<br /> that Lucky, a German shepherd guide dog for the blind in Wuppertal, Germany, is<br /> available for his fifth owner. Lucky led his first owner in front of a bus,<br /> killing him. Then he led the second off the end of a pier, drowning him. He<br /> nudged his third owner off a railway platform in front of an express train,<br /> killing him. And he walked his fourth owner into heavy traffic, abandoning him<br /> to be hit and killed. The new owner won't be told of Lucky's record -- the<br /> trainers say the dog might sense nervousness ""and do something silly.""</p>

45341,"<p>Turmoil rocked Heaven this morning as allegations arose that God had had an affair with a former worshiper.</p>
<p>The scandal was begun when a 21 year old woman, known only as Mary, claimed that she had given birth to God's ""only son"" last week in a barn in the hamlet of Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Sources close to Mary claim that she ""had loved God for a long time,"" that she was constantly talking about her relationship with God, and that she was ""thrilled to have had his child.""</p>
<p>In a press conference this morning, God issued a vehement denial, saying that ""No sexual relationship existed"" and that ""the facts of this story will come out in time, verily.""</p>
<p>Independent counsel Kenneth Beazulbub immediately filed a brief with the Justice department to expand his investigation to cover questions of whether any commandments may have been broken, and whether God had illegally funneled laundered money to his illegitimate child through three foreign operatives identified only as the ""Wise Men"".</p>
<p>Beazulbub has issued subpoenas to several angels who are rumored to have acted as go-betweens in the affair.</p>
<p>Critics have pointed out that these allegations have little to do with the charges that Beazulbub was originally appointed to investigate, that God had created large-scale flooding in order to cover up evidence of a failed land deal.</p>
<p>In recent months, Beazulbub's investigation has already been expanded to cover questions surrounding the large number of locusts that plagued God's political opponents in the last election, as well as to claims that the giveaway of a parcel of public land in Promised County to a Jewish special interest group was quid pro quo for political contributions.</p>
<p>Some journalists have speculated that the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gommorah may have been to divert attention away from God's political problems. If these allegations prove to be true, this could be a huge blow to God's career, much of which has been spent crusading for stricter moral standards and harsher punishments for wrongdoers.</p>
<p>Known for his fiery oratory, God has sometimes been criticized for his political theatrics, as when he introduced the bill he styled ""The Ten Commandments"" by appearing as a burning bush on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, however, it is unlikely that a sitting God can be removed from power. Most legal scholars are in agreement that indicting God would constitute taking His name in vain.</p>

45346,"<p>EARTHQUAKE ROCKS PORT ADELAIDE:</p>
<p>A major earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter Scale hit in the early hours of yesterday morning, with the epicentre in Port Adelaide, SA. </p>
<p>The earthquake decimated the area causing approximately $30 worth of damage.</p>
<p>Several priceless collections of mementos from the Torana Appreciation Society and the Port Adelaide Progress Hall were damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>Three areas of historic burnt out cars were disturbed.</p>
<p>Many locals were woken well before their welfare cheques arrived. one resident - Tracy Sharon Smith, a 15-year-old mother of 5 said ""It was such a shock, my little Chardonnay Mercedes came running into my bedroom crying. </p>
<p>My youngest two, Tyler-Morgan and Megan-Storm slept through it all. I was still shaking when I was watching Jerry Springer the next morning"".</p>
<p>Apparently though, looting, muggings and car crime carried on as normal.</p>
<p>The Red Cross has so far managed to ship 4,000 crates of Vegemite and 70,000 bottles of Home Brew to the area to help the stricken locals. </p>

<p>HOW YOU CAN HELP</p>
<p>This appeal is to raise money for food and clothing, parcels for those unfortunate to be caught up in this disaster. Clothing is most sought after.</p>
<p>Items most needed include: baseball caps, flannelette shirts, thongs and tracksuits.</p>
<p>Food parcels may be harder to come by, but are needed all the same.</p>
<p>Required foodstuffs include, Yiros' , McDonalds, KFC, ice cream and cans of Woodstock Bourbon or Bacardi Breezers.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to donate money, 25c buys a biro for filling in<br /> compensation forms; $5.00 buys chips, battered fish, crisps and fizzy drinks for a family of 9; $10.00 will pay for a packet of Winfield Blues and a lighter to calm the nerves of those affected.</p>

That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick, they would<br /> press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints.<br /> Finally the principal decided that something had to be done. She called all of<br /> the girls to the restroom and met them there with the maintenance man.<br /> She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the<br /> custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night. To demonstrate how!<br /> difficult it was to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance guy to clean<br /> one of them. He took a long handled squeegee, dipped it into the toilet and then<br /> cleaned the mirror.<br /> Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirrors.</p>

<p>2. I worked with an individual who plugged their power strip<br /> back into itself and for the life of them could not understand<br /> why their computer would not turn on.</p>

<p>3. I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping beside her<br /> car. ""Do you need some help?"" I asked. She replied, ""I knew I<br /> should have replaced the battery in this remote door unlocker.<br /> Now I can't get into my car. Do you think that convenience store<br /> would have a battery for it?"" ""Hmmm, I dunno, but let me see<br /> your keyring for a second."" As I took the key and manually<br /> unlocked the door, I replied, ""Why don't you drive over there<br /> and check about the batteries...it's a long walk."" </p>

<p>5. Several years ago we had an intern who was none too swift.<br /> One day he was typing and turned to a secretary and said, ""I'm<br /> almost out of typing paper. What do I do?"" ""Just use copier<br /> machine paper,"" she told him. With that, the intern took his<br /> last remaining blank piece of paper, put it on the photocopier<br /> and proceeded to make five blank copies.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>6. One of our servers crashed. I was watching our new system<br /> administrator trying to restore it. He inserted a CD and needed<br /> to type a path name to a directory named ""i386."" He started to<br /> type it and paused, asking me, ""Where's the key for that line<br /> thingy?, you know, the one that looks like an upside down<br /> exclamation mark."" I replied, ""You mean the letter ""i?"" ...and<br /> he said, ""Yeah, that's it!"" </p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>7. I was in a car dealership a while ago when a large new motor<br /> home was towed into the garage. The front of the vehicle was in<br /> dire need of repair and the whole thing generally looked like an<br /> extra in ""Twister."" I asked the manager what had happened. He<br /> told me that the driver had set the cruise control, and had then<br /> gone back to make himself a sandwich.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>8. When my husband and I arrived at an automobile dealership to<br /> pick up our car, we were told that the keys had been<br /> accidentally locked in it. We went to the service department and<br /> found a mechanic working feverishly to unlock the driver's side<br /> door. I instinctively tried the door handle on the passenger's<br /> side and discovered it was open. ""Hey,"" I announced to the<br /> technician, ""It's open!"" ""I know,"" answered the young man. ""I<br /> already got that side...I'll have the driver's door open in just<br /> another couple of minutes."" </p>

He asked, ""Does it hurt you?""She said that it didn't. The doctor then told her, ""Well, then, there's no reason that you shouldn't practice anal sex, if that's what you like, so long as you take care not to get pregnant.""The woman was mystified. She asked ""You can get pregnant from anal sex?""The doctor replied, ""Of course. Where do you think lawyers come from?""</p>

<p>1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic. </p>
<p>2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else. </p>

45411,"<p>A lady went into a store and told the clerk that she wanted to<br /> return a blender for refund because it didn't work.

<p>The clerk didn't know what to do, so he called the store manager<br /> who asked her if he can help. She explained that she wanted to<br /> return the broken blender for refund. He told her that he would<br /> not give her a refund because she bought the toaster on special.<br /> Once again she screams: ""Grab my tits! Ohhh, grab my tits!"" </p>
<p>The manager was taken aback and asked her why she was yelling<br /> that particular phrase. She replied, ""Because I like my tits<br /> grabbed when I'm getting screwed up the ass!""</p>
"
45412,"<p>In my own words: ""I was flying from SFO to PDX on Friday, and the flight attendant reading the flight safety information had the whole plane looking at each other like 'what the heck?' (Getting PDX people to look at each other is an accomplishment.)  So once we got airborne, I took out my laptop and typed up what she said so I wouldn't forget.  I've left out a few parts I'm sure, but this is most of it.""</p>
<p>Before takeoff...<br /> ""Hello, and welcome to Alaska Flight 438 to Portland.  If you're going to Portland, you're in the right place.  If you're not going to Portland, you're about to have a really long evening.""</p>
<p>""We'd like to tell you now about some important safety features of this aircraft.  The most important safety feature we have aboard this plane is...The Flight Attendants.  Please look at one now.""</p>
<p>""There are 5 exits aboard this plane: 2 at the front, 2 over the wings, and one out the plane's rear end.  If you're seated in one of the exit rows, please do not store your bags by your feet.  That would be a really bad idea.  Please take a moment and look around and find the nearest exit.  Count the rows of seats between you and the exit.  In the event that the need arises to find one, trust me, you'll be glad you did.</p>
<p>We have pretty blinking lights on the floor that will blink in the direction of the exits.  White ones along the normal rows, and pretty red ones at the exit rows.""</p>
<p>""In the event of a loss of cabin pressure these baggy things will drop down over your head.  You stick it over your nose and mouth like the flight attendant is doing now.  The bag won't inflate, but there's oxygen there, promise.  If you are sitting next to a small child, or someone who is acting like a small child, please do us all a favor and put on your mask first.  If you are traveling with two or more children, please take a moment now to decide which one is your favorite.  Help that one first, and then work your way down.""</p>
<p>""In the seat pocket in front of you is a pamphlet about the safety features of this plane.  I usually use it as a fan when I'm having my own personal summer.  It makes a very good fan.  It also has pretty pictures.  Please take it out and play with it now.""</p>
<p>""Please take a moment now to make sure your seat belts are fastened low and tight about your waist.  To fasten the belt, insert the metal tab into the buckle.  To release, it's a pulley thing -- not a pushy thing like your car because you're in an airplane -- HELLOOO!!""</p>
<p>""There is no smoking in the cabin on this flight.  There is also no smoking in the lavatories.  If we see smoke coming from the lavatories, we will assume you are on fire and put you out.  This is a free service we provide.  There are two smoking sections on this flight, one outside each wing exit.</p>
<p> We do have a movie in the smoking sections tonight...hold on, let me check what it is...Oh here it is; the movie tonight is 'Gone with the Wind.' ""</p>
<p>""In a moment we will be turning off the cabin lights, and it's going to get really dark, really fast.  If you're afraid of the dark, now would be a good time to reach up and press the yellow button.  The yellow button turns on your reading light.  Please don't press the orange button unless you absolutely have to.<br /> The orange button is your seat ejection button.""</p>
<p>""We're glad to have you with us on board this flight.  Thank you for choosing Alaska Air, and giving us your business and your money.  If there's anything we can do to make you more comfortable, please don't hesitate to ask.""</p>
<p>""If you all weren't strapped down you would have given me!  a standing ovation, wouldn't you?""</p>
<p>After landing...<br /> ""Welcome to the Portland International Airport.  Sorry about the bumpy landing.  It's not the captain's fault.  It's not the copilot's fault.  It's the asphalt.""</p>
<p>""Please remain seated until the plane is parked at the gate.  At no time in history has a passenger beaten a plane to the gate.  So please don't even try.  Please be careful opening the overhead bins because 'shift happens'.""</p>

45419,"<p>Are you considering having children? To determine whether you are truly<br /> prepared for the experience, we suggest you take this set of simple tests...<br /> MESS TEST: </p>
<p>Smear peanut butter on the sofa and curtains. Now rub your hands in the wet<br /> flowerbed and rub on the walls. Cover the stains with crayons. Place a fish<br /> stick behind the couch and leave it there all summer. </p>
<p>TOY TEST: </p>
<p>Obtain a 55-gallon box of Legos. (If Legos are not available, you may<br /> substitute roofing tacks or broken bottles.) Have a friend spread them all over<br /> the house. Put on a blindfold. Try to walk to the bathroom or kitchen. Do not<br /> scream (this could wake a child at night). </p>
<p>GROCERY STORE TEST: </p>
<p>Borrow one or two small animals (goats are best) and take them with you as you<br /> shop at the grocery store. Always keep them in sight and pay for anything they<br /> eat or damage. </p>
<p>DRESSING TEST: </p>
<p>Obtain one large, unhappy, live octopus. Stuff into a small net bag making<br /> sure that all arms stay inside. </p>
<p>FEEDING TEST: </p>
<p>Obtain a large plastic milk jug. Fill halfway with water. Suspend from the<br /> ceiling with a stout cord. Start the jug swinging. Try to insert spoonfuls of<br /> soggy cereal (such as Fruit Loops or Cheerios) into the mouth of the jug while<br /> pretending to be an airplane. Now dump the contents of the jug on the floor. </p>
<p>NIGHT TEST: </p>
<p>Prepare by obtaining a small cloth bag and fill it with 8 to 12 pounds of<br /> sand. Soak it thoroughly in water. At 8:00 PM begin to waltz and hum with the<br /> bag until 9:00 PM. Lay down your bag and set your alarm for 10:00 PM. Get up,<br /> pick up your bag, and sing every song you have ever heard. Make up about a dozen<br /> more and sing these too until 4:00 AM. Set alarm for 5:00 AM. Get up and make<br /> breakfast. Keep this up for five years. Look cheerful. </p>
<p>PHYSICAL TEST (WOMEN) </p>
<p>Obtain a large beanbag chair and attach it to the front of your clothes. Leave<br /> it there for 9 months. Now remove 10% of the beans. </p>
<p>PHYSICAL TEST (MEN): </p>
<p>Go to the nearest drug store. Set your wallet on the counter. Ask the clerk to<br /> help himself. Now proceed to the nearest food store. Go to the head office and<br /> arrange for your paycheck to be directly deposited to the store. Purchase a<br /> newspaper. Go home and read it quietly for the last time. </p>
<p>FINAL ASSIGNMENT: </p>
<p>Find a couple that already have a small child. Lecture them on how they can<br /> improve their discipline, patience, tolerance, toilet training, and child's<br /> table manners. Suggest many ways they can improve. Emphasize to them that they<br /> should never allow their children to run riot. Enjoy this experience. It will be<br /> the last time you will have all the answers.</p>

45443,"<p>The turmoil of the delivery room changed into silence and bewilderment as the newborn emerged from its mother. The doctor had no previous knowledge or historical case studies to aid him in diagnosing the situation at hand, as he stared at the new born boy, dumb-founded. The boy was born without eyelids!</p>
<p>Time was critical. The doctor assembled the top residents in the hospital to determine a course of action, for the baby's sight was truly in peril. A decision was made. The boy would have his penis circumcised and the foreskin removed from his penis would be surgically reconstructed into eyelids. After ten hours in the operating room the doctors emerged. </p>
<p>By this time the word of the baby boy born without eyelids had spread throughout the city. News reporters and all concerned gathered around the doctors, anticipating the outcome of the surgery. The doctors collectively agreed the operation was a success and a monumental achievement in reconstructive surgery. The crowd cheered and embraced one another. Reporters scribbled down notes and took pictures. </p>
<p>Suddenly, from the back of the crowd a question emerged: Will there be any long-term side affects of this operation? The pandemonium of the jubilant crowd subsided. The silence was nervously painstaking as the doctors stared at each other. The doctors' heads nodded in unison and one doctor came forth. Yes, replied the Doctor, there will be one side affect. The boy's a little Cock-eyed!</p>

""I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again.

45493,"<p>A team of archaeologists were excavating in Israel when they came upon a cave. Written on the wall of the cave were the following symbols in order of appearance. </p>

<p>2. A donkey </p>
<p>3. A shovel </p>
<p>4. A fish </p>
<p>5. A Star of David </p>
<p>They decided that this was a unique find and the writings were at Least more than three thousand years old. They chopped out the piece of stone and had it brought to the museum where archaeologists from all over the world came to study the ancient symbols. They held a huge meeting after months of conferences to discuss what they could agree was the meaning of the markings. </p>
<p>The President of their Society stood up and pointed at the first drawing and said, ""This looks like a dog. We can judge that this was a highly intelligent race as they knew how to have animals for companionship. To prove this statement you can see that the next symbol resembles a donkey, so, they were even smart enough to have animals help them till the soil. The next drawing looks like a shovel of some sort, which means they even had tools to help them. Even further proof of their high intelligence is the fish which means that that they had a famine that hit the earth whereby the food didn't grow, they would take to the sea for food. The last symbol appears to be the Star of David which means they were evidently Hebrews."" </p>
<p>The audience applauded enthusiastically and the President smiled and said, ""I'm glad to see that you are all in full agreement with our interpretations."" </p>

45494,"<p>�Lo que hacemos por ser Ingenieros de Sistemas!</p>
<p>1. Cuando el ingeniero de sistemas le diga que acude en su ayuda, descon�ctese de la red y vaya por un caf�. No nos espere, para nosotros no es ning�n problema acordarnos de todos las claves de usuario.</p>
<p>2. Cuando nos llame para decirnos que cambiemos su computador de sitio, aseg�rese de que lo deja bien enterrado bajo media de tonelada de postales, fotos de sus ni�os, animales de toda clase, flores secas, trofeos varios, etc. A nosotros, como no tenemos vida privada, nos encanta echar un vistazo a la suya.</p>
<p>3. Cuando el ingeniero de sistemas le env�e un correo electr�nico de importancia alta, b�rrelo inmediatamente sin leer: Lo m�s probable es que estemos haciendo pruebas.</p>
<p>4. Cuando el ingeniero de sistemas est� almorzando, entre sin ninguna consideraci�n y expl�quele sus problemas esperando a que se le responda en el acto. Estamos aqu� para servirle y siempre a punto para solucionar problemas.</p>
<p>5. Cuando el ingeniero de sistemas est� tomando un caf� tranquilamente, preg�ntele algo acerca de los computadores. La �nica raz�n por la que nos vamos a tomar caf�, es para atender a las personas que no tienen correo electr�nico o tel�fono.</p>
<p>6. Mande todos sus mensajes en may�sculas. El servidor de correo lo recoger� inmediatamente y lo tratar� como mensaje urgente.</p>
<p>7. Cuando llame al tel�fono del ingeniero de sistemas, pulse el n�mero 5 para saltarse el mensaje que le dice que est� de vacaciones y grabe su mensaje. Entonces, espere exactamente 24 horas antes de mandar un correo electr�nico directamente a su jefe quej�ndose de que no ha recibido ninguna respuesta a su llamada. Usted no se merece este trato.</p>
<p>8. Cuando la fotocopiadora no funcione, llame al ingeniero de sistemas. Al fin, la fotocopiadora tiene cable, �no?</p>
<p>9. Cuando su m�dem le d� el mensaje: 'No hay tono de marcado', en casa, llame al ingeniero de sistemas. Podemos solucionar problemas de tel�fono desde donde sea.</p>
<p>10. Cuando su computador no funcione, t�relo encima de la silla del ingeniero de sistemas y no deje ning�n papel con su nombre ni la descripci�n del problema. Nos encanta el misterio.</p>
<p>11. Cuando el ingeniero de sistemas le est� explicando como cambiar alg�n par�metro de su configuraci�n, p�ngase a leer el peri�dico. De hecho, no esperamos que usted tenga que hacer nada, simplemente nos encanta o�rnos a nosotros mismos cuando explicamos algo.</p>
<p>12. Cuando le demos alguna explicaci�n sobre alg�n programa, no se moleste en aprender. Siempre estaremos ah� para volver a hacerlo.</p>
<p>13. Cuando la impresora no imprima, reenv�e su trabajo al menos 20 veces. A veces los trabajos que intenta imprimir desaparecen en el Cosmos sin raz�n aparente.</p>
<p>14. Cuando la impresora no imprima tras los 20 intentos, env�e su trabajo a todas las dem�s impresoras de la empresa. Seguro que alguna imprimir�.</p>
<p>15. No use la ayuda que viene en los programas. Estas ayudas on-line s�lo son para brutos.</p>
<p>16. Cuando vaya a tomar alg�n cursillo de inform�tica, no dude en practicar con la red de la empresa e instalar y probar todo lo que desee. Estaremos encantados de trabajar hasta la madrugada para arreglar todos los estragos que usted cause.</p>
<p>17. Cuando lleguemos a reparar su computador y est� usted comiendo, deguste con calma su almuerzo en nuestra cara. Funcionamos mejor bajo presi�n.</p>
<p>18. Nunca nos d� las gracias. Nos encanta nuestro trabajo y, adem�s, �nos pagan!</p>
<p>19. Cuando el ingeniero de sistemas le pregunte si ha instalado alg�n nuevo programa en su computador, mienta. �A nadie le importa lo que usted tiene en su PC!</p>
<p>20. Si el cable de su rat�n siempre tira el gatito de porcelana que tiene usted encima de la mesa, levante el computador y pise el cable con �l. Los cables de rat�n est�n dise�ados para aguantar 80 kilos de peso.</p>
<p>21. Si la tecla {Enter} de su teclado no funciona, �chele la culpa a la actualizaci�n del correo electr�nico. Adem�s, los teclados funcionan mucho mejor con medio kilito de migas de galleta, cabellos y manchas secas de Coca Cola debajo de las teclas.</p>
<p>22. Cuando el sistema le muestre la t�pica ventana de 'Est� usted seguro...', conteste siempre que 'S�' o 'Aceptar'. �Si no estuviera usted seguro no lo habr�a hecho, verdad?</p>
<p>23. Si�ntase completamente libre para decir 'No tengo ni idea acerca de esta mierda de inform�tica'. A nosotros nunca nos ha molestado que la gente diga que nuestra profesi�n es una mierda.</p>
<p>24. Cuando necesite cambiar el cartucho de t�ner, llame al ingeniero de sistemas. El cambio de cartucho es una tarea extremadamente complicada y Epson recomienda que solamente la realice un ingeniero con una maestr�a en hardware.</p>
<p>25. Cuando le suceda algo a su computador, pida a su secretaria (si la tiene) que nos llame. A los que trabajamos en un Help Desk nos encanta tener que tratar con una tercera persona que no tiene ni idea de cu�l es su problema.</p>
<p>26. Cuando escan�e la foto de su �ltima parranda, de 30 megas, a tope de colores y resoluci�n, envi�la a todo el mundo a trav�s de su correo electr�nico y, por supuesto, indique alta prioridad. Tenemos montooooones de megas libres en el servidor y un procesador del carajo.</p>
<p>27. Cuando tenga que imprimir tropocientos mil folios, no se le ocurra ir imprimiendo de poco en poco: �m�ndelos todos de una vez! Los dem�s pueden esperar, usted tiene prioridad.</p>
<p>28. Cuando se encuentre por casualidad a su ingeniero de sistemas durante el fin de semana, no dude en hacerle preguntas acerca de computadores. Nosotros trabajamos 24 horas al d�a, 7 d�as a la semana, incluida la playa en verano, la nieve en invierno, supermercados, cines, etc.</p>
<p>29. Si sus hijos estudian inform�tica, tr�igalos el fin de semana a la oficina. Ah� estaremos para prestarles cualquier equipo, reparar su base de datos de Access hecha trizas por su copia ilegal de Visual Basic, etc.</p>
<p>30. Cuando nos traiga su computador cl�nico de casa para que se lo reparemos gratis, por favor recu�rdenos que es urgente para que por la tarde pueda usted jugar al solitario. �Ah� estaremos!<br /> Nos sobra tanto tiempo, y el d�a es tan largo. De todas formas, �todo el mundo sabe que perdemos constantemente el tiempo navegando por Internet!</p>
<p>31. Cuando necesite la ayuda del ingeniero de sistemas para hacer una presentaci�n, no se afane, puede pasarla unas pocas horas antes. �Acaso no sabe que podemos hacer milagros?</p>
<p>Ah, �y disc�lpennos por ser ingenieros de sistemas!</p>

<p>The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the<br /> man had consumed the cigars in a normal fashion.  The man sued...  and<br /> won!</p>
<p>In delivering his ruling, the judge stated that since the man held a policy<br /> from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable,<br /> and also guaranteed that it would insure the cigars against fire, without<br /> defining what it considered to be ""unacceptable fire,"" it was obligated to<br /> compensate the insured for his loss.</p>
<p>Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance<br /> company accepted the judge's ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare<br /> cigars he lost in ""the fires.""</p>
<p>After the man cashed his cheque however, the insurance company had him<br /> arrested...  on 24 counts of arson !  With his own insurance claim and<br /> testimony from the previous case being used against him, the man was<br /> convicted of intentionally burning the rare cigars and sentenced to 24<br /> consecutive one year terms...</p>

<p>If you've got melted chocolate all over your hands, you're eating it too slowly.</p>
<p>Chocolate covered raisins, cherries, orange slices &amp; strawberries all count as fruit, so eat as many as you want.</p>
<p>The problem:  How to get 2 pounds of chocolate home from the store in hot car.  The solution:  Eat it in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Diet tip:  Eat a chocolate bar before each meal.  It'll take the edge off your appetite and you'll eat less.</p>
<p>A nice box of chocolates can provide your total daily intake of calories in one place.  Isn't that handy?</p>
<p>If you can't eat all your chocolate, it will keep in the freezer. But if you can't eat all your chocolate, what is  wrong with you?</p>
<p>If calories are an issue, store your chocolate on top of the fridge.  Calories are afraid of heights, and they will jump out of the chocolate to protect themselves.</p>
<p>If I eat equal amounts of dark chocolate and white chocolate, is that a balanced diet?</p>
<p>Money talks.  Chocolate sings.</p>
<p>Chocolate has many preservatives.  Preservatives make you look younger.</p>
<p>Q.  Why is there no such organization as Chocoholics Anonymous? A.  Because no one wants to quit.</p>
<p>If not for chocolate, there would be no need for control top pantyhose.  An entire garment industry would be devastated.</p>
<p>Put ""eat chocolate"" at the top of your list of things to do today. That way, at least you'll get one thing done.</p>

<p>How to live in a world that's politically correct?</p>
<p>His workers no longer would answer to ""Elves,""</p>
<p>""Vertically Challenged"" they were calling themselves.</p>
<p>And labor conditions at the North Pole</p>
<p>Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.</p>
<p>Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,</p>
<p>Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.</p>
<p>And equal employment had made it quite clear</p>
<p>That Santa had better not use just reindeer.</p>
<p>So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,</p>
<p>Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!</p>
<p>The runners had been removed from his sleigh;</p>
<p>The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.</p>
<p>And people had started to call for the cops</p>
<p>When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.</p>
<p>Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite</p>
<p>frightened. His fur trimmed red suit was called</p>
<p>""Unenlightened.""</p>
<p>And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,</p>
<p>Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose And had</p>
<p>gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation, Demanding millions</p>
<p>in over-due compensation.</p>
<p>So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,</p>
<p>Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,</p>
<p>Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,</p>
<p>Demanding from now on her title was Ms.</p>
<p>And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion</p>
<p>That making a choice could cause so much commotion.</p>
<p>Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,</p>
<p>Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.</p>
<p>Nothing that might be construed to pollute.</p>
<p>Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.</p>
<p>Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.</p>
<p>Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.</p>
<p>Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.</p>
<p>Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.</p>
<p>No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.</p>
<p>Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.</p>
<p>And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,</p>
<p>Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.</p>
<p>For they raised the hackles of those psychological</p>
<p>Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.</p>
<p>No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;</p>
<p>Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.</p>
<p>Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;</p>
<p>And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.</p>
<p>So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed;</p>
<p>He just could not figure out what to do next.</p>
<p>He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,</p>
<p>But you've got to be careful with that word today.</p>
<p>His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;</p>
<p>Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.</p>
<p>Something special was needed, a gift that he might</p>
<p>Give to all without angering left or the right.</p>
<p>A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,</p>
<p>Each group of people, every religion;</p>
<p>Every ethnicity, every differing hue,</p>
<p>Everyone, everywhere...why even you.</p>
<p>So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...</p>
<p>""May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on Earth.""</p>
<p>(If that fits your plans and national agenda...)</p>

45520,"<p>REDMOND, WA--In what CEO Bill Gates called'an unfortunate but necessary step to protect our intellectual property from theft and exploitation by competitors,' the Microsoft Corporation patented the numbers one and zero Monday.With the patent, Microsoft's rivals are prohibited from manufacturing or selling products containing zeroes and ones--the mathematical building blocks of all computer languages and programs--unless a royalty fee of 10 cents per digit used is paid to the software giant.'Microsoft has been using the binary system of ones and zeroes ever since its inception in 1975,' Gates told reporters. 'For years, in the  interest of the overall health of the computer industry, we permitted the  free and unfettered use of our proprietary numeric systems. However,  changing marketplace conditions and the increasingly predatory practices of  certain competitors now leave us with no choice but to seek compensation for  the use of our numerals.'A number of major Silicon Valley players, including Apple Computer, Netscape and Sun Microsystems, said they will challenge the Microsoft patent  as monopolistic and anti-competitive, claiming that the 10-cent-per-digit  licensing fee would bankrupt them instantly.'While, technically, Java is a complex system of algorithms used to create a platform-independent programming environment, it is, at its core,  just a string of trillions of ones and zeroes,' said Sun Microsystems CEO  Scott McNealy, whose company created the Java programming environment used  in many Internet applications. 'The licensing fees we'd have to pay  Microsoft every day would be approximately 327,000 times the total net worth  of this company.''If this patent holds up in federal court, Apple will have no choice but to convert to analog,' said Apple interim CEO Steve Jobs, 'and I have  serious doubts whether this company would be able to remain competitive  selling pedal-operated computers running software off vinyl LPs.'As a result of the Microsoft patent, many other companies have begun radically revising their product lines: Database manufacturer Oracle has  embarked on a crash program to develop 'an abacus for the next millennium.'  Novell, whose communications and networking systems are also subject to  Microsoft licensing fees, is working with top animal trainers on a  chimpanzee-based message-transmission system. Hewlett-Packard is developing  a revolutionary new steam-powered printer.Despite the swarm of protest, Gates is standing his ground, maintaining that ones and zeroes are the undisputed property of Microsoft.       'We will vigorously enforce our patents of these numbers, as they are  legally ours,' Gates said. 'Among Microsoft's vast historical archives are Sanskrit cuneiform tablets from 1800 B.C. clearly showing ones and a symbol known as 'sunya,' or nothing.  'We also own: papyrus scrolls written by Pythagoras himself in which he  explains the idea of singular notation, or 'one'; early tracts by Mohammed  ibn Musa al Kwarizimi explaining the concept of al-sifr, or 'the cipher';  original mathematical manuscripts by Heisenberg, Einstein and Planck; and a  signed first-edition copy of Jean-Paul Sartre's Being And Nothingness.  Should the need arise, Microsoft will have no difficulty proving to the  Justice Department or anyone else that we own the rights to these numbers.'Added Gates: 'My salary also has lots of zeroes. I'm the richest man in the world.'According to experts, the full ramifications of Microsoft's patenting of one and zero have yet to be realized.'Because all integers and natural numbers derive from one and zero, Microsoft may, by extension, lay claim to ownership of all mathematics and  logic systems, including Euclidean geometry, pulleys and levers, gravity,  and the basic Newtonian principles of motion, as well as the concepts of  existence and nonexistence,' Yale University theoretical mathematics  professor J. Edmund Lattimore said. 'In other words, pretty much  everything.'Lattimore said that the only mathematical constructs of which Microsoft may not be able to claim ownership are infinity and transcendental  numbers like pi. Microsoft lawyers are expected to file liens on infinity  and pi this week.Microsoft has not yet announced whether it will charge a user fee to individuals who wish to engage in such mathematically rooted motions as  walking, stretching and smiling.In an address beamed live to billions of people around the globe Monday, Gates expressed confidence that his company's latest move will,  ultimately, benefit all humankind.'Think of this as a partnership,' Gates said. 'Like the ones and zeroes of the binary code itself, we must all work together to make the  promise of the computer revolution a reality. As the world's richest, most  powerful software company, Microsoft is number one. And you, the millions of  consumers who use our products, are the zeroes.'</p>

45526,"<p>Two new chemical elements have recently been discovered.<br /> Here for the first time is a description of their properties.</p>
<p>Element Name: WOMAN<br /> Symbol:  WO<br /> Atomic Weight: (don't even go there!)</p>
<p>Physical Properties:  Generally round in form. Boils at nothing and may freeze any time. Melts whenever treated properly. Very bitter if not used well.</p>
<p>Chemical properties:  Very active. Highly unstable. Possesses Strong affinity to gold, silver, platinum, and precious stones. Violent when left alone. Able to absorb great amounts of exotic food. Turns slightly green when placed next to a better specimen.</p>
<p>Usage:  Highly ornamental. An extremely good catalyst for dispersion of wealth. Probably the most powerful income reducing agent known.</p>
<p>Caution: Highly explosive in inexperienced hands.<br /> -------------------------------</p>
<p>Element Name:  MAN<br /> Symbol:  XY<br /> Atomic Weight: (180 +/- 50)</p>
<p>Physical properties:  Solid at room temperature, but gets bent out of shape easily. Fairly dense and sometimes flaky. Difficult to find a pure sample. Due to rust, aging samples are unable to conduct electricity as easily as young samples.</p>
<p>Chemical properties:  Attempts to bond with WO any chance it can get. Also tends to form strong bonds with itself.  Becomes explosive when mixed with Kd (Element: Child) for prolonged period of time. Neutralize by saturating with alcohol.</p>
<p>Usage: None known. Possibly good methane source. Good samples are able to produce large quantities on command.</p>
<p>Caution: In the absence of WO, this element rapidly decomposes and begins to smell.</p>

I'm with you, Mexican, if I get one<br /> more lunch of Creamed Corn and Hash, I will jump off this<br /> building right with you!""<br />      All the while the blonde is just sitting there eating his<br /> sandwhich.  Feeling left out, he says ""I get a sandwhich every<br /> single day too! I hate it too!! I am with you both! Tomorrow if<br /> we all get the same lunch, we are jumping off this building!!""</p>
<p>     The next day, they are all working patiently, just waiting<br /> to see what they got for lunch.  The day seemed to go on<br /> forever, but finally lunch came.  The Mexican guy opens up his<br /> lunch.  He finds a taco!! He gives a sigh and jumps off the<br /> building.<br />      The Irishman is very scared.  He does not want to jump off,<br /> but he  has to.  So he cautiosly opens up his lunch. And what do<br /> you know? He has creamed corn and hash!  He says good-bye to the<br /> blonde man and jumps off screaming.<br />      The blonde, being lonely, opens up his lunch and he finds a<br /> sandwhich.  He just shakes his head and jumps.</p>
<p>     At the funeral, the wives of all three men are standing<br /> around mourning together.  The Mexican's wife says ""If only I<br /> didn't give him taco's everyday, he may have still been alive<br /> today""<br />      The Irishman's wife shakes her  head in agreement, saying<br /> ""I take full responsibility in my husbands death""<br />      They both look over at the blonde man's wife who is not<br /> crying and ask her why she is not mourning.  She replies ""Don't<br /> blame me, he made his own lunch!""</p>

45543,"<p>In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com, did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot. And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg.<br /> Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com.</p>
<p>She said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why doth thou travel far from town to town with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?"" And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, Dear?""</p>
<p>And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).""</p>
<p>Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. The drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy.</p>
<p>A man named Maccabia did secret himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short.</p>
<p>And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would work only with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks.</p>
<p>Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."" And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known ""eBay"" he said, ""we need a name that reflects what we are,"" and Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.""</p>
<p>""YAHOO"", said Abraham. And that is how it all began, It wasn't Al Gore after all.</p>

45550,"<p>Dear Dr. Dover:I wish to apply for an operation to make me sterile. My reasons are numerous. After being married for seven years and having had 7 children, I have come to the conclusion that contraceptives are useless.After getting married I was advised to use the rhythm method. Despite trying the Tango and the Samba, my wife fell pregnant and I ruptured myself doing the Cha-Cha. Apart from that, where do you find a band when you get the urge at two o'clock in the morning?A doctor suggested the safe period. At the time, we were living with the in-laws and we had to wait 3 weeks for the safe period, when the house was empty. Needless to say this didn't work, and the wife got pregnant.A lady of several years' experience said if we made love while breast feeding we would be all right. Well, I finished up with clear skin, Silky Hair and was very healthy... but the wife got pregnant yet again.Another tale we heard was if the wife jumped up and down after intercourse this would prevent pregnancy. She slipped a disk but still got pregnant again.I asked the chemist about the condoms and he demonstrated them, so I bought a packet. My wife fell pregnant again, which did not surprise me as I never did believe how stretching one of those things over your thumb could prevent babies. We tried the coil next but that didn't work. It had a left-hand screw and my wife is definitely a right-hand screw.The Dutch cap was next and seemed to be our answer, but my wife got severe headaches when the only size available was too tight across the forehead.Eventually we tried the Pill, but it kept dropping out, so she tried it between her knees and I couldn't get anywhere near her.You must appreciate my problems. If I can't have the operation I will have to resort to oral sex, and I can't believe that talking about it is any substitute for the real thing.Yours sincerely,Bubba Brickhead</p>

<p>""But honey,"" his lover says. ""The store closes in two minutes. You'll never have time to get to the store, and get dressed.""</p>
<p>""That's okay,"" He quips. ""I'll just run down there naked, and if anyone sees me, I'll pretend I'm a statue.""</p>
<p>So the young man ran down to the store, got two packs of cigarettes (this store was obviously in a heavy nudist area or something), and starts to run back. The car is in sight, and he has a few more yards to go, when all of the sudden three nuns round the corner. He panics, and freezes like a statue, his beloved cigarettes in one hand.</p>
<p>The first nun walks over to the young man. ""Oh! What a beautiful cigarette dispenser!"" She exclaimed. She sticks a quarter up his ass, pulls on his dong, and he drops a pack of cigarettes in utter disbelief.</p>
<p>The second nun strolls over. ""What an interesting cigarette dispenser! I must try it, too."" She sticks a quarter up the young man's ass, chokes his chicken, and he drops the other pack of cigarettes.</p>
<p>The third nun was the unimpressed sort. She strode up, stuck a quarter up the young man's ass, and yanked his monkey. Nothing happened. She pulled on his Element of Adam again. Nothing happened. She tried third time, and her eyes widened with sudden realization and surprise.</p>

He went into a butcher's shop and bought a single sausage,which he stuck in Joe's fly. They then went to a nearby bar.""Two beers,"" said Bruce to the barman. They downed the beers as fast as they could and the barman waited for the money. All of a sudden, Bruce got down on his knees and began sucking the sausage hanging out of Joe's fly.""Get out of my bar, you gay bastards!"" the barman screamed and booted them out the door. They did this all day, going to about 16 bars and getting thrown out before paying for their beers.""I just can't do this anymore,"" Bruce whined.""My knees are getting sore from kneeling down on the floor so much. We'll have to swap places.""""We can't,"" said Joe.""We lost the sausage after the third pub.""</p>

<p>Doris shows her the house and they agree to start straight away. ""There's just one problem"" explains the model "" because of my job I have to have a bath every night, and I notice you don't have a bath?""</p>

45579,"<p>The following are the first three winners of a Most Embarrassing Moment's Contest in New Woman Magazine. </p>
<p>""It was Christmas Eve, and I was on my feet all day working behind the cosmetics counter. I decided I would find a place to sit for a moment. I spied a tall plastic trash can and plopped down, resting my feet on a cardboard box. I allowed my body to ease into the can. About that time a few customers came to the register to check out, but I couldn't get out of the trash can. I was stuck; I couldn't believe it. The customers came around the counter to help me - some pulled my arms while others held the can. Then my manager came to the counter, wanting to know what was going on. He said he was going to call the fire department, who blasted in with sirens and lights. My hips had created a vacuum, so they had to cut me out of the trash can with a giant pair of scissors."" -Linda Evans; Winter Park, Florida </p>
<p>""While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release some pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to grab hold of her after receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other patrons. I told her that if she did not start behaving *right now*, she would be punished. To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as threatening, 'If you don't let me go *right now*, I will tell Grandma that I saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!' ""The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. Even the tellers stopped what they were doing! I mustered up the last of my dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last thing I heard when the door closed behind me were screams of laughter"" -Amy Richardson; Stafford,Virginia </p>
<p>""It was the day before my eighteenth birthday. I was living at home, but my parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my girlfriend over for a romantic night alone. ""As we lay in bed after making love, we heard the telephone ring downstairs. I suggested to my girlfriend that I give her a piggyback ride to the phone. Since we didn't want to miss the call, we didn't have time to get dressed. When we got to the bottom of the stairs, the lights suddenly came on and a whole crowd of people yelled, 'SURPRISE!' My entire family - aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins - and all my friends were standing there! My girlfriend and I were frozen in a state of shock and embarrassment for what seemed like an eternity. ""Since then, no one in my family has planned a surprise party again."" -Tim Cahill; Poughkeepsie, New York</p>

45580,"<p>A Jewish anthropologist, Benny Steinfeld, was working in the desert near Israel when he happened upon an odd looking vase. After cleaning it he pried open the lid and was astonished when a genie sprang from the container and granted him 3 wishes. Steinfeld wished for enormous wealth, huge land holdings and a bevy of beautiful wives. All wishes were granted, but on one condition. Never again in his life could the anthropologist get a haircut or shave. To do so would mean instant imprisonment in the same urn in which the genie had been imprisoned. All went well during the first few years of his lavish lifestyle, but his beard and long hair became more and more of a problem. One day, during a moment of weakness and desperation he ran to the bathroom, grabbed some scissors and began cutting off his beard. Immediately his fortunes vanished, and he found himself trapped in the urn lying in the desert sand. The moral of this story? ""A Benny shaved is a Benny urned.""</p>

<p>""This thing lives in trees (pause) and eats nuts (pause)"" No hands went up. ""<br /> And it is gray (pause) and has a long bushy tail (pause)"" The children were<br /> looking at each other, but still no hands raised.

45584,"<p>One day John's tennis elbow was acting up and he decided to stop in and see a doctor. When he got to the doctor's office the nurse told him he could see the doctor in 15 minutes but, first he'd have to give a urine sample. John said that this was absurd but, the nurse insisted and John complied. 15 minutes later, John was ushered in to see the doctor.</p>
<p>""So that tennis elbow is really acting up, huh?"" the doctor said. ""The nurse must have told you,"" said John, wondering how the Doctor knew. ""No. It was in your urinalysis."" and the doctor continued to say that he had just purchased this new machine that could diagnose every physical condition with total accuracy. John didn't believe a word of this but he did agree to provide another urine sample on check-up visit. </p>
<p>Two days later, John was sitting at the kitchen table with his wife and his teen age daughter. He was telling them about this ridiculous machine, when John decided to have a little fun with the doctor. John pissed in the bottle as did his wife and teen age daughter. Then while walking to his garage he had a brainstorm. John put a few drops of oil from his crankcase in the jar and finally beat off and put a few drops of semen in the jar. </p>
<p>He drove to the doctors office, shook the bottle, then handed it to the nurse. This time his urinalysis took half an hour. </p>
<p>Finally, John was ushered in to see the doctor. The doctor looked at him and said, ""I've got some bad news, smart ass. Your daughter is pregnant, your wife's got V. D., your car is about to throw a rod, and if you don't stop beating off that tennis elbow is never gonna heal!""</p>

<p>He teed up the ball and the little old lady sprinkled this magic powder onto the ball. </p>
<p>Tiger took his shot and it went 320 yards straight down the middle of the fairway. </p>

<p>Again it flew straight as an arrow and finished two feet from the flag. </p>

45610,"<p>An elderly man lay dying in his bed. In death's agony, he suddenly smells the aroma of his favourite chocolate chip cookies wafting up the stairs. </p>
<p>He gathered his remaining strength, and lifted himself from the bed. Leaning against the wall he slowly made his way out of the bedroom, and with even greater effort forced his way down the stairs, gripping the railing with both hands.</p>
<p>With laboured breath, he leaned against the door-frame, gazing into the kitchen.  Were it not for deaths agony, he would have thought himself already in heaven: there, spread out upon racks on the kitchen table and counters were literally hundreds of his favourite chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>Was it heaven? Or was it the one final act of love from his devoted wife, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man?</p>
<p>Mustering one final great effort, he threw himself towards the table, landing on his knees in a rumpled posture. His parched lips parted... the wonderous taste of the cookie already in his mouth.</p>

<p> Everybody who has a dog calls him ""Spot"", or ""Blackie"", or ""Fido"".<br /> I call mine Sexton.  Over the years that got shortened to ""Sex"".  Now Sex<br /> has been very embarassing to me.  When I went to city hall to renew his<br /> license, I told the clerk I wanted a license for Sex.  He said he'd like one<br /> too.  Then I said this is for a dog, and he said he didn't care what she<br /> looked like.  Then I said you don't understand, I've had Sex since I was<br /> nine years old. He said I must have been quite a kid.  When I got married<br /> and went on my honeymoon, I took the dog with me, and when I checked<br /> into my hotel, I told the clerk I wanted a room for me and my wife and a<br /> special room for Sex.  He said every room was a special room for Sex.<br /> I said you don't understand, Sex keeps me awake at night, and he said<br /> me too.</p>
<p> One day I entered a contest, but before the contest began the dog ran<br /> away.  Another contestant asked me why I was standing there looking<br /> around, and I told him I was planning to have Sex in the contest.  He<br /> told me I should have sold tickets.  I said you don't undersand, I had<br /> hopes of having Sex on TV.  He called me a showoff.</p>
<p> When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of<br /> the dog, and I said your honor, I had Sex before I was married, and the<br /> judge said me too.  Then I told him after I got married Sex left me, and he<br /> said me too.  Last night Sex ran off again, and I spent hours looking for him.<br /> A cop came over and asked me what I was doing in the alley at four o'clock<br /> in the morning.  I told him I was looking for Sex.</p>

45630,"<p>1998 DARWIN AWARD nominations:The Darwin Awards are annually bestowed upon (the remains of) individuals who have given their all in an effort to improve our gene pool. The Darwin Awards applaud those who have made the ultimate sacrifice of killing themselves by the most extraordinarily stupid means. The Awards commemorate those who find innovatively moronic ways of killing themselves, thereby helping to eliminate undesirable weaknesses from the human gene pool. GRAVITY KILLS ... A 22-year-old Reston man was found dead yesterday after he tried to use occy straps (the stretchy little ropes with hooks on each end) to bungee jump off a 70-foot railroad trestle, police said. Fairfax County (Virginia) police said Eric A. Barcia, a fast-food worker, taped a bunch of these straps together, wrapped an end around one foot, anchored the other end to the trestle at Lake Accotink Park, jumped ... and hit the pavement. Warren Carmichael, a police spokesman, said investigators think Barcia was alone because his car was found nearby.''The length of the cord that he had assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the ground,'' Carmichael said.  Police say the apparent cause of death was ''major trauma.'' An autopsy is scheduled for later in the week. LAUNCHED ON THE FOURTH OF JULY ... Three young men in Oklahoma were enjoying the coming fourth of July holiday and wanted to apparently test fire some fireworks. Their only real problem was that their launch pad and seating arrangements were atop a several - hundred - thousand -gallon fuel distillation storage tank. Oddly enough, some fumes were ignited, producing a fireball seen for miles and miles.  They were launched, no doubt, countless thousands of feet into the air and were found dead 250 yards from their respective seats. DON'T ASK GOD TO PROVE HIMSELF, HE JUST MIGHT ... A lawyer and two of his buddies were fishing on Caddo Lake in Texas. A lightning storm hit the lake and most of the fisherman immediately headed for the shore. But not our friend the lawyer. He was alone on the rear of his aluminum bass boat and his buddies were in the front. This gentleman stood up, spread his arms wide (crucifixion style) and shouted: ''HERE I AM LORD, LET ME HAVE IT!'' Needless to say, God delivered [well, wouldn't you?]. The other two passengers on the boat survived and are said to have immediately joined the Ministry. CATCH! ... A man in Alabama died from rattlesnake bites. Big deal, you may say, but there's a twist here that makes him a Darwin Award candidate.  It seems he and a friend were playing catch with a rattlesnake. You can guess what happened from here. The friend (a future Darwin Award candidate) was hospitalized. THEY SAY THOSE THINGS WILL KILL YOU ... Not much was given to me on this unlucky fellow, but he qualifies nonetheless. You see, there was a gentleman from Korea who was killed by his cell phone, more or less. He was doing the usual ''walking and talking'' when he walked into a tree and managed to somehow break his neck. Keep that in mind the next time you decide to drive and dial at the same time. GIMME A LIGHT! ... In a west Texas town, employees in a medium-sized warehouse noticed the smell of a gas leak. Sensibly, management evacuated the building, extinguishing all potential sources of ignition -lights, power, etc.After the building had been evacuated, two technicians from the gas company were dispatched. Upon entering the building, they found they had difficulty navigating in the dark. To their frustration, none of the lights worked. Witnesses later described the vision of one of the technicians reaching into his pocket, and retrieving an object that resembled a lighter. Upon operation of the lighter-like object, the gas in the warehouse exploded, sending pieces of it up to three miles away. Nothing was found of the technicians, but the lighter was virtually untouched by the explosion. The technician that was suspected of causing the explosion had never been thought of as ''bright'' by his peers.  And...................      The first candidates for the 1999 Darwin Awards have been nominated.And so, without further ado, the first candidates for '99:      MAN DIES IN FREAK ACCIDENT CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.A 39-year-old Charlottesville man died Thursday in a freak accident involving his washing machine. According to police reports, Samuel Randolph Strickson was doing laundry when he tried to speed up the process. Strickson apparently tried to stuff approximately 50 pounds of laundry into his washing machine by climbing on top of the washer and attempting to force the clothing into the basin. Strickson then apparently accidentally kicked the washing machine's ON button.  When the machine turned on, Strickson lost his balance and both feet went down into the machine, where they got stuck. The machine started its cycle, and Strickson, unable to free himself, started thrashing around as the machine's agitator went into gear. Strickson's head banged against a nearby shelf in the laundry room, knocking over a bottle of bleach, which poured over Strickson's face, blinding him. Forensic reports say Strickson apparently also swallowed some of the bleach. He then vomited, but was still unable to free himself. Strickson's dog, then apparently came into the laundry room.  At about the sametime, according to police, a large box of baking soda fell from the shelf, startling the dog, who then urinated. Urine, like vinegar, is acidic, and the chemical reaction between the urine and the baking soda resulted in ''a small explosion,'' according to police reports. The dog, however, escaped unharmed. Strickson remained stuck in the washing machine, which eventually went into its high speed spin cycle, spinning Strickson around at about 70 miles per hour, according to forensic experts. Strickson's head then smashed against a steel beam behind the washing machine, immediately killing him. A neighbor heard the commotion and called 911, but Strickson was pronounced dead at the scene. More nominees.............. (AP) LOS ANGELES - Police officials would not release the name of a Pacoima man who was found dead yesterday after responding to complaints from neighbors that a bad smell was coming from his apartment.Upon entering the apartment, officers were surprised to see that every square inch of the apartment, including appliances and even the inside of the toilet, were covered with pornographic images cut from magazines. ''The visual effect was very unsettling,'' said Officer Hradj of the Pacoima Police. ''Because everything looked the same, you could not tell where one wall ended and a doorway began.'' The surprises did not end there, however. Police described the manas having ''concocted a wire frame around his head'' upon which he had taped various pornographic images, apparently so he could freely move about his apartment without ever losing his clasp view of nude bodies. Small slits had been cut into the paper so he could find his way, but according to Hradj, ''He had almost no peripheral vision. He could barely see a thing.''  The man was found nude with this wire frame entangled in a hanging lamp.  ''We think he had been dusting,'' said another police officer, ''because a feather duster was lying nearby, and his head gear had somehow become caught in the lamp, which was chained to the ceiling.'' The man allegedly choked to death trying to extricate himself from his predicament.  According to his apartment manager, the white male in his mid-30's never left his apartment, and had food delivered weekly.Funeral services are planned for next week. His next of kin requested that his name be withheld.  FROM THE FROZEN NORTH COUNTRY: A young Inuit man, searching for a way of getting drunk cheaply because he had no money to buy alcohol, mixed gasoline with milk.Not surprisingly, this concoction made him ill, and he vomited into the fireplace in his house. The resulting explosion and fire burned his house down, killing both him and his sister.</p>

<p>While working with Mr. Xxxxxx, I have always found him<br /> working studiously and sincerely at his table without idling or<br /> gossiping with colleagues in the office. He seldom<br /> wastes his time on useless things. Given a job, he always<br /> finishes the given assignment in time. He is always<br /> deeply engrossed in his official work, and can never be<br /> found chitchatting in the canteen. He has absolutely no<br /> vanity in spite of his high accomplishment and profound<br /> knowledge of his field. I think he can easily be<br /> classed as outstanding, and should on no account be<br /> dispensed with.

45650,"<p>I humbly suggest that you may wish to share this with all of the E-Mail  lists in which you participate.  You may also wish to keep a copy send to  correspondents who forget these suggestions.E-Mail Facts Of Life1. Big companies don't do business via chain letter. Bill Gates is not giving you $1000, and Disney is not giving you a free vacation. There is no baby food company issuing class-action checks. You can relax; there is no need to pass it on 'just in case it's true'. Furthermore, just because someone said in the message, four generations back, that 'we checked it out and it's legit', does not actually make it true.2. There is no kidney theft ring in New Orleans. No one is waking up in a bathtub full of ice, even if a friend of a friend swears it happened to their cousin. If you are hell-bent on believing the kidney-theft ring stories, please see:     http://urbanlegends.tqn.com/library/weekly/aa062997.htm  And I quote: 'The National Kidney Foundation has repeatedly issued requests for actual victims of organ thieves to come forward and tell their stories. None have.' That's 'none' as in 'zero'. Not even your friend's cousin. 3. Neiman Marcus doesn't really sell a $200 cookie recipe. And even if they do, we all have it. And even if you don't, you can get a copy at: http://www.bl.net/forwards/cookie.html Then, if you make the recipe, decide the cookies are that awesome, feel free to pass the recipe on.4. We all know all 500 ways to drive your roommates crazy, irritate co-workers gross out bathroom stall neighbors and creep out people on an elevator. We also know exactly how many engineers, college students, Usenet posters and people from each and every world ethnicity it takes to change a lightbulb. 5. Even if the latest NASA rocket disaster(s) DID contain plutonium that went to particulate over the eastern seaboard, do you REALLY think this information would reach the public via an AOL chain-letter? 6. There is no 'Good Times' virus. In fact, you should never, ever, ever forward any E-Mail containing any virus warning unless you first confirm it at an actual site of an actual company that actually deals with virii. Try: http://www.norton.com/ or http://www.symantec.com. 7. If your CC: list is regularly longer than the actual content of your message, you're probably going to Hell. 8. If you're using Outlook, IE, or Netscape to write E-Mail, turn off the 'HTML encoding.' [hear, hear!]  Those of us on Unix shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment and then view it with a web browser, since you're probably forwarding us a copy of the Neiman Marcus Cookie Recipe anyway.9. If you still absolutely MUST forward that 10th-generation message from a friend, at least have the decency to trim the eight miles of headers showing everyone else who's received it over the last 6 months. It sure wouldn't hurt to get rid of all the '&gt;' that begin each line [I do that!]. Besides, if it has gone around that many times - we've probably already seen it. 10.Craig Shergold in England is not dying of cancer or anything else at this time and would like everyone to stop sending him their business cards. He apparently is also no longer a 'little boy' either. Nor can you get into the Guinness Book of World Records this way anymore (the rules were rewritten specifically to prevent this.)</p>

45668,"<p>Because I'm a Man, when I lock my keys in the car, I will fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we call a road service until long after hypothermia has set in.</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, when the car isn't running very well, I will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if I know what I'm looking at. If another man shows up, one of us will say to the other, ""I used to be able to fix these things, but now with all these computers and everything, I wouldn't know where to start."" </p>
<p>We will then drink beer.</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, when I catch a cold, I need someone to bring me soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan. You never get as sick as I do, so for you this isn't a problem.</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, I can be relied upon to purchase basic groceries at the store, like milk or bread. But never, under any circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which ""feminine hygiene product"" is a euphemism.</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, I must hold the television remote control in my hand while I watch TV. If the thing has been misplaced, I may miss a whole show looking for it (though one time I was able to survive by holding a calculator).</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I don't think we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen to a complete stranger? I mean, how the hell could he know where we're going?</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, there is no need to ask me what I'm thinking about. The answer is always either sex or sports. I have to make up something else when you ask, so don't.</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, I do not want to visit your mother, or have your mother come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or think about her any more than I have to.<br /> Whatever you got her for Mother's Day is okay, I don't need to see it. And don't forget to pick up something for my mother, too.</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, you don't have to ask me if I liked the movie. Chances are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't.</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, I think what you're wearing is fine. I thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too. Either pair of shoes is fine. With the belt or without it, looks fine. Your hair is fine. You look fine. Can we just go now?</p>
<p>Because I'm a Man, and this is, after all, the year 2004, I will share equally in the housework. You just do the laundry, the cooking, the gardening, the cleaning, the vacuuming, and the dishes, and I'll do the rest.</p>

45681,"<p>After Quasimodo's death, the bishop of the Cathedral of Notre Dame sent word through the streets of Paris that a new bellringer was needed. The bishop decided that he would conduct the interviews personally and went up into the belfry to begin the screening process. After observing several applicants demonstrate their skills, he had decided to call it a day - when an armless man approached him and announced that he was there to apply for the bell ringer's job.The bishop was incredulous.  ""You have no arms!""""No matter,"" said the man, ""observe!""  He then began striking the bells with his face, producing a beautiful melody on the carillon.  The bishop listened in astonishment, convinced that he had finally found a suitable replacement for Quasimodo.Suddenly, rushing forward to strike a bell, the armless man tripped and plunged headlong out of the belfry window to his death in the street below.The stunned bishop rushed to his side.  When he reached the street, a crowd had gathered around the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful music they had heard only moments before.As they silently parted to let the bishop through, one of them asked, ""Bishop, who was this man?""""I don't know his name,"" the bishop sadly replied, ""but his face rings a bell.""The following day, despite the sadness that weighed heavily on his heart due to the unfortunate death of the armless campanologist, the bishop continued his interviews for the bell ringer of Notre Dame.The first man to approach him said, ""Your Excellency, I am the brother of the poor armless wretch that fell to his death from this very belfry yesterday.  I pray that you honor his life by allowing me to replace him in this duty.""The bishop agreed to give the man an audition, and, as the armless man's brother stooped to pick up a mallet to strike the first bell, he groaned, clutched at his chest and died on the spot.  Two monks, hearing the bishop's cries of grief at this second tragedy, rushed up the stairs to his side. ""What has happened?"" the first asked, breathlessly. ""Who is this man?""""I don't know his name,"" sighed the distraught bishop, ""but he's a dead ringer for his brother.""</p>

45719,"<p>""Salary Theorem"" states that ""Engineers and Scientists     can never earn as much as Business Executives and     Sales People."" This theorem can now be supported by a     mathematical equation based on the following two     postulates:  1. Knowledge is Power.   2. Time is Money.   As every engineer knows:    Power = Work / Time   Since:    Knowledge = Power    Time = Money   It follows that:    Knowledge = Work/Money.    Solving for Money, we get:    Money = Work / Knowledge.   Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches    infinity, regardless of the amount of work done.   Conclusion:    The less you know,the more you make.</p>

45724,"<p>'Don't Squat With Yer Spurs On,  A Cowboy's Guide To Life'                by Texas Bix Bender--------------------------------------------------Never kick a fresh turd on a hot day.There's two theories to arguin' with a woman.  Neither one works.Don't worry about bitin' off more than you can chew. Your mouth is probably a whole lot bigger'n you think.If you get to thinkin' you're a person of some influence, try orderin' somebody else's dog around.Never ask a man the size of his spread.After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he started roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him.  The moral: when you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.If you find yourself in a hole the first thing to do is stop diggin'.Never smack a man who's chewin' tobacco.It don't take a genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.Never ask a barber if he thinks you need a haircut.Never follow good whiskey with water,  unless you're out of good whiskey.Good judgement comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.Always drink upstream from the herd.Never drop your gun to hug a grizzly.If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every now and then to make sure it's still there.When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't be suprised if they learn their lesson.The best way to have a quiche for dinner is to make it up and put it in the oven to bake at 325 degrees. Meanwhile, get out a large T-bone, grill it, and when it's done, eat it. As for the quiche, continue to let it bake, but otherwise ignore it.When you're throwin' your weight around, be ready to have it thrown around by somebody else.Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin' it back.Always take a good look at what you're about to eat. It's not so important to know what it is, but it's critical to know what it was.The quickest way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in your pocket.A smart ass just don't fit in a saddle.Never miss a good chance to shut up.</p>

At dinner, his father told the story of how George Washington chopped down the cherry tree. Feeling incredibly guilty, the little boy 'fessed up and told his father about what had happened. Soon, the boy was spanked, and how! ""Wait, dad! What's going on? I told you the truth!""""Yes, you did. But George Washington's dad wasn't in the tree when he chopped it down!""</p>

They sent in bombers to blow up the bridge and all the Israelites were saved.""

45738,"<p>Dear Diary, </p>
<p>Monday </p>
<p>Now home from honeymoon and settled in our new home, it's fun to cook for Bill. Today I made an angel food cake and the recipe said, ""beat 12 eggs separately."" Well, I didn't have enough bowls to do that, so I had to borrow enough bowls to beat the eggs in. The cake turned out fine. </p>
<p>Tuesday </p>
<p>We wanted a fruit salad for supper. The recipe said, ""serve without dressing"". So I didn't dress. But, Bill happened to bring a friend home for supper that night. Did they ever look startled when I served the salad. </p>
<p>Wednesday </p>
<p>I decided to serve rice and found a recipe which said, ""wash thoroughly before steaming the rice"". So I heated some water and took a bath before steaming the rice. Sounded kinda silly in the middle of the week. I can't say it improved the rice any. </p>
<p>Thursday </p>
<p>Today Bill asked for salad again. I tried a new recipe. It said, ""prepare ingredients, then toss on a bed of lettuce one hour before serving."" I hunted all over the garden by my moms. So I tossed my salad into the bed of lettuce and stood over there one hour so the dog would not take it. Bill came over and asked if I felt all right. I wonder why? </p>
<p>Friday </p>
<p>Today I found an easy recipe for cookies. It said, ""put all ingredients in a bowl and beat it."" Beat it I did, right over to my mom's house. There must have been something wrong with the recipe, because when I came back home again it looked the same as when I left it. </p>
<p>Saturday </p>
<p>Bill went shopping today and brought home a chicken. He asked me to dress it for Sunday. I'm sure I don't know how hens dress for Sunday. I never noticed back on the farm, but I found a doll dress and some little shoes. I though the hen looked real cute. When Bill saw it, I wondered why he counted to 10. </p>
<p>Sunday </p>
<p>Today Bill's folks came to dinner. I wanted to serve roast, but all we had in the icebox, was hamburger. So I put it in the oven and set the controls for roast. Must be the oven, because it still came out hamburger. </p>
<p>Monday </p>
<p>I was going to bake bread today. The recipe said, ""mix well and knead well. Then stand in a warm place until double in bulk."" I just won't bake bread if I have to double in bulk. </p>
<p>Goodnight Dear Diary. This has been an exciting week. I am eager for tomorrow to come, so I can try a new recipe on Bill. </p>
<p>Love, PAM</p>

45758,"<p>The American businessman was at the pier of a small coastal<br /> Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman<br /> docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.<br /> The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish<br /> and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied<br /> ""only a little while"". The American then asked why didn't he<br /> stay out longer and catch more fish? </p>
<p>The Mexican said he had enough to support his family's immediate<br /> needs. The American then asked, ""but what do you do with the<br /> rest of your time?"" </p>
<p>The Mexican fisherman said, ""I sleep late, fish a little, play<br /> with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into<br /> the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with<br /> my amigos, I have a full and busy life, senor."" </p>
<p>The American scoffed, ""I am a Harvard MBA and could help you.<br /> You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a<br /> bigger boat with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy<br /> several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing<br /> boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would<br /> sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own<br /> cannery. You would control the product, processing and<br /> distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing<br /> village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually NYC<br /> where you will run your expanding enterprise."" </p>
<p>The Mexican fisherman asked, ""But senor, how long will this all<br /> take?"" </p>
<p>To which the American replied, ""15-20 years."" </p>
<p>""But what then, senor?"" </p>
<p>The American laughed and said that's the best part. When the<br /> time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company<br /> stock to the public and become very rich, you would make<br /> millions. ""Millions, senor? Then what?"" </p>
<p>The American said, ""Then you would retire. Move to a small<br /> coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a<br /> little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll<br /> to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play<br /> your guitar with your amigos.""</p>

<p>He woke his wife and told her, ""You have three choices: Either go duck hunting with me, let me fuck you in the ass, or give me a blow job. I have to run out get the dog, and load the truck. You'd better decide by the time I get back.""</p>
<p>He returned after a while, and said to his wife, ""Well, what have you decided to do?""</p>
<p>To which she replied, ""Well, I sure don't want to go duck hunting, and I'm sure the hell not going to let you fuck me in the ass, so I guess I'll give you a blow job.""</p>
<p>She begins to suck on his dick, and all the sudden stops and begins spitting and choking.</p>
<p>He said to her, ""What's the problem?"" And she replied, ""My god, your dick tastes like shit!""</p>
<p>He replied, ""Oh yeah, the dog didn't want to go duck hunting either."" </p>

45770,"<p>An extremely ugly man was sitting in a bar having a drink with his friend, who is his polar opposite. In fact, he may be the most handsome man in town. </p>
<p>The two of them are discussing a beautiful blonde girl sitting at the bar. </p>
<p>The handsome man said, ""Boy, I sure would like to get some of that.""</p>
<p>The ugly man said, ""Go ahead, go for it.""</p>
<p>The handsome man said, ""There's no way, she won't go with anybody, I've tried many times.""</p>
<p>The ugly man said, ""I think I could go out with her if I wanted to.""</p>
<p>The handsome man laughed and said, ""If she won't go out with me, she sure as hell won't go out with you.""</p>
<p>Ugly said, ""I'll bet you fifty bucks she'll go with me.""</p>
<p>Handsome says, ""You're on!"" </p>
<p>Ugly says, ""OK, just leave the money with the bartender and I'll pick it up later.""</p>
<p>He walks up to the girl, starts talking and then turned around and walked out of the bar, with the girl right behind him.</p>
<p>The handsome man couldn't believe it. He went up to the bar and asked the bartender, ""What happened? What did he say to her?""</p>
<p>The bartender told him, ""Well, he didn't say much. He just said it's a nice night for a walk. And then he licked his eyebrows and left."" </p>

"
45778,"<p>Follow all of these instructions carefully for error-free floppies!! </p>
<p>Never leave diskettes in the disk drive, as data can leak out of the disk and corrode the inner mechanics of the drive. </p>
<p>Diskettes should be rolled up and stored in pencil holders. </p>
<p>Diskettes should be cleaned and waxed once a week. </p>
<p>Microscopic metal particles can be removed by waving a powerful magnet over the surface of the disk. </p>
<p>Any stubborn metallic shavings can be removed with scouring powder and soap. </p>
<p>When waxing the diskettes, make sure the surface is even. This will allow the diskette to spin faster, resulting in better access time. </p>
<p>Do not fold diskettes unless they do not fit into the drive. ""Big"" diskettes may be folded and used in ""little"" disk drives. </p>
<p>Never insert a diskette into the drive upside down. The data can fall off the surface of the disk and jam the intricate mechanics of the drive. </p>
<p>Diskettes cannot be backed up by running them through the xerox machine. </p>
<p>If your data is going to need to be backed up, simply insert two diskettes into the drive. </p>
<p>Whenever you update a document, the data will be written on both diskettes. </p>
<p>Diskettes should not be inserted or removed from the drive while the red light is flashing. </p>
<p>Doing so could result in smeared or possibly unreadable text. </p>
<p>Occasionally the red light remains flashing in what is known as a ""hung"" or ""hooked"" state. If your system is ""hooking"" you will probably need to insert a few coins before being allowed access to the slot. </p>
<p>If your diskette is full and you need more storage space, remove the disk from the drive and shake vigorously for 2 minutes. This will pack the data enough (Data Compression) to allow for more storage. </p>
<p>Be sure to cover all the openings with scotch tape to prevent loss data. </p>
<p>Access time can be greatly improved by cutting more holes in the diskette jacket. This will provide more simultaneous access points to the disk. </p>
<p>Diskettes may be used as coasters for beverage glasses, provided that they are properly waxed beforehand. </p>
<p>Be sure to wipe the diskettes dry before using. (see item 2 above) </p>
<p>Never use scissors and glue to manually edit documents. The data is stored much too small for the naked eye, and you may end up with data from some other document stuck in the middle of your document. </p>
<p>Razor blades and scotch tape may be used, however, provided the user is equipped with an electron microscope. </p>
<p>Periodically spray diskettes with insecticide to prevent system bugs from spreading.</p>

45779,"<p>NEW PRODUCT: MICROSOFT CONTRACEPTIVESMicrosoft Corporation has taken another step toward dominating  every aspect of American life with the introduction of Contraceptive98,  a suite of applications designed for users who engage in sex. Microsoft has been a pioneer in peer-to-peer connectivity and plug and play. It believes these technologies will give it substantial leverage in penetrating the copulation enhancement market. The product addresses two important user concerns: the need for virus protection  and the need for a firewall to ensure the non-propagation of human beings.The Contraceptive98 suite consists of three products: Condom98,  DeFetus 1.0 (from Sementec), and AIDScan 2.1 (from Norton Utilities).   A free copy of Intercourse Explorer 4.0 is bundled in the package. The  suite also comes in two expanded versions. Contraceptive98 Professional  is the Client/Server edition, for professionals in the sexual services  sector. Contraceptive98 Small Business Edition is a package for start-ups,  aimed at the housewife and gigolo niches.OPERATIONOnly one node in a peer-to-peer connection needs to install the package.  At installation, the Condom98 software checks for minimum hardware. If  the user meets the requirements, the product installs and is sufficiently  scalable to meet most requirements.After installation, operation commences. One caution is that the user  must have sufficient RAM to complete the session. When the session is complete, a disconnect is initiated, and the user gets the message, 'It  is now safe to turn off your partner.'DRAWBACKSUsability testers report that frequent failures were a major concern  during beta testing. General Protection Fault was the most serious  error encountered. Early versions had numerous bugs, but most of these  have been eliminated. The product needs to be installed each time it  is used.CONCLUSIONContraceptive98 is a robust product. Despite its drawbacks, it is a  reasonably good value for its $49.95 price tag, and is far superior to  its shareware version. Hopefully, future releases (of the software,  that is) will add missing functionality, such as Back out and Restore,  Uninterruptible Power Supply, and Onboard Camera. Microsoft CEO Bill  Gates is optimistic about Contraceptive98's potential. He recently  said, 'Our contraceptive products will help users do to each other  what we've been doing to our customers for years.'</p>

45780,"<p>HER STORY:<br /> He was in an odd mood when I got to the bar to meet him. I thought it might<br /> have been because I was a bit late. He didn't say anything much about it. He<br /> seemed silent, distracted and his only eye contact seemed judgmental. I decided<br /> maybe I should never wear that dress again. Well, maybe it was the color. Maybe<br /> I should never wear this color again either. The conversation was so slow going<br /> so I thought maybe we should go off somewhere more intimate so we could talk<br /> more privately. He didn't really seem to agree, but we went off to this quiet,<br /> little restaurant and he's STILL acting a bit funny and I'm trying to cheer him<br /> up, be witty, and tell cute stories, but I start to wonder whether it's me or<br /> something else. He doesn't smile much, so I ask him, but he says no. But you<br /> know I'm not really sure. I wonder and then I think about the 5 pounds I gained<br /> this past month. I bet he thinks I'm a fat hog now. Anyway, in the cab back to<br /> his house, I say that I love him and he just puts his arm around me, but doesn't<br /> squeeze. I don't know what the hell this all means or what I should think<br /> because you know he doesn't say it back or do anything. We finally get back to<br /> his place and I'm wondering if he's going to dump me. So I try to ask him about<br /> it, but he just switches on the TV. Reluctantly, I say I'm going to sleep. Then,<br /> after about 10 minutes or so, he joins me and we have sex. But, he still seems<br /> really, really distracted, so afterwards I just wanted to leave. I roll over and<br /> sniffle a little real quietly. He snores. I don�t know, I just don't know, what<br /> he thinks anymore. I mean, do you think he's met someone else?</p>
<p>HIS STORY:<br /> Hard day at work. Really tired. Got laid though.</p>

Imagine his horror when one day she announces that she is bringing her boyfriend home for tea - and worse, that she wants to get engaged to him. </p>
<p>The day comes, and the boyfriend turns up. He has long tangled hair, several tattoos, a sleeveless denim jacket and dirty jeans with holes in.

At the station, the three accountants each buy tickets and watch as the three engineers buy only a single ticket.""How are three people going to travel on only one ticket?"" asks an accountant.""Watch and you'll see,"" answers an engineer. They all board the train. The accountants take their respective seats but all three engineers cram into a restroom and close the door behind them. Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the restroom door and says, ""Ticket, please."" The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and moves on. The accountants saw this and agreed it was quite a clever idea. So after the conference, the accountants decide to copy the engineers on the return trip and save some money (being clever with money, and all that). When they get to the station, they buy a single ticket for the return trip. To their astonishment, the engineers don't buy a ticket at all.""How are you going to travel without a ticket?"" says one perplexed accountant.""Watch and you'll see,"" answers an engineer.

45808,"<p>Many years ago, a beloved Pope died and went to heaven. Saint Peter greeted<br /> him in a firm embrace. ""Welcome your holiness, your dedication and unselfishness<br /> in serving your fellow man during your life has earned you great stature in<br /> heaven. You may pass through the gates without delay and are granted free access<br /> to all parts of heaven.""</p>
<p>St. Peter continued: ""You are also granted an open-door policy and may, at<br /> your own discretion, meet with any heavenly leader including the Father, without<br /> prior appointment. Is there anything which your holiness desires?""</p>
<p>""Well, yes,"" the Pope replied. ""I have often pondered some of the mysteries<br /> which have puzzled and confounded theologians through the ages. Are there<br /> perhaps any transcripts which recorded the actual conversations between God and<br /> the prophets of old? I would love to see what was actually said, without the<br /> dimming of memories over time.""</p>
<p>St. Peter immediately ushered the Pope to the heavenly library and explained<br /> how to retrieve the various documents. The Pope was thrilled and settled down to<br /> review the history of humanity's relationship with God.</p>
<p>Two years later, a scream of anguish pierced the quiet of the library.<br /> Immediately several of the saints and angels came running. </p>
<p>They found the Pope pointing to a single word on a parchment, repeating over<br /> and over: ""There's an 'R'. There's an 'R.' There's an 'R'... It's CELIBRATE, not<br /> celibate!""</p>

<p>""Well, Paddy,"" Saddam replied, ""This is indeed important news! How big is your army?""</p>
<p>""Right now,"" said Paddy, after a moment's calculation, ""There is myself, my cousin Sean, my next door neighbour Seamus, and the entire dart team from the pub. That makes eight!""</p>
<p>Saddam paused. ""I must tell you, Paddy, that I have one million men in my army waiting to move on my command.""</p>
<p>""Begorra!"", said Paddy. ""I'll have to ring you back!""</p>
<p>Sure enough, the next day, Paddy called again. ""Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!""</p>
<p>""And what equipment would that be, Paddy?"" Saddam asked.</p>
<p>""Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor.""</p>
<p>Saddam sighed. ""I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and 14,000 armoured personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1-1/2 million since we last spoke.""</p>
<p>""Saints preserve us!"" said Paddy. ""I'll have to get back to you.""</p>
<p>Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day. ""Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne! We've modified Harrigan's ultra-light with a couple of shotguns in the cockpit, and four boys from the Shamrock Pub have joined us as well!""</p>
<p>Saddam was silent for a minute and then cleared his throat. ""I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 10,000 bombers and 20,000 fighter planes. My military complex is surrounded by laser-guided, surface-to-air missile sites. And since we last spoke, I've increased my army to TWO MILLION!""</p>
<p>""Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!"", said Paddy, ""I'll have to ring you back.""</p>
<p>Sure enough, Paddy called again the next day. ""Top o' the mornin', Mr. Hussein! I am sorry to tell you that we have had to call off the war.""</p>
<p>""I'm sorry to hear that,"" said Saddam. ""Why the sudden change of heart?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" said Paddy, ""We've all had a long chat over a bunch of pints, and decided there's no way we can feed two million prisoners.""</p>

45820,"<p>An elderly gentleman walks into a health club to inquire about<br /> the exercise programs, club facilities, and perks of the<br /> establishment. He walks up to the counter where he is greeted by<br /> a Herculean body builder.</p>

"
45823,"<p>Forwarded from a guy at MIT who knows this guy at WPI. Story confirmed by a co-employee who graduated from MIT. Unfortunately we don't have an e-dress for Mikey to  REALLY confirm this, but then, who would make THIS up?   ;-)                       -------------------------And so I get back to school, start my senior year, two research projects, grad school applications, GRE preparation, and the like. The year started off good, but that all changed about two months ago. Some of you (especially those at Berkeley) may have heard rumors of some bizarre accident that I was involved in. So here is the truth, unabridged, for those of you who actually want to know...Around the second week of school, the society of physics students held a roughly annual welcome back party, and, as tradition dictates, we made our own ice cream with liquid nitrogen (77 K) as a refrigerant and aerator.Things were going fine for a while. We spilled a little of the nitrogen onto a table, and watched tiny little drops of it dance around. Then someone asked, 'why does it do that?'That may have been the point of no return. I, as is traditionally my role, answered that the nitrogen evaporates at the surface of the table, which provides a cushion of air for the drop to sit on, and thermally insulates the drop to minimize further evaporation. So you see a drop dance around without boiling away, and without interacting with the table and getting slowed down or smeared out. Then, I continued...I mentioned that the same principle makes it possible to dip a wet hand into molten lead, or to drink liquid nitrogen without injury.I had done the latter several years earlier in a cryogenics lab, and remembered the physics behind how it worked. Naturally, people around me were skeptical. 'You can't drink the stuff... it'll freeze your whole body... remember terminator 2?' but I was sure of myself. I had done it before, and I believed in the physics behind it. So, naturally, I poured myself a glass and took a shot. Simple: Swallow, blow smoke out nose and mouth and impress everyone at the party.Within about two seconds, I had collapsed to the floor, unable to breathe or feel anything other than intense pain.Ambulance arrives. Police arrive. Trip to hospital. Admission. Try to explain to ER staff exactly how something like this happens. Then I pass out.I wake up next morning connected to many machines, some beeping, others performing more important functions like digesting my food and breathing for me.Turns out that, in accordance with popular belief, you really should not drink the stuff. I eventually learned a few things about liquid nitrogen. Like... while you can safely put it in your mouth, and blow neat smoke patterns, you should never ever ever swallow. First off, the closing of the epiglottis prevents the nitrogen gas from escaping, so it is forced into your body instead. Second, your esophagus naturally constricts around anything inside it, so, even if there is a thin protective gas layer, the esophagus will find a way to make contact with the liquid nitrogen.Also turns out that my memory was flawed. When I had done it six years ago, I put it into my mouth and didn't swallow. Over time, that fineline between parlor trick and near fatal accident must have blurred.So... the consequences... my entire upper GI tract, from epiglottis to the bottom of the stomach was badly burned, scarred, and perforated. The gas also expanded quite a bit while inside my body. It filled my chest cavity with several liters of nitrogen gas, which was under enough presuure to collapse a lung. So after what I'm told was a grueling all night surgery, they removed part of my stomach, and had my entire digestive system, top to bottom, running on machine power for a while. I also had a breather for the first day or so, until my lung was restored. There are a few details which are considerably uglier which I will spare you.So... the recovery... they were impressed with my recuperative skills. I could breathe on my own completely after a few days. I could sit up in bed after a week, and was walking in two. About that time, I began to eat again as well. After four weeks, I was up and about again. Now, something like eight weeks, I'm virtually healed, with the exception of a number of unsightly scars.But.... the good news is that I am the first documented medical case of a cryogenic ingestion. Read the new england journal of medicine. Three articles are in review now, and will be published soon, I'm told. These days, my little adventure leaves me with bad jokes at physics department meetings, and the occasional blurb in the school paper. 'Make Mikey drink it. Mikey likes it.' I've also picked up the nickname'Nitro-Mike,' which is somehow supposed to sound cool, because it conjures up images of nitro-glycerin, which implies I'm a bad mother. I don't buy it.If any of you guys have heard a variation on this story, let me know. I'm always curious to hear how these things sound third and fourth hand. I was on a follow-up visit to the hospital, and I mentioned to one of the nurses that I go to WPI. And he said that he heard about some kid from WPI who broke into a lab in the middle of the night and stole some liquid nitrogen to try and get high. Then, as the story goes, by the time he gets to the hospital, he's in pretty bad shape. His lower jaw has to be amputated, as well as his tongue. He can never eat solid foods again, and also has a 'bag,' if you know what I mean. I didn't have the heart to tell this guy the truth, because the story was so good at that point.So, that, in a nutshell, is what's happened to me. Nowadays, I'm back to my normal self... school, thesis work, grad apps, playing music, talking on the radio, and suffering over women.So here I am.Michael</p>

45830,"<p>Position Available Immediately: Apprentice Sith Lord, Dark Side<br /> Consulting Group</p>
<p>An unexpected position has opened up in the Dark Side Consulting<br /> Group for an Apprentice Sith Lord. The ideal candidate for this<br /> position would like galactic travel and possess a complete<br /> understanding of and competence with the Force, or demonstrate a<br /> willingness to learn.</p>
<p>Duties include: Performing competitive intelligence, hands-on<br /> intervention in support of the Sith Master's planning<br /> initiatives, ability to travel the galaxy widely, and operating<br /> a variety of laser-powered hand weapons and high-powered<br /> space/air vehicles.

45857,"<p>Cracking an international market is a goal of most growing corporations. It<br /> shouldn't be that hard, yet even the big multi-nationals run into trouble<br /> because of language and cultural differences. For example... </p>
<p>The name Coca-Cola in China was first rendered as Ke-kou-ke-la. Unfortunately,<br /> the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of signs had been<br /> printed that the phrase means ""bite the wax tadpole"" or ""female horse stuffed<br /> with wax"" depending on the dialect. Coke then researched 40,000 Chinese<br /> characters and found a close phonetic equivalent, ""ko-kou-ko-le,"" which can be<br /> loosely translated as ""happiness in the mouth.""</p>
<p>In Taiwan, the translation of the Pepsi slogan ""Come alive with the Pepsi<br /> Generation"" came out as ""Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead.""</p>
<p>Also in Chinese, the Kentucky Fried Chicken slogan ""finger-lickin' good"" came<br /> out as ""eat your fingers off.""</p>
<p>The American slogan for Salem cigarettes, ""Salem - Feeling Free,"" got<br /> translated in the Japanese market into ""Whensmoking Salem, you feel so refreshed<br /> that your mind seems to be free and empty.""</p>
<p>When General Motors introduced the Chevy Nova in South America, it was<br /> apparently unaware that ""no va"" means ""it won't go."" After the company figured<br /> out why it wasn't selling any cars, it renamed the car in its Spanish markets to<br /> the Caribe.</p>
<p>Ford had a similar problem in Brazil when the Pinto flopped. The company found<br /> out that Pinto was Brazilian slang for""tiny male genitals"". Ford pried all the<br /> nameplates off and substituted Corcel, which means horse.</p>
<p>When Parker Pen marketed a ballpoint pen in Mexico, its ads were supposed to<br /> say ""It won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you."" However, the company's<br /> mistakenly thought the spanish word ""embarazar"" meant embarrass. Instead the ads<br /> said that ""It wont leak in your pocket and make you pregnant.""</p>
<p>An American t-shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the spanish market which<br /> promoted the Pope's visit. Instead of the desired ""I Saw the Pope"" in Spanish,<br /> the shirts proclaimed ""I Saw the Potato.""</p>
<p>Chicken-man Frank Perdue's slogan, ""It takes a tough man to make a tender<br /> chicken,"" got terribly mangled in another Spanish translation. A photo of Perdue<br /> with one of his birds appeared on billboards all over Mexico with a caption that<br /> explained ""It takes a hard man to make a chicken aroused.""</p>
<p>Hunt-Wesson introduced its Big John products in French Canada as Gros Jos<br /> before finding out that the phrase, in slang, means ""big breasts."" In this case,<br /> however, the name problem did not have a noticeable effect on sales.</p>
<p>Colgate introduced a toothpaste in France called Cue, the name of a notorious<br /> porno mag.</p>
<p>In Italy, a campaign for Schweppes Tonic Water translated the name into<br /> Schweppes Toilet Water.</p>
<p>Japan's second-largest tourist agency was mystified when it entered<br /> English-speaking markets and began receiving requests for unusual sex tours.<br /> Upon finding out why, the owners of Kinki Nippon Tourist Company changed its<br /> name.</p>
<p>and finally...</p>
<p>In an effort to boost orange juice sales in predominantly continental<br /> breakfast eating England, a campaign was devised to extoll the drink's<br /> eye-opening, pick-me-up qualities. Hence, the slogan, ""Orange juice. It gets<br /> your pecker up.""</p>

<p>This puzzled the groom, since after 12 marriages, he thought that at least one of her husbands would have been able to perform. He asked his new bride to explain the phenomenon. </p>
<p>She responded: </p>
<p>My first husband was a Sales Representative who spent our entire marriage telling me, in grandiose terms, 'It's gonna be great!' </p>
<p>My second husband was from Software Services; he was never quite sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he would send me documentation. </p>
<p>My third husband was from Field Services and constantly said that everything was diagnostically OK, but he just couldn't get the system up. </p>
<p>My fourth husband was from Educational Services, and he simply said, Those who can, do; those who can't, teach. </p>
<p>My fifth husband was from the Telemarketing Department and said that he had the orders, but he wasn't quite sure when he was going to be able to deliver. </p>
<p>My sixth husband was an Engineer. He told me that he understood the basic process but needed three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method. </p>
<p>My seventh husband was from Finance and Administration. His comments were that he knew how, but he just wasn't sure whether it was his job. </p>
<p>My eighth husband was from Standards and Regulations and told me that he was up to the standards but that regulations said nothing about how to do it. </p>
<p>My ninth husband was a Marketing Manager. He said, 'I know I have the product. I'm just not sure how to position it.' </p>
<p>My tenth husband was a psychiatrist, and all he ever wanted to do was talk about it. </p>
<p>My eleventh husband was a gynecologist, and all he ever wanted to do was look at it. </p>
<p>My twelfth husband was a stamp collector, and all he ever wanted to do was -- God I miss him! </p>

45861,"<p>Three men who were lost in the forest were captured by<br /> cannibals. The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could<br /> live if they pass a trial. The first step of the trial was to go<br /> to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So<br /> all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.</p>
<p>The first one came back and said to the king, ""I brought ten<br /> apples."" The king then explained the trial to him. ""You have to<br /> shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your<br /> face or you'll be eaten.""</p>
<p>The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out<br /> in pain, so he was killed.</p>
<p>The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the<br /> king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this<br /> should be easy. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the<br /> ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.</p>
<p>The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one<br /> asked, ""Why did you laugh, you almost got away with it?"" The<br /> second one replied, ""I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy<br /> coming with pineapples.""</p>

Especially silks. I'm sick of them all.."" ""Agreed, Tarquin,"" replied the other, ""I'm with you all the way on that. I'd rather suffer an eternity in hell than talk to another Q.C."" And so it was that they reached the gate, and with much eyebrow raising by the heavenly host were judged worthy to enter.""One moment, St. Peter,"" said Piers as the gates swung wide, ""just one thing - We're sick of Barristers - are there any inside? Because if there are, the deal's off..."" ""Certainly not!"" Cried St. Pete, ""You're quite safe - no barristers in here.."" Thus reassured, the two pressed on. They were finding heaven very enjoyable until all of a sudden an ancient looking chap with a long beard, wearing a barristers gown and wig pushed past them, a bundle of papers under one arm and a battered copy of the Weekly reports under the other.. Enfuriated they stormed back to St. Peter. Oi - St. Peter! cried Piers, already drafting his pleadings in his head, ""You said there were no barristers here.."" ""There aren't,"" stammered St. Peter  ""Well who's the silk in with the long beard, then?"" demanded the outraged lawyer.""Oh,"" Said St. Peter, realisation dawning, ""That's not a barrister! That's God. He just thinks he's a barrister..""</p>

I spent the afternoon shopping with the girls and I thought it might have been my fault because I was a bit later than I promised but he didn't say anything about it. I don't remember doing anything to make him upset, but I could tell there was something wrong.</p>
<p>The conversation was quite slow going so I thought we should go off to someplace intimate so we could talk more privately. We went to this restaurant and he was STILL acting a bit funny. I was getting really worried, what did I do? What was bothering him? Was he mad at me?</p>
<p>I tried to cheer him up, but started to wonder what was bothering him. Was it me or something else? I asked him if he was upset with me, he said no. But I wasn't really sure. In the car on the way back home, I said that I loved him deeply and he just put his arm around me. I didn't know what the heck that meant because, you know, he didn't say it back or anything. We finally got back home and I was wondering if he was going to leave me! So I tried to get him to talk but he just switched on the TV.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, I said I was going to go to bed. Then after about 10 minutes, he joined me and to my surprise, we made love. But, he still seemed really distracted, so afterwards I wanted to confront him but didn't, so I just cried myself to sleep. I just don't know what to do anymore. I mean, I really think he's seeing someone else.</p>

45869,"<p>An old preacher was dying. He sent a message for his banker and his lawyer, both church members, to come to his home.When they arrived, they were ushered up to his bedroom. As they entered the room, the preacher held out his hands and motioned for them to sit on each side of the bed. The preacher grasped their hands, sighed contentedly, smiled, and stared at the ceiling. For a time, no one said anything.Both the banker and lawyer were touched and flattered that the preacher would ask them to be with him during his final moments. They were also puzzled; the preacher had never given them any indication that he particularly liked either of them. They both remembered his many long, uncomfortable sermons about greed, covetousness, and avaricious behaviour that made them squirm in their seats.Finally, the banker said, ""Preacher, why did you ask us to come?""The old preacher mustered up his strength and then said weakly, ""Jesus died between two thieves, and that's how I want to go.""</p>

45884,"<p>A mechanical engineer died &amp; went to heaven. Upon arrival Saint Peter checked<br /> ""THE BOOK"" and didn't find his name, so he informed the engineer that he must<br /> get on the elevator and go DOWNSTAIRS. </p>
<p>Reluctantly the engineer boarded the elevator for the long trip DOWNSTAIRS and<br /> upon arrival in hell found that he was very uncomfortable due to the excessive<br /> heat. He asked to see the devil and was granted an interview, at which time he<br /> requested a large of materials with which to build an air conditioner. The devil<br /> replied that he could have anything he wished, and what he couldn't find, they<br /> would steal. So the engineer spent a month and a half building an air<br /> conditioner, which, when completed, cooled hell off only a few degrees. </p>
<p>Somewhat unsatisfied the engineer requested additional materials, with which<br /> he spent another month and a half building a sprinkler system to add to the<br /> cooling effect of his air conditioner. Hell was getting much cooler now and<br /> folks were beginning to almost enjoy it. </p>
<p>About a month later the red phone rang. The devil answered, and found that God<br /> was on the other end of the line. </p>
<p>""Remember that mechanical engineer we sent down about 4 months ago?"" God<br /> queried. </p>
<p>""Hell yes, I remember!"" Said the devil. </p>
<p>""Well, Saint Peter missed that man's name on the last page of our book because<br /> the page was stuck to the one in front of it. So I want you to send the engineer<br /> back UPSTAIRS, as is our agreement. If they're on THE BOOK, then they stay<br /> UPHERE and if not, they go DOWNSTAIRS."" God exclaimed! </p>
<p>""I'll be damned if your going to get that engineer back. He's put in an air<br /> conditioner and a sprinkler system down here and folks are almost happy to be<br /> here. I expect that when some folks hear about this they may begin to request to<br /> be sent DOWNSTAIRS!"" said the devil. </p>
<p>""Now look here! We have an agreement! In the book---UPSTAIRS and not in the<br /> book---DOWNSTAIRS!! If you don't send that engineer back right away I believe<br /> I'll have to sue you!!!"" shouted God!! </p>
<p>""And just where do you think you'll get an attorney?"" replied the devil!!!</p>

45887,"<p>3 nuns were allowed to have one night away from the church...so<br /> they traveled all around, and had a blast. The next morning, all<br /> 3 lined up in front of the Confession Stand.</p>
<p>The first nun went in and the priest asked her, ""What sins have<br /> you committed?"" And the nun said, ""Well, father, I made love to<br /> a man I met in a bar."" And the Priest thought for about 40<br /> seconds, and said, ""You are forgiven, but you must drink of the<br /> holy water."" So she thanked him, and took a big drink, and she<br /> ran off, and threw up. The third nun laughed quietly. </p>
<p>The second nun went in, and he asked her the same question, and<br /> the second nun said, ""Well, I made love to a man, and I got very<br /> drunk."" So, the priest thought for 40 seconds, and said, ""You're<br /> forgiven, but you must drink of the holy water."" So, she thanked<br /> him, and went to the water, and drank a lot, she ran and threw<br /> up.</p>
<p>The priest became very confused as they were throwing up, and<br /> the third nun was laughing her head off. She stumbled into the<br /> confession stand. The priest knew she was drunk, and he said,<br /> ""What have you done, M'Lady?"" And she laughed, and screamed out,<br /> ""I pissed and spat in the holy water!""</p>

45911,"<p>ATTENTION :<br /> All citizens of Arkansas planning a trip to Washington, D.C. to visit Willy Jeff</p>
<p>1. Before leaving for Washington, clean red mud from windshields and remove hog and chicken feed from pick-up bed.</p>
<p>2. Any cardboard box can be made to look like a suitcase if brown shoe polish is smoothly applied. Boxes must have tops, but no ropes. When a few miles out of Arkansas, remove overalls and brogans and putt them into your box. Change to Sunday suit, clean shirt and good shoes (wear socks).</p>
<p>3. Limit occupancy of your car or pickup to a reasonable number of riders. It looks country to overload a vehicle.</p>
<p>4. Those going on their tractors should leave three weeks early. Remember to drive on the right side of the road at all times, except when passing an older tractor or a buddy in a wagon.</p>
<p>5. En route always buy a full tank of gas. A dollar's worth at a time requires too many gas stops.</p>
<p>6. On arrival in Washington, immediately get settled in a tourist or boarding house. If they don't feed, try to locate near an all-nite cafe. Leave soda crackers, Viennas, R.C. Colas and Moon Pies In car or pick-up. First class tourist homes do not take kindly to guests who prepare food in their sleeping rooms.</p>
<p>7. Do not take live chickens or hogs - for some reason people in Virginia think that they have good hams. For the sake of national unity, we don't want to show them up. Besides, their dogs would chase our chickens and our hogs would eat their dogs... just making a hell of a mess.</p>
<p>8. Do not take Sears catalog or corn cobbs with you. Up there the out-houses are always inside and they furnish a rolled paper substitute, but remember to turn the knob on the white bowl as this is a house rule and creates less air pollution problems. Brother Al Gore gets all heated about this pollution and we don't want to set him off.</p>
<p>9. If invited by a county agent, fertilizer manufacturer's representative or hog vaccine manufacturer's salesman to have a drink in his hotel room, do not spit tobacco juice on the carpeted floor. When asked what you drink, don't say ""stump juice"". Tell them all classy people from Arkansas drink B&amp;B (Bourbon and Branch water).</p>
<p>10. And above all else - don't let any Yankee show you up. Constant screaming of ""He's a good ole boy"" will make it difficult for them to engage you in conversation on their intelligence level. You can also keep up the chant started by Cousin Slick, ""It's time for change!"" As you know, we plan a change of underwear on the first of every month. First cousins change with second cousins, but always keep it in the family. Willie has passed a decree, even when divorced you can still be cousins in Arkansas.</p>

<p>1. Two times a week, we go to a nice restaurant, a little wine, good<br /> food and companionship. She goes Tuesdays. I go Fridays.</p>
<p>2. We also sleep in separate beds. Hers is in Florida, mine is in NY.</p>
<p>3. I take my wife everywhere, but she keeps finding her way back.</p>
<p>4. I asked my wife, ""Where do you want to go for our anniversary?""<br /> ""Somewhere I haven't been in a long time!""<br /> So I suggested, ""How about the kitchen?""</p>
<p>5. We always hold hands. If I let go, she shops.</p>
<p>6. She has an electric blender, electric toaster, and electric bread maker. Then she said ""There are too many gadgets, and no place to sit down !""<br /> So I bought her an electric chair.</p>
<p>7. My wife told me the car wasn't running well, there was water in the carburetor. When I asked where the car was, she told me ""In the lake.""</p>
<p>8. My wife is on a new diet. Coconuts and bananas. She hasn't lost weight, but BOY, can she climb a tree now!</p>
<p>9. She got a mudpack and looked great for two days. Then the mud fell off...</p>
<p>10. She ran after the garbage truck, yelling, ""Am I too late for the garbage?""<br /> The driver said, ""No, jump in!""</p>

45919,"<p>A man observed a woman in the grocery store with a three year old girl in her basket. As they passed the cookie section, the little girl asked for cookies and her mother told her no. The little girl immediately began to whine and fuss, and the mother said quietly, ""Now Monica, we just have half of the aisles left to go through - don't be upset. It won't be long."" </p>
<p>Soon, they came to the candy aisle and the little girl began to shout for candy. When told she couldn't have any, she began to cry. The mother said, ""There, there, Monica, don't cry - only two more aisles to go and then we'll be checking out."" </p>
<p>When they got to the checkout stand, the little girls immediately began to clamor for gum and burst into a terrible tantrum upon discovering there'd be no gum purchased. The mother patiently said, ""Monica, we'll be through this check out stand in 5 minutes and then you can go home and have a nice nap."" </p>
<p>The man followed them out to the parking lot and stopped the woman to compliment her. ""I couldn't help noticing how patient you were with little Monica,"" he began. </p>
<p>The mother replied, ""I'm Monica - my little girl's name is Tammy.""</p>

45921,"<p>A big-city California lawyer went duck hunting in rural Texas. </p>
<p>He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence. </p>
<p>As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. </p>
<p>The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell into this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it.""</p>
<p>The old farmer replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here.""</p>
<p>The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own.""</p>
<p>The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we do things in Texas. We settle small disagreements like this with the Texas Three-Kick-Rule.""</p>
<p>The lawyer asked, What is the Texas Three-Kick-Rule?.""</p>
<p>The farmer replied, ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up.""</p>
<p>The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. </p>
<p>The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. </p>
<p>His second kick nearly wiped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on this belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up.</p>
<p>The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get to his feet and said, ""OK, you old coot! Now it's my turn."" </p>
<p>The old farmer smiled and said, ""No I give up, you can have the duck.""</p>

45926,"<p>Teaching Math in 1950: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for<br /> $100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price. What is his<br /> profit?</p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1960: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for<br /> $100. His cost of production is 4/5 of the price, or $80. What<br /> is his profit?</p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1970: A logger exchanges a set ""L"" of lumber<br /> for a set ""M"" of money. The cardinality of set ""M"" is 100. Each<br /> element is worth one dollar. Make 100 dots representing the<br /> elements of the set ""M"". The set ""C"", the cost of production,<br /> contains 20 fewer points than set ""M."" Represent the set ""C"" as<br /> a subset of set ""M"" and answer the following question: What is<br /> the cardinality of the set ""P"" for profits?</p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1980: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for<br /> $100. Her cost of production is $80 and her profit is $20. Your<br /> assignment: Underline the number 20.</p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1990: By cutting down beautiful forest trees,<br /> the logger makes $20. What do you think of this way of making a<br /> living? Topic for class participation after answering the<br /> question: How did the forest birds and squirrels feel as the<br /> logger cut down the trees?... There are no wrong answers.</p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1996: By laying off 40% of its loggers, a<br /> company improves its stock price from $80 to $100. How much<br /> capital gain per share does the CEO make by exercising his stock<br /> options at $80? Assume capital gains are no longer taxed,<br /> because this encourages investment.</p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1997: A company out-sources all of its loggers.<br /> The firm saves on benefits, and when demand for its product is<br /> down, the logging work force can easily be cut back. The average<br /> logger employed by the company earned $50,000, had three weeks<br /> vacation, a nice retirement plan and medical insurance. The<br /> contracted logger charges $50 an hour. Was outsourcing a good<br /> move?</p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1998: A laid-off logger with four kids at home<br /> and a ridiculous alimony from his first failed marriage comes<br /> into the logging-company corporate offices and goes postal,<br /> mowing down 16 executives and a couple of secretaries, and gets<br /> lucky when he nails a politician on the premises collecting his<br /> kickback. Was outsourcing the loggers a good move for the<br /> company? </p>

He decided to bestow it with abundant wildlife - mountain sheep, grizzly bears, salmon and other unique and amazing creatures. As a backdrop God decided that some of the most majestic mountains, creeks and rivers are required. He then decided that this place should be called Canada and that the people inhabiting this area should be called Canadians and be the envy of all nations on the planet earth. At this point one of his angels asked ""Don't you think you are being a bit generous to these Canadians?"" To which God replied ""No, you should see the neighbours I am giving them""</p>

He winked at me and said,"" You must have<br /> been quite a kid."" When I got married and went on my honeymoon, I took my dog<br /> with me. I told the hotel clerk that I wanted a room for my wife and me, and<br /> another room for Sex. He said,� As long as you pay your bill, we don't care what<br /> you do."" I said,� Look, you don't understand, Sex keeps me up at night."" The<br /> clerk said, ""Funny, I have the same problem."" Then I wanted to enter Sex into a<br /> competition. Just before the judges came around, the dog ran away. Another dog<br /> owner came over and asked me what was wrong. I said,""Sex ran away."" He said,�<br /> What?"" I told him that I wanted to have sex in the contest. He said, ""You'll<br /> clean up!"" ""No you don't understand, I wanted to have Sex on the T.V, I am<br /> taping it at home."" He said, ""You know, they do have that stuff on cable these<br /> days."" Then my wife and I decided to separate. So we went to court to fight for<br /> custody of the dog. I said to the judge, ""Your honor, I have had Sex since<br /> before we were married."" The judge replied,"" This is no confessional. Please<br /> stick to the facts."" Then I told him, after I was married, Sex kind of left me.<br /> The judge said, ""Yeah, me too"". Well then last night, Sex got out and ran away<br /> again. So I went looking for him. I just about found him in an alley, when a<br /> police car pulled up. The officer asked me what I was doing. I said, ""Looking<br /> for Sex."" My case comes up a week from tomorrow.</p>

<p>She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the custodian. She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every day.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how difficult it was to clean the mirrors. She asked the custodian to clean one of the mirrors. He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it into the toilet, and then cleaned the mirror.</p>
