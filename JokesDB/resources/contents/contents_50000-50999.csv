50000,"<p>You don't know Jack Schitt!</p>
<p>When someone says ""You don't know Jack Schitt"", well, now you'll know the entire story.</p>
<p>Jack Schitt was the only son of Owe Schitt and Awe Schitt. Owe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married Awe Schitt, who later ran a country hotel.. The Kneedeep Inn.</p>
<p>Jack Schitt eventually married Noe Schitt and together they produced six children.</p>
<p>Sadly, their first child, Holy Schitt, passed away shortly after birth. Next came twin sons, Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt. Then they had twin daughters, Fulla Schitt and Givva Schitt. Their last child was a son, Bull.</p>
<p>As time went on, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. Deep Schitt's twin brother, Dip Schitt, married Lotta schitt, who gave birth to a son, Chicken Schitt. Fulla Schitt and Givva Schitt married the Happens brothers.</p>
<p>The Schitt-Happens children are Dawg Schitt, Byrd Schitt and Hawse Schitt.</p>
<p>Bull Schitt recently married a spicy Italian number, Pisa Schitt and together they await the birth of their first child, Baby Schitt.</p>
<p>So the next time someone says, ""You don't know Jack Schitt!"" you can say ""Not only do I know Jack Schitt, but the whole damn family as well!""</p>

50008,"<p>A guy is caught by a ranger eating a bald eagle and is consequently<br /> put in jail for the crime. On the day of his trail, the conversation<br /> went something like this:</p>
<p>Judge: ""Do you know that eating a bald eagle is a federal offense?""<br /> Man: ""Yes I did. But if you let me argue my case, I'll explain what<br /> happened."" </p>
<p>Judge: ""Proceed.""<br /> Man: ""I got lost in the woods. I hadn't had anything to eat for two weeks. I was so hungry. Next thing I see is a Bald Eagle swooping down at the lake for some fish.</p>
<p>I knew that if I followed the Eagle I could maybe steal the fish. Unfortunately, in the process of taking the fish I killed the Eagle. I figured that since I killed the Eagle I might as well eat it since it would be more disgraceful to let it rot on the ground.""</p>
<p>Judge: ""The court will take a recess while we analyze your testimony.""</p>
<p>15 minutes goes by and the judge returns.</p>
<p>Judge: ""Due to the extreme circumstance you were under and because you<br /> didn't intend to kill the Eagle, the court will dismiss the charges.<br /> But if you don't mind the court asking, what does a Bald Eagle taste<br /> like?""</p>
<p>Man: ""Well your honor, it is hard to explain. The best I can<br /> describe it is maybe a combination between a California Condor and a<br /> Spotted Owl.""</p>

<p>She said that was good, and for some reason she said we needed a new cuckoo clock.

<p>It was the madman's turn to take the test.</p>
<p>After a grueling 4 hours of testing, the examining officer said, ""Well, you've passed four of the five tests. I'm very impressed.</p>
<p>However, the last test is the hardest of all.""</p>
<p>The examiner led the man to a dark room, switched on a<br /> flashlight, and pointed it at a light bulb hanging from the<br /> ceiling. ""For your fifth test, you must walk on the beam of light and change the bulb.""</p>

<p>After he was done with that, like any normally functioning person, he really had to go. So he asked the bartender where the bathroom was, and he went to where he thought it was.</p>
<p>Later that night, Bob was laying in bed trying to go to sleep, and he was thought, ""wait a minute.. there was a golden toilet!!"" Right then he got up and went out to find the special toilet. He had hit 5 bars that night, so he went to the first one, asked where the bathroom was, when he went and looked, there was no golden toilet.</p>
<p>This continued until he got to the last bar, he was really tired by then, and rather then going to look for the toilet himself, he asked the bartender, ""do you by any chance have a golden toilet here?"" and the bartender said to another person that was there, ""hey!

50044,"<p>""It seemed like a great idea, except that we forgot  that Grandma and Grandpa would be there... ""As a joke, my brother used to hang a pair of panty hose over his fireplace before Christmas.  He said all he wanted was for Santa to fill them.  What they say about Santa checking the list twice must be true, because every Christmas morning, although Jay's kids' stockings were overflowed, his poor panty hose hung sadly empty and grew increasingly threadbare. One year, I decided to make his dream come true.  I put on sunglasses and a fake beard and went in search of an inflatable love doll.  Of course, they don't sell those things at Wal-mart.  I had to go to an adult bookstore downtown.  If you've never been in an X-rated store, don't go.  You'll only confuse yourself.  I was there almost three hours saying things like, ""What does this do?""  ""You're kidding me!""  ""Who owns that?""  ""Do you have their phone number?""Finally, I made it to the inflatable doll section.  I wanted to buy a standard, uncomplicated doll suitable for a night of romance, that could also substitute as a passenger in my truck, so I could use the car pool lane during rush hour.  I'm not sure what a complicated doll is.  Perhaps one that is subject to wild mood shifts and using a French accent for no reason at all.  (That also describes a few ex-girlfriends.) Finding what I wanted was difficult.  Love dolls come in many different models.  The top of the line, according to the side of the box, could do things I'd only seen in a book on animal husbandry.  I figured the expensive options were features Jay could live without, so I settled for ""Lovable Louise.""  She was at the bottom of the price scale. On Christmas Eve, with the help of an old bicycle pump, Louise came to life.  My sister-in-law was in on the plan and cleverly left the front door key hidden under the mat.  In the wee morning hours, long after Santa had come and gone, I snuck into the house and filled the dangling panty hose with Louise's pliant legs and bottom. I also ate some cookies and drank what remained of a glass of milk on a nearby tray.  Then I let myself out, went home, and giggled for a couple of hours. The next morning, my brother called to say that Santa had been to his house and left a present that had made him VERY happy but had left the dog confused.  He would bark, start to walk away, then come back and bark some more.  I suggested he purchase an inflatable Lassie to set Rover straight. We also agreed that Louise should remain in her panty hose so the rest of the family could admire her when they came over for the traditional Christmas dinner.  It seemed like a great idea, except that we forgot that Grandma and Grandpa would be there...My grandmother noticed Louise the moment she walked in the door.  ""What the hell is that?"" she asked.  My brother quickly explained. ""It's a doll."" ""Who would play with something like that?"" Granny snapped.  I had several candidates in mind, but kept my mouth shut.  ""Where are her clothes?""  Granny continued.  I hadn't seen any in the box, but I kept this information to myself. ""Boy, that turkey sure smells nice, Gran,"" Jay said, trying to steer her to the dining room.  But Granny was relentless. ""Why doesn't she have any teeth?"" Again, I could have answered, but why would I?  It was Christmas and no one wanted to be the one to ride in the back of the ambulance saying, ""Hang on Granny, Hang on!"" My grandfather, a delightful old man with poor eyesight, sidled up to me and said,"" Hey, who's the naked gal by the fireplace?""  I told him she was Jay's friend.  A few minutes later I noticed Grandpa by the mantel, talking to Louise.  Not just talking, but actually flirting.  It was then that we realized this might be Grandpa's last Christmas at home. The dinner went well.  We made the usual small talk about who had died, who was dying, and who should be killed, when suddenly Louise made a noise that sounded a lot like my father in the bathroom in the morning. The she lurched from the panty hose, flew around the room twice, and fell in a heap in front of the sofa.  The cat screamed, I passed cranberry sauce through my nose, and Grandpa ran across the room, fell to his knees, and began administering mouth to mouth resuscitation.  My brother wet his pants and Granny threw down her napkin, stomped out of the room, went outside and sat and fumed in the car. It was indeed a Christmas to treasure and remember. Later in my brother's garage, we conducted a thorough examination to decide the cause of Louise's collapse.  We discovered that Lousie had suffered from a hot ember to the back of her right thigh.  Fortunately, thanks to a wonder drug called duct tape, we restored her to perfect health.  Louise went on to star in several bachelor party movies.  I think Grandpa still calls her whenever he can get out of the house.</p>

50061,"<p>Geekonics<br /> By John Woestendiek<br /> Philadelphia Inquirer<br /> Wed., January 8, 1997</p>
<p>NEWS BULLETIN: Saying it will improve the education of children who have grown up immersed in computer lingo, the school board in San Jose, Calif., has officially designated computer English, or ""Geekonics"", as a second language.</p>
<p>The historic vote on Geekonics -- a combination of the word ""geek"" and the word ""phonics"" -- came just weeks after the Oakland school board recognized black English, or Ebonics, as a distinct language.</p>
<p>""This entirely reconfigures our parameters,"" Milton ""Floppy"" Macintosh, chairman of Geekonics Unlimited, said after the school board became the first in the nation to recognize Geekonics.</p>
<p>""No longer are we preformatted for failure,"" Macintosh said during a celebration that saw many Geekonics backers come dangerously close to smiling. ""Today, we are rebooting, implementing a program to process the data we need to interface with all units of humanity.""</p>
<p>Controversial and widely misunderstood, the Geekonics movement was spawned in California's Silicon Valley, where many children have grown up in households headed by computer technicians, programmers,<br /> engineers and scientists who have lost ability to speak plain English and have inadvertently passed on their high-tech vernacular to their children.</p>
<p>HELPING THE TRANSITION</p>
<p>While schools will not teach the language, increased teacher awareness of Geekonics, proponents say, will help children make the transition to standard English. Those students, in turn, could possibly help their parents learn to speak in a manner that would lead listeners to believe that they have actual blood coursing through their veins.</p>
<p>""Bit by bit, byte by byte, with the proper system development, with nonpreemptive multitasking, I see no reason why we can't download the data we need to modulate our oral output,"" Macintosh said.</p>
<p>The designation of Ebonics and Geekonics as languages reflects a growing awareness of our nation's lingual diversity, experts say.  Other groups pushing for their own languages and/or vernaculars to be declared official viewed the Geekonics vote as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>""This is just, like, OK, you know, the most totally kewl thing, like, ever,"" said Jennifer Notat-Albright, chairwoman of the Committee for the Advancement of Valleyonics, headquartered in Southern California. ""I mean, like, you know?"" she added.</p>
<p>THEY'RE HAPPY IN DIXIE</p>
<p>""Yeee-hah,"" said Buford ""Kudzu"" Davis, president of the Dixionics Coalition. ""Y'all gotta know I'm as happy as a tick on a sleeping bloodhound about this. We could be fartin' thru silk perty soon.""</p>
<p>Spokesmen for several subchapters of Dixionics � including Alabonics, Tennesonics and Louisionics -- also said they approved of the decision.</p>
<p>Bill Flack, public information officer for the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Bureaucratonics said that his organization would not comment on the San Jose vote until it convened a summit meeting, studied the impact, assessed the feasibility, finalized a report and drafted a comprehensive action plan, which, once it clears the appropriate subcommittees and is voted on, will be made public to those who submit the proper information-request forms.</p>
<p>Proponents of Ebonics heartily endorsed the designation of Geekonics as an official language.</p>
<p>""I ain't got no problem wif it,"" said Earl E. Byrd, president of the Ebonics Institute. ""You ever try talkin' wif wunna dem computer dudes? Don't matter if it be a white computer dude or a black computer dude; it's like you be talkin' to a robot -- RAM, DOS, undelete, MegaHertZ. Ain't nobody understands. But dey keep talkin' anyway. 'Sup wif dat?""</p>
<p>Those involved in the lingual diversity movement believe that only by enacting many different English languages, in addition to all the foreign ones practiced here, can we all end up happily speaking the same boring one, becoming a nation that is both unified in its diversity, and diversified in its unity.</p>
<p>Others say that makes no sense at all. In any language.</p>

50081,"<p>Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling<br /> event. It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for<br /> the gold medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler's<br /> trainer comes to him and says, ""Now don't forget all the<br /> research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match<br /> because of this ""pretzel"" hold he has. Whatever you do, don't<br /> let him get you in this hold! If he does, you're finished!""</p>
<p>The wrestler nods in agreement.</p>
<p>Now, to the match: The American and the Russian circle each<br /> other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the<br /> Russian lunges forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him<br /> up in the dreaded pretzel hold. A sigh of disappointment goes up<br /> from the crowd, and the trainer buries his face in his hands for<br /> he knows all is lost. He can't watch the ending.</p>
<p>Suddenly there's a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the<br /> trainer raises his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up<br /> in the air. The Russian's back hits the mat with a thud, and the<br /> American weakly collapses on top of him, getting the pin and<br /> winning the match.</p>
<p>The trainer is astounded! When he finally gets the American<br /> wrestler alone, he asks, ""How did you ever get out of that hold?<br /> No one has ever done it before!"" The wrestler answers, ""Well, I<br /> was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the<br /> last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right<br /> in front of my face. I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my<br /> last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those<br /> babies just as hard as I could. You'd be amazed how strong you<br /> get when you bite your own balls!""</p>

Tell you what, let's drink a little<br /> right now while waiting for the cops."" </p>
<p>""Oh, no I couldn't, replies the catholic, but after pressuring him, the<br /> catholic preacher soon agrees. </p>
<p>The Baptist preacher takes out the wine and a couple of Dixie cups, and pours<br /> a little into each. The catholic preacher drinks it down quickly. ""That wasn't<br /> that bad, you're right,"" the catholic preacher says. Noticing the Baptist hasn't<br /> drank his wine, he asks, ""Aren't you going to have some?"" </p>

50104,"<p>Introductory Chemistry was taught at Duke University for many years by professor Bonk. One year, two guys took the class and did pretty well on all the quizzes and mid-terms--so much so that going into the final, they each had a solid A. These two friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week, despite the Chemistry final being on Monday, they decided to go to the Uuniversity of Virginina to party with some friends.They did this and had a great time. However, with their hangovers and tiredness, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found professor Bonk after the final and explained to him how they missed the final. They told him they went up to the University of Virgina for the weekend and had planned to come back in time to study, but they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare. They couldn't fix it for a long time and were late getting back to campus.Bonk thought this over and agreed that they could take the final the following day. The two guys, elated and relieved, studied that night and went in the next day at the time that Bonk had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet. He told them to begin.They looked at the first problem which was something simple about molarity and solutions; it was worth 5 points. ""Cool,"" they thought, ""this is going to be an easy final"". They then turned the page. They were unprepared, however, for what they saw on it. The question contained only two words: (95 points) Which tire?</p>

The lawyer was then approached by Satan, who told him that he would<br /> be able to arrange his appeal to be heard in just a few days, but only if the<br /> attorney stipulated to change the venue to Hell. When the attorney inquired as<br /> to why appeals could be heard so much faster in Hell, Satan gleefully exclaimed,<br /> ""Who do you think has all of the judges!""</p>

50127,"<p>News Release: Teacher Arrested</p>
<p>At New York's Kennedy airport today, an individual later discovered to be a public school teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a set square, a slide rule, and a calculator. At a morning press conference, Attorney general John Ashcroft said he believes the man is a member of the notorious al-gebra movement.</p>
<p>He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.</p>
<p>""Al-gebra is a fearsome cult,"" Ashcroft said. ""They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value.</p>
<p>They use secret code names like 'x'and 'y' and refer to themselves as 'unknowns', but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'there are 3 sides to every triangle'.""</p>
<p>When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, ""If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes.""</p>

<p>1.  If you think the way to a man's heart is through his stomach you're<br />     aiming too high.</p>
<p>2.  Women don't make fools of men -- most of them are the<br />     do-it-yourself types.</p>
<p>3.  The best reason to divorce a man is a health reason: you're sick of<br />     him.</p>
<p>4.  Never trust a man who says he's the boss at home. He probably lies<br />     about other things too.</p>
<p>5.  A woman's work that is never done is the stuff she asked her<br />     husband to do.</p>
<p>6.  If you want a nice man go for a bald one -- they try harder.</p>
<p>7.  Go for younger men. You might as well -- they never mature anyway.</p>
<p>8.  A man who can dress himself without looking like Wurzel Gummidge is<br />     unquestionably gay.</p>
<p>9.  Men are all the same -- they just have different faces so you can<br />     tell them apart.</p>
<p>10. Definition of a man with manners -- he gets out of the bath to pee.</p>
<p>11. Whenever you meet a man who would make a good husband, you will<br />     usually find that he is.</p>
<p>12. Scientists have just discovered something that can do the work of<br />     five men -- a woman.</p>
<p>13. There are a lot of words you can use to describe men -- strong,<br />     caring, loving -- they'd be wrong but you could still use them.</p>
<p>14. Men are like animals -- messy, insensitive and potentially violent<br />     -- but they make great pets.</p>
<p>15. Men's brains are like the prison system -- not enough cells per<br />     man.</p>

<p>They finally get her into the president's office and he asks her how much she would like to deposit. She says she has $165,000 and then dumps it out of the bag onto his desk. </p>
<p>The president was surprised and of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asks her. The old lady says, ""I make bets"". </p>
<p>The president replies, ""Bets? What kind of bets?"" and she says, ""for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square"". ""Ha!"" says the president, ""That's a stupid bet, you can never win that kind of bet"". </p>
<p>The old lady says, ""So, would you like to take my bet?"" ""Sure,"" says the president, ""I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!"" </p>
<p>The little old lady says ""OK, but since there is a lot of money involved is it Ok with you if I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 AM to witness?"" </p>
<p>""Sure"" says the president. </p>
<p>That night the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls. Turning from side to side, again and again, thoroughly checking them out until he was sure that there is no way his balls are square and that he will win the bet. </p>
<p>The next morning at 10 AM the little old lady appears with her lawyer at the president's office. She introduces the lawyer to the president and repeats the bet, that $25,000 says the president's balls are square.</p>
<p>The president agrees with the bet again and the old lady asks him to drop his pants so they can see. </p>
<p>The president does this. </p>
<p>The little old lady looks closely at his balls and then asks if she can feel them. ""Well, OK"" says the president, $25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure"". </p>
<p>Then he notices that the lawyer is quietly banging his head against the wall and he asks the old lady , ""What is wrong with your lawyer?"" </p>

Then he lit a match and put it under the birds right foot.  Sure enough, the parrot began to sing 'Jingle Bells.'  Then he put the match under the bird's left foot, and it began to sing 'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.'  ''That's incredible! Does he do anything else?'' the wife asked.  ''I don't know, lets see.'' replied the man.    So he lit another match and put it between the birds legs.

50161,"<p>A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he could get in nine holes before he had to head home. Just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone. Not being able to say no, he allowed the old gent to join him. To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball - and directly between his ball and the green. After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, ""You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree."" With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay. The old man offered one more comment, ""Of course, when I was your age that pine tree was only three feet tall.""</p>

As he entered the  classroom,  he saw ten stands with ten birds over each bird and  only the  legs showing.He sat right in the front row because he wanted to do  the  best job possible. The professor announced that the  test  would be to look at each set of bird legs and give the common  name, habitat, genus, species, and identifying  characteristic.The student looked at each set of bird legs. They all  looked  the same to him. He began to get upset. He had stayed  up all  night studying, and now he had to identify birds by  their  legs.

50194,"<p>Every time a new Pope is elected, there are many rituals and ceremonies to perform, in accordance with tradition.</p>
<p>But there's one tradition that very few people know about...<br /> Shortly after the new Pope is enthroned, the Chief Rabbi seeks an audience. He is shown into the Pope's presence, whereupon he presents him with a silver tray bearing a velvet cushion. On top of the cushion is an ancient, shriveled parchment envelope. The Pope symbolically stretches out his arm in a gesture of rejection. The Chief Rabbi then retires, taking the envelope with him and does not return until the next Pope is elected.</p>
<p>John Paul II was intrigued by this ritual, whose origins were unknown to him. He instructed the best scholars of the Vatican to research it, but they came up with nothing. When the time came and the Chief Rabbi was shown into his presence, he faithfully enacted the ritual rejection but, as the Chief Rabbi turned to leave, he called him back.</p>
<p>""My brother,"" the Holy Father whispered, ""I must confess that we Catholics are ignorant of the meaning of this ritual enacted for centuries between us and you, the representative of the Jewish people. I have to ask you, what is it all about?""</p>
<p>The Chief Rabbi shrugs and replies: ""But we have no more idea than you do. The origin of the ceremony is lost in the mists of ancient history.""</p>
<p>The Pope said: ""Let us retire to my private chambers and enjoy a glass of wine together, then, with your agreement, we shall open the envelope and discover at last the secret."" The Chief Rabbi agreed.</p>
<p>Fortified in their resolve by the wine, they gingerly pried open the parchment envelope and with trembling fingers, the Chief Rabbi reached inside and extracted a folded sheet of similarly ancient paper. As the Pope peered over his shoulder, he slowly opened it. They both gasped with shock.</p>
<p>It was the check for the Last Supper.</p>

Dad - ''Well, it wasn't there yesterday, and you drove the car last night, and no one has driven it since. How can you explain the scratch?''Son - ''Well, as I've said before, I have no recollection of scratching the car. While it is true that I did take the car out last night, I did not scratch it.''Dad - ''But your sister, Monica, has told me she saw you back the car against the mailbox at the end of the driveway, heard a loud scraping sound, saw you get out to examine the car, and then drive away. So again I'll ask you, yes or no, did you scratch the car?''Son - ''Oh, you mean you think you have evidence to prove I scratched it. Well, you see, I understood you to mean did ''I'' scratch the car. I stand by my earlier statement, that I did not scratch the car.''Dad - ''Are you trying to tell me you didn't drive the car into the mailbox?''Son - ''Well, you see sir, I was trying to drive the car into the street. I mishandled the steering of the car, and it resulted in direct contact with the mailbox, though that was clearly not my intent.''Dad- ''So you are saying that you did hit the mailbox?''Son - ''No sir, that's not my statement. I'll refer you back to my original statement that I did not scratch the car.''Dad - ''But the car did hit the mailbox and the car did get scratched as a result of this contact?''Son - ''Well yes, I suppose you could look at it that way.''Dad - ''So you lied to me when you said you did not scratch the car?''Son - ''No! No, that's not correct. Your question was ''Did I scratch the car?'' From a strict legal definition, as I understood the meaning of that sentence, I did not scratch the car...the mailbox did...I was merely present when the scratching occurred. So my answer of ''No'' when you asked ''Did I scratch the car'' was legally correct, although I did not volunteer information.''Dad - ''Where did you learn to talk like a complete idiot?''Son - ''From the President of the United States.''</p>

50232,"<p>Here's something that ran in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on 2/24/97. The author is Ethel Morgan Smith of West Virginia University.        'Be Black for Me'I am glad February is almost over. It's during this month that everyone is looking for me - or rather, anyone who can come and be black for them.  I'm the only African-American professor in my university department of 50 faculty members. I reside in a world that is predominantly white and male: a land-grant state university with about 20,000 students, 5 percent of whom are African-Americans.During February, my mailbox is overflowing.  Most of the mail wants me to represent 'my people' for some worthwhile organization during the month of February and February only. Sometimes the tone is pleasant. I generally accept those. Most often the tone is not pleasant.  I group the mail into categories of 'accept for sure,' 'decline for sure,' 'maybe' and 'I'll get back  to you.' I've had letters that point out (if not in so many words) that their tax dollars pay my salary and they rightfully deserve a piece of me.  The least I can do, these letters imply, is come and be black for them.  I dump those requests in my recycling bin.I also get numerous calls. A pleasant woman from the arts council needed someone to attend her luncheon book-club meeting at her house. One of my colleagues, whom I haven't even met, gave her my telephone number. Her group is thinking of including a black writer on its reading list next year. I accept her pleasant invitation. It doesn't conflict with my calendar. I can be black that Wednesday.Someone knocks on my door. A graduate student, white male, wants me to be a member of his thesis committee. A portion of his writing will be on the impact of contemporary African-American women authors on American literature. He's a good student. I accept and thank him for thinking of me. I want to know when I can expect some of his work.Another student drops by. She is African-American and can't decide if she's angry with me or not. Last semester I thought she was being self-righteous (as I think many students are) when she screamed at me in class for selecting a novel whose protagonist, a black man, was married to a white woman. The student said that the protagonist wasn't really black because he was married to a white woman. I blew up at her in class and asked her who made her God of Blackness? I don't think I apologized to her.  She wants to talk about what to do with the rest of her life.  I suggest improving her grades.  She leaves before I can thank her for coming.I get back to sorting the mail.  Five more organizations have submitted requests for me to come and be black.  Another knock on my door. It's two white students, male and female, from last semester's African-American literature class. They (well, he, since the male speaks for the female) liked my class and learned a lot, but thought they would offer me some advice. He tells me that the black kids, all four of them, wanted to speak too much in class when I asked for comments or specific questions about the text. I remind them that everyone was given ample opportunity to speak. The student tells me that it was also annoying that 'they' always sat together. I point out that all of the white students sat together as well. My two visitors leave.Someone else knocks on my door. It's my colleague whose office is down the hall. He calls himself a folklorist. He, too, wants me to come and be black for his group. Another colleague drops by. A white male who's fascinated by Africa wants me to know that if I have any interest in going to see my homeland, he is the man to help me get there. I tell him that Alabama is my homeland. My boss comes by next. He wants me to be a part of a new task force on diversity. I accept and thank him for thinking of me.  I have to get home. It's nearing the end of come-and-be-black-for-me month and I need my rest.</p>

Joan of Arc was cannonized by Bernard Shaw, and victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. Finally, Magna Carta provided that no man should be hanged twice for the same offense."" </p>
<p>""The Renaissance was an age in which more individuals felt the value of their human being. Martin Luther was nailed to the church door at Wittenberg for selling papal indulgences. He died a horrible death, being excommunicated by a bull. It was the painter Donatello's interest in the female nude that made him the father of the Renaissance. It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Guttenberg invented the Bible. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100-foot clipper."" </p>
<p>""The government of England was a limited mockery. Henry VIII found it difficult to walk because he had an abbess on his knee. Queen Elizabeth was the ""Virgin Queen.""

50240,"<p>The Pope and a lawyer find themselves together before the Pearly Gates. After a small quantum of time which was spent discussing their respective professions, ol' St. Peter shows up to usher them to their new Heavenly station. After passing out wings, harps, halos and such, St. Pete decides to show them to their new lodgings. Only a brief flight from the welcome, Pete brings them down on the front lawn (cloud-encrusted, natch) of a huge palatial estate with all sorts of lavish trappings. This, Pete announces, is where the lawyer will be spending eternity, (at least until the end of time..) ""Hot Dang"", the Pope says to His-self, ""If he's getting a place like this, I can hardly wait to see my digs!"". They take flight once again, and as Pete leads on, the landscape below begins to appear more and more mundane until they finally land on a street lined with Brownstone houses. Pete indicates the third walkup on the left as the Popes new domicile and turns to leave, wishing the pontiff his best. The Pope, in a mild state of astonishment, cries out ""Hey Pete! What's the deal here? You put that lawyer-feller in a beautiful estate home and I, spiritual leader of terra-firma, end up with this dive?"" Pete looks at the pontiff amusedly and replys: ""Look here old fellow, this street is practically encrusted with spiritual leaders from many times and religions. We're putting you here with them so you guys can get your dogma together. That other guy gets an estate, because he's the first (non-)damned lawyer to make it up here!!""</p>

<p>""We'll see,"" the therapist said. He directed the wife into his examining room, closed the door behind her, and told her to get undressed. Then he told her to get up onto the examining table on her stomach.</p>

""And whose clock is that<br /> one?""<br />     St. Peter responded, ""That's Abraham Lincoln's clock.

But I wasn't really<br /> sure. </p>
<p>So anyway, in the cab on the way back to his house, I said that<br /> I love him and he just put his arm around me. I didn't know what<br /> the hell that meant because you know he doesn't say it back or<br /> anything. We finally got back to his place and I was wondering<br /> if he was going to dump me! So I tried to ask him about it but<br /> he just switched on the TV. Reluctantly, I said I was going to<br /> go to sleep. Then after about 10 minutes, he joined me and we<br /> had sex. </p>
<p>But, he still seemed really distracted, so afterwards I just<br /> wanted to leave but I just cried myself to sleep. I dunno, I<br /> just don't know what he thinks anymore. I mean, do you think<br /> he's met someone else???</p>

50338,"<p>Dos amigos est�n en el estadio viendo un partido de f�tbol del equipo de su pueblo que est� m�s aburrido que una fiesta de carpetas. De repente, uno le dice al otro:</p>
<p>""�Ves ese calvo que tengo delante, �se que est� como un armario?""</p>
<p>""S�, �qu� pasa?""</p>
<p>""�Qu� te juegas a que le meto una chota en la nuca?""</p>
<p>""�Qu� dices, t�o? �Venga, me juego una cena si quieres!""</p>
<p>""Vale"".</p>
<p>El t�o levanta la mano y le zurra una al calvo que le deja marca en el cuello. �ste se da la vuelta encendido:</p>
<p>""�Ahhhh! �Qui�n ha sido? �Que me lo cargo!""</p>
<p>""�Pepeeeeeee! �Joder, cu�nto tiempo, t�o!""</p>
<p>""�Qu�? �Yo no soy Pepe!"", responde indignado el calvo.</p>
<p>""Ah, lo siento perdona. Me he confundido de persona"".</p>
<p>""Que no se repita...""</p>
<p>""Vale, vale"".</p>
<p>Pasan los minutos y el partido sigue igual de aburrido.</p>
<p>""Oye, �te juegas algo a que le doy otra a�n m�s fuerte?""</p>
<p>""Lo que quieras, t�o, me juego lo que quieras"".</p>
<p>El peg�n mira al calvo fijamente; espera a que est� distra�do y...</p>
<p>""Este es el momento"", piensa.</p>
<p>Se pone de pie, levanta la mano y le suelta una que lo tira del asiento.</p>
<p>""�AHHHHHH! �Pero bueno, qu� pasa contigo, te voy a matar!""</p>
<p>""�Pepe, co�o, a m� no me enga�as, t� eres Pepe!""</p>
<p>""�QUE NOOOOOO! �A LA MIERDAA! �QUE NO SOY PEPEEEEE!""</p>
<p>""Hostia, t�o, lo siento, estaba convencido. Ya me ha quedao claro, perdona"".</p>
<p>""GRRRR...""</p>
<p>Total que termina el partido, y cuando est�n saliendo del campo, ven un poco delante de ellos sobresalir la calva del pobre hombre.</p>
<p>""�A que le meto otra m�s fuerte?""</p>
<p>""�Qu�? Me juego si quieres la paga de la semana"".</p>
<p>""Vale. Atento"".</p>
<p>El t�o que coge carrerilla y empieza a apartar a la gente:</p>
<p>""A ver, por favor, se�ora, que voy a zurrarle al calvo. Ese perro, por favor, �de qui�n es, que molesta?""</p>
<p>En eso, sale corriendo con el pu�o cerrado alzado. La gente animando:</p>
<p>""�EH, EH, EH, EH, EH!""</p>
<p>Cuando llega donde est� el calvo, salta y le da con toda su alma en la nuca. El calvo da dos vueltas de campana; arrolla a una viejecita y se empotra contra un �rbol. Aturdido mira hacia atr�s con los ojos inyectados en sangre y murmura:</p>
<p>""�Q... Qu� co�o...!""</p>
<p>""���PEPEEEEEEE, JODER, T�O, EN EL CAMPO HE VISTO UNO QUE ERA IGUAL QUE T�!!!""</p>

50384,"<p>According to a radio report, a middle school in Oregon was faced with a unique problem. A number of girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom. That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints.<br /> Finally the principal decided that something had to be done. She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the custodian. She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every day. To demonstrate how difficult it was to clean the mirrors, she asked the custodian to clean one of the mirrors.</p>
<p>He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it into the toilet and then cleaned the mirror.</p>
<p>Since then there have been no lip prints on the mirror.</p>

50392,"<p>Dear Tech Support, </p>
<p>Last year I upgraded Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure. </p>
<p>In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization where it monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3 and Beer-bash 2.5 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected. I cannot seem to purge Wife 1.0 from my system. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 1.0 but uninstall does not work on this program. </p>
<p>Can you help me? </p>
<p>********* </p>
<p>Dear Sir- </p>
<p>This is a very common problem men complain about but is mostly due to a primary misconception. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a ""UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT"" program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by its creator to run everything. </p>
<p>It is impossible to uninstall, delete, or purge the program from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 1.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this. Some have tried to install Girlfriend 2.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than original system. Look in your manual under Warnings - Alimony/Child Support. </p>
<p>I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and just deal with the situation. Having Wife 1.0 installed myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding General Protection Faults (GPFs). You must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur. The best course of action will be to push apologize button then reset button as soon as lockup occurs. </p>
<p>System will run smooth as long as you take the blame for all GPFs. Wife 1.0 is a great program but is very high maintenance.</p>

The foundation will be glad to pay for any damages.""The lady replied, ""Nah, that's okay. We're not welcome back at Denny's anyway.""</p>

50405,"<p>Two good Montana buddies were out hunting for a cougar that was killing their sheep. They staked out an area of the woods near their fields, and waited. After a while, sure enough, there came the cougar. They patiently waited until it was close, and then they both jumped up and shot it at the same time. They couldn't tell whose bullet had taken the cougar's life! They decided to share the credit, and also to have the cougar stuffed, and they decided to take turns keeping the stuffed cougar. However, this arrangement turned out not to be to their liking. Instead, they decided to divide the stuffed cougar in two, and flip a coin for who would get which end. Bill lost, and ended up with a mounted trophy of the cougar's rear. </p>

50419,"<p>Airline employees' entertaining little quips - all real:</p>
<p>'Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane immediately.'</p>

<p>And after landing: 'Thank you for flying Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.'</p>
<p>As a plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a voice comes over the loudspeaker, 'Whoa, big fella, whoa!'</p>
<p>After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant announced, 'Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted.'</p>
<p>From an airline employee: 'Welcome aboard Flight XXX to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love more...</p>

Almost everyone had got off the plane when this little old lady walking with a cane asked him, 'Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?'<br /> 'Why no ma'am,' said the pilot, 'what is it?'<br /> The old lady said, 'Did we land or were we shot down?'</p>
<p>After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the flight attendant came on with. 'Ladies and gentleman, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate. And, once the tyre smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.'</p>

50428,"<p>There was once a COBOL programmer in the mid to late 1990s. For the sake<br /> of this story, we'll call him Jack. After years of being taken for granted<br /> and treated as a technological dinosaur by all the UNIX programmers and<br /> Client/Server programmers and Web site developers, Jack was finally<br /> getting some respect. He'd become a private consultant specializing in<br /> Year 2000 conversions. He was working short-term assignments for prestige<br /> companies, traveling all over the world on different assignments. He was<br /> working 70 and 80 and even 90 hour weeks, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>Several years of this relentless, mind-numbing work had taken its toll on<br /> Jack. He had problems sleeping and began having anxiety dreams about the<br /> Year 2000. It had reached a point where even the thought of the year 2000<br /> made him nearly violent. He must have suffered some sort of breakdown,<br /> because all he could think about was how he could avoid the year 2000 and<br /> all that came with it.</p>
<p>Jack decided to contact a company that specialized in cryogenics. He made<br /> a deal to have himself frozen until March 15th, 2000. This was very<br /> expensive process and totally automated. He was thrilled. The next thing<br /> he would know is he'd wake up in the year 2000; after the New Year<br /> celebrations and computer debacles; after the leap day. Nothing else to<br /> worry about except getting on with his life.</p>
<p>He was put into his cryogenic receptacle, the technicians set the revive<br /> date, he was given injections to slow his heartbeat to a bare minimum, and<br /> that was that.</p>
<p>The next thing that Jack saw was an enormous and very modern room filled<br /> with excited people. They were all shouting ""I can't believe it!"" and<br /> ""It's a miracle"" and ""He's alive!"". There were cameras (unlike any he'd<br /> ever seen) and equipment that looked like it came out of a science fiction<br /> movie.</p>
<p>Someone who was obviously a spokesperson for the group stepped forward.<br /> Jack couldn't contain his enthusiasm. ""It is over?"" he asked. ""Is 2000<br /> already here? Are all the millennial parties and promotions and crises all<br /> over and done with?""</p>
<p>The spokesman explained that there had been a problem with the programming<br /> of the timer on Jack's cryogenic receptacle, it hadn't been year 2000<br /> compliant. It was actually eight thousand years later, not the year 2000.<br /> But the spokesman told Jack that he shouldn't get excited; someone<br /> important wanted to speak to him.</p>
<p>Suddenly a wall-sized projection screen displayed the image of a man that<br /> looked very much like Bill Gates. This man was Prime Minister of Earth. He<br /> told Jack not to be upset. That this was a wonderful time to be alive.<br /> That there was world peace and no more starvation. That the space program<br /> had been reinstated and there were colonies on the moon and on Mars. That<br /> technology had advanced to such a degree that everyone had virtual reality<br /> interfaces which allowed them to contact anyone else on the planet, or to<br /> watch any entertainment, or to hear any music recorded anywhere.</p>
<p>""That sounds terrific,"" said Jack. ""But I'm curious. Why is everybody so<br /> interested in me?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" said the Prime Minister. ""The year 10000 is just around the<br /> corner, and it says in your files that you know COBOL.""</p>

50473,"<p>By Maki Becker Special to the Times 28 August 1996The way police told it, Southwest Los Angeles home-invasion robbery suspect Carlos Hawthorne was trying to throw detectives off his trail.Hawthorne, 20, was one of two men who allegedly invaded Vanessa Arlene Sells' home Sunday, shot her and her daughter, and fled in their 1992 Lexus.Police said Hawthorne called them about 7:30 p.m. Monday to report that he had seen three men running away from a Lexus near the 2500 block of Clyde Avenue in Culver City.Police officers from the LAPD's special-problems unit responded to Hawthorne's call and spotted the Lexus. Meanwhile, Hawthorne remained on the phone with a communications operator who was able to determine where he was calling from: a phone booth at 3560 La Cienega Blvd., less than a mile from where the car was found.The officers found Hawthorne at the phone booth, still talking to the operator and with the keys to the Lexus in his hand, and detained him. When they searched his pockets, they found a silver necklace and a bracelet that matched the description of jewelry that had been stolen from Sells' home. They later booked him on charges of robbery and attempted murder.</p>

As he was locking up to go home at the end of the day something caught his eye. There in the swamp was the lady waist deep with a gun in her hand.

50482,"<p>Stage 1 - SMARTThis is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject in the known Universe. You know you know everything and want to pass on your knowledge to anyone who will listen. At this stage you are always RIGHT. And of course the person you are talking to is very WRONG. This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are SMART.Stage 2 - GOOD LOOKINGThis is when you realise that you are the BEST LOOKING person in the entire bar and that people fancy you. You can go up to a perfect stranger knowing they fancy you and really want to talk to you. Bear in mind that you are still SMART, so you can talk to this person about any subject under the sun.Stage 3 - RICHThis is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world. You can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have an armoured truck full of money parked behind the bar. You can also make bets at this stage, because of course, you are still SMART, so naturally you will win all your bets. It doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are RICH. You will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are the BEST LOOKING person in the world.Stage 4 - BULLET PROOFYou are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone especially those with whom you have been betting or arguing. This is because nothing can hurt you. At this point you can also go up to the partners of the people who you fancy and challenge to a battle of wits or money. You have no fear of losing this battle because you are SMART, you are RICH and hell, you're BETTER LOOKING than they are anyway!Stage 5 - INVISIBLEThis is the Final Stage of Drunkenness. At this point you can do anything because NO ONE CAN SEE YOU. You dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you. You are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you. You can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still SMART you know all the words.</p>

50525,"<p>A man (Mike) and a woman (Sandra) were stranded on a deserted island for many years. They weren't really in love, but they liked one another very well. They sort of depended on one another as ""husband and wife"" in their stranded situation. </p>
<p>The morning following a bad storm, a new guy (Joe) washed up on shore. After Joe got to feeling better and had a bit of rest and food, Joe and Sandra immediately realized they shared a VERY strong attraction for one another, but they realized that certain protocols would have to be observed to not upset Mike. </p>
<p>Mike, oblivious to the pheromones floating around, was just glad to have someone new to talk to. ""This is wonderful! Now we'll be able to have three people doing 8-hour shifts in the watchtower instead of two people doing 12-hour shifts,"" Mike commented enthusiastically. Joe was only too happy to help, and in fact volunteered to do the first shift. He climbed up the tall tower and stood watch, scanning the ocean horizon for any ships. </p>
<p>Soon Mike and Sandra started placing stones in a circle in order to make a fire to cook supper. Joe yelled down, ""Hey, no screwing!"" </p>
<p>Mike and Sandra looked at each other with a question on their faces, and yelled back, ""We're not screwing!"" </p>
<p>A few minetes later, they started to put driftwood into the stone circle. Again Joe yelled down, ""Heeey, no screwing!"" </p>
<p>Again they yell back up to Joe, ""We're not screwing!"" </p>
<p>Later they started putting palm leaves on the roof of the shack to patch leaks. Once again, Joe, the new man, yelled down from high above, ""Hey, I said no screwing!!"" </p>
<p>The two below yelled back up to Joe, ""And we said we're *not* screwing! Can't you see that?"" </p>
<p>Finally Joe's eight hour shift was over and Joe climbed down from the tower and Mike started to climb up to take his place. By the time Mike got halfway up, Joe and Sandra were already screwing their brains out. </p>
<p>Once at the top, Mike turned around and looked down and said to himself, ""Son-of-a-gun. From up here it DOES look like they're screwing!""</p>

<p>El destacamento del H. Ej�rcito Mexicano que ser� enviado como refuerzo a las tropas estadounidenses estar� compuesto en su totalidad por capitalinos, a petici�n de los altos mandos militares, debido a las siguientes razones ampliamente analizadas:</p>
<p>1.- Tenemos muchos.<br /> 2.- Son altamente resistentes a los gases t�xicos (tolerancia superior a los 350 IMECA).<br /> 3.- Considerando los altos contenidos de agentes pat�genos que se incluyen en su dieta diaria, dif�cilmente ser�n susceptibles a da�os provocados por armas biol�gicas.<br /> 4.- Pueden desmantelar los tanques y veh�culos enemigos antes que �stos reaccionen, dej�ndolos parados en cuatro ladrillos.<br /> 5.- El Escuadr�n de Tragafuegos es capaz de asustar a cualquier lanzallamas afgano.<br /> 6.- Ning�n bloqueo pertrechado por medios militares es m�s eficiente que una manifestaci�n de ambulantes.<br /> 7.- El H.

Q: What do physicists enjoy doing the most at baseball games?A: The 'wave'.The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center was known as SLAC, until the big earthquake, when it became known as SPLAC. SPLAC? Stanford Piecewise Linear Accelerator.A student recognizes Einstein in a train and asks: Excuse me, professor, but does New York stop by this train? Researchers in Fairbanks Alaska announced last week that they have discovered a superconductor which will operate at room temperature. The answer to the problem was ""log(1+x)"". A student copied the answer from the good student next to him, but didn't want to make it obvious that he was cheating, so he changed the answer slightly, to ""timber(1+x)"" One day in class, Richard Feynman was talking about angular momentum. He described rotation matrices and mentioned that they did not commute. He said that Sir William Hamilton discovered noncommutivity one night when he was taking a walk in his garden with Lady Hamilton. As they sat down on a bench, there was a moment of passion. It was then that he discovered that AB did not equal BA. Why did the chicken cross the road?

50640,"<p>A little boy was afraid of the dark. One night his mother told him to go<br /> out to the back porch and bring her the broom. The little boy turned to<br /> his mother and said, ""Mama, I don't want to go out there. It's dark."" </p>
<p>The mother smiled reassuringly at her son. ""You don't have to be afraid of<br /> the dark,"" she explained. ""Jesus is out there. He'll look after you and<br /> protect you."" The little boy looked at his mother real hard and asked,<br /> ""Are you sure he's out there?"" </p>
<p>""Yes, I'm sure. He is everywhere, and he is always ready to help you when<br /> you need him,"" she said. The little boy thought about that for a minute<br /> and then went to the back door and cracked it a little. Peering out into<br /> the darkness, he called, </p>

50641,"<p>Seems God was just about done creating the universe, but he had two extra<br /> things left in his bag of creations, so he decided to split them between Adam<br /> and Eve. He told the couple that one of the things he had to give away was the<br /> ability to stand up while urinating.</p>
<p>""It's a very handy thing,"" God told the couple, who he found under an apple<br /> tree. ""I was wondering if either one of you wanted that ability.""</p>
<p>Before God had a chance to explain any further, Adam jumped up and blurted,<br /> ""Oh, give that to me! I'd love to, please, oh please, oh please, let me have<br /> that ability, It'd be so great! When I'm working in the garden or naming the<br /> animals. I could just stand there and let it fly. It'd be so cool; I could write<br /> my name in the sand. Oh please God, let it be me who you give that gift to, let<br /> me stand and pee, oh please..."" Adam went on and on like an excited little boy<br /> who had to pee.</p>
<p>Eve just smiled and told God that if Adam really wanted that so badly, that he<br /> should have it. It seemed to be the sort of thing that would make him happy and<br /> she really wouldn't mind if Adam were the one given this ability.</p>
<p>And so Adam was given the ability to control the direction of his misdirection<br /> while in a vertical position. And so, he was happy and did celebrate by wetting<br /> down the bark on the tree nearest him, laughing with delight all the while. And<br /> it was good.</p>
<p>""Fine,"" God said, looking back into his bag of leftover gifts, ""What's left<br /> here? Oh yes, Multiple orgasms...""</p>

<p>She responded, ""Why, yes I do know you, Mr. Williams.I've known you since you were a young boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you."" The lawyer was stunned. </p>
<p>Not knowing what else to do,he pointed across the room and asked, ""Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?"" She again replied, ""Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy and bigoted and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he has cheated on his wife with three different women. Yes, I know him."" The defense attorney almost died. </p>
<p>The judge asked both lawyers to approach the bench, and in a very quiet voice, said, ""If either of you bastards asks her if she knows me, you'll be jailed for contempt.""</p>

A trigger happy, young, enterprising Texas Ranger decided to<br /> track down the bandit on his own and collect the reward. After a lengthy search,<br /> the Ranger tracked the bandit to his favorite cantina and snuck up behind him.<br /> At the sound of the Ranger's guns cocking and preparing to fire, the surprised<br /> bandit sped around only to see both of the Ranger's six-shooters bearing down on<br /> him. The Ranger announced, ""You're under arrest! Tell me where you hid the loot<br /> or I'll drop you where you stand,"" his finger becoming itchy on the trigger.<br /> However, the bandit didn't speak English and the Ranger didn't speak Spanish.<br /> Fortunately for the Ranger, a bilingual lawyer was present in the cantina and<br /> translated the Ranger's demand to the bandit. The terrified bandit blurted out,<br /> in Spanish, that the loot was buried next to an old oak tree behind the cantina.<br /> ""What did he say, what did he say?� the Ranger hurriedly asked. To which the<br /> lawyer replied, ""Well, the best I can make out he said ... DRAW!""</p>

<p>Our instructor was lecturing about self-examination of the breast or testicles when a female student asked another male student and me if we ever got an erection while we did self-examination of our testicles.</p>
<p>We answered that it was possible that we had. You know, you don't really want everyone to know when you get aroused.</p>
<p>She then asked, ""What do you do about it?""</p>
<p>We said in unison, ""Nothing, why?""</p>

So the army guy threw out a grenade, the priest threw out a bible, and the weight lifter threw out a weight. The plane was still falling so the three men jumped off. Tey landed safely and started walking down the street talking about what just happened. When they saw a man crying. They asked him what was wrong, and he said he got hit in the head with a weight. The men felt sorry, but nonetheless kept walking. This time they saw a little girl praying in the middle of the street. They asked her why she was praying, and she said she got hit in the head with a bible, and that it was a sign from above. They kept on walking. this time they saw a little boy laughing hysterically. they asked him why, and he said he farted and his house blew up.</p>

Bob was really worried  because he didn't think it would work, but he got in line  for bayonets, thinking he might stand a chance if he could  stab them to death. As luck would have it, Bob's turn came  and they had ran out. ''Don't worry.'' said the man issuing them out.

Now Bob is terrified, going into battle with a broom and  carrot, when the sirens go off, signaling invasion. Bob  goes out, only to be laughed at by the enemy. One enemy  even comes up to him, hoping to get a good shot at him.  Well, Bob didn't have anything to lose so he pointed at  him and said ''Bangity bangity bang!'' and the guy fell  down dead. He did the same thing with the magic carrot. Amazed at what was happening, he continued to fight. Then,  a guy came slowly up to him and he would not die. Bob tried  to shoot and stab him, but he wouldn't die. The last words  poor Bob heard as he was being trampled over were  ''Tankity tankity tank.''</p>

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that a whole lot of people were confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of No Rights. </p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE I</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to a new car, big-screen color TV or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything. </p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE II</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone -- not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc., but the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be. </p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE III</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful, do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all of your relatives independently wealthy. </p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE IV</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes. </p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE V</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just not interested in public health care. </p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE VI</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim or kill someone, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and kill you. </p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE VII</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob, cheat, or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still won't have the right to a big-screen color TV or a life of leisure. </p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE VIII</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to demand that our children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience. We hate oppressive governments and won't lift a finger to stop you from going to fight if you'd like. However, we do not enjoy parenting the entire world and do not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat.</p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE IX</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to a job. All of us sure want you to have one, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities in education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful. </p>
<p><strong>ARTICLE X</strong> </p>
<p>You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you have the right to pursue happiness -- which, by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an overabundance of idiotic laws created by those around you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.</p>

The guy is puzzled and asks her why, ""because I have found out that I can get $20 for what I give you for free,"" she answered. The woman got up and went to wait on the porch for her cab to arrive.

50719,"<p>Earthly Drug Problems </p>
<p>Jesus, in a very worried state, convened all of his apostles and disciples to an emergency meeting because of the high drug consumption problem all over the earth.<br /> After giving it much thought they reached the conclusion that in order to better deal with the problem, that they should try the drugs themselves and then decide on the correct way to proceed. It was therefore decided that a commission made up of some of the members return to earth to get the different types of drugs. </p>
<p>The secret operation is effected and two days later the commissioned disciples begin to return to heaven. Jesus, waiting at the door, lets in the first disciple: </p>
<p>''Who is it?''<br /> ''It's Paul''<br /> Jesus opens the door.<br /> ''What did you bring Paul?''<br /> ''Hashish from Morocco''<br /> ''Very well son, come in.'' </p>

50723,"<p>Once there was this little boy and he was really perverted. He<br /> liked to look up little girl's skirts. One day he had a sucker<br /> with him and he told this little girl that he would give her the<br /> sucker if she would climb to the top of the monkey bars<br /> (Unbeknownst to her, he was gonna look up her skirt). So the<br /> little girl glimbed to the top and the little boy gave her the<br /> sucker.</p>
<p>The little girl walked home that day and her mother immediately<br /> noticed the sucker hanging out of her mouth. Her mother asked<br /> her where she got the sucker and the little girl told her the<br /> story of the little boy and the monkeybars. Her mother was<br /> appalled and she scolded her little girl for falling for the<br /> trick. She said ""Don't you know that little boy was just trying<br /> to see you panties?""</p>
<p>The little girl went to school the next day and the little boy<br /> offered her another sucker in exchange for her climbing to the<br /> top of the monkey bars. She said, ""My Mommie told me that all<br /> you wanted to do was look at my panties-and I'm not going to let<br /> you!""</p>
<p>Now the little boy was determined so he offered her a whole bag<br /> of suckers and she accepted. She went home and her mother<br /> scolded her again!</p>
<p>She went to school the next day datermined that the little boy<br /> was not going to see her panties. But, he offered her 2 bags of<br /> suckers and she gave in.

After one year and $180,000.00 they concluded that the reason the head was larger than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure during sex.After the US published the study France decided to do their own. After $250,000.00, and 3 years of research, they concluded that the reason was to give the woman more pleasure during sex.Poland, unsatisfied with these findings, conducted their own study. After 2 weeks and a cost of around $75.46, they concluded that it was to keep a man's hand from flying off and hitting him in the forehead.</p>

One of<br /> their members was a thief. Hotel rooms were invaded and<br /> wallets were stolen. Then the hotel called in a detective.<br /> The detective ordered dinner in his room where he could<br /> devise a plan of capture. First, the maid came in to deliver<br /> fresh towels. Then a newlywed couple, locked in embrace,<br /> accidentially entered his room before making an apologetic<br /> departure. Next, an elderly lady knocked and entered, then<br /> apologized when she saw it was the detective's room and not<br /> hers. Then room service knocked bringing in the detective's<br /> dinner.

"
50742,"<p>The setting is a quiet and serene country stream weaving through the gentle hills of a grassy plain. All is quiet and still, and, lo, a small fly hovers a few inches above the quiet waters of the stream.</p>
<p>Beneath the water floats a small fish. The fish thinks to itself, if that fly just drops two inches, I will be able to jump out of the water and catch it.</p>
<p>Now, standing on the bank of the stream lurks a bear. The bear looks at the scene and thinks to itself,  if that fly drops just two inches, then the fish will jump out of the water to catch it, and I will be able to dash into the stream and snap up the fish in my mouth.</p>
<p>Crouching nearby the stream, in the tall grass, waits a hunter.  The hunter looks at the scene and thinks to himself, if that fly drops just two inches, then the fish will spring out of the water to catch it, then bear will dash out into the river, and I'll get a clear shot at the bear.</p>
<p>Sitting at the entrance to its hole, is a small field mouse.  Looking at the scene, the mouse thinks to itself, if that fly just drops two inches, then fish will leap out of the water, the bear will rush out at the fish, the hunter will take a shot at the bear, and I'll have just enough time to run out and grab the cheese in the hunter's sack.</p>
<p>Lazing in a tree which overhangs the river, is a cat.  The cat looks down at the scene, and thinks to itself, if that fly drops two inches, the fish will jump up to catch it, and the bear will come out to catch the fish, the hunter will take a shot at the bear, and the mouse will run to get the cheese . . . then I'll be able to pounce down onto the mouse as it leaves its hole.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the fly drops two inches . . .</p>
<p>Immediately everyone is thrown into wild furious action. The fish leaps out of the water, and snaps the fly in its mouth. The bear lunges into the stream and catches the fish in its mouth. The hunter bursts out of his grassy cover and fires at the bear. The mouse forgets totally about the cheese, and the cat gets such a fright it overbalances and falls into the stream . . .</p>
<p>What's the moral of the story?</p>

50751,"<p>Important Warning for those who have been drawn unsuspectingly into the use of bread: </p>
<p>1. More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread users. </p>
<p>2. Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread-consuming households score below average on standardized tests. </p>
<p>3. In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the average life expectancy was less than 50 years; infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever, and influenza ravaged whole nations. </p>
<p>4. More than 90 percent of violent crimes are committed within 24 hours of eating bread. </p>
<p>5. Bread is made from a substance called ""dough."" It has been proven that as little as one pound of dough can be used to suffocate a mouse. The average American eats more bread than that in one month! </p>
<p>6. Primitive tribal societies that have no bread exhibit a low incidence of cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and osteoporosis. </p>
<p>7. Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and given only water to eat begged for bread after as little as two days. </p>
<p>8. Bread is often a ""gateway"" food item, leading the user to ""harder"" items such as butter, jelly, peanut butter, and even cold cuts. </p>
<p>9. Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since the human body is more than 90 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead to your body being taken over by this absorptive food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey bread-pudding person. </p>
<p>10. Newborn babies can choke on bread. </p>
<p>11. Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 400 degrees Fahrenheit! That kind of heat can kill an adult in less than one minute. </p>
<p>12. Most American bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish between significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical babbling. </p>
<p>In light of these frightening statistics, we propose the following bread restrictions: </p>
<p>1. No sale of bread to minors. </p>
<p>2. A nationwide ""Just Say No To Toast"" campaign, complete celebrity TV spots and bumper stickers. </p>
<p>3. A 300 percent federal tax on all bread to pay for all the societal ills we might associate with bread. </p>
<p>4. No animal or human images, nor any primary colors (which may appeal to children) may be used to promote bread usage. </p>
<p>5. The establishment of ""Bread-free"" zones around schools.</p>

50752,"<p>True story:</p>
<p>About a week ago, I broke my ankle (in three places) and was in the hospital for several days. My first night in the hospital, after having surgery to rejoin my bones with pins and plates and such, I was in a great deal of pain and quite immobile. My nurse for that first night was a very nice 50ish lady with a strong German accent.</p>
<p>At one point in the middle of the night, she came in to give me a shot of morphine. She asked where I would like the shot and I pointed to my right thigh. I slid my blankets down and she lifted my gown.</p>
<p>With my gown raised, she uttered the words, ""Okay, small prick,"" and proceeded with the injection.</p>
<p>I'm still not sure whether her words were meant to warn me of the upcoming pain or as an editorial comment.</p>

50763,"<p>The Lord spoke to Noah and said, ''In six months I am going to make it rain<br /> until the whole world is covered with water and all the evil things are<br /> destroyed. But, I want to save a few good people and two of every living thing<br /> on the planet. I am ordering you to build an ark.'' And, in a flash of<br /> lightning, he delivered the specifications for the ark. ''OK,'' Noah said,<br /> trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints, ''I'm your man.'' </p>
<p>Six months passed, the sky began to cloud up, and the rain began to fall in<br /> torrents. The Lord looked down and saw Noah sitting in his yard, weeping, and<br /> there was no ark. </p>
<p>''Noah!'' shouted the Lord, ''Where is My ark?'' A lightning bolt crashed into<br /> the ground right beside Noah. </p>
<p>''Lord, please forgive me!'' begged Noah. ''I did my best, but there were some<br /> big problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the ark's construction,<br /> but Your plans did not meet their code. So, I had to hire an engineer to redo<br /> the plans, only to get into a long argument with him about whether to include a<br /> sprinkler system. </p>
<p>''My neighbors objected, claiming that I was violating zoning ordinances by<br /> building the ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city<br /> planning board. </p>
<p>Then, I had a big problem getting enough wood for the ark, because there was a<br /> ban on cutting trees to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince the<br /> environmentalists and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that I needed the wood<br /> to save the owls, but they wouldn't let me catch them, so no owls. </p>
<p>''Next, I started gathering up the animals but got sued by an animal rights<br /> group that objected to me taking along only two of each kind. </p>
<p>''Just when the suit got dismissed, the EPA notified me that I couldn't<br /> complete the ark without filling out an environmental impact statement on Your<br /> proposed flood. They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no<br /> jurisdiction over the Supreme Being. Then, the Corps of Engineers wanted a map<br /> of the proposed flood plan. I sent them a globe! </p>
<p>''Right now, I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Equal<br /> Opportunities Commission over how many minorities I'm supposed to hire. The IRS<br /> has seized all my assets claiming that I am trying to leave the country, and I<br /> just got a notice from the state that I owe some kind of use tax. Really, I<br /> don't think I can finish the ark in less than five years.'' </p>
<p>With that, the sky cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow arched<br /> across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled. ''You mean you are not going to<br /> destroy the world?'' he asked hopefully. </p>
<p>''No,'' said the Lord. ''The government already has.''</p>

The doctor replies that the illness is quite serious but can be cured with a small course of two suppositories inserted deep up the back passage. The man agrees, and so the doctor warns him of the pain, tells him to bend over, and shoves the thing way up his behind. The doctor then hands him the second dose and tells him to do the same thing in six hours time using rubber gloves and KY-Jelly or something.</p>
<p>So, the man goes home and later that evening tries to get the second suppository inserted, but he finds he cannot reach himself properly to obtain the required depth.

50770,"<p>once there was a man and a woman who decided that it was time for them to take their relationship a step higher.  It was the womans first time and she asked the man how exactly they did it.  He replied that there were several ways to do it, but one of his favorites was the woman striping slowly and then the he would kiss every inch of her body including breasts, butt, inbetween the toes, fingers, eyes, and ears.  Then the man would strip and she would do the same to him.    The woman agreed and started to slowely take off her shirt.""no no no, the man said, you have to do it while dancing a sexy dance around me.""  The woman did.  When she started to unbutton her pants, the man saw that she had unusually large breasts and as she leaned over they kind of popped out of her bra.  She got her pants off and turned around in a circle.  The man noticed that she was wearing a thong.  He liked the way that she looked and also looked forward to kissing her breasts and where the thong was going.  Before the woman unclipped her bra, she asked the man if he would be so kind as to keep the secret of what they were doing to himself and not tell anyone.  The man agreed so that she would get it off and he could get started.The next day at work, he told everyone he could find that one of the people that he worked with had had sex with him.  (the lady he was talking about was of coarse the woman)  When the lady found out, she decided to get back at him.  She walked up to him and asked if he would come into the bosses office to get intamet with him.  He was up to the challenge and she told him it was his turn to go first.  He did and before she started kissing him, she told him to turn around.  He did and she picked up his clothes and ran out.</p>

"
50772,"<p>TO: All Employees<br /> From: Management<br /> Re: Restroom Policy</p>
<p>In the past, employees were permitted to make trips to the restroom under informal guidelines. Effective Feb. 25, 1995 a Restroom Policy will be established to provide a consistant method of accounting for each employee's restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of all employees.</p>
<p>Under this policy, a ""Restroom Trip Bank"" will be established for each employee. The first day of each month, employees will be given a Restroom Trip Credit of 20 points. RTC can be accumulated from month to month.</p>
<p>Shortly, the entrances to all the restrooms will begin being equipped with personnel identification stations and computer linked voice print recognition. During the next two (2) weeks, each employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one normal and one under stress) management by Feb. 10,1995. The voice print recognition stations will be operational, but not restrictive, for the month of Feb. Employees should aquaint themselves with the stations during this period. It will be restrictive starting March 1, 1999.</p>
<p>If an employee's RTB balances at zero (0), the doors to all restrooms will not unlock for that employee's voice print until the first of the month.</p>
<p>In addition, all the restrooms are being equipped with a time paper roll retractor. If the restroom is occupied for more than three (3) minutes, an alarm will sound throughout the entire building. A computer simulated voice will be activated and announce over the public announcing system the name of the delinquent employee. Ten (10) seconds later, the roll of paper will retract, the toilet will flush and the restroom door will automatically open. If at that time, the employee still remains seated inside the stall, the restroom cameras (which will be linked to the payroll and security console) will turn on.</p>
<p>Your cooperation on this matter will be appreciated. If you have any questions about the new policy, please feel free to ask you supervisor.</p>
<p>Thank You!<br /> Management</p>

With this, the<br /> husband fell suspicious of his wife and decided to catch her in the act. The<br /> husband pretended to fall asleep while keeping an eye on his wife.<br /> ""What did Mary say to Joseph after Jesus was born?"" the preacher asked.

50799,"<p>How Specs Live ForeverThe US Standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is  4 feet, 8.5 inches.   That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used?   Because that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were built by English expatriates.  Why did the English people build them like that?  Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. Why did 'they' use that gauge then?   Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing.  Okay! Why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing?   Well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on some of the old, long distance roads, because that's the pacing of the old wheel ruts. So who built these old rutted roads?   The first long distance roads in Europe were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their legions. The roads have been used ever since.  And the ruts?   The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots.  Since the chariots were made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. Thus, we have the answer to the original questions.  The United State standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original specification for an Imperial Roman army war chariot. Specs and Bureaucracies live forever. So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's ass came up with it, you may be exactly right.  Because the Imperial Roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two war horses.</p>

<p>""Like a tight band around my head,"" replied the spinster.<br /> Mindful that this type of headache is most often due to an unhealthy or<br /> stressed lifestyle, the Doctor asked if she smoked a lot.<br /> ""Certainly not, Doctor. Never have smoked, never will,"" was the emphatic<br /> reply.</p>
<p>""Do you drink a lot of alcohol?""<br /> ""Doctor! I am strictly teetotal.""</p>
<p>""How often do you have sex?""<br /> ""That is an impertinent question; I am as chaste as the driven snow.""</p>
<p>""Perhaps you're spending too much time going to church?""<br /> ""Impossible, Doctor. As I keep telling the Mothers Union, I go twice every<br /> Sunday and every Festival Day because it is our clear duty to do so.""</p>
<p>""Are you working too hard at your charity activities?""<br /> ""Well,"" simpered the spinster, ""I always believe that you can never do too<br /> much for your fellow man, even to the detriment of your own health.""</p>
<p>""Just as I thought,"" said the Doctor, ""It is clear that the headaches are due<br /> to your halo being too tight.""</p>

50808,"<p>There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things<br /> mechanical. After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he<br /> happily retired. Several years later the company contacted him regarding a<br /> seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their<br /> multi-million dollar machines.</p>
<p>They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine to work but<br /> to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had<br /> solved so many of their problems in the past.</p>
<p>The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the<br /> huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked with a chalk a small ""x"" on<br /> a particular component of the machine and stated, ""This is where your<br /> problem is."" </p>
<p>The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company<br /> received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They<br /> demanded an itemized accounting of his charges.</p>
<p>The engineer responded briefly:</p>
<p>    One chalk mark $1<br />     Knowing where to put it $49,999</p>
<p>It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.</p>

<p>The Programmer, now somewhat agitated, says, ""O.K., if you don't know the answer you pay me $5 and if I don't know the answer I pay you $50! "" Now, that got the Engineer's attention, so he agrees to the game. The Programmer asks the first question, ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" Then Engineer doesn't say a word and just hands the Programmer $5.</p>
<p>Now, its the Engineer's turn. He asks the Programmer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down on four?"" The Programmer looks at him with a puzzled look, takes out his laptop computer, looks through all his references and after about an hour wakes the Engineer and hands the Engineer $50. The Engineer politely takes the $50 turns away and tries to return to sleep.</p>
<p>The Programmer, a little miffed, asks, ""Well what's the answer to the question?"" Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands $5 to the Programmer, turns away and returns to sleep.</p>

50866,"<p>This fundamentalist Christian couple felt it important to own an equally fundamentally Christian pet. So, they went shopping. At a kennel specializing in this particular breed, they found a dog they liked quite a lot. When they asked the dog to fetch the Bible, he did it in a flash. When they instructed him to look up Psalm 23, he complied equally fast, using his paws with dexterity. They were impressed, purchased the animal, and went home (piously, of course). That night they had friends over. They were so proud of their new fundamentalist dog and his major skills, they called the dog and showed off a little. The friends were impressed, and asked whether the dog was able to do any of the usual dog tricks, as well. This stopped the couple cold, as they hadn't thought about 'normal' tricks. ""Well,"" they said, ""let's try this out."" Once more they called out to the dog, and then clearly pronounced the command, ""Heel!"" Quick as a wink, the dog jumped up, put his paw on the man's forehead, closed his eyes in concentration, and bowed his head.</p>

<p>""No, that felt more like snow to me"", she replied. </p>
<p>""No, I'm sure it was just rain, he said"". </p>
<p>Well, as these things go, they were about to have a major argument about whether it was raining or snowing. Just then they saw a minor communist party official walking toward them. ""Let's not fight about it"", the man said, ""Let's ask Comrade Rudolph whether it's officially raining or snowing"". </p>
<p>As the official approached, the man said, ""Tell us, Comrade Rudolph, is it officially raining or snowing?""</p>
<p>""It's raining, of course"", he replied, and walked on. </p>
<p>But the woman insisted: ""I know that felt like snow!"", to which the man quietly replied: ""Rudolph the Red knows rain, dear""!</p>

50890,"<p>A big shot city lawyer and a redneck got into a car wreck on a hot summer day.<br /> The lawyer got out of his BMW and the redneck got out of his pickup to survey<br /> the damage, and the redneck realized he was at fault... ""YOU STUPID HICK!""<br /> shouted the lawyer, looking with contempt at the redneck in his dirty overalls<br /> and tangled beard. ""Hick, huh?"" though the redneck. ""How am I going to get out<br /> this?"" After looking over the handsome, impeccably dressed and dignified city<br /> lawyer in his $2,000 navy blue pinstriped suit, carefully knotted red silk tie,<br /> starched white shirt, silver cufflinks and black dress shoes polished like<br /> mirrors, $1,000 briefcase and hundred dollar haircut, the redneck walked back to<br /> his car, got out a bottle, and brought it back. Mister Hotshot was checking his<br /> suit and shoes to make sure they were not dirty. He handed it to the lawyer, and<br /> said, ""Here, you look pretty shook up. I think you ought to take a nip of this.<br /> It'll steady your nerves....IT'S HOMEMADE..."" Mister Pinstripes did, but was so<br /> angry about the wreck, he refused to speak. The redneck then said, ""You still<br /> look a little bit pale. How about another?"" And the smug, pompous lawyer took<br /> another swallow. After a few minutes, he began to feel the heat of the sun<br /> through his wool suit. Then the redneck said �It�s mighty hot today. Folks<br /> �round here don�t usually wear shoes on a day like this. Why don�t you take off<br /> them fancy shoes, and the socks, too?� </p>
<p>The lawyer frowned: ""Take off my shoes and socks? Do I LOOK like someone who<br /> would walk around barefoot? That's fine for rednecks, but not for a professional<br /> like ME! These are $500 shoes!"" </p>
<p>But after a few more sips, the redneck asked him again, and then again, and<br /> finally the lawyer let out a drunken laugh, and took off his polished shoes and<br /> socks. Then the redneck said: �Why don�t you take off that fancy tie?"" ""Take off<br /> my tie?"" said the lawyer with a sneer and slur in his voice. ""I'm a lawyer!!!""<br /> But then he looked down at his bare feet and took off his tie... </p>
<p>The redneck said: ""And the suit? You look kind of funny standing there<br /> barefoot in a suit! I got another pair of overalls you can wear while we fogger<br /> out what to do about this situation!"" </p>
<p>The lawyer tried to give him an arrogant look, but he was feeling the heat of<br /> the sun and the liquor. He tried to resist, but... </p>
<p>Off came the jacket of the $2,000 pinstriped suit. Then the white shirt.<br /> Finally, the trousers, too, and the lawyer pulled on the overalls. </p>
<p>At the urging of the redneck, the lawyer then took another sip, and another,<br /> and another. </p>
<p>The suspenders and the cufflinks and the briefcase were all in a heap now, and<br /> the lawyer was having a hard time standing up. After another half hour, the<br /> lawyer said he was feeling pretty good, and asked the redneck if he didn't think<br /> that he ought to have a little nip, too. Then he realized he couldn't find the<br /> redneck... or his expensive clothes. </p>
<p>""Not me"", the redneck replied, stepping out from behind a tree and wearing the<br /> lawyer's clothes and holding the keys to his BMW. He looked at the formerly<br /> well-dressed and dignified lawyer, barefoot in overalls and drunk as a skunk and<br /> looking like a true redneck, ""Here's the keys to my pickup. Now that I've cut ya<br /> down to size, I'm waiting for the state trooper!""</p>

<p>The scientist says to God - ""God, you know, a bunch of us have been thinking and I've come to tell you that we really don't need you anymore. I mean, we've been coming up with great theories and ideas, we've cloned sheep, and we're on the verge of cloning humans. So as you can see, we really don't need you.""</p>

<p>The scientist says, ""Sure. What kind of contest?""<br /> God: ""A man-making contest.""</p>

50930,"<p>The scene is a newspaper office. The editor says to one of his photographers, ""There's a fire raging out of control west of town, and I want you to get out there fast. And above all, get some good shots. If that means you have to hire an airplane, just do it. Don't worry about the expense."" </p>
<p>So, the reporter calls the local FBO and orders a plane. He rushes out to the airport, spots a small aircraft with a young pilot in it, pulls open the door, jumps in and says to the pilot, ""Let's go, take off.""</p>
<p>As directed, the pilot takes off, gets up to altitude, and the reporter then tells him, ""See that fire raging to the west? I want you to fly over that and get down as close as you can."" </p>
<p>Incredulous, the pilot says, ""You want me to fly over that fire?"" </p>

50932,"<p>Top 9 cartoon characters suspected of drug abuse.</p>
<p>1. GARGAMEL (From the Smurfs)<br />    Most likely LSD.  Spends his life in pursuit of little blue guys in sissy white outfits and mentally abusing his cat.  What does he plan to do with the blue dwarfs when he catches them anyway?</p>
<p>2. OLIVE OYL<br />    Probably Dexatrim abuse, maybe some amphetamines.  Who is that skinny??  She might even be anorexic, she is always giving her burger to her friend.  One  side question...what the hell are Popeye and Brutus thinking?  What is it...her personality?  NOT!</p>
<p>3. SNAGGLEPUSS<br />    Can't explain it.  Maybe it's the name, or the look, but he is suspicious.</p>
<p>4. HE-MAN<br />    This is an easy one.  I mean c'mon.  Roid monkey #1. ""BY THE POWER OF ANABOL!!!""  Makes me want to root for Skeletor.  Alone in his castle, hitting the weights.  And on top of that he even injects the shit in his pet tiger.  Can we say ""animal abuse?</p>
<p>5. YOGI AND BOO-BOO<br />    We all know what is really in those picnic baskets.  They go back to the cave and trip.  Another side?  Are they gay?  I mean, take a look a Boo-Boo.  Not that there's anything wrong with that..........</p>
<p>6. DROOPY<br />    The number one downer abuser in toon land.  Can't someone slip him an upper every year or two.  The only time I ever saw him happy is when he sees the picture of babe.  Sort of makes you wonder.</p>
<p>7. DOPEY DWARF<br />    He openly admits it.  The other dwarfs deny involvement but they are under investigation.  Allegations are that Doc is writing some extra scripts for Sneezy and all the guys partaking are afloat.</p>
<p>8. DAFFY DUCK<br />    If he isn't using crack, Merion Berry is clean.  He is so wired he bounces around on his head without pain.  Blows his beak off all the time.  Some symptoms might be from ""daffiness"" but Haldol wouldn't work for him.</p>
<p>9. SHAGGY<br />    By far the #1 suspect.  His clothes, his hair, his bad goatee, the boy converses with dogs.  But all of this is nothing until you go to the Munchie Factor.  Anybody who averages 9.3 dog treats consumed per episode does pot....no if, ands or buts about it.  And look at the way him and his friends painted that van!<br /> Pretty rad design dude</p>

50978,"<p>An old country doctor went way out to the boondocks to deliver a baby. It<br /> was so far out, there was no electricity. When the doctor arrived, no one<br /> was home except for the laboring mother and her 5-year-old child. The<br /> doctor instructed the child to hold a lantern high so he could see, while<br /> he helped the woman deliver the baby. The child did so, the mother pushed<br /> and after a little while, the doctor lifted the newborn baby by the feet<br /> and spanked him on the bottom to get him to take his first breath. The<br /> doctor then asked the 5-year-old what he thought of the baby. ""Hit him<br /> again,"" the 5-year-old said, ""he shouldn't have crawled up there in the<br /> first place!""</p>

50981,"<p>LAW 1: No matter how bad your last shot was, the worst is yet to come.</p>
<p>This law does not expire on the 18th hole, since it has the supernatural</p>
<p>tendency to extend over the course of a tournament, a summmer and,</p>
<p>eventually, a lifetime.</p>
<p>LAW 2: Your best round of golf will be followed almost immediately by your</p>
<p>worst round ever. The probability of the latter increases with the number</p>
<p>of people you tell about the former.</p>
<p>LAW 3: Brand new golf balls are water-magnetic. Though this cannot be</p>
<p>proven in the lab, it is a known fact that the more expensive the golf</p>
<p>ball, the greater its attraction to water.</p>
<p>LAW 4: Golf balls never bounce off of trees back into play. If one does,</p>
<p>the tree is breaking a law of the universe and should be cut down.</p>
<p>LAW 5: No matter what causes a golfer to muff a shot, all his playing</p>
<p>partners must solemnly chant ""You looked up,"" or invoke the wrath of the</p>
<p>universe.</p>
<p>LAW 6: The higher a golfer's handicap, the more qualified he deems himself</p>
<p>as an instuctor.</p>
<p>LAW 7: Every par-three hole in the world has a secret desire to humiliate</p>
<p>golfers. The shorter the hole, the greater its desire.</p>
<p>LAW 8: Topping a 3-iron is the most painful torture known to man.</p>
<p>LAW 9: Palm trees eat golf balls.</p>
<p>LAW 10: Sand is alive. If it isn't, how do you explain the way it works</p>
<p>against you?</p>
<p>LAW 11: Golf carts always run out of juice at the farthest point from the</p>
<p>clubhouse.</p>
<p>LAW 12: A golfer hitting into your group will always be bigger than anyone</p>
<p>in your group. Likewise, a group you accidentally hit into will consist of</p>
<p>a football player, a professional wrestler, a convicted murderer and an IRS</p>
<p>agent -- or some similar combination.</p>
<p>LAW 13: All 3-woods are demon-possessed.</p>
<p>LAW 14: Golf balls from the same ""sleeve"" tend to follow one another,</p>
<p>particularly out of bounds or into the water (see Law three)</p>
<p>LAW 15: A severe slice is a thing of awesome power and beauty.</p>
<p>LAW 16: ""Nice lag"" can usually be translated to ""lousy putt."" Similarly,</p>
<p>""tough break"" can usually be translated ""way to miss an easy one, sucker.""</p>
<p>LAW 17: The person you would most hate to lose to will always be the one</p>
<p>who beats you.</p>
<p>LAW 18: The last three holes of a round will automatically adjust your</p>
<p>score to what it really should be.</p>
<p>LAW 19: Golf should be given up at least twice per month.</p>
<p>LAW 20: All vows taken on a golf course shall be valid only until the</p>

50991,"<p>In an ancient monastery in a far away place, a new monk arrived to join<br /> his brothers in copying books and scrolls in the monastery's scriptorium.<br /> He was assigned to be a rubricator on copies of books that had already<br /> been copied by hand.</p>
<p>One day, he asked Father Florian (the head of the scriptorium), ""Does not<br /> the copying by hand of other copies allow for error? How do we know we are<br /> not copying the mistakes of someone else? Are they ever checked against he<br /> original?"" Fr. Florian was taken aback by the observation of this youthful<br /> monk. ""A very good point, my son. I will take one of the latest books down<br /> to the vault and compare it against the original."" Fr. Florian went down<br /> to the vault and began his verification.</p>
<p>After a day had passed, the monks began to worry and went down looking for<br /> the old priest. They were sure something must have happened. As they<br /> approached the vault, they heard crying. When they opened the door, they<br /> found Fr. Florian sobbing over the new copy and the original ancient book,<br /> both of which were opened before him on the table. It was obvious to all<br /> that the poor man had been crying his heart out for a long time.</p>
<p>""What is the problem, Reverend Father?"" asked one of the monks. ""Oh, my<br /> Lord,"" sobbed the priest, ""the word is 'celebrate'.""</p>

50997,"<p>A new missionary recruit went to Venezuela for the first time.<br /> He was struggling with the language and didn't understand a<br /> whole lot of what was going on. Intending to visit one of the<br /> local churches, he got lost, but eventually got back on track<br /> and found the place. Having arrived late, the church was already<br /> packed. The only pew left was the one on the front row.</p>
<p>So as not to make a fool of himself, he decided to pick someone<br /> out of the crowd to imitate. He chose to follow the man sitting<br /> next to him on the front pew. As they sang, the man clapped his<br /> hands, so the missionary recruit clapped too. When the man stood<br /> up to pray, the missionary recruit stood up too. When the man<br /> sat down, he sat down. When the man held the cup and bread for<br /> the Lord's Supper, he held the cup and bread. During the<br /> preaching, the recruit didn't understand a thing. He just sat<br /> there and tried to look just like that man in the front pew.</p>
<p>Then he perceived that the preacher was giving announcements.<br /> People clapped, so he looked to see if the man was clapping. He<br /> was, and so the recruit clapped too. Then the preacher said some<br /> words that he didn't understand and he saw the man next to him<br /> stand up. So he stood up too. Suddenly a hush fell over the<br /> entire congregation. A few people gasped. He looked around and<br /> saw that nobody else was standing. So he sat down.</p>
<p>After the service ended, the preacher stood at the door shaking<br /> the hands of those who were leaving. When the missionary recruit<br /> stretched out his hand to greet the preacher, the preacher said,<br /> in English: ""I take it you don't speak Spanish.""</p>
<p>The missionary recruit replied: ""No I don't. It's that obvious?""</p>
<p>""Well yes,"" said the preacher, ""I announced that the Acosta<br /> family had a newborn baby boy and would the proud father please<br /> stand up.""</p>
