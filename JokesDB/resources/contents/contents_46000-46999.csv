<p>""Well, I do have a double room with one occupant,"" admitted the manager, ""and he might be glad to split the cost. But to tell you the truth, he snores so loudly that people in adjoining rooms have complained in the past. I'm not sure it'd be worth it to you."" </p>

46019,"<p>UNIX AirwaysEveryone brings one piece of the plane along when they come to the airport. They all go out on the runway and put the plane together piece by piece, arguing non-stop about what kind of plane they are supposed to be building. Air DOSEverybody pushes the airplane until it glides, then they jump on and let the plane coast until it hits the ground again. Then they push again, jump on again, and so on ... Mac AirlinesAll the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look and act exactly the same. Every time you ask questions about details, you are gently but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to know, are to stupid to know, and everything will be done for you without your ever having to know, so just shut up. Windows AirThe terminal is pretty and colorful, with friendly stewards, easy baggage check and boarding, and a smooth take-off. After about 10 minutes in the air, the plane explodes with no warning whatsoever. Windows NT AirJust like Windows Air, but costs more, uses much bigger planes, and takes out all the other aircraft within a 40-mile radius when it explodes.  Linux AirDisgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines decide to start their own airline. They build the planes, ticket counters, and pave the runways themselves. They charge a small fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but you can also download and print the ticket yourself for free. When you board the plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench and a copy of the seat-HOWTO.html. Once settled, the fully adjustable seat is very comfortable, the plan leaves and arrives on time without a single problem, the in-flight meal is wonderful. You try to tell customers of the other airlines about the great trip, but all they can say is, ""You had to do WHAT with the seat?""</p>

46032,"<p>HOW TO SING THE BLUES (attrib. to Memphis Earlene Gray with help from Uncle Plunky)    1. Most blues begin: 'Woke up this morning.'     2. 'I got a good woman' is a bad way to begin the   blues, unless you stick something nasty in the   next line.         I got a good woman--       with the meanest dog in town.     3. Blues are simple. After you have the first   line right, repeat it. Then find something that   rhymes. Sort of.       Got a good woman      with the meanest dog in town.      He got teeth like Margaret Thatcher      and he weighs about 500 pounds.     4. The blues are not about limitless choice.    5. Blues cars are Chevies and Cadillacs. Other   acceptable blues transportation is Greyhound   bus or a southbound train. Walkin' plays a   major part in the blues lifestyle. So does   fixin' to die.     6. Teenagers can't sing the blues. Adults sing   the blues. Blues adulthood means old enough to   get the electric chair if you shoot a man in   Memphis.     7. You can have the blues in New York City, but   not in Brooklyn or Queens.  Hard times in   Vermont or North Dakota are just a depression.    Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City are still   the best places to have the blues.     8. The following colors do not belong in the blues:        a. violet        b. beige        c. mauve     9. You can't have the blues in an office or a   shopping mall, the lighting is wrong.     10. Good places for the Blues:     a. the highway     b. the jailhouse     c. the empty bed         Bad places for the Blues     a. Ashrams     b. Gallery openings     c. weekend in the Hamptons    11.  No one will believe it's the blues if you     wear a suit, unless you happen to be an old     black man. 12.  Do you have the right to sing the blues?         Yes, if:     a. your first name is a southern state--like Georgia      b. you're blind     c. you shot a man in Memphis.     d. you can't be satisfied.          No, if:     a. you were once blind but now can see.      b. you're deaf     c. you have a trust fund.     13. Neither Julio Iglesias nor Barbra Streisand    are capable of singing the blues.    14. If you ask for water and baby gives you    gasoline, it's the blues.  Other blues    beverages are:     a. wine     b. Irish whiskey     c. muddy water     d. one bourbon, one scotch and one beer         Blues beverages are NOT:     a. Any mixed drink     b. Any wine kosher for Passover     c. Yoo Hoo (all flavors)          15. If it occurs in a cheap motel or a shotgun    shack, it's blues death. Stabbed in the back    by a jealous lover is a blues way to die. So    is the electric chair, substance abuse, or being    denied treatment in an emergency room.    It is not a blues death if you die during a    liposuction treatment.    16. Some Blues names for Women       a. Sadie       b. Big Mama       c. Bessie     17. Some Blues Names for Men          a. Joe     b. Willie     c. Little Willie     d. Lightning         Persons with names like Sierra or Sequoia    will not be permitted to sing the blues no matter    how many men they shoot in Memphis.    18. Other Blues Names (Mix and Match Starter Kit)         a. Name of Physical infirmity (Blind, Cripple, Asthmatic)    b. First name (see above) or name of fruit (Lemon, Lime, Kiwi)     c. Last Name of President (Jefferson, Johnson, Fillmore, etc.)</p>

<p>Dear Madam, Here is money I owe for the apartment you showed me. You will note that it is less than the agreed upon amount because when I rented the apartment I was under the following assumptions...</p>
<p>that it was heated, that it had never been rented before and that it was much smaller than it was. </p>

Secondly, how could ever think that such a beautiful apartment would sit vacant? And as for the size, it was just right and not my fault that you did not have the furniture to fill it!""</p>

46047,"<p>A truck driver, hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers, stops for a beer. As he approaches the bar, he sees a big sign on the door that says, ""COMPUTER NERDS NOT ALLOWED - ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!"" He enters and sits down.</p>
<p>The bartender comes over to him, sniffs, and says that he smells kind of nerdy. He then asks him what he does for a living. The truck driver explains to him that he drives a truck, and the smell is just from the computers he is hauling. The bartender serves him a beer and says, ""OK, truck drivers aren't nerds.""</p>
<p>As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in wearing a pair of glasses with tape around the middle, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt that is at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver asks him why he did that.</p>
<p>The bartender replied, ""Don't worry. The computer nerds are in season because they are overpopulating Silicon Valley. You don't even need a license.""</p>
<p>So the truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads for the freeway. Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the road. </p>
<p>He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, snatching up all of the computers. The scavengers are comprised of engineers, accountants and programmers - computer geeks. Each of them wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen.</p>
<p>He can't let them steal his whole load. So remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, killing several of them instantly. </p>

<p>""In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake. But I was only trying<br /> to retrieve the gerbil,"" Eric Tomaszewski told bemused doctors in the Severe<br /> Burns Unit of Salt Lake City Hospital. Tomasszewski, and his homosexual<br /> partner Andrew ""Kiki"" Farnum, had been admitted for emergency treatment after<br /> a felching session had gone seriously wrong.</p>
<p> ""I pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Raggot, our gerbil, in,""<br /> he explained. ""As usual, Kiki shouted out 'Armageddon', my cue that he'd had<br /> enough. I tried to retrieve Raggot but he wouldn't come out again, so I peered<br /> into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.""  At a<br /> hushed press conference a hospital spokesperson described what happened next.</p>
<p>   ""The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and a flame shot out the<br /> tubing, igniting Mr. Tomaszewski's hair and severely burning his face. It also<br /> set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers which in turn ignited a larger<br /> pocket of gas further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out like a<br /> cannonball."" Tomaszewski suffered second degree burns and a broken nose from<br /> the impact of the gerbil, while Farnum suffered first and second degree burns<br /> to his anus and lower intestinal tract.</p>

<p>7.  Suffering a broken nose from a gerbil being launched out of someone's<br /> anus. I'm just guessing here, but I seriously doubt the said gerbil was<br /> springtime fresh after his little journey into Kiki's ""tunnel of love"".</p>
<p>6. People walking around with these volcano-like pockets of gas in their<br /> rectums.</p>
<p> 5. People who do this kind of thing &amp; then admit what they were doing when<br /> taken to the emergency room. Sorry, but I think I would have made up a story<br /> about a gang of raving, pyromaniac, anal sex fiends breaking into my house and<br /> sodomizing me with a charcoal lighter before I admitted the truth. Call me old<br /> fashion, but I just can't imagine looking at a doctor &amp; saying ""Well doc, it's<br /> like this. See we have this gerbil named Raggot &amp; we took this cardboard<br /> tube...""</p>
<p>4. ""First and second degree burns to the anus."" Wouldn't this make the<br /> burning itch and discomfort of hemorrhoids a welcome relief? How does one ever<br /> take a healthy dump after something like this? And the smell of burning anus<br /> must be in the top five most horrible scents on the face of God's green earth.</p>
<p>3. People named ""Kiki"" which is obviously a Polynesian word for ""Idiotic<br /> white men who insert rodents up butts.""</p>
<p> 2. What kind of a hospital would hold a press conference about this?</p>
<p> 1. This happened in Salt Lake City?   What kind of people are those Mormons?<br /> I'm starting to get a whole new image of the Osmond family.</p>

Upon graduation, he decided he could combine his two vocations to better serve the needs of his patients and their owners, while doubling his practice and, therefore, his income.

46079,"<p>It's 1880, the decade of gunslingers and gentlemen. This is a story of one such young man that wanted more than anything to be the fastest and most respected gunslinger in the west. The place was Dodge City, Kansas in the Sawdust Saloon. </p>
<p>The young man walked into the Sawdust Saloon and, to his surprise, saw Bat Masterson sitting at a table playing poker. The young man walked up to Bat and said, ""Mr. Masterson, I would like to be a gunslinger just like you. Could you give me some tips?"" </p>
<p>Bat Masterson put his cards down, looked up at the boy and said, ""Son, I don't usually give out tips like this cause it could someday be detrimental to my health, but step back and let me take a look at you.""</p>
<p>The boy stepped back and Mr. Masterson said, ""You look good. You're wearing black, you've got two ivory handled guns with waxed holsters, and you look like a gunslinger. But what's more important, son, is: Can you shoot?"" </p>
<p>The young man, happy to show how good he was, quickly drew his pistol from his right holster and without aiming shot the cuff link off of the piano player's right sleeve. </p>
<p>Bat Masterson said, ""That's good shooting son, but can you shoot with your left hand?"" </p>
<p>Before Masterson could even finish, the boy had already drawn the pistol from his left holster and shot the cuff link off of the piano player's left shirt sleeve. Very proud of himself the young man blew the smoke away from his six shooter and holstered his gun. </p>
<p>""How was that?"" the boy asked Masterson. </p>
<p>Bat Masterson smiled and looked up and the boy and said, ""That was pretty good shooting son. I couldn't do better than that myself, but I do have one good tip for you."" </p>
<p>""What's that?"" the boy asked. </p>
<p>""I suggest that you go to the kitchen and ask the cook for a large can of lard. Then take both guns of yours and stick them down deep in the lard."" </p>
<p>Puzzled the young gunslinger asked Masterson why he should do that. Masterson put his cards down again, leaned back in his chair, and said, ""Well son, when Wyatt Earp gets done playing the piano over there, he's going to take those two guns of yours and shove em up your ass . . ""</p>

The doctor came out of the<br /> bedroom a minute after he'd gone in and asked Mr. Tuttle, ""Do you have a<br /> hammer?""<br /> A puzzled Mr. Tuttle went to the garage, and returned with a hammer. The<br /> doctor thanked him and went back into the bedroom. A moment later, he came out<br /> and asked, ""Do you have a chisel?"" Mr. Tuttle complied with the request.<br /> In the next ten minutes, Dr. Carver asked for and received a pair of pliers, a<br /> screwdriver and a hacksaw. The last request got to Mr. Tuttle. He asked, ""What<br /> are you doing to my wife?""<br /> ""Not a thing,"" replied old doc Carver. ""I can't get my instrument bag open.""</p>

46099,"<p>'Twas the night before Christmas, and God it was neat. The kids were both gone, and my wife was in heat.</p>
<p>The doors were all bolted, the phone off the hook, It was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook.</p>
<p>Momma in her teddy and I in the nude, Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube.</p>
<p>When out on the lawn there arose such a cry, That I lost my boner, and momma went dry.</p>
<p>Up to the window I sprang like an elf, Tore back the shade while she played with herself.</p>
<p>The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built, Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.</p>
<p>When what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangy reindeer.</p>
<p>With a fat little driver, half out of the sled, A sock in his ear and a bra on his head.</p>
<p>Sure as I'm speaking, he was high as a kite, And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right.</p>
<p>Whoa S**thead, whoa A**hole, whoa Stupid, whoa Putz, Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your nuts.</p>
<p>Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree, Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee.</p>
<p>They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub, Just as Santa leaned out and threw up on my shrub.</p>
<p>And then from the roof we heard such a clatter, As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder.</p>
<p>I was donning my jockeys, to cover my ass, When down the chimney Santa came with a crash.</p>
<p>His suit was all smelly with perfume galore, He looked like a bum and he smelled like a whore.</p>
<p>""That was some brothel,"" he said with a smile, ""The reindeer are pooped, and I'll just stay awhile""</p>
<p>He walked to the kitchen for himself poured a drink, Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink.</p>
<p>I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee, The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee.</p>
<p>Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack, But his toys were all gone, and some new things were packed.</p>
<p>The first thing he found was a pair of false tits, The next was a handgun with a penis that spits.</p>
<p>A box filled with condoms was Santa's next find, And six pair of panties, the edible kind.</p>
<p>A bra without nipples, a penis extension, And several more things I shouldn't even mention.</p>
<p>A f**k ring, a G-string, and all types of oil, And a dildo so long that it lay in a coil.          ""This stuff ain't for kids, Mrs. Santa will s**t, Do I'll leave 'em here, and then I'll just split.""</p>
<p>He filled every stocking and then took his leave, With one tiny butt plug stuck under his sleeve.</p>
<p>He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead, Thus he fell on his ass and broke wind instead.</p>
<p>In time he was seated, took reigns of his hitch, Saying, ""Take me home, Rudolf. This night's been a bitch!""</p>
<p>The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout, ""The best thing about pussy is you can't wear it out!!""</p>

<p>Embarrassed, the United Way rep mumbled, ""Um...no.""</p>
<p>""--or that my brother, a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a<br /> wheelchair?""

46113,"<p>A Cardiologist came up with a new operating procedure that would cut down the<br /> time that heart surgery would take and would cause less trauma to the patient.<br /> He was praised by his peers when he presented it at a convention in Washington<br /> D.C.He was also paid $50,000 to present his find. He did a couple more of these<br /> presentations and realized that it would be more lucrative to do lectures on his<br /> find than to work as a surgeon. So he decided to do the lectures full-time. He<br /> hired a driver and purchased a limousine.<br /> One day, after he'd been doing the lecture circuit for about 6 months, his<br /> driver turns to him and says, ""You know....This is completely unfair."" ""What do<br /> you mean?"" asks the surgeon.<br /> ""Well, you get paid $50,000 every time you do this lecture and that's more<br /> than I get paid in a year,"" replies the driver.<br /> The surgeon explains to him that it is a very complicated procedure and that<br /> he is the only person that can give this lecture.<br /> ""That's not true. I can do your lecture blindfolded. I have seen you do your<br /> lecture so many times that I know it by heart,"" says the driver.<br /> ""Well if that's the case, I'll tell you what. You do this lecture and you can<br /> keep the $50,000 if you do it right."" replies the surgeon.<br /> The driver replies, ""Ok. You're on.""<br /> So when they arrive at the lecture hall, the surgeon and the driver change<br /> coats and the surgeon puts on the driver's hat and sits in the back of the<br /> room.<br /> The driver nails the presentation.

<p>Patti looks at the frog in disbelief and asks how much he wants to borrow. </p>
<p>The frog says, '$30,000.'</p>
<p>The teller asks his name and the frog says his name is Kermit Jagger and that it's OK, he knows the bank manager.</p>
<p>Patti explains that $30,000 is a substantial amount of money and that he will need some collateral to secure the loan. She asks if he has anything that he can use as collateral.</p>
<p>The frog says, `Sure, I have this,' and produces a tiny pink porcelain elephant, about 2 cm tall, bright pink and perfectly formed. </p>
<p>Very confused, Patti explains that she'll have to consult the manager and disappears into a back office.</p>
<p>She finds the manager and says, `There's a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you and wants to borrow $30,000. And he wants to use this as collateral.' </p>
<p>She holds up the tiny pink elephant and says, 'I mean, what the heck is this?'</p>
<p>So the manager looks back at her and says, `It's a knick-knack Patti Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man's a Rolling Stone.'</p>

46116,"<p>The History of 2 + 2 = 5                                by Houston Euler                ""First and above all he was a logician.  At                 least thirty-five years of the half-century                 or so of his existence had been devoted                 exclusively to proving that two and two always                 equal four, except in unusual cases, where                 they equal three or five, as the case may be.""                        -- Jacques Futrelle, ""The Problem of Cell 13""Most mathematicians are familiar with -- or have at least seen references in the literature to -- the equation 2 + 2 = 4. However, the less well known equation 2 + 2 = 5 also has a rich, complex history behind it. Like any other complex quantitiy, this history has a real part and an imaginary part; we shall deal exclusively with the latter here.Many cultures, in their early mathematical development, discovered the equation 2 + 2 = 5. For example, consider the Bolb tribe, descended from the Incas of South America. The Bolbs counted by tying knots in ropes. They quickly realized that when a 2-knot rope is put together with another 2-knot rope, a 5-knot rope results.Recent findings indicate that the Pythagorean Brotherhood discovered a proof that 2 + 2 = 5, but the proof never got written up. Contrary to what one might expect, the proof's nonappearance was not caused by a cover-up such as the Pythagoreans attempted with the irrationality of the square root of two. Rather, they simply could not pay for the necessary scribe service. They had lost their grant money due to the protests of an oxen-rights activist who objected to the Brotherhood's method of celebrating the discovery of theorems. Thus it was that only the equation 2 + 2 = 4 was used in Euclid's ""Elements,"" and nothing more was heard of 2 + 2 = 5 for several centuries.Around A.D. 1200 Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) discovered that a few weeks after putting 2 male rabbits plus 2 female rabbits in the same cage, he ended up with considerably more than 4 rabbits. Fearing that too strong a challenge to the value 4 given in Euclid would meet with opposition, Leonardo conservatively stated, ""2 + 2 is more like 5 than 4."" Even this cautious rendition of his data was roundly condemned and earned Leonardo the nickname ""Blockhead."" By the way, his practice of underestimating the number of rabbits persisted; his celebrated model of rabbit populations had each birth consisting of only two babies, a gross underestimate if ever there was one.Some 400 years later, the thread was picked up once more, this time by the French mathematicians.  Descartes announced, ""I think 2 + 2 = 5; therefore it does.""  However, others objected that his argument was somewhat less than totally rigorous.  Apparently, Fermat had a more rigorous proof which was to appear as part of a book, but it and other material were cut by the editor so that the book could be printed with wider margins.Between the fact that no definitive proof of 2 + 2 = 5 was available and the excitement of the development of calculus, by 1700 mathematicians had again lost interest in the equation. In fact, the only known 18th-century reference to 2 + 2 = 5 is due to the philosopher Bishop Berkeley who, upon discovering it in an old manuscript, wryly commented, ""Well, now I know where all the departed quantities went to -- the right-hand side of this equation."" That witticism so impressed California intellectuals that they named a university town after him.But in the early to middle 1800's, 2 + 2 began to take on great significance. Riemann developed an arithmetic in which 2 + 2 = 5, paralleling the Euclidean 2 + 2 = 4 arithmetic. Moreover, during this period Gauss produced an arithmetic in which 2 + 2 = 3. Naturally, there ensued decades of great confusion as to the actual value of 2 + 2. Because of changing opinions on this topic, Kempe's proof in 1880 of the 4-color theorem was deemed 11 years later to yield, instead, the 5-color theorem. Dedekind entered the debate with an article entitled ""Was ist und was soll 2 + 2?""Frege thought he had settled the question while preparing a condensed version of his ""Begriffsschrift."" This condensation, entitled ""Die Kleine Begriffsschrift (The Short Schrift),"" contained what he considered to be a definitive proof of 2 + 2 = 5. But then Frege received a letter from Bertrand Russell, reminding him that in ""Grundbeefen der Mathematik"" Frege had proved that 2 + 2 = 4. This contradiction so discouraged Frege that he abandoned mathematics altogether and went into university administration.Faced with this profound and bewildering foundational question of the value of 2 + 2, mathematicians followed the reasonable course of action: they just ignored the whole thing. And so everyone reverted to 2 + 2 = 4 with nothing being done with its rival equation during the 20th century. There had been rumors that Bourbaki was planning to devote a volume to 2 + 2 = 5 (the first forty pages taken up by the symbolic expression for the number five), but those rumor remained unconfirmed. Recently, though, there have been reported computer-assisted proofs that 2 + 2 = 5, typically involving computers belonging to utility companies. Perhaps the 21st century will see yet another revival of this historic equation.From: ""Matt Westwood""  Footnote from Matt Westwood in the 21st century: It's got to be pointed out that 2.4 + 2.4 = 4.8 so rounding to the nearest integer, 2+2=5.</p>

46151,"<p>The Joy Of Having A Dick</p>
<p>I'll tell you a short poem; I'll try to make it quick. The subject is quite simple: The joy of having a dick.</p>
<p>Penises are super things; You ladies should be jealous. An organ surrounded by sensitive skin. That's smooth and rarely hairless</p>
<p>It starts to grow dramatically, When you're about thirteen. Your testicles on either side; Your willy in between.</p>
<p>It dangles neatly down below; Soft, obedient and loyal. At the slightest hint of lust, It's ready to uncoil.</p>
<p>It often has a mind all of its own; It's like a wild untamed beast. It squirms and writhes and stretches out; When you expect it least.</p>
<p>Sometimes, yes, it misbehaves; Erecting when it shouldn't. A bumpy train ride sets it off; Just when you wish it wouldn't.</p>
<p>And during the summer, wearing little, sunning on the beach. The slightest sight of shaking boobs Makes it squirm just like a leech.</p>
<p>Handle it with love and care; For it can give great pleasure. Has it grown since last weekend? And when did you last measure?</p>
<p>Some people fret about its size; They give it lots of thought. Is seven inches long enough? It makes guys quite distraught.</p>
<p>They peek across in urinals, To compare and try to see But if another glances back at them. There's no way they can pee.</p>
<p>Masturbating is a sin; That's what some folk believe. But those are just old wives' tales; Cuz it really can relieve.</p>
<p>Without this fabulous organ, No shag would be complete. Lesbians will try their best; But must admit defeat.</p>
<p>It has to main bodily functions I'm sure you'll all agree. To start a whole new life and of course� daily to pee</p>
<p>But I think the thing that's marvellous; About that one eyed brute. Is that when its trying to procreate, It knows which fluid to shoot</p>
<p>And always it remains with you; Until you're old and frail. Don't take it out in public though, or you'll be thrown in jail.</p>
<p>And so to summarise I'd say with certainty, that every male loves his little friend But girls, no matter what we do, Please don't fold, spindle mutilate and NEVER NEVER Bend!!!</p>

Me being my red-necked self, I pushed the red button that sent off the missles to Russia. Say your prayers.8) My fellow Americans, I have to ask one thing. What's a law?7) My fellow Americans, we sadly admit that Mr. Cheney is no longer with us. After another heart attack, he has been forced to retire. I shall have to retire too, because without him I'm a lost cause.6) Another thing to admit. Mr. Bush Sr., my father, is really my brother.5) And my wife is really my mother.4) My fellow Americans, I am a clone!!!!3) My fellow Americans, I have to tell you all something that happened back in November. I rigged the votes. It's been on my small hillbilly mind all this time. Gore really won, but don't tell him (the loser). Oh, did I say that out loud?2) My fellow Americans, as we speak an asteroid is heading toward Earth. You are all going to die. The key word is you. You. I have a one way ticket to the U.S. space station, where I'll watch and see you all get blown away by the rock, and I'll laugh evilly from my little room up in space, safe. Unlike you suckers! Ha!1) I would just like to tell the young Americans that you can just say no to drugs. Just say no. Drugs are bad. Drugs are very bad. That is all.  Of course, if I could tell them my side of the story, I would tell them that drugs are very refreshing. I was an addict when I was younger, and it attracts the ladies. I'm not just talking ladies either. I was popular after I smoked. I was cool. It was the one time in my life when I felt accepte .... oh... what? We're still on the air? Oh?

<p>It wasn't long before he came to a hedge and, after squeezing under it he saw a wonderful sight lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and nibbling at the lush grass. </p>

<p>""You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it. We eat them as well."" </p>

46246,"<p>While we believe we will be fully Y2K compliant by January 1, 2000, and most of our subsidiary units and contractors claim they will also be fully compliant, we obviously need to make some preparations in case unexpected challenges impair our ability to meet the needs of our customers. </p>
<p>Enclosed with this memo is a ""Y2K Backup System"" device designed to meet short time emergency needs in case of a computer operations failure, or operational delay. This device is the company's Primary Emergency Network Computer Interface Liaison device (P.E.N.C.I.L.). </p>
<p>This device has been field tested extensively, including certification testing, as well as volume and stress testing. Properly maintained, the device meets all the requirements for coding and data input. Prior to use, the (P.E.N.C.I.L.) will require preparation and testing. Tools and supplies required will be: A sharpened knife or grinding device;and a supply of computer paper (with or without holes). </p>
<p>Gripping the device firmly in your hand, proceed to scrape or grind the wooded end until it has a cone-like appearance. The dark core area must be exposed to properly function. (Left-handed employees should read this sentence backwards, and then go to your supervisor for assistance.) </p>
<p>Place a single sheet of computer paper on a smooth, hard surface. Take the backup device, place the sharpened point against the paper, and pull it across the paper. If properly done, this will input a single line. </p>
<p>CAUTION: Excessive force may damage components of the device or damage the data reception device. If either the P.E.N.C.I.L. or the paper are damaged, go back to the preparation instructions above. </p>
<p>Proper use of the device will require data simulation input by the operator. Placing the device against the computer page forming symbols as closely resembling the computer lettering system you normally use. At the completion of each of the simulated letters, lift the device off the page, move it slightly to the right, replace it against the page, and form the next symbol. This may appear tedious, and somewhat redundant, but, with practice, you should be able to increase your speed and accuracy. </p>
<p>The P.E.N.C.I.L. is equipped with a manual deletion device. The device is located on the reverse end of the P.E.N.C.I.L. Error deletions operate similarly to the ""backspace"" key on your computer. Simply place the device against the erroneous data, and pull it backwards over the letters. This should remove the error, and enable you to resume data entries. </p>
<p>CAUTION: Excessive force may damage the data reception device.Insufficient force, however, may result in less than acceptable deletion, and may require re-initialization of action as above. </p>
<p>This device is designed with user maintenance in mind. However, if technical support is required, you can still call our local computer desk supervisor.</p>

46261,"<p>Let's face it -- English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple.</p>
<p>English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.</p>
<p>We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.</p>
<p>And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't grocer and hammers don't ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices?</p>
<p>Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend, that you comb through annals of history but not a single annal?</p>
<p>If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?</p>
<p>If teachers taught, why didn't preacher praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? If you wrote a letter, perhaps you bote your tongue?</p>
<p>In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? Park on driveways and drive on parkways?</p>
<p>How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and wise guy are opposites? How can overlook and oversee be opposites, while quite a lot and quite a few are alike?</p>
<p>How can the weather be hot as hell one day and cold as hell another.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that we talk about certain things only when they are absent?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a horseful carriage or a strapful gown? Met a sung hero or experienced requited love? Have you ever run into someone who was combobulated, gruntled, ruly or peccable? And where are all those people who ARE spring chickens or who would ACTUALLY hurt a fly?</p>
<p>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm clock goes off by going on.</p>
<p>English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race at all). That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible.</p>

He says to his congregation, ""All those wishing to have a place in heaven, please stand."" The whole room stands up except, of course, the sleeping man. Then the preacher says even more loudly, ""And he who would like to find a place in hell please STAND UP!"" The weary man catching only the last part groggily stands up, only to find that he's the only one standing. Confused and embarrassed he says, ""I don't know what we're voting on here, Father, but it sure seems like you and me are the only ones standing for it!""</p>

46275,"<p>Recently, a magazine ran a contest. They were looking for people to submit quotes from their real-life managers. Here are some of the submissions: 1. As of tomorrow, employees will only be able to access the building using individual security cards. Pictures will be taken next Wednesday and employees will receive their cards in two weeks. (This was the winning quote from Fred Dales at Microsoft Corp in Redmond, WA.)2. What I need is a list of specific unknown problems we will encounter. (Lykes Lines Shipping)3. E-mail is not to be used to pass on information or data. It should be used only for company business. (Accounting manager, Electric Boat Company)4. This project is so important, we can't let things that are more important interfere with it. (Advertising/Marketing manager, United Parcel Service)5. Doing it right is no excuse for not meeting the schedule. No one will believe you solved this problem in one day! We've been working on it for months. Now, go act busy for a few weeks and I'll let you know when it's time to tell them. (R&amp;D supervisor, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing/3M Corp.)6. My Boss spent the entire weekend retyping a 25-page proposal that only needed corrections. She claims the disk I gave her was damaged and she couldn't edit it. The disk I gave her was write-protected. (CIO of Dell Computers)7. Quote from the Boss: ""Teamwork is a lot of people doing what I say."" (Marketing executive, Citrix Corporation)8. ""How About Friday?"" My sister passed away and her funeral was scheduled for Monday. When I told my Boss, he said she died so that I would have to miss work on the busiest day of the year. He then asked if we could change her burial to Friday. He said, ""That would be better for me."" (Shipping executive, FTD Florists)9. ""We know that communication is a problem, but the company is not going to discuss it with the employees."" (Switching supervisor, AT&amp;T Long Lines Division)10. We recently received a memo from senior management saying: ""This is to inform you that a memo will be issued today regarding the subject mentioned above."" (Microsoft, Legal Affairs Division)11. One day my Boss asked me to submit a status report to him concerning a project I was working on. I asked him if tomorrow would be soon enough. He said ""If I wanted it tomorrow, I would have waited until tomorrow to ask for it!"" (New business manager, Hallmark Greeting Cards.)12. Speaking the Same Language: As director of communications, I was asked to prepare a memo reviewing our company's training programs and materials. In the body of the memo one of the sentences mentioned the ""pedagogical approach"" used by one of the training manuals. The day after I routed the memo to the executive committee, I was called into the HR director's office, and told that the executive vice president wanted me out of the building by lunch. When I asked why, I was told that she wouldn't stand for ""perverts"" (pedophilia?) working in her company. Finally he showed me her copy of the memo, with her demand that I be fired - and the word ""pedagogical"" circled in red. The HR manager was fairly reasonable, and once he looked the word up in his dictionary, and made a copy of the definition to send back to her, he told me not to worry. He would take care of it. Two days later a memo to the entire staff came out directing us that no words which could not be found in the local Sunday newspaper could be used in company memos. A month later, I resigned. In accordance with company policy, I created my resignation memo by pasting words together from the Sunday paper. (Taco Bell Corporation)13. This gem is the closing paragraph of a nationally-circulated memo from a large communications company: ""(Company name) is endeavorily determined to promote constant attention on current procedures of transacting business focusing emphasis on innovative ways to better, if not supersede, the expectations of quality!""

46279,"<p>A priest wanted to raise money for his church and on being told there was a fortune in horse racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the races.However, at the local auction, the going price for a horse was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it, he might aswell go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in third. The next day the local paper carried this headline: PRIEST'S ASS SHOWS.The priest was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won. The local paper read: PASTOR'S ASS OUT FRONT.The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the priest not to enter the donkey in another race. The next day, the local paper headline read:BISHOP SCRATCHES PASTOR'S ASS.This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the priest to get rid of the donkey. The priest decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. The local paper, hearing of the news, posted the following headline thenext day: NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN.The Bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmerfor ten dollars. The next day, the paper read:NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the donkey and lead it to the plains where itcould run wild. The next day the headlines read: NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE.The Bishop was buried the next day.</p>

No, you must think of another wish.""The man said, ""Okay,"" and tried to think of a really good wish. Finally, he said, ""I've been married and divorced four times.

Eleven philosophers to ponder whether it is possible to actually do anything; ten semanticists to debate the various possible meanings of each phrase, word, and syllable; nine columnists to write about it from radically different viewpoints; eight letter writers to respond vehemently with opposing points of view; seven Quibblers who delight in pointing out others' mistakes (what is said is not as important as saying it correctly); six conservatives who believe things should stay the way they are; five liberals who believe that action should be taken immediately to form a committee to study possible actions; four ornery SOBs who disagree on principal with anything anyone else has suggested; three peacemakers who believe it's more important to work it out without showing any more emotions than necessary to get it done; two statisticians who maintain that numbers are more important than facts; and one pragmatist to ignore the bureaucratic piles of paperwork and replace the bad bulb with a good one. Whilst all this is going on, all the Mensans are keeping count in their heads just to make absolutely sure what it really does add up to 66.</p>

46352,"<p>Remember the book ""men are from mars, women are from venus""? Well, here's a<br /> prime example offered by an English professor at an American university.<br /> In-class assignment for Wednesday ""today we will experiment with a new form<br /> called the tandem story.""<br /> ""The process is simple. Each person will pair off with the person sitting to<br /> his or her immediate right. One of you will then write the first paragraph of a<br /> short story. The partner will read the first paragraph and then add another<br /> paragraph to the story. The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so<br /> on back and forth. Remember to re-read what has been written each time in order<br /> to keep the story coherent. There is to be absolutely no talking and anything<br /> you wish to say must be written on the paper. The story is over when both agree<br /> a conclusion has been reached.<br /> ""The following was actually turned in by two of my English students:<br /> Rebecca - last name deleted, and Gary - last name deleted:""<br /> Story: (first paragraph by Rebecca)<br /> At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. The chamomile,<br /> which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded her too<br /> much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked chamomile. But she<br /> felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl. His possessiveness was<br /> suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up<br /> again. So chamomile was out of the question.<br /> -------------------------------------------------------<br /> Meanwhile, advance Sergeant Carl harries, leader of the attack squadron now in<br /> orbit over skyline 4, had more important things to think about than the neuroses<br /> of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty<br /> night over a year ago. ""As. harries to gestation 17,"" he said into his<br /> transatlantic communicator. ""Polar orbit established. no sign of resistance so<br /> far..."" but before he could sign off a bluish particle beam flashed out of<br /> nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay. The jolt from the<br /> direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit.<br /> -------------------------------------------------------<br /> He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt one<br /> last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had<br /> feelings for him. Soon afterwards, earth stopped its pointless hostilities<br /> towards the peaceful farmers of skyline 4. ""Congress passes law permanently<br /> abolishing war and space travel,"" Laurie read in her newspaper one morning. The<br /> news simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared out the window,<br /> dreaming of her youth - when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree, with<br /> no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent<br /> wonder at all the beautiful things around her. ""why must one lose one's<br /> innocence to become a woman?� she wondered wistfully.<br /> -------------------------------------------------------<br /> Little did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live. Thousands of<br /> miles above the city, the anu'udrian mother ship launched the first of its<br /> lithium fusion missiles. The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks that pushed the<br /> unilateral aerospace disarmament treaty through congress had left earth a<br /> defenseless target for the hostile alien empires that were determined to destroy<br /> the human race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the anu'udrian<br /> ships were on course for earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the<br /> entire planet. With no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical<br /> plan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The<br /> president, in his top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor<br /> off the coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion which vaporized<br /> poor, stupid, Laurie and 85 million other Americans. The president slammed his<br /> fist on the conference table. ""We can't allow this! I�m going to veto that<br /> treaty! Let�s blow 'me out of the sky!""<br /> -------------------------------------------------------<br /> This is absurd. I refuse to continue this mockery of literature. My writing<br /> partner is a violent, chauvinistic, semi-literate adolescent.<br /> ------------------------------------------------------<br /> Yeah? Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts at writing<br /> are the literary equivalent of valium. ""Oh shall I have chamomile tea? Or shall<br /> I have some other sort of f****** tea???

The boy told him that they only<br /> sold whole heads of lettuce, but the man replied that he did not need a whole<br /> head, only half. The boy explained that he would have to ask the manager and so<br /> he walked into the back room and said, ""There is some jerk out there who wants<br /> to buy only a half a head of lettuce."" As he finished saying this, he turned<br /> around to find the man standing right behind him, so he quickly added, ""And this<br /> gentleman wants to buy the other half."" The manager okayed the request and the<br /> man went on his way. Later on the manager said to the boy, ""You almost got<br /> yourself in a lot of trouble earlier, but I must say I was impressed with the<br /> way you got out of it. You think on your feet and we like that around here.<br /> Where are you from, son?"" The boy replied, ""Minnesota, sir."" ""Oh, really? Why<br /> did you leave Minnesota?"" inquired the manager.

46359,"<p>Recently, a routine police patrol was parked outside a local neighborhood bar in Wisconsin. Late in the evening, the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so intoxicated that he could barely walk. The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes with the officer quietly watching.</p>
<p>After what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his own car which he fell into. He was there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off.</p>
<p>Finally, he started his car, switched the wipers on and off (it was a dry night), flicked the hazard flasher on and off, tooted the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and then remained stationary for a few more minutes as more patrons left in their vehicles.</p>
<p>At last he pulled out of the parking lot and started to drive slowly down the street. The police officer having patiently waited all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a breathalyzer test. To his amazement the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man consumed alcohol at all.</p>
<p>Dumbfounded, the office said ""I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyzer equipment must be broken.""</p>
<p>""I doubt it,"" said the man. ""Tonight I'm the designated decoy.""</p>

We can<br /> offer to make him a cardinal, and then ask him to play Benjamin Netanyahu as<br /> your personal representative. In addition to showing our spirit of cooperation,<br /> we�ll also win the match.�<br /> Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made. Of course Nicolas was<br /> honored and agreed to play. The day after the match, Nicolas reported to the<br /> Vatican to inform the Pope of the result.<br /> �I have some good news and some bad news, Your Holiness,� said the golfer.<br /> �Tell me the good news first, Cardinal Nicolas,� said the Pope.<br /> �Well,� you�re Holiness, �I don�t like to brag, but even though I�ve played<br /> some pretty terrific rounds of golf in my life, this was the best I have ever<br /> played, by far. I must have been inspired from above. My drives were long and<br /> true, my irons were accurate and purposeful and my putting was perfect.

It can be an active verb (Mary doesn't really give a fuck); or an adverb (Mary is really fucking interested in John); and as a noun, (Mary is a terrific fuck). It can be used as an adjective (Mary is fucking beautiful). As you see, there are very<br /> few words with the versatility of ""Fuck.""</p>
<p>Besides It's sexual connotations, this incredible word can be used to<br /> describe many situations:</p>
<p>It can be used in an anatomical description - ""He's a fucking asshole.""<br /> It can be used to tell time - ""It's five fucking thirty.""<br /> It can be used in business - ""How did I end up with this fucking job?""<br /> It can be maternal - as in ""Motherfucker.""</p>

46457,"<p>Dr. Schambaugh, of the University of Oklahoma School of<br /> Chemical Engineering, Final Exam for May of 1997 consisted<br /> of only one question. Dr. Schambaugh is known for asking<br /> questions such as, ''Why do airplanes fly?'' on his final<br /> exams. His one and only final exam question in May 1997 for<br /> his Momentum, Heat and Mass Transfer II class was:<br /> ''Is hell exothermic or endothermic? Support your answer<br /> with proof.'' </p>
<p>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using<br /> Boyle's Law or some variant. One student, however, wrote<br /> the following:<br /> ""First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must<br /> have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also<br /> have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell<br /> and at what rate are souls leaving? I think we can safely<br /> assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave.<br /> Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering<br /> hell, let us look at the different religions that exist in<br /> the world today. Some of these religions state that if you<br /> are not a member of their religion, then you will go to<br /> hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and<br /> people do not belong to more than one religion, we can<br /> project that all people and souls go to hell. With birth<br /> and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of<br /> souls in hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at<br /> the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's law states<br /> that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to<br /> stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume<br /> needs to stay constant. Two options exist:<br /> 1. If hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at<br /> which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure<br /> in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose. 2. If<br /> hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of<br /> souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop<br /> until hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the<br /> quote given to me by Theresa Manyan during Freshman<br /> year, ''that it will be a cold night in hell before I sleep<br /> with you'' and take into account the fact that I still have<br /> NOT succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then<br /> Option 2 cannot be true. Thus, hell is exothermic.""<br /> The student, Tim Graham, got the only A.</p>

46465,"<p>Watertown, New York:</p>
<p>It was eagle-eyed zookeepers who noticed first. The DNA testing only<br /> proved what they already suspected.</p>
<p>The Thompson Park Zoo's American bald eagle breeding program was going<br /> nowhere. Not with two males, anyway.</p>
<p>""We had our suspicions right away. The birds are virtually the identical<br /> size,"" said Director Glenn D.  Dobrogosz, who laughed Tuesday about the<br /> gender mix-up that provided a comical start to the zoo's new eagle<br /> breeding program.</p>
<p>""It happens. Not a lot. But it happens,"" he said.</p>
<p>The two American bald eagles - supposedly a male and female - arrived at<br /> the zoo last July from the Bird Treatment and Learning Center in<br /> Anchorage, Alaska.</p>
<p>The two males became good buddies but zookeepers quickly realized there<br /> would be no amorous flights for these two, Dobrogosz said.</p>
<p>Because bald eagle males and females share the same coloring<br /> characteristics, it is difficult to determine gender by visual inspection.<br /> However, in most raptor species, the female is slightly larger than the<br /> male, he said.</p>
<p>Based on their size and behavior, the Alaska center mistakenly thought it<br /> had sent a male and a female, Dobrogosz said. It wasn't until the Thompson<br /> Park Zoo took blood samples for DNA testing that it confirmed the birds'<br /> sexes.</p>
<p>""Sure enough, they both were boys,"" he said.</p>
<p>Now that the confusion has been cleared up, zookeepers are once again<br /> focused on the romancing.</p>
<p>One of the males is being sent to the Clinch Park Zoo in Traverse City,<br /> Mich. Meanwhile, the Watertown zoo already has received a new female from<br /> another raptor rehabilitation center on Sitka Island in Alaska.</p>
<p>""We're positive this time,"" Dobrogosz said, heading off the inevitable<br /> inquiry about the bird's gender.</p>

46467,"<p>DIARY OF A SNOW SHOVELER</p>
<p>December 8:<br /> 6:00 PM. It started to snow. The first snow of the season and the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the window, watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven. It looked like a Grandma Moses Print.  So romantic we felt like newlyweds again. I love snow!</p>
<p>December 9:<br /> We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering every inch of the landscape. What a fantastic sight! Can there be a more lovely place in the Whole World? Moving here was the best idea I've ever had. Shoveled for the first time in years and felt like a boy again.  I did both our driveway and the sidewalks. This afternoon the snow plow came along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again. What a perfect life!</p>
<p>December 12:<br /> The sun has melted all our lovely snow. Such a disappointment. My neighbor tells me not to worry, we'll definitely have a white Christmas. No snow on Christmas would be awful! Bob says we'll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to see snow again. I don't think that's possible. Bob is such a nice man.  I'm glad he's our neighbor.</p>
<p>December 14:<br /> Snow, lovely snow!  8"" last night. The temperature dropped to *20. The cold makes everything sparkle so. The wind took my breath away, but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway and sidewalks. This is the life! The snowplow came back this afternoon and buried everything again.  I didn't realize I would have to do quite this much shoveling, but I'll certainly get back in shape this way. I wish I wouldn't huff and puff so.</p>
<p>December 15:<br /> 20 inches forecast. Sold my van and bought a 4x4 Blazer. Bought snow tires for the wife's car and 2 extra shovels. Stocked the freezer. The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out. I think that's silly. We aren't in Alaska, after all.</p>
<p>December 16:<br /> Ice storm this morning. Fell on my ass on the ice in the driveway putting down salt. Hurt like hell. The wife laughed for an hour, which I think was very cruel.</p>
<p>December 17:<br /> Still way below freezing. Roads are too icy to go anywhere. Electricity was off for 5 hours. I had to pile the blankets on to stay warm. Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her. Guess I should've bought a wood stove, but won't admit it to her. God I hate it when she's right. I can't believe I'm freezing to death in my own living room.</p>
<p>December 20:<br /> Electricity's back on, but had another 14"" of the damn stuff last night. More shoveling. Took all day. freakin' snowplow came by twice. Tried to find a neighbor kid to shovel, but they said they're too busy playing hockey.  I think they're lying. Called the only hardware store around to see about buying a snow blower and they're out. Might have another shipment in March. I think they're lying. Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have it done and bill me. I think he's lying.</p>
<p>December 22:<br /> Bob was right about a white Christmas because 13 more inches of the white shit fell today, and it's so cold it probably won't melt till August. Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up to go out to shovel and then I had to piss. By the time I got undressed, pissed and dressed again. I was too tired to shovel. Tried to hire Bob who has a plow on his truck for the rest of the winter; but he says he's too busy. I think the asshole is lying.</p>
<p>December 23:<br /> Only 2"" of snow today. And it warmed up to 0. The wife wanted me to decorate the front of the house this morning. What is she...nuts??? Why didn't she tell me to do that a month ago?  She says she did but I think she's damn well lying.</p>
<p>December 24:<br /> 6"". Snow packed so hard by snowplow, I broke the shovel. Thought I was having a heart attack. If I ever catch the son of a bitch who drives that snowplow, I'll drag him through the snow by his balls. I know he hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shoveling and then he comes down the street at a 100 miles an hour and throws snow all over where I've just been! Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols with her and open our presents, but I was busy watching for the freakin' snowplow.</p>
<p>December 25:<br /> Merry Christmas. 20 more inches of the @#$%^&amp;  slop tonight. Snowed in. The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil. God I hate the snow! Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over the head with my shovel. The wife says I have a bad attitude. I think she's an idiot.  If I have to watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" one more time, I'm going to kill her.</p>
<p>December 26:<br /> Still snowed in. Why the hell did I ever move here? It was all HER idea. She's really getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>December 27:<br /> Temperature dropped to -30 and the pipes froze.</p>
<p>December 28:<br /> Warmed up to above-50. Still snowed in. THE BITCH is driving me crazy!!!</p>
<p>December 29:<br /> 10 more inches. Bob says I have to shovel the roof or it could cave-in. That's the silliest thing I ever heard. How dumb does he think I am?</p>
<p>December 30:<br /> Roof caved in. The snow plow driver is suing me for a million dollars for the bump on his head. The wife went home to her mother. 9"" predicted.</p>
<p>December 31:<br /> Set fire to what's left of the house. No more shoveling!</p>
<p>January 8:<br /> I feel so good. I just love those little white pills they keep giving me. Why am I tied to the bed?</p>

46476,"<p>The French zoo had acquired a very rare species of gorilla. Within a few weeks, the female gorilla became very cranky and difficult to handle. Upon examination, the zoo veterinarian determined the problem. The gorilla was in heat. To make matters worse, there were no male gorilla species available.</p>
<p>While reflecting on their problem, the zoo administrators noticed Pierre, an employee responsible for cleaning the animals' cages. Pierre, it was rumoured, had the ability to satisfy any female, but he wasn't very bright. So the zoo administrators thought they might have a solution.</p>
<p>Pierre was approached with a proposition: would he be willing to have sex with the gorilla for three hundred Euros? Pierre showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully.</p>
<p>The following day, Pierre announced that he would accept their offer, but only under three conditions. ""First,"" he said, ""I don't want to have to kiss her. Secondly, I want nothing to do with any offspring that may result from this union.""</p>

46486,"<p>It's wise to remember how easily this wonderful technology can<br /> be misused, sometimes unintentionally, with serious consequences.</p>
<p>Consider the case of the Illinois man who left the snow-filled<br /> streets of Chicago for a vacation in Florida. His wife was on a<br /> business trip and was planning to meet him there the next day.<br /> When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a<br /> quicke-mail. Unable to find the scrap of paper on which he had<br /> written her e-mail address, he did his best to type it in from<br /> memory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he missed one letter, and his note was directed<br /> instead to an elderly preacher's wife, whose husband had passed<br /> away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her<br /> e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing<br /> scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint.</p>

A bossy businessman learned this<br /> the hard way after ordering his nurses around as if they were<br /> his employees. But the head nurse stood up to him. One morning<br /> she entered his room and announced, ""I have to take your<br /> temperature.""</p>
<p>After complaining for several minutes, he finally settled down,<br /> crossed his arms and opened his mouth. ""No, I'm sorry,"" the<br /> nurse stated,"" but for this reading, I can't use an oral<br /> thermometer."" This started another round of complaining, but<br /> eventually he rolled over and bared his bottom. After feeling<br /> the nurse insert the thermometer, he heard her announce, ""I have<br /> to get something. Now you stay just like that until I get back!""<br /> She left the door to his room open on her way out, and he cursed<br /> under his breath as he heard people walking past his door<br /> laughing. After almost an hour, the man's doctor came into the<br /> room.</p>
<p>""What's going on here?"" asked the doctor. Angrily, the man<br /> answers, ""What's the matter, Doc? Haven't you ever seen someone<br /> having their temperature taken?""</p>

<p>""I wanted to buy my husband a pet, but all of yours are so expensive"", she said. </p>
<p>""Well,"" said the clerk, ""I have a huge bullfrog in the back for $50.00. Would you like to see it?"" </p>
<p>""$50.00?? For a Frog??"" asked the woman. </p>
<p>The clerk said, ""It's a special frog. It gives blow jobs."" </p>
<p>Well, the woman did not particularly enjoy giving head, so, she thought this was a heck of a deal. She'd get her husband a gift he'd surely enjoy, and she'd never have to do that again. The woman decided to buy the frog. She took it home to her husband and explained the strange gift. Of course, the husband was a bit skeptical, but said for sure he'd try it out that night. </p>
<p>The woman went to bed that night relieved knowing she'd never have to give another blow job. Around two in the morning, she woke up to hear pots and pans banging around in the kitchen. She got up to go see what was going on. When she got to the kitchen she saw her husband and the frog, sitting at the kitchen table like best buddies, looking through cookbooks. </p>
<p>""What are you two doing looking through cookbooks at this hour?"" asked the woman. </p>

46502,"<p>Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch. Unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull so that they can breed their own stock.</p>
<p>The brunette balances their checkbook, then takes their last $600 dollars out west to another ranch where a man has a prize bull for sale.</p>
<p>Upon leaving, she tells her sister, ""When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home.""</p>
<p>The brunette arrives at the man's ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599, no less. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news.</p>
<p>She walks into the telegraph office, and says, ""I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.""</p>
<p>The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, ""It's just 99 cents a word.""</p>
<p>Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. She realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word.</p>
<p>After thinking for a few minutes, she nods, and says, ""I want you to send her the word, 'comfortable.'""</p>
<p>The telegraph operator shakes his head. ""How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her the word, 'comfortable?'""</p>
<p>The brunette explains, ""My sister's blonde.""</p>

If he has not recovered, then kill it.For nosebleed: put the nose much lower than the body.For drowning: climb on top of the person and move up and down to make artificial perspiration.To remove dust from the eye, pull the eye down over the nose.For head colds: use an agonizer to spray the nose until it drops in your throat.For snakebites: bleed the wound and rape the victim in a blanket for shock.</p>

He finally printed out a 150-page<br /> report on his hi-tech miniaturized printer, turned around to our shepherd and<br /> said, ""You have here exactly 1,586 sheep.""<br /> ""Amazing! That's correct! Like I agreed, you can take one of my sheep,"" said<br /> the shepherd.<br /> The shepherd watched the man make a selection and bundle it into his<br /> Cherokee.<br /> When he was finished the shepherd said, ""If I can tell you exactly<br /> what your political persuasion is, where you're from and whom you work for, will<br /> you give me my sheep back?""<br /> ""Okay, why not,"" answered the young man.<br /> ""You're a Democrat from Palm Beach and you're working for Jesse Jackson,"" said<br /> the shepherd.<br /> ""Wow! That's correct,"" said the young man. ""How did you ever guess that?""<br /> ""Easy,"" answered the shepherd. ""Nobody called you, but you showed up here<br /> anyway.

46547,"<p>Morris had just been hired as the new CEO of a large high tech corporation. The CEO who was stepping down met with him privately and presented him with three numbered envelopes... #1,#2,#3. ""Open these if you run up against a problem you don't think you can solve,"" the departing CEO said.</p>
<p>Well, things went along pretty smoothly, but six months later, sales took a downturn and Morris was really catching a lot of heat. About at his wit's end, he remembered the envelopes. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, ""Blame your predecessor.""</p>
<p>Morris, the new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Satisfied with his comments, the press -- and Wall Street -- responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.</p>
<p>About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, ""Reorganize."" This he did, and the company quickly rebounded.</p>
<p>After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on difficult times. Morris went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope.</p>
<p>The message said, ""Prepare three envelopes.""</p>

<p>KINDERGARTEN TEACHER:  To get to the other side.</p>
<p>PLATO:  For the greater good of man.</p>
<p>ARISTOTLE:  It is the nature of chickens to cross roads.</p>
<p>KARL MARX:  It was a historical inevitability.</p>
<p>TIMOTHY LEARY:  Because that's the only trip the establishment would let it<br /> take.</p>
<p>OSAMA BIN LADEN: That chicken knew nothing of its mission (ha ha ha)<br /> only that it would be a martyr.</p>
<p>SADDAM HUSSEIN:  This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite<br /> justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.</p>
<p>RONALD REAGAN:  I forget.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK:  To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.</p>
<p>HIPPOCRATES:  Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.</p>
<p>ANDERSEN CONSULTING:  Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was<br /> threatening its dominant market position.  The chicken was faced with<br /> significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the<br /> newly competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partnering relationship<br /> with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution<br /> strategy and  implementation processes. Using the Poultry Integration Model<br /> (PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge,<br /> capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and technology<br /> in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework.<br /> Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best<br /> chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in the transportation<br /> industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their<br /> personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them to<br /> synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit goals of delivering<br /> and uccessfully architecting and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework<br /> across the continuum of poultry cross-median processes.The meeting was held in a<br /> park-like setting, enabling and creating an impactful environment which was<br /> strategically based, industry focused, and built upon a consistent, clear, and<br /> unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, and core<br /> values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total business.</p>
<p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN:  The road, you see, represents the black man. The chicken<br /> 'crossed' the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.</p>
<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.:  I envision a world where all chickens will be free<br /> to cross roads without having their motives called into question.</p>

<p>""Por la orilla, por la orilla, y se cura el se�or Bonilla...""</p>

"
46567,"<p>Twas the night before Christmas<br /> And all through the house<br /> There were empties and butts<br /> Left around by some louse.<br /> And the best quart I'd hid<br /> By the chimney with care<br /> Had been swiped by some creep<br /> Who'd discovered it there!</p>
<p>Our hung-over guests<br /> Had been poured into bed<br /> (They'll wake in the morn<br /> With a God-awful head)<br /> My tongue, cotton-coated,<br /> Hung down to my belt<br /> And only the seasick<br /> Could know how I felt!</p>
<p>My wife - she had long ago<br /> Gone up to bed<br /> While visions of Redskins<br /> Danced in her head.<br /> And I in the parlor<br /> Sat all alone,<br /> I'd unplugged the cat<br /> And put out the phone.</p>
<p>Just then, through a window<br /> Came noise and smells<br /> Like an overturned beer truck<br /> And tinkle of bells!<br /> I sprang from my chair<br /> To see what was the matter<br /> To see what was causing<br /> The smell and the clatter.</p>
<p>When what to my wondering<br /> Eyes did appear<br /> But eight drunken reindeer<br /> And sled full of beer!<br /> With a little old driver,<br /> Nose red as a brick,<br /> I knew it was Santa<br /> As tight as a tick!</p>
<p>Weaving upward and downward<br /> His reindeer they came<br /> While he hiccoughed and burped<br /> And called them by name:<br /> ""On Gallo! On Ripple!<br /> We ain't got all night!<br /> You, too, Manischevitz!<br /> And you, Miller lite!</p>
<p>""Ho Bud! Easy, Boh!<br /> Give Busch there a hand!<br /> Now now, Lowenbrau -<br /> You can go when we land!<br /> Head up for that roof --<br /> Watch out for the wall!<br /> Get going, you guys<br /> We've got a long haul!""</p>
<p>So up to my roof<br /> Went his reindeer and sled<br /> But my TV antenna<br /> Hit him right in the head!<br /> And then in a twinkling<br /> I heard Santa swear<br /> So hot that it melted<br /> The snow everywhere!</p>
<p>I could tell in a moment<br /> This guy had no class<br /> For he fell down my chimney<br /> Right smack on his sack!<br /> He was dresed all in fur<br /> From his head to his toes.<br /> Red were his eyeballs,<br /> His coat and his nose.</p>
<p>He had a round face<br /> And toy-filled sack<br /> His breath would have blown<br /> A freight off the track!<br /> He was chubby and plump<br /> And he tried to stand right<br /> But he couldn't fool me -<br /> He was high as a kite!</p>
<p>He spoke not a word<br /> But went straight to his work<br /> And missed half the stockings,<br /> The plastered old jerk!<br /> Then putting five fingers<br /> To the end of his nose<br /> He gave me the word<br /> As up the chimney he rose.</p>
<p>Crossing my rooftop<br /> He went at a run<br /> Not seeing what one<br /> Of his reindeer had done.<br /> He skidded, and then<br /> Fell flat on his face!<br /> His remarks after this<br /> Were a total disgrace!</p>
<p>Then he got in his sled<br /> And I heard Santa moan:<br /> ""Why did I stop there?<br /> Bux's kids are all grown!""</p>

<p>He says, ""How bad is it doc? I'm going on my honeymoon next week and my fianc�e is still a virgin in every way.""</p>
<p>The doc said , ""I'll have to put your penis in a splint to let it heal and keep it straight. It should be okay next week.""</p>
<p>So he took four tongue depressors and formed a neat little 4-sided bandage, and wired it all together; an impressive work of art.</p>
<p>The guy mentions none of this to his girl, marries, and on his honeymoon night in the motel room, she rips open her blouse to reveal a gorgeous set of breasts. This was the first time he saw them.</p>
<p>She says, ""You are my FIRST, no one has ever touched these breasts.""</p>

<p>The guy said, ""OK,"" and went home and did his daily routine.</p>
<p>One morning he woke up and the phone rang. He picked it up and it was the doctor.</p>
<p>The doc said, ""I've got some good news and some bad news.""</p>
<p>The guy said, ""Well, what is the good news?""</p>
<p>The doc said, ""You have 24 hours to live.""</p>
<p>The guy said, ""Well, what's the bad news?""</p>
<p>The doc said, ""I forgot to call you yesterday.""</p>

You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually NYC where you will run your expanding enterprise.""The Mexican fisherman asked, ""But, how long will this all take?""To which the American replied, ""15-20 years.""""But what then?""The American laughed and said that's the best part.""When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.""""Millions.. Then what?""The American said, ""Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.""</p>

46600,"<p>A golfer is in a competitive match with a friend, who is ahead by a couple of strokes. The golfer says to himself, 'I'd give anything to sink this next putt.' A stranger walks up to him and whispers, 'Would you give up a fourth of your sex life?' The golfer thinks the man is crazy and that his answer will be meaningless, but also that perhaps this is a good omen, so he says, 'Okay,' and sinks the putt. Two holes later he mumbles to himself, 'Boy, if I could only get an eagle on this hole.' The same stranger moves to his side and says, 'Would it be worth another fourth of your sex life?' The golfer shrugs and says, 'Sure.' He makes an eagle. On the final hole, the golfer needs yet another eagle to win. Though he says nothing, the stranger moves to his side and says, 'Would you be willing to give up the rest of your sex life to win this match?' The golfer says, 'Certainly!' He makes the eagle. As the golfer walks to the club house, the stranger walks alongside and says, 'You know, I've really not been fair with you because you don't know who I am. I'm the devil, and from now on you will have no sex life.' 'Nice to meet you,' says the golfer. 'My name's Father O'Malley.'</p>

46635,"<p>The Naughty Night Before Christmas</p>
<p>Twas the night before Christmas, and God it was neat. The kids were both gone, and my wife was in heat. The doors were all bolted, the phone off the hook, It was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook. Momma in her teddy and I in the nude, Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube.</p>
<p>When out on the lawn there arose such a cry, That I lost my boner, and momma went dry. Up to the window I sprang like an elf, Tore back the shade while she played with herself. The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built, Shoved a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.</p>
<p>When what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangy reindeer. With a fat little driver, half out of the sled, A sock in his ear and a bra on his head. Sure as I'm speaking, he was high as a kite, And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right.</p>
<p>Whoa Shithead, whoa Asshole, whoa Stupid, whoa Putz, Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your nuts. Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree, Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee. They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub, Just as Santa leaned out and threw up on my shrub.</p>
<p>And then from the roof we heard such a spatter, As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder. I was donning my jockies, to cover my ass, When down the chimney Santa came with a crash. His suit was all smelly with perfume galore, He looked like a bum and he smelled like a whore.</p>
<p>""That was some brothel,"" he said with a smile, ""The reindeer are pooped, and I'll just stay awhile"" He walked to the kitchen for himself poured a drink, Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink. I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee, The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee.</p>
<p>Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack, But his toys were all gone, and some new things were packed. The first thing he found was a pair of false tits, The first thing he found was a pair of false tits, The next was a handgun with a penis that spits. A box filled with condoms was Santa's next find, And six pair of panties, the edible kind. A bra without nipples, a penis extension, And several more things I shouldn't even mention. A fuck ring, a G-string, and all types of oil, And a dildo so long that it lay in a coil.</p>
<p>""This stuff ain't for kids, Mrs. Santa will shit, So I'll leave 'em here. and then I'll just split."" He filled every stocking and then took his leave, With one tiny butt plug stuck under his sleeve. He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead, Thus he fell on his ass and farted instead. In time he was seated, took reigns of his hitch, Saying, ""Take me home, Rudolph. This night's been a bitch!""</p>
<p>The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout, ""The best thing about pussy is you can't wear it out!!""</p>

"
46650,"<p>The US Standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That's an exceedingly odd number. </p>
<p>Why was that gauge used? </p>
<p>Because that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were built by English expatriates. </p>
<p>Why did the English people build them like that? </p>
<p>Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. </p>
<p>Why did ""they"" use that gauge then? </p>
<p>Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. Okay! </p>
<p>Why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? </p>
<p>Well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on some of the old, long distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. </p>
<p>So who built these old rutted roads? </p>
<p>The first long distance roads in Europe were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their legions. The roads have been used ever since. </p>
<p>And the ruts? </p>
<p>The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. Since the chariots were made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. </p>
<p>Thus, we have the answer to the original questions. The United State standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original specification for an Imperial Roman army war chariot. Specs and Bureaucracies live forever. </p>
<p>So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's ass came up with it, you may be exactly right. Because the Imperial Roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two war horses.</p>

<p>Alice smiles: ""I'm going hunting with you!"" </p>
<p>Jake, though he had many reservations about this, reluctantly decides to take her along. Later they arrive at the hunting site. Jake sets his wife safely up in the tree stand and tells her: ""If you see a deer, take careful aim on it and I'll come running back as soon as I hear the shot"". </p>
<p>Jake walks away with a smile on his face knowing that Alice couldn't bag an elephant--much less a deer. Not 10 minutes pass when he is startled as he hears an array of gunshots. </p>

46693,"<p>In the dorm, one of the favorite intramural sports was water fights. Dousing and bombarding one another with water from squirt guns, glasses, balloons, even wastebaskets. Since each room had a sink, there was endless ammunition. The most frequent target was the resident assistant.<br /> Approaching his room one afternoon, he noticed his door was ajar. Looking up, he saw a pail of water balanced on the door's edge, ready to fall on him. As he took down the pail and emptied it into his sink, he thought, Those crazy guys actually thought they could fool me with that old gag! It was then he realized that ""those crazy guys"" had removed the drainpipe beneath the sink.</p>

46698,"<p>Unos monjes se encontraban reclu�dos en el monasterio, y tanto era el tiempo que llevaban sin follar, que decidieron compincharse con las monjas del convento que estaba pegado al suyo, y que tambi�n estaban bastante cachondas. De esta forma, se les ocurri� perforar unos agujeros en la pared en las capillas que solo estaban separadas por un tabique, de manera que a la hora de bajar a rezar pudieran realizar los actos sexuales.</p>
<p>A partir de entonces cada vez que sonaban las campanas para ir a rezar monjes y monjas se pegaban a la pared para echar un buen polvo. Ante el poco inter�s que mostraban los monjes al rezar y taras haber encontrado restos de sem�n en la pared, el padre superior decidi� instalar unas gillotinas en los agujeros y asi cada vez que un monje metiera la polla para follar se quedaria sin miembro para siempre.</p>
<p>Transcurrida una semana el padre superior reuni� a todos los monjes en el comedor para ver cuantos de los monjes hab�an quebrantado los votos sagrados. Puso a todos en fila e hizo que se subieran la sotana para ver si ten�an o no pene. Cual fue su sorpresa al descubrir que todos los monjes ya no ten�an pene excepto el �ltimo de la fila al que le pregunt�:</p>

46709,"<p>A young man who was also an avid golfer found himself with a few hours to<br /> spare one afternoon. He figured if he hurried and played very fast, he<br /> could get in 9 holes before he had to head home. Just as he was about to<br /> tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could<br /> accompany the young man as he was golfing alone. Not being able to say no,<br /> he allowed the old gent to join him.</p>
<p>To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball<br /> far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. Finally,<br /> they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough<br /> shot. There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball and it was<br /> directly between his ball and the green. After several minutes of debating<br /> how to hit the shot the old man finally said, ""You know, when I was your<br /> age I'd hit the ball right over that tree."" </p>
<p>With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the<br /> ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on<br /> the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay. The old man<br /> offered one more comment, ""Of course, when I was your age that pine tree<br /> was only 3 feet tall.""</p>

46753,"<p>Dear Tech Support: </p>
<p>I am desperate for some help. I recently upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that the new program began unexpected child processing and also took up a lot of space and valuable resources. This wasn't mentioned in the product brochure. </p>
<p>In addition Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialisation where it monitors all other system activity. </p>
<p>Applications such as Boys Night Out 2.5, and Golf 5.3 no longer run and crash the system whenever selected. Attempting to operate Sunday Football 6.3 always fails but Saturday Shopping 7.1 runs instead. I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background whilst attempting to run any of my favourite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0 but de-install doesn't work on this program. </p>
<p>Can you please help!<br /> Joe. </p>
<p>Dear Joe, </p>
<p>This is a very common problem resulting from a basic misunderstanding. </p>
<p>Many men upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 thinking that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT program. Whereas Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM designed by its creator to run everything. </p>
<p>You are unlikely to be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0 as Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this and it is impossible to de-install, delete or purge the program files from the system once installed. </p>
<p>Some people have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0, but have<br /> ended up with even more problems. (See in manual under Alimony/Child Support and Solicitors Fees). Having Wife 1.0 installed myself I recommend you keep it installed and deal with the difficulties as best you can. </p>
<p>When any faults or problems occur, whatever you think has caused them, you must run the C: IAPOLOGISE program and avoid attempting to use the *Esc-key. It may be necessary to run C: I APOLOGISE a number of times, but hopefully eventually the operating system will return to normal. </p>
<p>Wife 1.0 although a very high maintenance program can be very rewarding. To get the most out of it consider buying additional software such as Flowers 2.0 and Chocolates 5.0. </p>
<p>Do not under any circumstances install Secretary (Short Skirt version) as this is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and the system will almost certainly crash. </p>
<p>Best of luck!<br /> Tech Support</p>

46772,"<p>A Japanese company and an American company decided to have a canoe race. Both<br /> teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak performance before the race.<br /> On the big day the Japanese won by a mile. Afterward, the American team became<br /> very discouraged and morally depressed. </p>
<p>The American management decided the reason for the crushing defeat had to be<br /> found. A Management Team made up of senior management was formed to investigate<br /> and recommend appropriate action. Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people<br /> rowing and 1 person steering, while the American team had 8 people steering and<br /> one person rowing. </p>
<p>American management hired a consulting company and paid them an incredible<br /> amount of money. They advised that too many people were steering the boat, while<br /> not enough people were rowing. To prevent losing to the Japanese again next<br /> year, the rowing team's management structure was totally reorganized to 4<br /> steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant<br /> superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system<br /> that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder.<br /> It was called the Rowing Team Quality First Program, with meetings, dinners and<br /> free pens for the rower. We must give the rower the empowerment and enrichments<br /> through this quality program. </p>
<p>The next year the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the American<br /> management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new<br /> canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments for new equipment.<br /> Then they distributed the money saved as bonuses to the senior executives.</p>

46777,"<p>A young blonde female stock broker was bored with driving her BMW. It lacked individuality and besides that, every other girl in the office had one. She fancied something a bit more individual, perhaps a MG convertible.</p>
<p>That week she visited her local car dealer and spied a beautiful Jaguar XK140 convertible. It was wonderfully restored and she fell in love with it's gorgeous red paint job. An empty check stub later and off she was tearing down the leafy country lanes enjoying her beautiful new car. Her long blonde hair was flowing in the wind, music blaring from the radio, what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>At that thought there was a splutter from the engine and the car slowly coasted to a stop. She got out and lifted the bonnet and concluded after a few minutes that she didn't have a bloody clue what was wrong. Luckily she had her mobile phone with her and a quick phone call to the AutoClub and a short wait saw a bright shiny yellow van pull up behind her.</p>

Well, after 20 years the wife felt this was stupid. She<br /> figured she would break him out of his crazy habit. So one<br /> night, while they were in the middle of doing it, she  turned<br /> on the lights. She looked down and saw her husband was holding a<br /> dildo. She gets completely upset.<br /> ""You impotent bastard, "" she sreamed at him, "" how could you be<br /> lying to me all of these years. You better explain yourself!""<br /> The husband looks her straight in the eyes and says, calmly ""<br /> I'll explain the dildo....if you explain our three kids.""</p>

46789,"<p>The following supposedly a true story.This guy walked into a little corner store with a shot gun and demanded all the cash from the cash drawer. After the cashier put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a bottle of scotch that he wanted behind the counter on the shelf. He told the cashier to put it in the bag as well, but the cashier refused and said ""Because I don't believe you are over 21."" The robber said he was, but the clerk still refused to give the scotch to him because he didn't believe him. At this point the robber took his drivers license out of his wallet and gave it to the clerk. The clerk looked it over, and agreed that the man was in fact over 21 and he put the scotch in the bag. The robber then ran from the store with his loot. The cashier promptly called the police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got off of the license. They arrested the robber two hours later.</p>

46793,"<p>Three French legionaries are hiking across the desert where they<br /> have been for several days. They are out of food and on their<br /> last ration of water.</p>
<p>As they walk a bit further, the head legionary thinks he sees<br /> something up ahead and cries to the others (in a French accent),<br /> ""look! It is a bacon tree! It is what we 'ave been waiting for!""</p>
<p>And sure enough, there seems to be a tree covered with streaky<br /> bacon. Of course the legionaries are delighted, so desperate<br /> that they don't even consider the possibility of it being a<br /> mirage.</p>
<p>As they get closer, the head legionary says, ""Stay 'ere. I will<br /> investigate"". So he approaches, but as he does so, two gunshots<br /> penetrate the deadly silence, seeming to com from the bacon<br /> tree, and strike down the legionary. The tree disappears.</p>
<p>The other two rush to see if there is anything they can do, but<br /> it seems almost too late.</p>
<p>""Sir!"" they cry, ""are you alright?""</p>
<p>And the head legionary, before he dies, says, ""Zat was not a<br /> bacon tree...zat was an 'ambush!""</p>

46794,"<p>Last year, my friend upgraded his GirlFriend 3.1 to              GirlFriendPlus 1.0 (marketing name: Fiancee 1.0). Recently he              upgraded Fiancee 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and it's a memory hogger, has              taken all his space; and Wife 1.0 must be running before he can              do anything. Although he didn't ask for them, Wife 1.0 came              with Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw and BrotherInLaw.             Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend 4.0...             - A ""Don't remind me again"" button             - Minimize button             - Shutdown feature             - An installshield feature so that Girlfriend 4.0 can be              completely uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache              and other objects)             - ""Abort"" button (O.K. that one's pretty bad - but had to say it)             I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still              installed, they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted.              Then I tried to uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 but it didn't have an              uninstall program.              I tried to unstall it by hand, but it put files in my system              directory. Another thing that sucks -- in all versions of              Girlfriend that I've used is that it is totally ""object              orientated"" and only supports hardware with gold plated              contacts.             *****  BUG WARNING  ********             Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install              Mistress 1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will              delete MSMoney files before              doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse              to install, claiming insufficient resources.</p>

46796,"<p>One bright, beautiful Sunday morning, everyone in the tiny town of Johnstown got up early and went to the local church. Before the service started, the townspeople were sitting in their pews and talking about their lives, their families, etc. Suddenly, Satan appeared at the front of the church. Everyone started screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from the evil incarnate.<br /> Soon everyone is evacuated from the church except for one elderly gentleman who sat calmly in his pew, not moving, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy is in his presence. </p>
<p>Now this confused Satan a bit, so he walked up to the man and said, ""Hey! Don't you know who I am?"" </p>
<p>The man replied, ""Yep, sure do."" </p>
<p>Satan asked, ""Aren't you afraid of me?"" </p>
<p>""Nope, sure ain't,"" said the man. </p>
<p>Satan was a little perturbed at this and queried, ""Why aren't you afraid of me?"" </p>
<p>The man calmly replied, ""I've been married to your sister for 25 years.""</p>

46823,"<p>A young female teacher was giving an assignment to her 6th grade<br /> class one day. It was a large assignment so she started writing<br /> high up on the chalkboard. Suddenly there was a giggle from one<br /> of the boys in the class. She quickly turned and asked, ""What's<br /> so funny, Pat?"" ""I just saw one of your garters!"" </p>
<p>""Get out of my classroom,"" she yells, ""I don't want to see you<br /> for three days!"" </p>
<p>The teacher turns back to the chalkboard. Realizing she had<br /> forgotten to title the assignment, she reaches to the very top<br /> of the chalkboard. Suddenly there is an even louder giggle from<br /> another male student. She quickly turns and asks, ""What's so<br /> funny, Billy?"" </p>
<p>""I just saw both of your garters!"" </p>
<p>Again, she yells, ""Get out of my classroom! This time the<br /> punishment is more severe, I don't want to see you for three<br /> weeks!"" </p>
<p>Embarrassed and frustrated, she drops the eraser when she turns<br /> around again. So she bends over to pick it up. This time there<br /> is an burst of laughter from another male student. She quickly<br /> turns to see Little Johnny leaving the classroom. </p>

46824,"<p>Due to the great consternation caused by the revelation of my act of<br /> procreation, I accept my obligation to give an explanation to the population for<br /> my act of copulation.<br /> I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of sexual gratification, that I<br /> could not obtain through masturbation, which resulted in my fornication. I<br /> accepted her invitation, and provided her with excitation, stimulation,<br /> penetration, replication, and liberation. She provided lubrication (to avoid<br /> inflammation) and I wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried for<br /> duplication but I insisted upon termination, in spite of her fascination with<br /> variation.<br /> This has caused me great aggravation, and the agitation and provocation of the<br /> media has resulted in my humiliation, denigration, and degradation. My wife is<br /> considering castration, which would require my hospitalization.<br /> Pray that this matter will find culmination in my sanctification and<br /> rehabilitation so that my plans for nomination to my ultimate vocation will not<br /> result in revocation and termination. I hope this proclamation has provided<br /> illumination and verification and will prohibit further provocation.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> The Rev. Jesse Jackson.</p>

46841,"<p>MAN IN CALIF. SUES TOM RIDGE OVER DUCT TAPE ADVICE</p>
<p>Corona, CA(Corona Times)</p>
<p>Tom Ridge's advice to Americans to stock up on duct tape and plastic has sparked a lawsuit which has been filed against him, the Department of Homeland Security and President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>Steven J. Bosell, the owner of B &amp; B Construction in Corona, California, has filed a lawsuit claiming emotional distress, personal injury and sexual disfunction after he wrapped his ""privates"" in duct tape to protect them from a biological attack.</p>
<p>""After watching Mr. Ridge on television advising us to stock up on duct tape and plastic, I went to the local Costco and bought $100 worth of duct tape to protect myself"", Bosell said. ""When I got home, I taped up my windows and doors. After I did that I realized survivors like myself are going to reproduce and populate the Earth after a biological attack, we have to protect our privates as well.""</p>
<p>Bosell claimed in his lawsuit he wrapped his ""privates"" in duct tape as test of ""Homeland Security"". When he tried to remove the tape, Bosell injured himself when the tape began peeling off skin and body hair. After calling an ambulance, Bosell was taken to the hospital where the doctors and nurses laughed at him.</p>
<p>""I told the doctors and nurses at the hospital if they laughed, I would file a lawsuit against them and the hospital. They laughed anyways and I now have another lawsuit pending"" Bosell said with tears streaming down his face. ""They went out their way to make me look like a fool. Once I saw the doctors scalpel go toward my privates, I totally lost it and blacked out"".</p>
<p>Also named in the lawsuit is the President of the United States, George W. Bush. ""President Bush is just as liable for injury to my reproductive future because he hired Mr. Ridge to run the Department of Homeland Security and Mr. Ridge gave the nation bad advice. They also made me look like a fool."" Bosell sobbed.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security and the Bush Administration have no comment on Mr. Bosell's lawsuit.</p>

<p>""When I go to heaven, I want to see my grandpa again. But he<br /> better have lost the nose hair and the old-man smell."" Age 5</p>
<p>""I once heard the voice of God. It said ""Vrrrrmmmmm."" Unless it<br /> was just a lawn mower."" Age 11</p>
<p>""I don't know about you, but I enjoy watching paint dry. I<br /> imagine that the wet paint is a big freshwater lake that is the<br /> only source of water for some tiny cities by the lake. As the<br /> lake gets drier, the population gets more desperate, and<br /> sometimes there are water riots. Once there was a big fire and<br /> everyone died."" Age 13</p>
<p>""I like to go down to the dog pound and pretend that I've found<br /> my dog. Then I tell them to kill it anyway because I already<br /> gave away all of his stuff. Dog people sure don't have a sense<br /> of humor."" Age 14</p>

<p>""Democracy is a beautiful thing, except for that part about<br /> letting just any old yokel vote."" Age 10</p>

<p>""It would be terrible if the Red Cross Bloodmobile got into an<br /> accident. No, wait. That would be good because if anyone needed<br /> it, the blood would be right there."" Age 5</p>
<p>""Give me the strength to change the things I can, the grace to<br /> accept the things I cannot, and a great big bag of money."" Age 13</p>
<p>""For centuries, people thought the moon was made of green<br /> cheese. Then the astronauts found that the moon is really a big<br /> hard rock. That's what happens to cheese when you leave it out.""<br /> Age 6</p>
<p>""The only stupid question is the one that is never asked, except<br /> maybe ""Don't you think it is about time you audited my return?""<br /> or ""Isn't it morally wrong to give me a warning when, in fact, I<br /> was speeding?"""" Age 15</p>
<p>""Once, I wept for I had no shoes. Then I came upon a man who had<br /> no feet. So I took his shoes. I mean, it's not like he really<br /> needed them, right?"" Age 15</p>
<p>""I often wonder how come John Tesh isn't as popular a singer as<br /> some people think he should be. Then, I remember it's because he<br /> sucks."" Age 15</p>

Years passed, the boy has grown up and his father has died, leaving him alone. So, one day, the boy ventures to the closest large town, where he goes to a club in search of companionship. He strikes up a conversation with a beautiful young girl. Things are going well, and they end up back at her place. They are about to get into bed when the boy remembers his father's advice and shies away.""What's wrong?"" she asks. ""Well, my father told me that women have teeth down there"" replied the young man. ""Of course we haven't got teeth down there!! Have a look if you like."" So he takes her up on the offer.

The German found this smokey bottle.<br /> So he brought it back to the other two and they all opened it  togther<br /> (the  German  was  a  really  nice guy). Well, low and behold, a GENIE<br /> POPPED OUT! The genie granted them each one wish, and  of  course  all<br /> three  wanted  to  be back home. So the genie said he would grant them<br /> their wishes.</p>
<p>""But first, you must all do me a favor. Mr. American - I want you<br /> to  built me a restaurant here. Mr. German - you will make the kitchen<br /> for this restaurant. Mr. Chinaman - you will get the supplies for  the<br /> restaurant.  I  have a hot date waiting for me in Bagdad, so I have to<br /> go. But I will return in ONE MONTH. At that time, if you satisfied  my<br /> requirements, I will grant your wishes.""</p>
<p>So for one month, the three men American and German toiled  while<br /> the  Oriental  kinda lazed around and gave a helping hand to the other<br /> two. Then about 4 days before the genie's expected return, the<br /> Oriental disappeared.</p>
<p>Well, the genie came back, just as he promised, and asked  to  be<br /> shown what they had done.</p>
<p>He was amazed by the restaurant! Five dining rooms, a  tremendous<br /> main lobby - all made of bamboo! It was a magnificent feat. As for the<br /> kitchen - full utensils, running gas stoves, pots,  pans  -  all  made<br /> from shells, bamboo, and coconuts. An absolute wonder!</p>
<p>""But where are the supplies from Mr. Chinaman?""</p>
<p>The two men said they didn't know. All they knew was that he  had<br /> disappered  a  few  days ago and they hadn't seen hide nor hair of him<br /> since then. Suddenly from the shadows, out leaped the Oriental,<br /> shouting in a loud voice:</p>

Dave's friend said ""When you get home, just go slide beneath the sheets, pull her panties down and give her oral sex.""So Dave goes out with his friends and has a great time. When he comes home hours later, he goes into his room and slides beneath the sheets. He pulls down her panties and begins to give her oral sex. She starts to moan and groan. After awhile, Dave tells her that he has to go take a leak and for her to wait there. When Dave gets to the bathroom he's stunned to see his wife sitting on the john. ""How did you get here?"" he asked. ""Shhhh,"" she replied. ""My Mom is sleeping.""Submitted By: Julia</p>

46953,"<p>An Anagram is a word or phrase made by transposing or rearranging the<br /> letters of another word or phrase. The following examples are quite<br /> astounding (although I think someone has too much spare time on their<br /> hands).</p>
<p>Amazing anagrams:</p>
<p>Dormitory                 ==      Dirty Room<br /> Evangelist                ==      Evil's Agent<br /> Desperation               ==      A Rope Ends It<br /> The Morse Code            ==      Here Come Dots<br /> Slot Machines             ==      Cash Lost in 'em<br /> Animosity                 ==      Is No Amity<br /> Snooze Alarms             ==      Alas!

<p>The next two are truely really amazing. This well known phrase from Hamlet<br /> by Shakespeare:</p>
<p>""To be or not to be: that is the question, whether tis nobler in the<br />  mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.""</p>
<p>becomes:</p>
<p>""In one of the Bard's best-thought-of tragedies, our insistent hero,<br />  Hamlet, queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten.""</p>
<p>This phrase from more recent history (including the name of the man<br /> who uttered it):</p>
<p>""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.""<br /> - Neil A. Armstrong</p>
<p>becomes:</p>
<p>""A thin man ran; makes a large stride; left planet, pins flag on moon!<br />  On to Mars!""</p>

He then tells her that she can get dressed,<br /> then goes out to meet the man. ""Sir,"" the doctor says, ""There is<br /> nothing wrong with you. I couldn't get an erection either!""</p>

46965,"<p>I took some clients out to dinner last week, and I noticed a spoon in the shirt pocket of our waiter as he handed us the menus. It seemed a little odd, but I dismissed it as a random thing. Until our busboy came with water and tableware; he too, sported a spoon in his breast pocket. I looked around the room, and all the waiters and busboys had spoons in their pockets. When our waiter returned to take our order, I just had to ask, ""Why the spoons?""""Well,"" he explained, ""our parent company recently hired some Andersen Consulting efficiency experts to review all our procedures, and after months of statistical analyses, they concluded that our patrons drop spoons on the floor 73% more often than any other utensil, at a frequency of 3 spoons per hour per workstation. By preparing our workers for this contingency in advance, we can cut our trips to the kitchen down and save time... nearly 1.5 extra man-hours per shift."" Just as he concluded, a ""ch-ching"" came from the table behind him, and he quickly replaced the fallen spoon with the one from his pocket.""I'll grab another spoon the next time I'm in the kitchen instead of making a special trip,"" he proudly explained.I was impressed. ""Thanks, I had to ask.""""No problem,"" he answered. Then he continued to take our orders. As the members of our dinner party took their turns, my eyes darted back and forth from each person ordering and my menu. That's when, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a thin black thread protruding from our waiter's fly. Again, I dismissed it; yet I had to scan the room and, sure enough, there were other waiters and busboys with strings hanging out of their trousers. My curiosity overrode discretion at this point, so before he could leave I had to ask. ""Excuse me, but...uh...why, or what about that string?""""Oh, yeah,"" he began, in a quieter tone, ""not many people are that observant. That same efficiency group found we could save time in the Men's Room, too.""""How's that?"" I asked.""You see, by tying a string to the end of our, uh, selves, we can pull it out at the urinals literally hands-free and thereby eliminate the need to wash our hands, cutting time spent in the washroom by over 93%!""""Hey, wait a minute. If the string helps you pull it out, how do you get it back in?""""Well,"" he whispered, ""I don't know about the other guys, but I use the spoon.""</p>

It was small enough to make me cozy and at home.<br /> Last night, however, I found out that it bad been previously occupied, that there wasn't any heat and that it was entirely too large.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250 with the following letter.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, First of all, I cannot understand how you expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. As for the heat, there is plenty of it, if you know how to turn it on. Regarding the space, the apartment is indeed of regular size, but if you don't have enough furniture to fill it, please do not blame the landlady.</p>

And thus set in motion,<br /> A whole web o' spiders,<br /> With pundits galore,<br /> And ""White House insiders. You ask, ""Who would care<br /> About Bill and his penis?""<br /> Republican Ken Starr,<br /> And he's armed with subpoenas! More rapid than eagles,<br /> Process servers, they flew!<br /> ""Here's one for you!<br /> And for you! And you, too!"" ""Now Jordan! Now Cockell!<br /> Is there anyone else?!?<br /> Let's subpoena the lawyers!<br /> And Bubba himself!!"" ""We want you to tell us<br /> About Bill's private life,<br /> And anyone he sleeps with,<br /> 'cept, of course, his wife."" And many months later,<br /> After long we've all suffered,<br /> Let's examine more closely<br /> Just what Starr's uncovered. We've learned ""Little Bill""<br /> Has a mind of his own,<br /> And - horror of horrors -<br /> He likes to get blown! A funny fact surfaced,<br /> After 40 million bucks:<br /> Seems most people don't care<br /> Just who Clinton, er, makes love to. The economy's great,<br /> And shows no signs of slowing.<br /> Hell, we hope Ms. Lewinsky<br /> NEVER stops blowing! Now the public's grown weary.<br /> Will this sleaze never end?<br /> We just want to get back<br /> To ""E.R."", and to ""Friends."" Now Monica, Linda-<br /> And Ken Starr, you suck -<br /> Get the hell off my TV,<br /> Your 15 minutes are up.</p>

46994,"<p>A posh hotel holds three weddings on the same day and at the end of the night the 3 grooms meet up at the bar to discuss the days events over a couple of shandy's. </p>
<p>One questions the other two, ""listen, it's our wedding night and I was wondering - how many times are we expected to...um...you know.... do it"" The other two look blankly at him, wondering if the usual 2 pumps and a squirt is enough, or if should they go for it twice, seeing as it is a special occasion. Eventually, they all decide to retire to their respective wives and see how the night goes, with the idea to meet up the following morning over breakfast to discuss what went on. </p>
<p>Suddenly one of the grooms pipes up, ""Hold on lads, we can't discuss our first night marital goings on over the breakfast table with our new wives sat with us."" </p>
<p>""No you're right. What we'll do then, is for every piece of toast we order with our breakfast, that'll be the amount times we did it"" offers another groom. They all decide it's an excellent idea and depart. </p>
<p>The next day in the hotel dining room, the grooms are all looking a bit dishevelled, but that's nothing compared to the brides, who can barely stagger across the room to their tables. The waitress comes up to the first groom to take his order, ""Hello, I'll have the full English breakfast with THREE pieces of toast please"". The other two grooms smile at him and raise a glass of fresh orange in a toast to his fantastic prowess. </p>
<p>The waitress moves to the second couple, and the groom orders, ""I too shall have the full English breakfast but could I have FOUR pieces of toast"" The other two grooms turn to make pistols from their fingers to shoot a salute to the master swordsman. </p>
<p>The waitress gets to the last groom ""I shall also have the full English breakfast please, yet I shall have..."" he takes a deep breath ""SEVEN, yes SEVEN PIECES OF TOAST"" he calls for everyone's benefit whilst giving a big cheesy grin to his two wedding mates, who stare at him in disbelief at the thought how raw his poor corey must be. </p>
<p>""Seven pieces of toast sir?"" queries the waitress. ""Why, that's an awful lot"" </p>
<p>""Yes indeed young lady, seven pieces of toast it is."" She writes down his order and turns away, but before she can leave, the groom calls after her again </p>
<p>""And by the way love, can you make two of those brown?""</p>

<p>""Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage-- to move in the opposite direction.""</p>

<p>""Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.""</p>
<p>""God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates empirically.""</p>
<p>""The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.""</p>
<p>""Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.""</p>
<p>""We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.""</p>
<p>""Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school.""</p>
<p>""Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.""</p>
<p>""Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity.""</p>
<p>""If A is a success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut.""</p>
<p>""As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.""</p>
<p>""Yes, we have to divide up our time like that, between our politics and our equations. But to me our equations are far more important, for politics are only a matter of present concern. A mathematical equation stands forever.""</p>
<p>""...one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought.""</p>

<p>""Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.""</p>
<p>""The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.""</p>
<p>""Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.""</p>
<p>""Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.""</p>

<p>""Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds.""</p>
<p>""Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.""</p>
<p>""No, this trick won't work...How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love?""</p>
<p>""My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.""</p>
<p>""The release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking...the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind. If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker."" </p>
<p>""Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.""</p>
<p>""The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.""</p>
<p>""Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.""</p>

46998,"<p>There was a tribe in Africa which was very fierce and warring...they would battle all the tribes in the area, and they always won. As a victory trophy, they would take the throne of the chief of the defeated tribe and carry it home, chanting victory chants and singing the whole way. When they got home, they would put the throne in the attic of the grass hut. This went on for quite some time, and soon the throne collection grew, adding to the prestige of the tribe.One day, they battled a tribe of farily large people, some might call them giants. They won, and they struggled to get the throne home...but the chanting and joyesness prevailed as usual. When they got home, they had the ritual of putting the throne in the attic of the grass hut, but the weight was too much. The ceiling collapsed, killing everyone on the tribe.The moral: People who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.</p>
