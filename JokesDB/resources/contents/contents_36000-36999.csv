36007,"<p>BARKING: Because you are a dog, you are expected to bark. So bark--- a lot. Your owners will be very happy to hear you protecting their house. Especially late at night while they are sleeping safely in their beds. There is no more secure feeling for a human than to keep waking up in the middle of the night and hearing your protective bark, bark, bark...LICKING: Always take a BIG drink from your water dish immediately before licking your human. Humans prefer clean tongues. Be ready to fetch your human a towel.THE ART OF SNIFFING: Humans like to be sniffed. Everywhere. It is your duty, as the family dog, to accommodate them.DINING ETIQUETTE: Always sit under the table at dinner, especially when there are guests, so you can clean up any food that falls on the floor. It's also a good time to practice your sniffing.HOUSEBREAKING: Housebreaking is very important to humans, so break as much of the house as possible.GOING FOR WALKS: Rules of the road: When out for a walk with your master or mistress, never go to the bathroom on your own lawn.PLAYING: If you lose your footing while chasing a ball or stick, use the flower bed to absorb your fall so you don't injure yourself. CHASING CATS: When chasing cats, make sure you never--- quite--- catch them. It spoils all the fun</p>

"
36023,"<p>In order to brighten up the living room we bought a pet fish and an aquarium to put it in. The fish was brightly coloured and I often liked to watch it as it swam contentedly round and round its little rectangular tank of water. It was so friendly and tame that it was happy to take food directly out of my hand. Having an interest in the theories of Charles Darwin, as an experiment one day I decided to see how the fish would adapt to change. So each day I would remove a tablespoonful of the water and replace it with a tablespoonful of seawater. This went on for several months until eventually the fish was happily swimming around in pure seawater.I decided to reverse the process, and each day, I would remove a tablespoonful of seawater from the tank and replaced it with a tablespoonful of fresh water until the water in the tank was completely returned to fresh water. The fish was none the worse for his experience.Encouraged by this success I decided to try a further experiment. Each day I would remove a tablespoonful of the water from the tank to see if the fish could adapt to the changed circumstances of reduced water levels. Although the fish had difficulty adapting at first it was eventually able to lie on the bed of the tank and breath air. Later I decided to move the fish to a disused budgerigar cage and was surprised to see that the fish had adapted to its new circumstances and was cheerfully hopping from perch to perch, ringing the bell, and playing on the swing. The fish lived like this for several months until sadly one day it fell from its perch straight into the bowl of drinking water and drowned.</p>

36037,"<p>1. How Dogs and Men Are the SameBoth take up too much space on the bed.Both have irrational fears about vacuum cleaning.Both are threatened by their own kind.Both mark their territory.Both are bad at asking you questions.Neither tells you what's bothering them.The smaller ones tend to be more nervous.Both have an inordinate fascination with women's crotches.Neither does any dishes.Both fart shamelessly.Neither of them notices when you get your hair cut.Both like dominance games.Both are suspicious of the postman.Neither knows how to talk on the telephone.Neither understands what you see in cats.2. How Dogs Are Better Than MenDogs do not have problems expressing affection in public.Dogs miss you when you're gone.Dogs feel guilt when they've done something wrong.Dogs don't criticize your friends.Dogs admit when they're jealous.Dogs are very direct about wanting to go out.Dogs don't laugh at how you throw.Dogs don't feel threatened by your intelligence.You can train a dog.Dogs are easy to buy for.You are never suspicious of your dog's dreams.The worst social disease you can get from dogs is fleas.  (OK. The really worst disease you can get from them is rabies, but  there's a vaccine for it, and you get to kill the one that gives it to  you.)Dogs understand what no means.Dogs understand if some of their friends cannot come inside.Middle-aged dogs don't feel the need to abandon you for a younger ownerDogs admit it when they're lost.Dogs are colorblind.Dogs aren't threatened if you earn more than they do.Dogs mean it when they kiss you.3. Where Dogs Fall DownMen only have two feet that track in mud.Men can buy you presents.Men don't have to play with every man they see when you take them aroundthe block. Men are a little bit more subtle.Men don't eat turds on the sly.Dogs have dog breath all the time.Men can do math stuff.  But then, who really needs a man to do math?Men don't shed as much, and if they do, they hide it.It's fun to dry off a wet man.And the reverse-----4. WHY DOGS ARE BETTER THAN WOMEN.....* Dogs don't ask what are you thinking.* Dogs don't cry.* Dogs love it when your friends come over.* Dogs don't care if you use their shampoo.* Dogs think you sing great.* A dog's time in the bathroom is confined to a quick drink.* Dogs don't expect you to call when you are running late.* The later you are, the more excited dogs are to see you* Dogs will forgive you for playing with other dogs.* Dogs don't notice if you call them by another dog's name.* Dogs are excited by rough play.* Dogs don't mind if you give their offspring away.* Dogs love red meat.* Dogs can appreciate excessive body hair.* Anyone can get a good-looking dog.* If a dog is gorgeous, other dogs don't hate it.* Dogs don't shop.* Dogs like it when you leave lots of things on the floor.* A dog's disposition stays the same all month long.* Dogs never need to examine the relationship.* A dog's parents never visit.* Dogs love long car trips.* Dogs understand that instincts are better than asking for directions.* Dogs understand that all animals smaller than dogs were made to be     hunted.</p>

Scared and drunk, they stopped and decided to go there anyway.The first one did not have anything to clean herself with, so she took off her panties and used them to clean herself and discarded them.The second not finding anything either, thought ""I'm not getting rid of my panties..."" so she used the ribbon of a flower wreath to clean herself.The morning after, the two husbands were talking to each other on the phone, and one says to the other: "" We have to be on the look-out, it seems that these two were up to no good last night, my wife came home without her panties..."".The other one responded: ""You're lucky, mine came home with a card stuck to her ass that read, ""We will never forget you"".</p>

36044,"<p>DAD - Son, come in here, we need to talk.</p>
<p>SON - What's up, Dad?</p>
<p>DAD - There's a scratch down the side of the car. Did you do it?</p>
<p>SON - I don't believe; if I understand the definition of ""scratch the car""; that I can say, truthfully,that I scratched the car.</p>
<p>DAD - Well, it wasn't there yesterday, and you drove the car last night, and no one else has driven it since. How can you explain the scratch?</p>
<p>SON - Well, as I've said before, I have no recollection of scratching the car. While it is true that I did take the car out last night, I did not scratch it.</p>
<p>DAD - But your sister, Monica, has told me she saw you back the car against the mailbox at the end of the driveway, heard a loud scraping sound, saw you get out to examine the car, and then drive away. So again I'll ask you, yes or no, did you scratch the car?</p>
<p>SON - Oh, you mean you think you have evidence to prove I scratched it. Well, you see, I understood you to mean did ""I"" scratch the car. I stand by my earlier statement, that I did not scratch the car.</p>
<p>DAD - Are you trying to tell me you didn't drive the car into the mailbox?</p>
<p>SON - Well, you see sir, I was trying to drive the car into the street. I mishandled the steering of the car, and it resulted in direct contact with the mailbox, though that was clearly not my intent.</p>
<p>DAD - So you are then saying that you did hit the mailbox?</p>
<p>SON - No sir, that's not my statement. I'll refer you back to my original statement that I did not scratch the car.</p>
<p>DAD - But the car did hit the mailbox, and the car did get scratched as a result of this contact?</p>
<p>SON - Well, yes, I suppose you could look at it that way.</p>
<p>DAD - So you lied to me when you said you did not scratch the car?</p>
<p>SON - No. No, that's not correct. Your question was ""Did I scratch the car?"" From a strict legal definition, as I understood the meaning of that sentence, I did not scratch the car... the mailbox did... I was merely present when the scratching occurred. So my answer of ""No"" when you asked ""Did I scratch the car"" was legally correct, although I did not volunteer information.</p>
<p>DAD - Where in the heck did you learn to be such a liar?</p>
<p>SON - From The President of the United States.</p>

<p>The next day a incredibly hot chick also managed to get stranded<br /> on the island. She was very sick when she came, so the horny guy<br /> helped out. After she was feeling better she went to the horny<br /> guy and said ""you've saved my life I will do anything for you.""<br /> So the horny turns to her and asks, ""Will you take the dog for a<br /> walk?""</p>

<p>FREE BEER FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN PASS OUR TEST! </p>
<p>So the guy asks the bartender what the test is. The Bartender replies ""Well,<br /> first you have to drink that whole gallon of pepper tequila, the whole thing at<br /> once and you can't make a face while doing it. Second, there's a 'gator out back<br /> with a sore tooth...you have to remove it with your bare hands. Third, there's a<br /> woman up-stairs who's never had an orgasm. You got to make things right for<br /> her.""<br /> The guy says, ""Well, as much as I would love free beer, I won't do it. You<br /> have to be nuts to drink a gallon of pepper tequila and then get crazier from<br /> there. Well, as time goes on and the man drinks a few, he asks, ""Where sat<br /> tequila?"" </p>
<p>He grabs the gallon of tequila with both hands, and downs it with a big slurp<br /> and tears streaming down his face. Next, he staggers out back and soon all the<br /> people inside hear the most frightening roaring and thumping, then silence. </p>
<p>The man staggers back into the bar, his shirt ripped, and big scratches all<br /> over his body. ""Now"" he says ""Where's that woman with the sore tooth?""</p>

36091,"<p>Billy Joe and Emma Sue are a redneck couple, and one day they<br /> decide to get hitched. So, both clans come out and do the<br /> hillbilly wedding thing--shotguns, whiskey, the whole deal.</p>
<p>On the wedding night, Billy Joe takes Emma Sue out to his<br /> father's hunting cabin for their honeymoon. As he's carrying her<br /> over the threshold, Emma Sue leans over and whispers in his ear,<br /> ""Billy Joe, I'm a little nervous. You know, I ain't never been<br /> with a man before.""

36097,"<p>The usual large flamboyant typeface associated with the season's greetings had been downsized this year commensurate with the trend toward corporate downsizing. [And the fact that SMTP does not support typeface control].<br /> The recent announcement that Donner and Blitzen have elected to take the early reindeer retirement package has triggered a good deal of concern about whether they will be replaced, and about other restructuring at the North Pole. </p>
<p>Streamlining was appropriate in view of the reality that the North Pole no longer dominates the season's gift distribution business. Home shopping channels and mail order catalogues have diminished Santa's market share and he could not sit idly by and permit further erosion of the profit picture. </p>
<p>The reindeer downsizing was made possible through the purchase of a late model Japanese sled for the CEO's annual trip. Improved productivity from Dasher and Dancer, who summered at the Harvard Business School, is anticipated and should take up the slack with no discernible loss of service. Reduction in reindeer will also lessen airborne environmental emissions for which the North Pole has been cited and received unfavorable press. </p>
<p>I am pleased to inform you and yours that Rudolph's role will not be disturbed. Tradition still counts for something at the North Pole. Management denies, in the strongest possible language, the earlier leak that Rudolph's nose got that way not from the cold, but from substance abuse. Calling Rudolph ""a lush who was into the sauce and never did pull his share of the load"" was an unfortunate comment, made by one of Santa's helpers and taken out of context at a time of year when he is known to be under executive stress. </p>
<p>As a further restructuring, today's global challenges required the North Pole to continue to look for better, more competitive steps. Effective immediately, the following economy measures are to take place in the ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" subsidiary: </p>
<p>The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree never turned out to be the cash crop forecasted. It will be replaced by a plastic hanging plant, providing considerable savings in maintenance. </p>
<p>The two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not cost effective. In addition, their romance during working hours could not be condoned. The positions are therefore eliminated. </p>
<p>[The three French hens will remain intact. After all, everyone loves the French!] </p>
<p>The four calling birds were replaced by an automated voice mail system, with a call waiting option. An analysis is underway to determine who the birds have been calling, how often, and how long they talked. </p>
<p>The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of Directors. Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could have negative implications for institutional investors. Diversification into other precious metals as well as a mix of T-Bills and high technology stocks appear to be in order. </p>
<p>The six geese-a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer be afforded. It has long been felt that the production rate of one egg per goose per day is an example of the decline in productivity. Three geese will be let go, and an upgrade in the selection procedure by personnel will assure management that from now on every goose it gets will be a good one. </p>
<p>The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in better times. The function is primarily decorative. Mechanical swans are on order. The current swans will be retrained to learn some new strokes and therefore enhance their outplacement. </p>
<p>As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under heavy scrutiny by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the workforce is being sought. The more militant maids consider this a dead-end job with no upward mobility. Automation of the process may permit the maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring or a-mulching. </p>
<p>Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number. This function will be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no longer do the steps. </p>
<p>Ten lords-a-leaping is overkill. The high cost of Lords plus the expense of international air travel prompted the Compensation Committee to suggest replacing this group with ten out-of-work congressmen. While leaping ability may be somewhat sacrificed, the savings are significant because we expect an oversupply of unemployed congressmen this year. </p>
<p>Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple case of the band getting too big. A substitution with a string quartet, a cutback on new music and no uniforms will produce savings which will drop right down to the bottom line. </p>
<p>We can expect a substantial reduction is assorted people, fowl, animals and other expenses. Though incomplete, studies indicate that stretching deliveries over twelve days in inefficient. If we can drop ship in one day, service levels will be improved. </p>
<p>Lastly, it is not beyond consideration that deeper cuts may be necessary in the future to stay competitive. Should that happen, the Board will request management to scrutinize the Snow White Division to see if seven dwarfs is the right number.</p>

"
36101,"<p>A butcher is working, and really busy. He notices a big black lab in his shop and shoos him away. Later, he notices the lab is back again. </p>
<p>He walks over to the lab, and notices the dog has a note in his mouth. The butcher takes the note, and it reads, ""Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please."" The butcher looks, and lo and behold, in the lab's mouth, there is a 20 dollar bill.</p>
<p>So the butcher takes the money, puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, and places the bag in the lab's mouth. The butcher is very impressed, and since it's closing time, he decides to close up shop and follow the lab. So, off he goes. </p>
<p>The lab trots off down the street and comes to a crossing. The lab puts down the bag, jumps up and presses the crossing button. Then he waits, bag in mouth, for the lights to change. When it does, he walks across the road, with the butcher following. The lab then comes to a bus stop, and starts looking at the timetable. The butcher is in awe at this stage. </p>
<p>The lab checks out the times, and sits on one of the benches. Along comes a bus. The lab walks to the front of the bus, looks at the number, and goes back to his bench. Another bus comes. Again the lab goes and checks out the number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on. The butcher, by now fully intrigued, follows the lab onto the bus. </p>
<p>The bus travels thru town and out to the suburbs. Eventually the lab gets up, moves to the front of the bus, and standing on his hind legs, pushes the button to stop the bus. The dog gets off, groceries still in his mouth, and the butcher still in tow. They walk down the road, and the dog approaches a house. </p>
<p>He walks up the path, and drops the groceries on the step. Then he walks back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whomp!- against the door. Then he goes back down the path, takes another run, and throws himself -whomp!- against the door again! There's no answer at the door, so the lab goes back down the path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter of the garden. </p>
<p>He gets to a window, and bangs his head against it several times. He walks back, jumps off the wall, and waits at the door. The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door, and starts laying into the lab, who now hangs his head in shame. </p>
<p>The butcher runs up and stops the guy. ""What the heck are you doing? This dog is a genius. He could be on TV!"" </p>
<p>To which the guy responds, ""Clever, my eye. This is the second time this week he's forgotten his key!""</p>

He looked and looked, but didn't<br /> know how to choose. So he went back up to the front desk, ""How<br /> many types are there?"" ""Four."" she responed. The man was still<br /> confused. Noticing this the lady told him, ""The types are<br /> Catholic, Salvation Army, the Presbyterian, and the Baptist<br /> type."" ""What is the differance?"" ""Well, the Catholic type holds<br /> up the masses, the Salvation Army type lifts what's fallen, the<br /> Presbyterian type keeps the staunch and upright, and the Baptist<br /> type makes a mountain out of a mole-hill.""</p>

36104,"<p>There's this old priest who got sick of all the people in his parish who kept confessing to adultery. One Sunday, in the pulpit, he said, ""if I hear one more person confess to adultery, I'll quit!"" Well, everyone liked him, so they came up with a code word. Someone who had committed adultery would say they had ""fallen"".<br /> This seemed to satisfy the old priest and things went well, until the priest died at a ripe old age. About a week after the new priest arrived, he visited the Mayor of the town and seemed very concerned. The priest said, ""you have to do something about the sidewalks in town.When people come into the confessional, they keep talking about having fallen."" The Mayor started to laugh, realizing that no-one had told the new priest about the code word. </p>
<p>Before the mayor could explain, the priest shook an accusing finger at the mayor and said, ""I don't know what you're laughing about, Your wife fell three times this week.""</p>

36109,"<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, 22 October 1998WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department today filed suit against Ford  Motor Company, alleging that Ford's practice of 'bundling'  radios with its cars was a monopolistic restriction of trade, and an  unfair competitive practice against makers of car radios such as  Alpine and Pioneer.'We feel that it is wrong for Ford to give away what other  companies charge for,' said Joe Klein, head of the DOJ's  antitrust division. 'Furthermore, requiring that Ford dealers  deliver cars to consumers with radios preinstalled restricts consumer  choice.'Justice demanded that Ford immediately cease shipping cars with  radios, and that it provide current Ford owners with easy  instructions for removing their existing radios. Klein also asked a  judge to impose a $1,000,000 per day fine on Ford for each day it  failed to comply. 'Usually, antitrust fines are about $10,000 per  day,' Klein said. Klein called the amount of the requested fine  'unprecendented', but then said, 'Well, you know, what  the hell.'</p>

<p>Well, one day we got a service call that said, ""Cat caught in machine, come quick!""</p>
<p>When I arrived I saw everyone sitting around mending their various wounds, scratches and contusions. No sight of the cat. It appears that while they were running the machine the cat was twirling his tail in his usual fashion and stuck it down into the printer at the most inopportune time and got sucked in! Apparently, the cat absolutely freaked out and clawed at everyone who came close. They finally freed the cat, and to this day, the cat goes nowhere near the machine.</p>

<p>13&gt; After every child's request, asks, ""Wouldn't you rather have a nice big bag of clams?"" </p>
<p>12&gt; The twinkle in his eye and the twitch of his nose are due to a lack of medication. </p>

"
36162,"<p>An optimist sees the best in the world, while a pessimist sees only the worst. An optimist finds the positive in the negative, and a pessimist can only find the negative in the positive.For example, an avid duck hunter was in the market for a new bird dog. His search ended when he found a dog that could actually walk on water to retrieve a duck. Shocked by his find, he was sure none of his friends would ever believe him.He decided to try to break the news to a friend of his, a pessimist by nature, and invited him to hunt with him and his new dog.As they waited by the shore, a flock of ducks flew by. they fired, and a duck fell. The dog responded and jumped into the water. The dog, however, did not sink but instead walked across the water to retrieve the bird, never getting more than his paws wet. This continued all day long; each time a duck fell, the dog walked across the surface of the water to retrieve it.The pessimist watched carefully, saw everything, but did not say a single word.On the drive home the hunter asked his friend, ""Did you notice anything unusual about my new dog?""""Yes, I sure did,"" responded the pessimist. ""He can't swim.""</p>

36166,"<p>Thanksgiving Forecast: </p>
<p>Turkeys will thaw in the morning, then warm in the oven to an afternoon high near 190F.The kitchen will turn hot and humid, and if you bother the cook, be ready for a severe squall or cold shoulder. </p>
<p>During the late afternoon and evening, the cold front of a knife will slice through the turkey, causing an accumulation of one to two inches on plates. Mashed potatoes will drift across one side while cranberry sauce creates slippery spots on the other. Please pass the gravy. </p>
<p>A weight watch and indigestion warning have been issued for the entire area, with increased stuffiness around the beltway.During the evening, the turkey will dimish and taper off to leftovers, dropping to a low of 34F in the refrigerator. </p>
<p>Looking ahead to Friday and Saturday, high pressure to eat sandwiches will be established.Flurries of leftovers can be expected both days with a 50 percent chance of scattered soup late in the day.We expect a warming trend where soup develops.By early next week, eating pressure will be low as the only wish left will be the bone.</p>

36174,"<p>El ""V�a Crudis"" es un periodo de recogimiento espiritual donde diariamente, los parroquianos de todos los bares y cantinas de la arquidi�cesis se ponen a cargar con la Cruz de su Parroquia.</p>
<p>Los parroquianos del V�a Crudis son muy devotos de las bebidas espirituosas, y cada bebida espirituosa tiene su Santo Patrono.</p>
<p>Estos son los principales venerables que componen el santoral de las bebidas espirituosas:</p>
<p>SAN CUBAS TADEO, el santo patrono del ron con refresco de cola, es sin duda uno de los santos m�s populares. Le tienen devoci�n los parroquianos de todas las clases y condiciones sociales.</p>
<p>SAN MARTINI DE PORRES, la figura m�s venerada de los c�cteles, es un santo muy sofisticado y cosmopolita.</p>
<p>SAN GRIA es un santo dulce y de sabor afrutado. Siempre refrescante, San Gria esta muy relacionado con la uva.</p>
<p>SAN JOS� CUERVO, patrono del agave tequilero, ha cobrado mucha popularidad �ltimamente y ha pasado de ser un santo populachero a un santo elitista.</p>
<p>SAN GRITA, compa�ero inseparable de San Jos� Cuervo, es un santo picosito que sirve como botana.</p>
<p>SAN PEDRO DOMECQ, originario del Valle Calafia, es un santo dedicado a las Bebidas de uva, sobre todo al brandy y a los vinos.</p>
<p>SAN BUCA es un santo digestivo originario de Italia.</p>
<p>SANTA CLARA es la santa patrona de las monjas del rompope. La hermana Engracia es la Madre Superiora de la orden que le rinde culto a Santa Clara.</p>
<p>SANTA CLAUS, adem�s de ser el gordito sonriente y bonach�n que todas las Navidades les trae regalos a los ni�os que se portan bien, es el padrino de  la sidra que trae como regalo burbujas de sabor.</p>
<p>SANTA CHELA, de distintos or�genes, pero pocos le hacen gestos, es una santa que siempre ha gozado de popularidad.</p>
<p>Y por ultimo, SANTA CRUZ. Una santa muy temida, pero de la que nadie se salva, pues es la que se sufre al d�a siguiente de haber rendido culto a cualquiera de los santos mencionados con anterioridad.</p>

36175,"<p>A man was having problems with premature ejaculation so he decided to go<br /> to the doctor. He asked the doctor what could he do to cure his problem. </p>
<p>In response the doctor said, ""When you feel like you are getting ready to<br /> ejaculate try startling yourself"". </p>
<p>That same day the man went to the store and bought himself a starter<br /> pistol. All excited to try this suggestion out he runs home to his wife. </p>
<p>At home his wife is in bed, naked and waiting on her husband. As the two<br /> begin, they find themselves in the '69' position. The man, moments later,<br /> feels the sudden urge to come and fires the starter pistol. </p>
<p>The next day, the man went back to the doctor. The doctor asked, ""How did<br /> it go?""</p>
<p>The man answered, ""Not that well..when I fired the pistol my wife crapped<br /> on my face, bit 3 inches off my penis and my neighbor came out of the<br /> closet with his hands in the air!""</p>

The line of the men that were dominated by their women was 100 miles long, and in the line of men that dominated their women, there was only one man. </p>
<p>God got mad and said, ""You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created you in my image and you were all whipped by your mates. Look at the only one of my sons that stood up and made me proud. Learn from him! Tell them my son, how did you manage to be the only one in this line?"" </p>

36178,"<p>Somewhere in America, next week...</p>
<p>Dad: Son, come in here, we need to talk.<br /> Son: What's up, Dad?</p>
<p>Dad: There's a scratch down the side of the car. Did you do it?<br /> Son: I don't believe, if I understand the definition of ""scratch the car"", that I can say, truthfully, that I did not scratch the car.</p>
<p>Dad: Well, it wasn't there yesterday, and you drove the car last night, and no one else has driven it since. How can you explain the scratch?<br /> Son: Well, as I've said before, I have no recollection of scratching the car. While it is true that I did take the car out last night, I did not scratch it.</p>
<p>Dad: But your sister, Monica, has told me she saw you back the car<br /> against the mailbox at the end of the driveway, heard a loud scraping<br /> sound, saw you get out to examine the car, and then drive away. So again I'll ask you, yes or no, did you scratch the car?<br /> Son: Oh, you mean you think you have evidence to prove I scratched it. Well, you see, I understood you to mean did ""I"" scratch the car. I<br /> stand by my earlier statement, that I did not scratch the car.</p>
<p>Dad: Are you trying to tell me you didn't drive the car into the<br /> mailbox?<br /> Son: Well, you see sir, I was trying to drive the car into the street. I mishandled the steering of the car, and it resulted in direct contact with the mailbox, though that was clearly not my intent.</p>
<p>Dad: So you are then saying that you did hit the mailbox?<br /> Son: No sir, that's not my statement. I'll refer you back to my<br /> original statement that I did not scratch the car.</p>
<p>Dad: But the car did hit the mailbox, and the car did get scratched as a result of this contact?<br /> Son: Well, yes, I suppose you could look at it that way.</p>
<p>Dad: So you lied to me when you said you did not scratch car?<br /> Son: No. No, that's not correct. Your question was ""Did I scratch<br /> the car?"". From a strict legal definition, as I understood the meaning of that sentence, I did not scratch the car... the mailbox did... I was merely present when the scratching occurred. So my answer of ""No"" when you asked ""Did I scratch the car"" was legally correct, although I did not volunteer information.</p>
<p>Dad: Where did you learn to talk like a complete idiot?<br /> Son: From The President of the United States.</p>

The police had to close the<br /> bridge because a group of, one car, one truck and a busload of<br /> people were chanting 'jump jump jump.'

<p>People are idiots<br /> Two days ago on Long Island, New York, a hispanic man who had<br /> recently robbed a few department stores had run away into the<br /> woods while police chased him. Know what he did? Climbed a tree.<br /> The police found him. He grabbed for something, a police officer<br /> said, ""He's got a gun"" and shot him down.</p>
<p>People are illiterate<br /> Recently two men, just starting out as crooks, were robbing<br /> vetrenary offices. Im not sure of the correct<br /> spelling/puncuation but they found what they thought read<br /> 'Histofetimene' which is a new drug out that gives a 'heroine<br /> high simulation' without the risk. They took it, turned up a day<br /> later in a hospital. Turns out the drug was actually used to<br /> 'lessen contractions during dog birth' or something. Jackasses.</p>
<p>People are ignorant<br /> A ground crew for a news station couldn't get to the site of an<br /> accident to report what happened because the power cord to the<br /> camera didnt reach far enough.

36196,"<p>A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo, and when the<br /> herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back of the herd that<br /> are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole,<br /> because the general speed and health of the whole herd is maintained or even<br /> improved by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way,<br /> the human brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells through<br /> which the electrical signals pass. </p>
<p>Recent etiological studies have shown that while excessive intake of alcohol<br /> kills off brain cells, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.<br /> Thus, regular consumption of spirits helps eliminate the weaker cells,<br /> constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. The result of<br /> this in-depth study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend<br /> parties and job-related performance. It also explains why, after a few short<br /> years of completing university studies and then getting married and settling<br /> down, most professionals cannot keep up with the performance of the new<br /> graduates. Only those few that stick to the strict regimen of voracious<br /> alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that they achieved<br /> during their university years.</p>
<p>So, this is a call to arms. As our country is losing its technological edge we<br /> should not shudder in our homes. But get back into the bars and pubs and quaff<br /> that pint! Your company and your country needs you to be at your peak, and at<br /> your best, and you shouldn't deny yourself the career opportunities that you<br /> could achieve through excessive alcohol consumption. Take life by the bottle and<br /> be all that you can be! And remember a good cold beer will kill those bad,<br /> useless brain cells that are slowing you down and it will make the necessary<br /> room needed to get the good brain cells up front and at the top ready to perform<br /> at their best. So bottoms up, down the hatch, look out brain it's coming fast!</p>

36206,"<p>One day there was a man who was walking through the forest and<br /> got lost. He wandered around for over a week, and was beginning<br /> to starve. He spotted a Bald Eagle who had just caught a fish<br /> and chased it, hoping to get it to drop the fish so he could eat<br /> it. Then he saw the bird land on a tree stump not far from him,<br /> so he picked up a stone to toss at it--hoping the bird would be<br /> frightened and fly away WITHOUT the fish. But, weak as he was,<br /> his aim was off and he hit the poor bird square on the head and<br /> killed it! ""Well,"" he thought to himself, ""no sense letting it<br /> go to waste, if I leave it here it will just rot, and it could<br /> save my life if I eat it."" So, he built himself a little<br /> fire--using a couple of stones--and cooked the eagle to eat.<br /> While it was cooking a ranger stumbled upon the man, and when he<br /> saw what he was up to, he immediately arrested him--because as<br /> you know, that is quite illegal! The man told the ranger what<br /> had happened, and asked for a trial so he could explain the<br /> situation to a judge. </p>
<p>So, the day of his trial he told the judge, ""Please Your Honor,<br /> it was a life or death situation! I was lost and starving, and I<br /> didn't mean to harm the bird--I only wanted the fish! And when I<br /> accidentally killed it, well, I felt terrible but couldn't see<br /> any reason to let it go to waste!"" </p>
<p>The judge listened to the man's story and deemed him, ""Not<br /> guilty, on the grounds of extenuating circumstances.""</p>
<p>The man was very grateful, and thanked the judge for his<br /> fairness. Then, the judge leaned over and quietly asked the man,<br /> ""Just between you and me, what DOES a Bald Eagle taste like<br /> anyway??""</p>
<p>The man comtemplated this for a moment and then spoke, ""Well,<br /> it's kind of hard to explain... but, I would say somewhere<br /> between a California Condor and a Spotted Owl.""</p>

You have to say 'Thank God' to make it go and 'Amen' to make it stop."" Not paying much attetion, the man says, ""Sure, ok."" So he gets on the horse and says, ""Thank God"" and the horse starts walking. Then he says, ""Thank God, thank God,"" and the horse starts trotting. Feeling really brave, the man says, ""Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God"" and the horse just takes off.

He sits down and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. Marty looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotless, clean. So is the rest of the house. He takes the aspirins and notices a note on the table, ""Honey, breakfast is in the warming oven, I left early to go shopping. Love you.""</p>
<p>So he goes to the kitchen and sure enough there is a hot breakfast and the morning newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating. Marty asks, ""Son, what happened last night?""</p>
<p>His son says, ""Well, you came home after 3 A.M., drunk and delirious. Broke some furniture, puked in the hallway, and gave yourself a black eye when you stumbled into the door.""</p>

36274,"<p>There was this preacher who was an avid golfer. Every chance he could get, he could be found on the golf course swinging away. It was an obsession. One Sunday was a picture perfect day for golfing. The sun was out, no clouds in the sky, and the temperature was just right. The preacher was in a quandary as to what to do, and shortly, the urge to play golf overcame him. He called an assistant to tell him that he was sick and could not do church, packed the car up, and drove three hours to a golf course where no one would recognize him. Happily, he began to play the course.An angel up above was watching the preacher and was quite perturbed. He went to God and said, ""Look at the preacher. He should be punished for what he is doing."" God nodded in agreement.The preacher teed up on the first hole. He swung at the ball, and it sailed effortlessly through the air and landed right in the cup three hundred and fifty yards away (as they say in basketball, nothing but net). A picture perfect hole-in-one. He was amazed and excited.The angel was a little shocked. He turned to God and said, ""Begging Your pardon, but I thought you were going to punish him.""God smiled. ""Think about it -- who can he tell?""</p>

36275,"<p>When Choosing A Mate, Compare These Other Professionals To Computer EngineersDOCTORS------- Supposedly, all women are after a Doctor, so don't expect your relationship to last more than 5 years. Eventually, he'll run off with some nurse from his office, or one of his young women patients that is pretending to be sick. He'll wait until you are stuck with a few kids to do this. This is not a problem with your Engineer husband. He had a hard enough time meeting you. It is unlikely he'll ever meet another woman in his profession. LAWYER------ Do You seriously expect an honest, trusting relationship with someone who gets paid for lying? Once again, this is not a problem with your Engineer spouse. He doesn't have enough social skills to lie convincingly. An additional drawback to marrying a lawyer is when the divorce happens you will get nothing. SALESMAN-------- See honesty segment under Lawyer. Plus, he will be travelling to trade shows, etc. where he will be in the company of other equally trustworthy individuals. Don't be surprised when you get the invitation to show up on the Ricki Lake show. The company that your Engineer husband works at will keep him in a cage, often called a cubicle, until he is ready to go home to you. HAZARDOUS PROFESSIONS,---------------------- I.E. POLICE OFFICER, FIREFIGHTER, CONSTRUCTION WORKER, ETC.Your husband, if he is not dead by some accident, will likely be crippled with a back injury, etc. just about the time you are at your sexual peak. The only hazards that your Engineer husband will face is losing his eyesight by staring at the terminal for too long. This hazard actually has some benefits. For one, he will not notice that you are getting older, since you will be a blur. He will remember you as when he first met you, because the memory will still be sharp, and you ask ""Honey, were you looking at her?"", he'll honestly be able to say that he didn't even see her. TEACHER------- The only reason he entered this profession is so that he could be surrounded by newly post-pubescent girls who idolise him. He'll be in jail soon, and then you'll have to look for another man.</p>

36287,"<p>1.  Do not expect your doctor to share your discomfort.Involvement with the patient's suffering might cause him to lose valuable scientific objectivity.2.  Be cheerful at all times.Your doctor leads a busy and trying life and requires all the gentleness and reassurance he can get.3.  Try to suffer from the disease for which you are being treated.Remember that your doctor has a professional reputation to uphold.4.  Do not complain if the treatment fails to bring relief.You must believe that your doctor has achieved a deep insight into the true nature of your illness, which transcends any mere permanent disability you may have experienced.5.  Never ask your doctor to explain what he is doing or why he is doing it.It is presumptuous to assume that such profound matters could be explained in terms that you would understand.6.  Submit to novel experimental treatment readily.Though the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting research paper will surely be of widespread interest.7.  Pay your medical bills promptly and willingly.You should consider it a privilege to contribute, however modestly, to the well-being of physicians and other humanitarians.8.  Do not suffer from ailments that you cannot afford.It is sheer arrogance to contract illnesses that are beyond your means.9.  Never reveal any of the shortcomings that have come to light in the course of treatment by your doctor.The patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one, and you have a sacred duty to protect him from exposure.10. Never die while in your doctor's presence or under his direct care.This will only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.</p>

<p>In my day, we didn't have mouses to move the cursor around. We only had the arrows, and if the up arrow was broken and you needed to get to the top of the screen, well, you just hit the left arrow a thousand times, dadgummit. (Kevin Cuddihy, Fairfax) </p>
<p>In my day, we couldn't afford shoes, so we went barefoot. In the winter we had to wrap our feet with barbed wire for traction. (Bill Flavin, Alexandria) </p>
<p>In my day, we didn't have hand held calculators. We had to do addition on our fingers. To subtract, we had to have some fingers amputated. (Jon Patrick Smith, Washington) </p>
<p>In my day, we didn't have fancy high numbers. We had ""nothing,"" ""one,"" ""twain"" and ""multitudes."" (Elden Carnahan, Laurel) </p>
<p>In my day, we didn't get that disembodied, slightly ticked-off voice saying 'Doors closing.' We got on the train, the doors closed, and if your hand was sticking out it scraped along the tunnel all the way to the next station and it was a bloody stump at the end. (Russell Beland, Springfield) </p>
<p>In my day, we didn't have virtual reality. If a one-eyed razorback barbarian warrior was chasing you with an ax, you just had to hope you could outrun him. (Sarah M. Wolford, Hanover) </p>
<p>Back in the 1970s we didn't have the space shuttle to get all excited about. We had to settle for men walking on the crummy moon. (Russell Beland, Springfield) </p>
<p>In my day, we didn't have days. There was only ""time for work,"" ""time for pray"" and ""time for sleep."" The sheriff would go around and tell everyone when to change. (Elden Carnahan, Laurel) </p>
<p>In my day, people could only dream of hitchhiking a ride on a comet. (David Ronka, Charlottesville) </p>
<p>In my day, we didn't have fancy healthfood restaurants. Every day we ate lots of easily recognizable animal parts, along with potatoes drenched in melted fat from those animals. And we're all as strong as AAGGKK-GAAK Urrgh. Thud. (Tom Witte, Gaithersburg) </p>
<p>In my day, we didn't have water. We had to smash together our own hydrogen and oxygen atoms. (Diana Hugue, Bowie) </p>
<p>Kids today think the world revolves around them. In my day, the sun revolved around the world, and the world was perched on the back of a giant tortoise. (Jonathan Paul, Garrett Park) </p>
<p>In the old days, nobody asked you to sign petitions. The sheriff just came to your house and told you ""you was part of a posse."" (Barry Blyveis, Columbia) </p>
<p>In my day, we didn't have dogs or cats. All I had was Silver Beauty, my beloved paper clip. (Jennifer Hart, Arlington) </p>

The clerk puts the budgies in a bag, and the two guys pay for the birds and leave the shop.       They get into Gerry's van and drive until they are high up on a hill, and stop at the top of a cliff with a 500-foot drop.""Dis looks loike a grand place, eh?"" says Gerry. He then takes two birds out of the bag, places them on his shoulders and jumps off the cliff. Paddy watches as his mate drops off the edge and goes straight down for a few seconds, before he hits the rocks below with a 'SPLAT!'. As Paddy looks down he shakes his head and says, ""Fock dat, dis budgie jumpin' is too fockin' dangerous for me.""       A minute later, Seamus arrives. He too has been to the pet shop and he walks up carrying a 'peeper bag'. He pulls a parrot out of the bag, and then Paddy notices that, in his other hand, Seamus is carrying a gun.""Hi, Paddy. Watch dis,"" Seamus says and launches himself over the edge of the cliff. Paddy watches as half way down, Seamus takes the gun and blows the parrot's head off. Seamus continues to plummet until there is another 'SPLAT!' and his remains join Gerry's at the bottom. Paddy shakes his head and says, ""An' oim never troyin' dat parrotshooting nider.""        A few minutes after Seamus has gone splat, Sean strolls up. He too has been to the pet shop, and he walks up carrying the now familiar 'peeper bag'. Instead of a parrot he pulls a chicken out of the bag,  and launches himself off the cliff with the usual result. Once more Paddy shakes his head - ""Fock me Sean! First der was Gerry wit his budgie jumping, den Seamus parrotshooting and now you fockin' hen glidin...""</p>

36316,"<p>One day, a mime is visiting the zoo and attempts to earn some money as a<br /> street performer. As soon as he starts to draw a crowd, the zoo keeper grabs him<br /> and drags him into his office.<br /> The zoo keeper explains to the mime that the zoo's most<br /> popular attraction, a gorilla, died suddenly and the<br /> keeper fears that attendance at the zoo will fall off.<br /> He offers the mime a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another<br /> one. The mime accepts the offer.<br /> So, the next morning, before the crowd arrives, the mime puts on the gorilla<br /> suit and enters the cage. He<br /> discovers that it's a great job. He can sleep all he wants, play and make fun<br /> of people, and he draws larger crowds than he ever did as a mime on the street.<br /> However, eventually the crowd tires of him, and he tires of just swinging on<br /> auto tires. He notices that the people are paying more attention to the lion in<br /> the next cage. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbs to<br /> the top of his cage, crawls across a partition, and dangles from the top of the<br /> lion's cage.<br /> Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd<br /> loves it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and gives the mime a<br /> raise for being such a good attraction.<br /> Well, this goes on for some time, the mime keeps<br /> taunting the lion, the crowd grows larger, and his<br /> salary keeps going up.<br /> Then, one day, when he is dangling over the top of the<br /> lion's cage, he slips and falls. The mime is terrified.<br /> The lion raises himself up and prepares to pounce. The<br /> mime is so scared that he begins to run around the cage<br /> with the lion in hot pursuit.<br /> Finally, the mime starts screaming, ""Help! Help me!""<br /> The lion is quick and pounces. The mime soon finds him flat on his back<br /> looking up at the angry lion. The lion says, ""Shut up, you idiot, or we'll both<br /> lose our jobs!""</p>

<p>41&gt; Fold the napkins inside out and you can use them a second time.</p>
<p>40&gt; Concerned about room at the table?  With a good juicer, you can reduce the entire meal to a delicious, space-saving shake.</p>

<p>38&gt; Remember, demonstrating how you ""stuffed"" the turkey with your ""special sauce"" will probably get you arrested.</p>
<p>37&gt; You should not give away a turkey drumstick as a ""marital aid door prize.""</p>
<p>36&gt; The ""Butterball Hotline"" is *not* a direct phone line to the desk of Al Roker.</p>
<p>35&gt; No matter how much wine is served at Thanksgiving dinner, a gourd should never be used as a marital aid.</p>
<p>34&gt; When your mother makes her signature marshmallow/butterscotch/marmalade/chocolate/caramel/powdered sugar/sprinkle-covered yams, take a helping even if you're on the Atkins Diet unless you really want to hear about the 40 hours she spent in labor bringing your sorry ass into this world so you could insult her cooking.</p>
<p>33&gt; We're Americans!  If all else fails, deep-fry that sucker -- regardless of what it is.</p>
<p>32&gt; Whenever someone asks where you got the turkey, tell them you married him.  *That* joke never gets old.</p>
<p>31&gt; Sure, an apple looks appetizing in a roast pig's mouth, but please consider that turkeys lack an appropriate orifice.</p>
<p>30&gt; Remember: A large family dinner is God's way of saying ""I  hate you.""</p>
<p>29&gt; Six or seven good-sized squirrels can be sewn together into a reasonable semblance of a turkey.  Just don't be too forceful with the stuffing.</p>
<p>28&gt; Uncle Marty unhitching his belt buckle after dessert is a sign he enjoyed his meal, not cause for a frantic call to 911.</p>
<p>27&gt; It's considered impolite to refer to stuffing the turkey as ""buggering the bird.""</p>
<p>26&gt; Despite Uncle Louie's insistence, unlimited helpings of ""turkey"" refers to the poultry, not Wild Turkey 101.</p>
<p>25&gt; Best not sit your adult Native American guests at the children's table.</p>
<p>24&gt; A systematic reassembly of the giblets on a serving tray both educates the kids and aesthetically pleases the adults.</p>
<p>23&gt; Shredded stock trading documents make lovely basket stuffers! (Martha Stewart only)</p>
<p>22&gt; Fresh apple cider is a fall treat for the kids, and you can surprise them with a post-Halloween trick by substituting the contents of Grandpa's catheter bag.</p>

<p>20&gt; Here's a time-saving recipe for rice pilaf: Start with some Minute Rice, then look behind the fridge and add whatever you can peel off the floor.</p>
<p>19&gt; A wishbone can be used as emergency IUD.</p>
<p>18&gt; No matter how funny a voice you make, using the turkey as a hand-puppet probably won't impress your girlfriend's parents.</p>
<p>17&gt; Avoid certain disaster by placing Adam Sandler at the kid's table and his guitar with the adults.</p>
<p>16&gt; Assign Great Aunt Gertrude a helpful task that also keeps her out of the kitchen... like re-roofing the garage.</p>
<p>15&gt; To aid digestion, avoid watching the annual Detroit Lions game.</p>
<p>14&gt; If Grandpa happens to die during dinner, it's impolite to call dibs on his spot at the big-people table.</p>
<p>13&gt; Memo to turkey carver: ""Do you want fries with that?"" is a little bit funnier every time you say it.</p>
<p>12&gt; For a festive touch, fill finger bowls with raw poultry juices.</p>
<p>11&gt; Keep an extra tureen of gravy handy so you can pour it over the head of anyone who answers a cell phone during the meal.</p>
<p>10&gt; When you say, ""I simply MUST have this recipe,"" don't follow up with, ""They're going to ask me about it in the emergency room.""</p>
<p>9&gt; If your turkey has four paws and fur, it's time to change butcher shops.</p>
<p>8&gt; Dress comfortably and casually.  You'll be eating yourself silly, and since only relatives will be there, you won't be getting laid anyway.<br />     (Note: This tip not applicable in Greater Appalachia.)</p>
<p>7&gt; Although guests love being pampered, it's not generally considered appropriate to unbutton their pants for them after the meal.</p>
<p>6&gt; Fun tip: Glue pine cones to your beer-can hats and fill them with gravy!</p>
<p>5&gt; Don't trust any recipe for mashed potatoes that includes the step, ""Now invite Gallagher over.""</p>
<p>4&gt; Great Thanksgiving trick: Hide a tape recorder inside the turkey.  When stuffing the bird, hit the ""play"" button.<br />     Your pre-recorded orgasm sounds will delight both family and friends!</p>
<p>3&gt; Be sure the dinnertime seating arrangements leave your unnaturally skinny niece a clear path to the bathroom.</p>
<p>2&gt; Keep the leftover gravy to make frozen gibletsicles for the kids!</p>
<p>1&gt; Accept the Dahmers' invitation if you must, but you'd be wise to take a pass on the ""Gran'berry sauce.</p>

36365,"<p>A young woman buys a mirror at an antique shop, and hangs it on her bathroom door. One evening, while getting undressed, she playfully says ""Mirror, mirror, on my door, make my bustline forty four"". </p>
<p>Instantly, there is a brilliant flash of light, and her breasts grow to enormous proportions.  Excitedly, she runs to tell her husband what happened, and in minutes they both return. </p>
<p>This time the husband crosses his fingers and says ""Mirror mirror on the door, make my penis touch the floor!"".</p>
<p>Again, there's a bright flash...and then his legs fall off!</p>

<p>Why do they put pictures of criminals up in the Post Office? What are we supposed to do . . . write to these men? Why don't they just put their pictures on the postage stamps so the mailmen could look for them while they delivered the mail?</p>

SH smiles to himself, ""Come on Paddy"", he says, ""there's no point you declaring war on us, you wouldn't stand a chance."" Paddy replies, ""No, no, we've had ourselves a meeting, and we've decided to declare war on you."" So SH says, ""OK Paddy, now listen, I've got an air force of over a thousand planes, what kind of air force have you got to match that? It'd be over in no time."" So Paddy says, ""Well my lad's got himself a hot-air balloon, and my brother used to work at an airport."" Hussein laughs, ""Oh come on, you've not got a hope"". ""Hold on a sec, Mr. Hussein, "", Paddy says, ""we'll just have a quick meeting."" So off he goes and has a quick meeting. ""Are you still there Mr. Hussein? Yes, well we've had our meeting, and we've decided that we're still going to declare war."" So SH says, ""Right then Paddy, well you know, as well as the air force, we've also got about a thousand tanks. How are you going to match that."" ""Well,"" Paddy says, ""I've got an old austin, and my cousin down the road has got a tractor."" ""Get real, "" says SH, ""that's no match at all."" So Paddy says, ""Hold on, I'll just go and have another meeting."" ""Are you still there Mr. Hussein? Yes, well we've had our meeting, and we've decided that we're still going to declare war."" SH thinks this is just amazing, ""Well how many soldiers have you got Paddy?"". ""Well,"" says Paddy, ""there's me, my kid, me 4 cousins, and they all had sons, and there's Bill down the road.... I reckon I could get together about 30."" Laughing openly now SH replies, ""Come on Paddy, I've got 10,000 highly trained fighting men at my disposal. I think you'd better go and have another meeting."" ""I will"", says Paddy, ""I will."" ""Are you still there Mr. Hussein? Yes, well we've had our meeting, and we've decided that we're not going to declare war on you after all."" ""At last, "" replies SH, ""What made you change your mind?"" ""Well, it's those 10 thousand soldiers you see. We can't declare war on you because we've not got the facilities to keep all those prisoners!""</p>

36370,"<p>It seems the gentleman had over-imbibed at a party, was heading home, and was pulled over by a state trooper. Upon being tested, the fellow couldn't walk a straight line any more than he could drive one, so the trooper wrote out a ticket and had just given it to the driver before an accident in the opposite lane took his attention to more important matters. </p>
<p>The inebriated driver, figuring that the trooper wasn't coming back to him, drove home and went to bed. He was awakened in the morning by a knock at the door, created by two more state troopers. </p>
<p>""Are you Mr. Smith?"" they asked? </p>
<p>He admitted that he was. </p>
<p>""Were you pulled over at 11:30 last night for driving under the influence?"" </p>
<p>Again, the man admitted that was he. </p>
<p>""And what did you do then,"" the troopers asked."" </p>
<p>The man replied that he drove his car home and went to bed. </p>
<p>""Where is your car now?"" the troopers inquired. The man answered that it was in the garage. </p>
<p>""May we see the car?"" asked the troopers. </p>
<p>The man answered, ""Sure,"" and opened the garage. </p>

36372,"<p>An old man was sitting on his front porch down in Louisiana<br /> watching the sun rise. He sees the neighbor's kid walk by<br /> carrying something big under his arm. He yells out ""Hey boy,<br /> whatcha got there?""</p>
<p>Boy yells back ""Roll of chicken wire.""</p>

<p>That evening at sunset the boy comes walking by and to the old<br /> man's surprise he is dragging behind him the chicken wire with<br /> about 30 chickens caught in it.</p>
<p>Same time next morning the old man is out watching the sun rise<br /> and he sees the boy walk by carrying something kind of round in<br /> his hand.</p>
<p>Old man yells out ""Hey boy, whatcha got there?""</p>

<p>Old man says ""What you gonna do with that?""</p>

<p>Old man yells back, ""You damn fool, you can't catch ducks with<br /> duck tape!""</p>
<p>Boy just laughs and keeps walking.</p>
<p>That night around sunset the boy walks by coming home and to the<br /> old man's amazement he is trailing behind him the unrolled roll<br /> of duck tape with about 35 ducks caught in it.</p>
<p>Same time next morning the old man sees the boy walking by<br /> carrying what looks like a long reed with something fuzzy on the<br /> end. Old man says ""Hey boy, whatcha got there?""</p>

36374,"<p>CHRISTMAS ON THE PLAINS<br /> (For any Auburn Fans, such as my poor misguided brother)   </p>
<p>Twas a few weeks before Christmas, and all through the South,The Bama fans<br /> were hiding and shutting their mouths. </p>
<p>Dubose was looking, but could find only a few,<br /> For they knew it was time to face the big Orange and Blue. </p>
<p>The fans were all crying and begging for ""Bear"",<br /> The last place they wanted to be was Jordan-Hare. </p>
<p>They came into town with their hopes oh so high,<br /> But Crimson couldn't shine through that Orange and Blue sky. </p>
<p>They were all in the stadium yelling ""Roll Tide!"",<br /> And waving their pom-poms with that big Bama Pride. </p>
<p>When out on the field there arose such a clatter,<br /> They sprang from their seats to see what was the matter. </p>
<p>Kitchens flanked to his right and rolled to his left,<br /> And threw the ball to Scissum in spite of himself. </p>
<p>Scissum was hit by Houston, and the ball recovered by Reese,And then, there on<br /> Bama faces was nothing but grief. </p>
<p>Holmes gave it a kick, and through the goal post it flew,And the field was<br /> covered with all Orange and Blue. </p>
<p>We heard Holmes exclaim as the ball went out of sight,<br /> WAR EAGLE TO ALL AND TO ALL A GREAT NIGHT! </p>
<p>Now, as we go to Atlanta, we'll leave the TIDE some CHEER,We can forget ""Punt<br /> Bama Punt"" this 25th year.......... </p>
<p>For now we have a new phrase that will surely last,<br /> WAR EAGLE TO ALL AND ""Pass Bama Pass""!!!!!!!</p>

36375,"<p>A husband and wife love to golf together, but neither of them are  playing like they want to, so they decide to take private lessons. The husband has his lesson first. After the pro sees his swing, he says, ""No, no, no, you're gripping the club way too hard!"" ""Well, what should I do?"" asks the man. ""Hold the club gently,"" the pro replied, ""just like you'd hold your wife's breast."" The man takes the advice, takes a swing, and WOW! He hits the ball 250 yds. straight up the fairway. The man goes back to his wife with the good news, and the wife can't  wait for her lesson. The next day the wife goes for her lesson. The pro watches her swing and says, ""No, no, no, you're gripping the club way too hard."" ""What can I do?"" asks the wife. ""Hold the club gently, just like you'd hold your husband's penis. ""The wife listens carefully to the pro's advice, takes a swing, and  THUMP. The ball goes straight down the fairway . . . about 15 ft. ""That was great,"" the pro says.""Now, take the club out of your mouth  and swing the club like you're supposed to!"" says the pro.</p>

36378,"<p>El tipo llega a su casa a las 18 horas, cansado, hecho pelota, y a las  reputeadas. Le dice a su esposa que tiene una reuni�n a las diez de la noche, a la que no piensa ir. Que su jefe es un negrero explotador, que no tiene l�mites, que le parece  un abuso que lo tenga diez horas laburando como un perro, y encima le pida que vuelva a las diez de la noche porque quiere invitar a cenar a no se que gerente de no se cual empresa.</p>
<p>La mujer, preocupada por su marido, lo convence de que el trabajo es importante, y de que vaya a esa reuni�n.</p>
<p>Entonces, el marido se va a pegar una ducha, y piensa en silencio lo f�cil que fue enga�arla.</p>
<p>La esposa - como toda mujer - cuando el tipo entra a la ducha, le revisa la billetera, el malet�n, los bolsillos de los pantalones y del saco, y le encuentra un papel que dice: ""Mi amor: Te espero esta noche para comer el pavo con salsa blanca que  tanto te gusta"".</p>
<p>La mujer coloca el papel donde lo hab�a encontrado, se saca toda la ropa,  se pone apenas una bata, se pinta los ojos y los labios, se ba�a en perfume importado, y cuando el marido sale del ba�o, se encuentra a su  mujer hecha una potra. El tipo se pone como loco, y sin perder un minuto de tiempo, le pega una  cepillada de aquellas.</p>
<p>Cuando terminan, el tipo medio muerto, se queda dormido. A las 21.30 la mujer lo despierta, y le avisa que tiene media hora para vestirse y llegar la reuni�n.</p>

36379,"<p>A man took his old duck to the Veterinarian, concerned because the duck wouldn't eat. The Vet explained to the man that as ducks age their upper bills grow down over their lower bills, and make it difficult for the animal to pick up it's food.""What you need to do is gently file the upper bill down, even with the lower bill. But you must be extra careful because the duck's nostrils are located in the upper bill and if you file down too far, when the duck takes a drink of water it'll drown.""The man goes about his business and about a week later the Vet runs into his patient.""Well, how is that duck of yours?"" the Vet inquires.""He's dead."" declared the heartbroken man.""I told you not to file his upper bill down too far! He took a drink of water and drowned didn't he?"" insisted the Vet.""No."" lamented the man.""I think he was dead before I took him out of the vice.""</p>

""Alright,"" said St.<br /> Peter. ""What we are going to do is send you back for the weekend as whoever you<br /> wish to be and then we'll accept you back into Heaven,"" exclaimed St. Peter as<br /> he looks at the first nun.<br /> ""Okay, who do you want to be?"" he asks the nun. ""Well, I thought her life was<br /> very interesting especially since she gave her life to God, so I want to be Joan<br /> of Arc."" Poof!

The second<br /> nun becomes Marilyn Monroe.<br /> ""Okay, who do you want to be?"" St. Peter says to the third nun. ""I want to be<br /> Alice Kapipelean."" ""Excuse me?!?"" confusingly asks St. Peter. ""I want to be<br /> Alice Kapipelean!"" exclaims the nun. St. Peter replies, ""Pardon me Sister, we<br /> have no record of any Alice Kapipelean being on earth,"" explains St. Peter.<br /> ""There is TOO an Alice Kapipelean and I have proof right HERE!!!"" shouts the<br /> nun.

36405,"<p>This is a bricklayer's accident report that was printed in the newsletter of the English equivalent of the Workers' Compensation Board. So here, thanks to John Sedgwick, is this Bricklayer's report. </p>
<p>Dear Sir; </p>
<p>I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block #3 of theaccident reporting form. I put ""Poor Planning"" as the cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient. </p>
<p>I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I found I had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to weigh 240 lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building at the sixth floor. </p>
<p>Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240 lbs of bricks. You will note on the accident reporting form that my weight is 135 lbs. </p>
<p>Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3, accident reporting form. </p>
<p>Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley which I mentioned in Paragraph 2 of this correspondence. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience. </p>
<p>At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground-and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, the barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight. </p>
<p>As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body. </p>
<p>Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.</p>
<p>I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope.</p>

One evening, he got down to the ferry and found there was a wait for the next boat, so John decided to stop at a nearby tavern. Before long he was feeling no pain.When he got back to the ferry slip, the ferryboat was just eight feet from the dock. Smith, afraid of missing this one and being late for dinner, took a running leap and landed right on the deck of the boat.""How did you like that jump, buddy?"" said a proud John to a deck hand.""It was great,"" said the sailor.

36415,"<p>Taipei, Taiwan (AP) - Diners tempted to lick a plate after a delicious meal can now go a step further - eat the plate.Chen Liang-erh, 50, an amateur inventor, announced Friday that he had perfected an edible plate made from wheat grain, and that he planned to mass-produce it and other edible crockery including cups, bowls and food containers.Chen spent six years developing the plate, which he said would retail at about 7 cents each.Diners who don't want to eat the items - which taste like unsalted popcorn - can boil them for a nutritious meal for animals, he said.Chen said this can help reduce pollution caused by discarded crockery.  The only disadvantage, he said, is his crockery cannot be washed and reused.</p>

36416,"<p>An 85-year-old couple, after being married for almost 60 years, died in a car crash. </p>
<p>They had been in good health the last ten years, mainly due to her interest in health food and exercising. </p>
<p>When they reached the Pearly Gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion, which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen, master bath suite and a Jacuzzi. </p>
<p>As they looked around, the old man asked St. Peter how much all this was going to cost. ""It's free,"" St. Peter replied, ""this is Heaven."" </p>
<p>Next, they went out in the back yard to survey the championship-style golf course that the home was located on. They would have golfing privileges every day and each week, the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. </p>
<p>The old man asked, ""What are the green fees?"" </p>
<p>St. Peter replied, ""This is Heaven, you play for free."" </p>
<p>Next, they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the World laid out. </p>
<p>""How much to eat?"" asked the old man. </p>
<p>""Don't you understand yet? This is Heaven, it is free!"" St. Peter replied, with some exasperation. ""Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?"" the old man asked timidly. </p>
<p>St. Peter lectured, ""That's the best part - you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven."" </p>
<p>With that, the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and screaming wildly. </p>
<p>St. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong. </p>
<p>The old man looked at his wife and said, ""This is all your fault! If it weren't for your blasted bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!"" </p>

36422,"<p>An old lady walks into a plastic surgeon's office and tells him she wants a facelift. He says ""Well, we have three models. The first is for $1000 and is guaranteed for one year, the second is $3000 and is guaranteed for 3 years and the last is $5000 and it is guaranteed for 5 years.""<br /> The old lady says ""Well tell me about them."" </p>
<p>The doctor says, ""For $1000 you are going to get a half-ass job that you pay very little for."" </p>
<p>She responds, ""Forget that one, what about the next one."" </p>
<p>He explains, ""For $3000 we do a much better job and pay close attention to detail, but it is only guaranteed for 3 years."" </p>
<p>The lady says, ""No, that's no good either, what about the last one."" </p>

36424,"<p>Teachers are paid too much!! I'm fed up with teachers and their hefty salaries for only 9 months work! What we need here is a little perspective. If I had my way, I'd pay teachers babysitting wages.That's right...instead of paying these outrageous taxes, I'd give them $3.00 an hour. And, I'm only going to pay them for 5 hours, not planning time. That would be $15.00 a day. Each parent should pay $15.00 a day for these teachers to baby sit their children. Even if they have more than one child, it's still cheaper than private daycare.Now how many children do they teach a day--maybe 20?  That's $15.00 x 20 = 300.00 a day. But remember, they only work 180 days a year! I'm not going to pay them for all the vacations:  $300.00 x 180 =$54,000. (Just a minute my calculator must need batteries.)What will teachers say about those who have 10 years of experience and a master's degree?  Well, maybe (just to be fair) they could get the minimum wage. We can round that off to about $6.00 an hour,  times 5 hours, times 20 children. $6.00 x 5 x 20. That's $600 a day times 180 days. That's only $108,000.Wait a minute...there is something wrong here...</p>

''I agree completely, ma'am,'' the man replied.    The woman stepped closer to examine the damage and noticed something shiny within her car.    Reaching in, she pulled out an unbroken bottle.   ''This bottle of wine wasn't even cracked. I think this is another sign that we are to drink a toast to our new friendship.''  ''That's a great idea, miss,'' the man answered taking the bottle from her. He popped the cork and drank his share. ''I'm sorry. How rude of me. Would you like some?''   ''No, thanks,'' came the reply. ''I'll just wait on the cops to get here.''</p>

36430,"<p>OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE?</p>
<p>Once upon a time, an American company and a Japanese company decided to have competitive boat race on the Bear River. Both teams practiced hard and long to reach their peak performance. On the big day, they both felt as ready as they could be.</p>
<p>The Japanese won by a mile! Afterwards the American Team became very discouraged by the losses and morale began to sag. Corporate management decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found. A The ""Continuous Improvement Team"" was established to investigate the problem and to recommend appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p>THEIR CONCLUSION: The problem was that the Japanese Team had eight people rowing and one person steering, whereby the American Team had one person rowing and eight people steering.</p>
<p>The American Corporate Steering Committee immediately hired a consulting firm to do a study on the management structure. After some time and millions of dollars, the consulting firm concluded that too many people were steering and not were rowing.</p>
<p>To prevent losing to the Japanese again, the American Team's management structure was totally reorganized to three Steering Director, three Steering Managers, and two Steering Supervisors. Also a new performance system for the person rowing the boat was developed to give more incentive to work harder.</p>
<p>""We must give him empowerment and enrichment. That ought to do it.""</p>
<p>The next year the Japanese won by two miles.</p>
<p>Humiliated, the American corporation laid off the rower to ""cut costs, sold all of the paddles, canceled all capital investments for new equipment, halted development of a new canoe, gave a ""Superior Performance"" award to the consulting firm, and distributed the money saved as bonuses to the senior executives.</p>

But that  afternoon, while they were eating their lunch in a park, they decided to buy  the sombrero after all. Sam's father threw what was left of their sandwiches  to some stray dogs, and they walked back to the marketplace.One of the animals followed them. It was a small, gray creature with  short hair, short legs, and a long tail. Wherever they went, it went too.""Isn't he cute!"" Sam's mother said. ""He must be one of those Mexican  Hairless dogs. Sam would love him."" ""He's probably somebody's pet,"" Sam's  father said. They asked several people if they knew who its owner were, but  no one did. They just smiled and shrugged their shoulders. Finally, Sam's  mother said, ""Maybe he's just a stray. Let's take him home with us. We can  give him a good home, and Sam will love him.""It is against the law to take a pet across the border, but Sam's parents  hid the animal in a box, and no one saw it. When they got home, they showed  it to Sam.""He's a pretty small dog,"" said Sam.""He's a Mexican dog,"" his father said. ""I'm not sure what kind. I think  it's called a Mexican Hairless. We'll find out. But he's nice, isn't he?""They gave the new pet some dog food. Then they washed it and brushed it  and combed it's fur. That night it slept on Sam's bed.

<p>The priest watches for a moment, horrified, before running over to the boy. ""What are you doing!?!?!"" the priest shouts at the boy. </p>

36561,"<p>Farmer and his Pigs:<br /> A farmer buys several pigs, hoping to breed them for ham, bacon, etc. After<br /> several weeks, he notices that none of the pigs are getting<br /> pregnant, and calls a vet for help. The vet tells the farmer that he<br /> should try artificial insemination. The farmer doesn't have the<br /> slightest idea what this means but, not wanting to display his<br /> ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the pigs are<br /> pregnant.  The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and<br /> will, instead, lay down and wallow in the mud when they are pregnant.<br /> The farmer hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the<br /> conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the<br /> pigs himself. So he loads the pigs into his truck, drives them<br /> out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back and<br /> goes to bed.  Next morning, he wakes and looks out at the pigs. Seeing that<br /> they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't<br /> take, and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods,<br /> bangs each pig twice for good measure, brings them back and goes to bed.<br /> Next morning, he wakes to find the pigs are still just standing<br /> around. One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them<br /> up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day shagging the pigs and,<br /> upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed.  </p>
<p>The next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the<br /> pigs. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the pigs are<br /> laying in the mud. ""No,"" she says, ""they're all in the truck and one of<br /> them's honking the horn.""</p>

36565,"<p>A few days before he left the presidency, Bill Clinton called George W Bush and said, ""It's time I took you to our most top secret military installation.""</p>
<p>As they were flying across the country on Air Force One, Clinton told his successor, ""As you know, nuclear war is an unacceptable option. So we've been forced to come up with other ways to stop enemy aggression. Since AIDS can't be cured, we decided to use it as a weapon."" </p>
<p>""What do you mean?"" Bush asked. </p>
<p>""I'll show you when we land,"" Clinton said. </p>
<p>Soon they landed in a remote section of Montana. Clinton escorted Bush into a large, heavily guarded compound, then took him into the first building. Bush saw a group of gorgeous women parading around in scanty lingerie and asked, ""What are they doing?"" </p>
<p>Clinton said, ""All of them have AIDS. If we're threatened by a European or South American country, we'll send them in so they can sleep with country's leaders and neutralize the threat."" </p>
<p>Bush nodded. In the next building, he saw a group of very effeminate teenage boys. Clinton explained, ""When these boys got AIDS, we made them eunuchs. If we're threatened by China, we'll send them in to satisfy the desires of the Chinese leaders. They'll be infected, and the crisis will be averted."" Bush nodded. </p>
<p>They entered the largest of the three buildings, and saw a huge group of adult men cavorting around on all fours. Bush said, ""What are these guys doing?"" </p>
<p>Clinton said, ""These men will serve their country if there's another crisis in Iraq, Iran, or anywhere else in the Middle East."" </p>
<p>""I don't understand. Why are they on all fours?"" </p>
<p>""Because,"" Clinton said, ""we have to send them in disguised as camels.""</p>

<p>""I had a heart attack,"" says the first man. ""You see, I knew my wife was cheating on me, so one day I showed up at home unexpectedly. I ran up to the bedroom, and found her alone, knitting. I ran down to the basement, but no one was hiding there, either. I ran up to the second floor, but no one was hiding there either.

So he gets out and walks to the front door. He rings it once....No answer. He rings it again.....Still no answer. So, he thinks, ''This is a big house, big party, maybe the party is outside, in the backyard.'' So he walks around the house to the back, there was no one out there either. As he aproached the back door, he was suprized to find it unlocked, and opened. There was obviously no one home, so he figured he'd just quietly run inside real quick, and use there bathroom, no one would know. So, he goes inside but he can't find the bathroom anywhere. So, he quickly ran up the stairs and searched, and searched, till finally as he opened a door to a small room, he was amazed to find a GOLDEN TOILET. He had never seen anything like it, but remembering that he was in a stranger's house, and that they could at anytime return home, he quickly did his business and walked out. As he got in the car he excitedly told his friends of the AMAZING GOLDEN TOILET. They laughed in disbelief at his crazy tale. They pulled out of the driveway, arguing about it. They argued the whole way to the party.A couple of hours later, on the way home from the party. They drive past the house with the GOLDEN TOILET. And they guy insists on stopping so he could prove to his friends the these people really did have a GOLDEN TOILET. So, they agree to check it out. So they all walk up to the front door and ring the door bell. And a woman answers the door. ''Excuse me maam, but could you please let me show my friends here your GOLDEN TOILET, they don't believe me!'' ''So YOU'RE the guy!'' The woman replies, then yells to her husband in the house, ''HONEY!?!...HERES THE GUY THAT POOPED IN YOUR TUBA!'''</p>

<p>10 second fuses only last 7 seconds.<br /> Anything you do can get you shot, even doing nothing.<br /> Claymores are labeled ""This side toward enemy"" for a reason.<br /> Don't draw fire, it irritates the people around you.</p>
<p>Don't ever be the first, don't ever be the last and don't ever, ever volunteer to do anything.</p>
<p>Don't look conspicuous: it draws fire.<br /> If it's stupid but works, it really isn't stupid.<br /> If the enemy is in range, so are you.<br /> If the pin is pulled, Mr. Grenade is *not* our friend.<br /> If you can't remember, the claymore is pointed at you.<br /> If your attack is going well, you have walked into an ambush.<br /> Incoming fire has the right of way.</p>
<p>It is generally unadvisable to eject directly over the area you just bombed.<br /> Make it too tough for the enemy to get in and you can't get out.<br /> Mines are equal opportunity weapons.<br /> Never share a fox hole with anyone braver than you.<br /> Professionals are predictable, it's the amateurs that are dangerous.<br /> Teamwork is essential; it gives the enemy someone else to shoot at.<br /> The easy way is always mined.</p>
<p>The enemy invariably attacks on one of two occasions:<br />   a.  When you're not ready for them.<br />   b.  When you're ready for them.<br />       Either time is inconvenient and generally a bummer.</p>

36612,"<p>There was this couple once who had everything; the son and daughter, a house, a cat... I mean the basic stuff. Well I guess as the got older they started to lose their sex drive. This discouraged the husband so he went to the doctor and got some extra strength Viagra even though it was still in its trial phase. Well the doctor told him, ""only one pill a day, and I'll call you at the end of the week.""<br /> So the doctor calls at the end of the week and asks how well the pills are working.<br /> The man replies, ""Oh their great! I haven't had sex like this for 10 years!""<br /> The doctor tells him to ""keep it up, and remember... only ONE pill a day.""<br /> The wife found out however and started slipping him an extra pill each day without him knowing. So when the doctor called and asked how everything was holding up the man replied, ""I'm addicted! I haven't had sex like this since I was 16!"" Now the doctor was kind of suspicious but just let it go and decided to call him at the end of next week. Meanwhile, the greedy wife (who was loving it) started giving him 3 doses of xtra strength viagra a day.<br /> The doctor called at the same time next week, but this time a little boy answered the phone. ""Are your parents there?"" the doctor asked.<br /> ""Well... they are but there locked in their room and won't come out."" The boy answered.<br /> ""Ok.. I'll call back in 3 hours."" The doctor promised; but when he called back the boy answered the phone again.<br /> ""You just missed them... they came down and got a drink and ran right back upstairs."" The boy informed him.<br /> ""Listen I'll be there in 5 minutes!"" The doctor by this time had a pretty good idea what was going on and rushed over there as fast as he could; but being unreliable, he got there an hour later.<br /> When he knocked on the door the little boy answered the door. In desperation the doctor asked where the boy's parents were.<br /> The boy took a deep breath and said, ""Mom's dead, sister's pregnant, my butt hurts, and dad's looking for the cat.""</p>

36618,"<p>Joe wanted to buy a motorbike. He doesn't have much luck until, one day, he comes across a Harley with a 'for sale' sign on it.</p>
<p>The bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. It is shiny and in absolute mint condition. </p>
<p>He immediately buys it, and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.</p>
<p>""Well, it's quite simple, really,"" says the seller, ""whenever the bike is outside and it's going to rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain."" </p>
<p>And he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.</p>
<p>That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there.</p>
<p>But just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, ""I have to tell you something about my family before we go in.""</p>
<p>""When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.""</p>
<p>""No problem,"" he says. And in they go.</p>
<p>Joe is shocked. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. </p>
<p>In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor,  everywhere he looks, dirty dishes.</p>
<p>They sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word.</p>
<p>As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation. </p>
<p>So he leans over and kisses Sandra. </p>
<p>No one says a word. </p>
<p>So he reaches over and fondles her breasts.</p>
<p>Still, nobody says a word. </p>
<p>So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table, and screws her right there, in front of her parents. </p>
<p>His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.</p>
<p>He looks at her mom. ""She's got a great body,"" he thinks. So he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, and has his way with her every which way right there on the dinner table. </p>
<p>Now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, but still, total silence.</p>
<p>All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.</p>
<p>Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.</p>
<p>Suddenly the father backs away from the table and shouts, ""All right, thats enough, I'll do the fucking dishes!""</p>

36621,"<p>Noah's Ark... If it happened today </p>
<p>And the Lord spoke to Noah and said, ""In six months I'm going to make it rain<br /> until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people are<br /> destroyed. But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind of living<br /> thing on the planet. I am commanding you to build an Ark."" </p>
<p>And in a flash of lightning, He delivered the specifications for an Ark.<br /> ""Okay,"" said Noah, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints. </p>
<p>""Six months, and it starts to rain,"" thundered the Lord. ""You'd better have<br /> the Ark completed, or learn to swim for a very long time."" </p>
<p>Six months passed, the skies clouded up and rain began to fall. The Lord saw<br /> that Noah was sitting in his front yard, weeping. ..... and there was no Ark. </p>
<p>""Noah,"" shouted the Lord, ""Where is the Ark?"" </p>
<p>""Lord, please forgive me!"" begged Noah. ""I did my best. But there were big<br /> problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction<br /> project, and your plans didn't meet code. So I had to hire an engineer to re-<br /> draw the plans. Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark needed a<br /> fire sprinkler system. </p>
<p>""Then my neighbor objected, claiming I was violating zoning by building the<br /> Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city planning<br /> commission. </p>
<p>""Then I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark, because there was a ban<br /> on cutting trees to save the Spotted Owl. I had to convince the U.S. Fish and<br /> Wildlife that I need the wood to save the Owls. But they wouldn't let me catch<br /> any owls. So, no owls. </p>
<p>""The carpenters formed a union and went out on strike. I had to negotiate a<br /> settlement with the National Labor Relations Board before anyone would pick up a<br /> saw or hammer. Now we have sixteen carpenters going on the boat, and still no<br /> owls. </p>
<p>""Then I started gathering up animals, and got sued by an animal rights group.<br /> They objected to me taking only two of each kind. </p>
<p>""Just when I got the suit dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn't complete<br /> the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your proposed flood.<br /> They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the<br /> conduct of a Supreme Being. </p>
<p>""Then the Army Corp of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed new flood plain.<br /> I sent them a globe. </p>
<p>""Right now, I'm still trying to resolve a complaint from the Equal Employment<br /> Opportunity Commission over how many Croatians I'm supposed to hire. The IRS has<br /> seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to avoid paying taxes by leaving the<br /> country. And I just got a notice from the state about owing them some kind of<br /> use tax. I really don't think I can finish the Ark for at least another five<br /> years,"" Noah wailed. </p>
<p>The sky began to clear. The sun began to shine. A rainbow arched across the<br /> sky. Noah looked up and smiled. </p>
<p>""You mean you're not going to destroy the earth?"" Noah asked hopefully. </p>
<p>""No,"" said the Lord sadly. ""The government already has.""</p>

<p>She starts thinking what she can ask for that will be good for<br /> her and bad for her ex, first she wants to ask for a million<br /> dollars, but then realizes that her ex will get ten million.<br /> then she was going to be the most beautiful person in the world,<br /> but then realizes that her ex will look even better.</p>
<p>After a long time of thinking she says ""I know what I want. I<br /> realize that my ex will get 5 times as much, and anyways, I<br /> decided that I want to marry a handsome man, and give birth to<br /> his child.""</p>

<p>Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant, and make sure he is in<br /> a good mood. For lunch make him a nutritious meal. For dinner prepare an<br /> especially nice meal for him. Don't burden him with chores, as he probably had<br /> a hard day. Don't discuss your problems with him, it will only make his stress<br /> worse.</p>

<p>SL: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past half-hour?</p>
<p>SM: Yes, I wonder what be wants.</p>
<p>SL: It's logical. He wants to rape us.</p>
<p>SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most. What can we do? </p>
<p>SL: The only logical thing to do of course is that we have to start walking faster. </p>
<p>SM: It is not working. </p>
<p>SL: Of course it is not working. The man did the only obvious thing to do. He started to walk faster too. </p>
<p>SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute. </p>
<p>SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and I'll go this way. He cannot follow both of us. </p>
<p>So the man decided to go after Sister Logical and Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried because Sister Logical has not yet arrived. Finally, Sister Logical arrives. </p>
<p>SM: Sister Logical. Thank Cod you are here. Tell us what happened. </p>
<p>SL: The only logical thing happened. The man could not follow both of us, so he followed me. </p>
<p>SM: So, what happened? Please tell us. </p>
<p>SL: The only logical thing to happen. I started to run as fast as I could. </p>
<p>SM: So what happened? </p>
<p>SL: The only logical thing to happen. The man also started to run as fast as he could. </p>
<p>SM: And what else? </p>
<p>SL: The only logical thing to happen. He reached me. </p>
<p>SM: Oh, no! What did you do then? </p>
<p>SL: The only logical thing to do. I lifted my habit up. </p>
<p>SM: Oh, Sister. What did the man do? </p>
<p>SL: The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants. </p>
<p>SM: Oh, no! What happened then? </p>
<p>SL: Isn't it logical, Sister? A nun with her habit up can run faster than a man with his pants down. </p>

<li>A dissident faction of Ross Perot's Reform Party has broken off to form its own party. Politics are getting pretty bad when you have to reform the Reform Party. President Clinton responded to the UN Earth Summit criticism by endorsing tough new standards for clean air. It's about time - twice during the '96 Olympics, the javelin got stuck in the sky.</li>

<p>During a recent staff meeting in Heaven, God, Moses, and Saint Peter concluded that the behavior of Ex-President Clinton has brought about the need for an eleventh commandment. </p>
<p>They worked long and hard in a brain-storming session to try to settle on the wording of the new commandment, because they realized that it should have the same style, majesty and dignity as the original ten. They began their brain-storming and came up with the 11th. </p>
<p>After many revisions, they finally agreed that the eleventh commandment should be: </p>

36673,"<p>Several years ago the United States funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft. The study took two years and cost over $180,000. The results of the study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex.After the results were published, Germany decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the US study were incorrect. After three years of research and costs in excess of $250,000, they concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the women with more pleasure during sex.When the results of the German study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't trust the US or German studies. So after nearly three weeks of intensive research at a cost of around $75, the Aussie study reached a conclusion. They came to the final conclusion that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent his hand from flying off and hitting him in the forehead.</p>

36727,"<p>In a recent issue of Meat &amp; Poultry magazine, editors quoted from ''Feathers,'' the publication of the California Poultry Industry Federation, telling the following story:     It seems the US Federal Aviation Administration has a unique device for testing the strength of windshields on airplanes. The device is a gun that launches a dead chicken at a plane's windshield at approximately the speed the airplane  flies. The theory is that if the windshield can withstand the carcass test impact, it'll survive a real collision with a bird during flight.    Apparently, the British were very interested in this and wanted to test a windshield on a brand new, high-speed train they were developing..  They borrowed the FAA's chicken launcher, loaded a chicken and fired. The ballistic chicken not only shattered the windshield, but went through   the engineer's seat, broke an instrument panel, and was imbedded in the back wall of the engine cab. The British were stunned and asked the FAA to review the test to see if everything was done correctly. The FAA reviewed the data thoroughly and had one recommendation: ''Use a thawed chicken.''</p>

<p>Very diligently, Kathleen did as she was asked. Heidi pushed and pushed, and<br /> after a little while Connor was born. The paramedic lifted him by his feet, and<br /> spanked him on his bottom.

<p>""My client merely inserted his arm into the window and removed a few trifling articles. His arm is not himself, and I fail to see how you can punish the whole individual for an offense committed by his limb."" </p>
<p>""Well put,"" the judge replied. ""Using your logic, I sentence the defendant's arm to one year's imprisonment. He can accompany it or not, as he chooses."" </p>

One of his friends told him that he should surprise his wife one of these nights, and things would change. His friend told him to sneak in, really late one night, and crawl quietly into bed beside his wife without waking her up.

So he waits a few days, sneaks in, and crawls into bed beside his wife.  He sticks his hand down her panties, and plays around a bit, then wipes it all over his face.

36896,"<p>Did you hear about the heavyset guy who had tried every diet in the world<br /> in an attempt to lose weight? He tried the Scarsdale diet, the Navy diet,<br /> Weight Watchers, and many more. None worked. One day, he was reading the<br /> Washington Post when he noticed a small ad which read:</p>
<p>Lose weight<br /> Only $1.00 a pound<br /> Call (202) 555-0238</p>
<p>The man decided to give it a try and called the number. A voice on the<br /> other end asked, 'How much weight do you want to lose?', to which the man<br /> responded, 'Ten pounds.'</p>
<p>The voice replied, 'Very well, give me your credit card number and we'll<br /> have a representative over to your house in the morning.'.</p>
<p>About 9:00 am the next morning the man gets a knock on the door. There<br /> stood a beautiful redheaded woman, completely naked except for a sign<br /> around her neck stating, 'If you catch me, you can have me'.</p>
<p>Well, the hefty fellow chased her upstairs, downstairs, over sofas,<br /> through the kitchen, all around the house. Finally, panting and wheezing<br /> like a dog, he did catch her. When he was through enjoying himself, she<br /> said, 'Quick, go into the bathroom and weigh yourself!'. He did just that<br /> and was amazed to find that he had lost ten pounds, right to the ounce!</p>
<p>That evening he called the number again. The voice on the other end asked,<br /> 'How much weight do you want to lose?', to which the somewhat less<br /> overweight man replied, 'Twenty pounds.'.</p>
<p>'Very well', the voice on the phone told him, 'Give me your credit card<br /> number and we'll have a representative over to your house in the<br /> morning.'</p>
<p>At about 8:00 am the next morning the man receives a knock on the door.<br /> When he opens the door he sees a beautiful blond dressed only in track<br /> shoes and a sign around her neck stating 'If you catch me, you can have<br /> me'. The chase took a good while longer this time and the man nearly<br /> passed out, but he finally did catch her. When he was through she told<br /> him, 'Quick, run into the bathroom and weigh yourself!' He ran to the<br /> bathroom and found he had lost another 20 pounds!</p>
<p>'This is fantastic!', he thought to himself. Later that evening he called<br /> the number again and the voice at the other end asked, 'How much weight do<br /> you want to lose?'. 'Fifty pounds!', the man exclaimed. 'Fifty pounds?',<br /> the voice asked. 'That's an awful lot of weight to lose at one time.'</p>
<p>The man replied, 'Listen buddy, here's my credit card number, you just<br /> have your representative over here in the morning!', and he hung up the<br /> phone.</p>
<p>About 6:00 am the next morning the man gets out of bed, splashes on some<br /> cologne and gets all ready for the next representative. At about 7:00 am<br /> he gets a knock on the door. When he opens the door, he sees this large<br /> gorilla with a sign around his neck stating,</p>

36909,"<p>I had been teaching my three-year old daughter the Lord's Prayer. For several evenings at bedtime, she would repeat after me the lines from the prayer. Finally, she decided to go solo. I listened with pride as she carefully enunciated each word, right up to the end of the prayer: ""Lead us not into temptation,"" she prayed, ""but deliver us some E-mail. Amen.""</p>
<p>And one particular four-year old prayed, ""And forgive us our trash baskets as we forgive those who put trash in our baskets.""</p>
<p>A little boy was overheard praying: ""Lord, if you can't make me a better boy, don't worry about it. I'm having a real good time like I am.""</p>

<p>The preacher was wired for sound with a lapel microphone, &amp; as he preached, he moved briskly about the platform, jerking the mike cord as he went. Then he moved to one side, getting wound up in the cord &amp; nearly tripping before jerking it again. After several circles &amp; jerks, a little girl in the third pew leaned toward her mother &amp; whispered, ""If he gets loose, will he hurt us?""</p>
<p>Six-year old Angie &amp; her four-year old brother Joel were sitting together in church. Joel giggled, sang &amp; talked out loud. Finally, his big sister had had enough. ""You're not supposed to talk out loud in church."" ""Why? Who's going to stop me?"" Joel asked. Angie pointed to the back of the church &amp; said, ""See those two men standing by the door? They're hushers.""</p>
<p>A mother was preparing pancakes for her sons, Kevin, 5, and Ryan, 3. The boys began to argue over who would get the first pancake. Their mother saw the opportunity for a moral lesson. ""If Jesus were sitting here, He would say 'Let my brother have the first pancake, I can wait'"". Kevin turned to his younger brother &amp; said, ""Ryan, you be Jesus!""</p>
<p>A father was at the beach with his children when his four-year old son ran up to him, grabbed his hand, &amp; led him to the shore, where a seagull lay dead in the sand. ""Daddy, what happened to him?"" the son asked. ""He died &amp; went to Heaven,"" the dad replied. The boy thought a moment &amp; then said, ""Did God throw him back down?""</p>
<p>A Sunday school class was studying the Ten Commandments. They were ready to discuss the last one. The teacher asked if anyone could tell her what it was. Susie raised her hand, stood tall, &amp; shouted, ""Thou shall not take the covers off thy neighbor's wife.""</p>
<p>At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including human beings. Little Johnny, a child in the kindergarten class, seemed especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam's ribs. Later in the week his mother noticed him lying as though he was ill, &amp; asked, ""Johnny what is the matter?"" Little Johnny responded, ""I have a pain in my side. I think I'm going to have a wife!""</p>

<p>VIVIOMETRO: Encuentre aqu� los resultados.</p>
<p>Si contesto afirmativamente:</p>
<p>ENTRE 80-115:<br /> Usted es una persona que est� convencida de que vida s�lo hay una. En el colegio ""capeaba"" clase de religi�n y en bachillerato se fum� el primer ""cacho"". Extrovertido, aventurero en el amor, audaz en la coqueter�a y muy creativo en la vida sexual (por eso cree que las mujeres lindas son para hombres sin imaginaci�n y viceversa). No sabe que es un escapulario ni le interesa y no recuerda todo el Padre Nuestro. Sin embargo, se cree tan Inmortal como Dios. Le preocupa el SIDA y por eso tiene lo �ltimo en preservativos. El d�a de ma�ana le puede decir a sus hijos, de coraz�n: confieso que he vivido"" o ""hierba mala nunca muere"".</p>
<p>ENTRE 60-80:<br /> Usted es una persona que ha tenido en el corcho el poema de Borges Instantes. Goza de una aguda sensibilidad social, es mel�mano y rumbero pero responsable. Respeta a Freud y por eso piensa que la fidelidad es un tema tan fr�gil como el de la virginidad hasta el matrimonio. Pragm�tico y profesional (sobre todo en la intimidad.) Por eso siempre aprovecha cualquier payaso despu�s de la media noche, le gusta la velocidad, raspa fiesta, le gusta estar en familia, es buen deportista y nunca madruga los fines de semana. Usted es de la filosof�a: ""El que peca y reza empata.""</p>
<p>ENTRE 20-40:<br /> Usted se ha echado una canita al aire pero no se lo reconoce ni a sus mejores amigos. Tiene una edici�n de la Biblia empastada que mantiene abierta para que proteja su hogar, y el tema de la reencarnaci�n le apasiona. Es abstemio, casero, mon�gamo (salvo contadas excepciones) y no matricular�a a sus hijos en un colegio mixto o laico. No pita en los colas evita las groser�as y se sonroja con los chistes verdes. Y, adem�s, piensa que este tipo de cuestionarios s�lo patrocinan la promiscuidad, la vida mundana y distorsiona los valores morales.</p>

36944,"<p>50 WAYS TO CONFUSE, WORRY, OR JUST SCARE PEOPLE IN THE COMPUTER LAB</p>
<p>1. Log on, wait a sec, then get a frightened look on your face and scream ""Oh my God! They've found me!"" and bolt.</p>
<p>2. Laugh uncontrollably for about 3 minutes &amp; then suddenly stop and look suspiciously at everyone who looks at you.</p>
<p>3. When your computer is turned off, complain to the monitor on duty that you can't get the damn thing to work. After he/she's turned it on, wait 5 minutes, turn it off again, &amp; repeat the process for a good half hour.</p>
<p>4. Type frantically, often stopping to look at the person next to you evilly.</p>
<p>5. Before anyone else is in the lab, connect each computer to a different screen than the one it's set up with.</p>
<p>6. Write a program that plays the ""Smurfs"" theme song and play it at the highest volume possible over &amp; over again.</p>
<p>7. Work normally for a while. Suddenly look amazingly startled by something on the screen and crawl underneath the desk.</p>
<p>8. Ask the person next to you if they know how to tap into top-secret Pentagon files.</p>
<p>9. Use Interactive Send to make passes at people you don't know.</p>
<p>10. Make a small ritual sacrifice to the computer before you turn it on.</p>
