22006,"<p>Scientists at NASA built a gun specifically to launch dead chickens at the windshields of airliners, military jets and the space shuttle, all traveling at maximum velocity.The idea was to simulate the frequent incidents of collisions with airborne fowl to test the strength of the windshields. British engineers heard about the gun and were eager to test it on the windshields of their new high-speed trains. Arrangements were made, and a gun was sent to the British engineers.When the gun was fired, the engineers stood shocked as the chicken hurtled out of the barrel, crashed into the shatterproof shield, smashed it to smithereens, blasted through the control console, snapped the train driver's backrest in two and embedded itself in the back wall of the cabin, like an arrow shot from a bow. The horrified Brits sent NASA the disastrous results of the experiment, along with the designs of the windshield, and begged the US scientists for suggestions.NASA responded with a one-line memo: ""Thaw the chicken.""</p>

22024,"<p>Write on the bottom of shoesSomeone once took a large black ink marker and wrote ""Help"" on the bottom of the groom's left shoe and ""Me"" on the bottom of the right shoe.  So when he knelt down for his vows, the entire congregation saw it. Of course, this will only work if he must kneel with back to congregation (i.e. Catholic wedding). Make sure you get it so that it is readable with the shoes side by side, left to right, toes toward the floor.  Do this far enough in advance so that the paint is dry before the groom wears the shoes to avoid damaging carpets.Besides ""Help Me"", other possible message to write on the soles are (with varying degrees of cruelness): Left Shoe (I'm With) Right Shoe (Stupid [pointing arrowhead]); Left Shoe (Quick, Call 911!) Right Shoe (Never Mind, I'm Doomed!)</p>

I will create a companion for you that will bewith you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you, so that you will know I love you, even when you cannot see me. Regardless of how selfish and childish and unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as I do, in spite of yourself.''And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam. And it was a good animal. And God was pleased.And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and he wagged his tail. And Adam said, ''But Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom and all the good names are taken and I cannot think of a name for this new animal.''And God said, ''No problem! Because I have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own name, and you will call him DOG.''And Dog lived with Adam and was a companion to him and loved him. And Adam was comforted. And God was pleased. And Dog was content and wagged his tail.After a while, it came to pass that Adam's guardian angel came to the Lord and said, ''Lord, Adam has become filled with pride. He struts and preens like a peacock and he believes he is worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed taught him that he is loved, but no one has taught him humility.'' And the Lord said, ''No problem! I will create for him a companion who will be with him forever and who will see him as he is. The companion will remind him of his limitations, so he will know that he is not worthy of adoration.''And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam. And Cat would not obey Adam.And when Adam gazed into Cat's eyes, he was reminded that he was not the supreme being. And Adam learned humility.And God was pleased. And Adam was greatly improved. And Dog wagged his tail.And Cat did not care one way or the other.</p>

<p>SUBJ: Clinton's Address to the Nation</p>
<p>Text from Clinton's Address to the Nation if he were on truth serum.<br /> 10.16 P.m. ET (0216 GMT) August 17, 1998</p>
<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>This afternoon in this room, from this chair, in this very spot, I was forced to testify before the Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury.</p>
<p>I answered their questions truthfully whenever there was compelling physical evidence that would contradict my lies, including questions about having sex while watching an intern do kinky things that I now spin as being part of my private life, questions so embarrassing that no American citizen would ever want to answer.</p>
<p>Still, the polls indicate that I must take complete responsibility for all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you tonight and not ducking questions while the Marine Band plays loudly and drowns out the media.</p>
<p>As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While I, a compulsive liar, deemed my answers legally accurate, I was not stupid enough to volunteer any information that might help prove what I did to Paula.</p>
<p>Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, since I got caught, I can see it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part to destroy all evidence linking me to the events, for which I am solely and completely responsible, but for which I refuse to apologize.</p>
<p>But I told the grand jury today, and I say to you now, that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence, or to take any other unlawful action. I was a lawyer before becoming your President and I know better than to do these things. I have less important people to do these things whenever I indicate that I would like to see something go away.</p>
<p>I know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression, and that is what I intended. How could I know this thing would spin out of control or that my spin doctors would be too worn out from the plethora of scandals to be effective.</p>
<p>I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that, because Hillary is a better lawyer and will clean me out in any divorce settlement.</p>
<p>I regret misleading my friends because most of them have evidence of other wrongdoing that may hurt me.</p>
<p>I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. I was also very concerned about protecting myself from my family.</p>
<p>The fact that these questions were being asked in a politically inspired lawsuit about my tendency to expose my private parts to women, which my lies and obstruction of justice has since caused to be dismissed, was a consideration, too. I could not allow the truth to be known until after the statute of limitations expires.</p>
<p>In addition, I had real and serious concerns about an independent counsel investigation that began with private business dealings 20 years ago. Dealings, I might add, about which an independent federal agency, staffed with my political appointees and friends, found none of the evidence of wrongdoing by me, or my wife, over two years ago.</p>
<p>The independent counsel investigation has enough evidence of wrongdoing on my part to move on to my staff and friends, now into my private life with interns in the oval office. And now the investigation itself is under investigation, because my very large staff of lawyers found a gullible judge who is stupid enough to help me by requiring the independent counsel to prove he didn't leak the things that we leaked.</p>
<p>This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people, and is getting much to close to the evidence I have worked so hard to conceal. I call upon all of my friends in the sympathetic media to join with me in stopping this out-of-control situation before they get enough evidence to impeach me.</p>
<p>Now, this matter is among me, the two people I love most -- my wife and our daughter -- and our God. I must put it right, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so. Even the bombing of terrorist camps that we have known about for ten years.</p>
<p>Nothing is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim my family life for my family. It's nobody's business but ours, and the focus groups indicated that there were enough stupid people to believe this nonsense.</p>
<p>Even presidents have private lives with interns in the oval office. It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into my sex addiction and get on with our national life.</p>
<p>My stonewalling and lying has caused this country to be distracted by this matter for too long, and I take my responsibility for my part in all of this, even though I did it because of Ken Starr. That is all I can get away with.</p>
<p>Now it is time -- in fact, it is past time -- to move on. We have important work to do -- new women to seduce, new interns to chase, and real terrorist camps to bomb.</p>
<p>And so tonight, I ask you to turn away from the spectacle I have created for the past seven months by lying to the American People, to repair the fabric of our national discourse, to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next American century, and to help me shut down the independent counsel before he closes the trap on me in such a manner that I can no longer lie my way out of this mess.</p>
<p>Thank you for watching and good night.</p>

22049,"<p>Preparation for parenthood is not just a matter of reading books and decorating the nursery. Here are 12 simple tests for expectant parents to take to prepare themselves for the real-life experience of being a mother or father.1. Women: to prepare for maternity, put on a dressing gown and stick a beanbag down the front. Leave it there for 9 months. After 9 months, take out 10% of the beans.2. Men: to prepare for paternity, go the local drug store, tip the contents of your wallet on the counter, and tell the pharmacist to help himself. Then go to the supermarket. Arrange to have your salary paid directly to their head office. Go home. Pick up the paper and read it for the last time.3. Before you finally go ahead and have children, find a couple who are already parents and berate them about their methods of discipline, lack of patience, appallingly low tolerance levels, and how they have allowed their children to run riot. Suggest ways in which they might improve their child's sleeping habits, toilet training, table manners and overall behavior. Enjoy it - it'll be the last time in your life that you will have all of the answers.4. To discover how the nights feel, walk around, the living room from 5pm to 10pm carrying a wet bag weighing approximately 8-12 lbs. At 10pm put the bag down, set the alarm for midnight, and go to sleep. Get up at 12 and walk around the living room again, with the bag, until 1am. Put the alarm on for 3am. As you can't get back to sleep, get up at 2am and make a drink. Go to bed at 2:45 am. Get up again at 3am when the alarm goes off. Sing songs in the dark until 4am. Put the alarm on for 5am. Get up. Make breakfast. Keep this up for 5 years. Look cheerful.5. Can you stand the mess children make? To find out, smear peanut butter onto the sofa and jam onto the curtains. Hide a fish finger behind the stereo and leave it there all summer. Stick your fingers in the flowerbeds then rub them on the clean walls. Cover the stains with crayons. How does that look?6. Dressing small children is not as easy as it seems: first buy an octopus and a string bag. Attempt to put the octopus into the string bag so that none of the arms hang out. Time allowed for this - all morning.7. Take an egg carton. Using a pair of scissors and a can of paint, turn it into an alligator. Now take a toilet tube. Using only scotch tape and a piece of foil, turn it into a Christmas tree. Last, take a milk container, a ping pong ball, and an empty packet of Coco Puffs and make an exact replica of the Eiffel Tower. Congratulations, you have just qualified for a place on the playgroup committee.8. Forget the Lexus and buy a Mini Van. And don't think you can leave it out in the driveway spotless and shining. Family cars don't look like that. Buy a chocolate ice cream bar and put it in the glove compartment. Leave it there. Get a quarter. Stick it in the cassette player. Take a family-size packet of chocolate cookies. Mash them down the back seats. Run a garden rake along both sides of the car. There!, Perfect!9. Get ready to go out. Wait outside the toilet for half an hour. Go out the front door. Come in again. Go out. Come back in. Go out again. Walk down the front path. Walk back up it. Walk down it again. Walk very slowly down the road for 5 minutes. Stop to inspect minutely every cigarette butt, piece of used chewing gum, dirty tissue and dead insect along the way. Retrace your steps.Scream that you've had as much as you can stand, until the neighbors come out and stare at you. Give up and go back in the house. You are now just about ready to try taking a small child for a walk.10. Always repeat everything you say at least five times.11. Go to your local supermarket. Take with you the nearest thing you can find to a pre-school child - a fully grown goat is excellent. If you intend to have more than one child, take more than one goat. Buy your week's groceries without letting the goats out of your sight. Pay for everything the goats eat or destroy. Until you can easily accomplish this do not even contemplate having children.12. Hollow out a melon. Make a small hole in the side. Suspend it from the ceiling and swing it from side to side. Now get a bowl of soggy Froot Loops and attempt to spoon it into the swaying melon by pretending to be an airplane. Continue until half of the Froot Loops are gone. Tip the rest into your lap, making sure that a lot of it falls on the floor. You are now ready to feed a 12-month old baby.13. Learn the names of every character from Barney and Friends, Sesame Street and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. When you find yourself singing ""I love you, you love me"" at work, now, CONGRATULATIONS! ... you finally qualify as a parent.</p>

22059,"<p>An 'American' tourist couple, both sociologists, were walking the streets of a small town in Saudi Arabia. It was nearing the middle of the day and they didn't want to miss lunch at their ramshackle hotel--the only one in town and which always served meals promptly. They came upon an old herder perched on a stool beside his camel. </p>
<p>""Excuse me, sir,"" the man asked, ""but could you tell me the time?"" </p>
<p>The old man glanced at them, spat in the dirt, then turned and reached under his camel....and hefted the animal's testicles. After a moment, he released them. ""It is 10 minutes before noon,"" he replied. </p>
<p>The couple exchanged confused looks, thanked the man and hurried back to their hotel, arriving just in time for the meal. Later that day, the wandering couple found themselves again on the same street and spied the old herder perched beside his camel, apparently unmoved. Curious as to how he could tell time by fondling his animal's balls they approached him and asked again, ""Sir, can you tell us the time?"" </p>
<p>They watched closely as he again reached up and grabbed the camel's jewels, seemingly judging their weight, then pronounced, ""It is half-past four."" </p>
<p>The couple excitedly exchanged looks. The woman blurted, ""Oh, sir! That is an amazing ability you have! Could you show us how you do it?!? </p>
<p>""Surely,"" the herder responded tiredly, and motioned them to squat beside him. ""Now, grasp his jewels gently and lift them up to his belly."" The woman did so while her companion watched. </p>
<p>""What now?"", she inquired. </p>

22061,"<p>A flea died and went to Heaven. St. Peter met it at the gate and explained that it could choose how it could spend the rest of eternity.</p>
<p>SP: ""Have you thought about it? Do you know how you'd like to spend the rest of eternity?""</p>
<p>Flea: ""Yes St. Peter, I have thought about it, I'd like to spend the rest of eternity on the back of a rich lady's dog.""</p>
<p>SP: ""So be it, it's done.""</p>
<p>A few weeks later St. Peter was wondering about the flea and so he called.</p>
<p>SP: ""Flea, how are you doing?""</p>
<p>Flea: ""Oh St. Peter, I made a terrible mistake. This old broad washes her dog two to three times a day, she perfumes it, and I'm nauseous and I have a headache from the smell.""</p>
<p>SP: ""Well you know that you aren't supposed to get more than one choice on how to spend the rest of eternity, but you are supposed to be happy. Have you thought about what else you might like to do?""</p>
<p>Flea: ""Oh yes, St. Peter! I have thought about it and I'm sorry I didn't  bring it up before, I'd like to spend it in Willie Nelson's beard.""</p>
<p>SP: ""So be it, it's done.""</p>
<p>Out of curiosity St. Peter checked on the flea a few weeks later.</p>
<p>SP: ""Hello flea, how are you doing now?""</p>
<p>Flea: ""I'm sorry St. Peter, I'm not doing well at all. I get woke up in the middle of the night, get drenched with beer, foul language all the time and I keep getting woozy with some white powder that flies around. It's Hell, St. Peter, I'm miserable!""</p>
<p>SP: ""You know, flea, you're not supposed to be able to change your mind about how you spend the rest of eternity, but you say this is 'Hell,' have you considered what else you might like to do?""</p>
<p>Flea: ""Oh, St. Peter, YES! I have thought about it, and I have decided that I'd like to spend the rest of eternity in Dolly Parton's bush.""</p>
<p>SP: ""So be it, it's done.""</p>
<p>Not being able to stand his curiosity, St. Peter decided to check on the flea again after a few weeks.</p>
<p>SP: ""How's it going flea?""</p>
<p>Flea: ""Oh, hi St. Peter, well, it's kind of strange... You see there  was this big party.  There was lots of singing and dancing, I got bounced around  a lot and there was this weird smoke in the air that made me dizzy.<br /> There were hands all over me and I don't quite remember all that happened, but would you believe it? I'm back in Willie Nelson's beard!""</p>

22128,"<p>One day, the teacher walks into her classroom and announces to the class that on each Friday, she will ask a question to the class and anyone who answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday.</p>
<p>On the first Friday, the teacher asks, ""How many grains of sand are in the beach?"" Needless to say, no one could answer.</p>
<p>The following Friday, the teacher asks the class, ""How many stars are in the sky?"" and again no one could answer.</p>
<p>Frustrated, little Johnny decides that the next Friday, he would somehow answer the question and get a 3 day weekend. So Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping-pong balls and paints them black. The next day, he brings them to school in a paper bag.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, just when the teacher says, ""Here's this week's question,"" Johnny empties the bag to the floor sending the ping-pong balls rolling to the front of the room. Because they are young kids who find any disruption of class amusing, the entire class starts laughing.</p>
<p>The teacher says, "" Okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?""<br /> Immediately, little Johnny stands up and says, ""Bill Cosby, see ya on Tuesday!""</p>

22131,"<p>A guy with leprosy wins tickets to see the world series. But when he gets there, he has trouble finding a seat because pieces of him are<br /> peeling and flaking off, and he's very concerned about grossing out<br /> the other fans.</p>
<p>The leper wanders through the bleachers looking for a seat where his<br /> grotesque appearance won't disturb anyone else. Finally he finds an open seat where he might be able to watch the game. He asks the man<br /> in the adjoining seat if it would be okay to sit there.</p>
<p>The man answers, ""Yeah. Just sit down, shut up, and watch the game.""</p>
<p>The leper sits down and adds, ""As you can see, I have leprosy. If<br /> it disturbs you, I will move.""</p>
<p>""It doesn't bother me. Just shut up, and watch the game.""</p>
<p>A while later, during the fourth inning, the man suddenly vomits.<br /> Frothy beer, hot dogs, and peanuts are splattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the leper gets up and says, ""Thank you for allowing<br /> me to sit next to you, but I can see that my appearance has caused<br /> you to get sick. I will find another place to sit.""</p>
<p>""It's NOT you. Just sit down, shut up, and watch the game.""</p>
<p>So the leper sits back down. But during the sixth inning, the man begins to vomit again. This time it is projectile vomitus. A powerful blast of beer and pretzels shoots out from the man's mouth and nose until is stomach is completely emptied.</p>

<p>So the leper sits back down.  But during the seventh inning, the man begins to vomit again. This time it is the dry heaves. The leper feels absolutely awful at the sight of this man suffering. And once again, the leper offers to leave.</p>

22148,"<p>Utility British Gas has admitted sending one of its customers a bill for �2,320,333,681,613.<br /> Brian Law of Fartown, Huddersfield, received the bill last month as a final demand after failing to pay an earlier bill of �59. </p>
<p>The sum of �2.3 trillion was apparently due for electricity supplied to Mr Law's new home in Fartown. </p>
<p>And the letter from British Gas threatened to take him to court unless he paid the amount in full. </p>
<p>Mr Law, who runs an exhibition company called Prodis Play in Leeds, had delayed paying the original bill last year because he was away on business. </p>
<p>According to the local newspaper, the Yorkshire Post, Mr Law attempted to call British Gas to resolve the matter but with little result. </p>
<p>""After two hours, I did get through to somebody, and said I had received this bill,"" Mr Law told the newspaper. </p>
<p>""I started reading the figure out and the girl I was speaking to said there must have been a mistake. </p>
<p>""Eventually, I talked to a chap who promised to sort things out and he asked me to fax the bill through. </p>
<p>""I did that and rang again on the Wednesday, but this gent wasn't in and neither was his manager. I kept leaving all my phone numbers but nobody rang back."" </p>
<p>Eventually, Mr Law decided that he would only be able to resolve the matter by going to court and offering to pay a penny a week. </p>
<p>However, after enquiries by the press, British Gas responded, saying it was a ""simple, clerical mistake"". </p>
<p>The figure on the final demand was in fact the meter reference for Mr Law's property. </p>
<p>The clerical error meant that the reference ended up in the bill's total box, said a spokesman for the company in Leeds. </p>
<p>The company said it had ""a very amiable conversation"" with Mr Law about the mix-up, adding: ""he seemed to see the funny side"". </p>
<p>Mr Law will now be setting up a direct debit arrangement to pay his future bills. </p>
<p>""There is certainly no question of us taking him to court or cutting off his supply,"" the company added.</p>

Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and<br /> Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one of his<br /> disciples.  The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the<br /> side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with nails<br /> through his hands.  He was buried in a nearby cave which was sealed off by<br /> a large boulder.""<br /> St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.<br /> The third blonde continues, ""Every year the boulder is moved aside so that<br /> Jesus can come out...  and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six more<br /> weeks of winter.""</p>

<p>""So why are his legs sticking up in the air like that, Daddy?"" asked Lucy as she fought back the tears.</p>

So I decided to find a girl with some ambition.<br /> After college, I found an ambitious girl and married her. She was so ambitious, she divorced me and took everything I owned. </p>
<p>Now all I want is a girl with large breasts!</p>

22171,"<p>Esta es la cr�nica de una Boda Pueblerina, disfr�tala...</p>
<p>Esto ocurri� el pasado 16 de Octubre en un lejano pueblo del prospero estado de Michoac�n, llamado Tejeringo el Chico, cerca de Tecojorita y Tenalgueo el Chico, famosos por su producci�n de l�cteos, como el queso en barras, queso babas, queso badotas y queso plas, que por mucho superan a los franceses. Aquel hermoso d�a de oto�o, contrajeron nupcias la se�orita Zoila Del Hoyo Prieto y el bien ponderado y atractivo Aquiles Baeza Parada. </p>
<p>Las damas de honor en la ceremonia religiosa fueron las encantadoras hermanas: Melo Rosa, Melo Deborah y Melo I. Rita, y por supuesto, la Mama Melo, as� como tambi�n las primas Isela Pico, Tecla Varela Vergara y Vilma Madero, quienes se mostraron muy felices por el gran acontecimiento. El banquete result� ser un gran �xito, acudieron much�simos invitados, algunos ven�an de muy lejos, de Lomas Turbo y Lomas Ajeo, como el millonario Agapito Melorcas y su esposa Alma Marcela Silva de Alegr�a; tambi�n asisti� gente arist�crata como Zacar�as Blanco de la Barra, descendiente directo del Zar Zacar�as el Grande; personajes internacionales como Willy Milano, Elber Gun, Cabuca Johson y Johny Demon. El maestro Sebino Sobretti, vestido elegantemente con un traje confeccionado con telas de Juir, fue quien dirigi� la orquesta en tan prestigiada fiesta. </p>
<p>Las ni�as Concha, Queta, Mela y Rita, sobrinas del novio, fueron las primeras en correr hacia el banquete, despu�s de que los hermanos Guillermo ""Memo"" Costecho y Bartolom� Costecho les gritaron a la mayor: �Agarra mesa grande! Una vez que se instal� todo mundo en sus respectivos lugares, llegaron los meseros a servir el banquete, en el hubo de todo, pero lo que m�s gust� fue el consom� costecho y el raspado de an�s que nos dieron al final; los que se quedaron con ganas de postre (pues no alcanzo para todos), se fueron con Rosa la Manguera, la se�ora que vende fruta en la puerta de la casa del chico temido del pueblo, mejor conocido como el Coyote Cojo. Cuando �ste vio salir de la fiesta al pobre Benito Camelo que iba a comprar mangos y que es casi casi un santo, como el beato Carlos del Toro, le arm� un pleito tremendo pues le dijo: ""ayer te vi sentado en la parada"" con tu supuesta novia, una tal Carmela Pel�ez; se empezaron a pelear, lleg� otro tipo de mala fama, Guillermo ""Memo"" Herdez alias el pel�n y se arm� un l�o.</p>
<p>La fiesta segu�a y nadie se dio cuenta del pleito, excepto Agapito V�lez Obando que sali� corriendo del lugar pues, seg�n M�nica Galindo, comi� mucha carne pero hizo pescado del toallero, es decir le dio una diarrea de aquellas. A pesar de estos peque�os incidentes, la fiesta pudo continuar en paz gracias al mensaje que emiti� la premio N�bel Rigoberta Mench� Far�as, la cual iba ataviada con un hermoso vestido guatemalteco de color rosa celeste, confeccionado con una fina tela de las famosas tiendas Telas Poncho, negocio que hered� Alfonso Jr., o sea Poncho el chico, quien tambi�n estuvo presente y disfrut� del magno evento.</p>
<p>Por �ltimo no debemos olvidar a mi gran amigo Eduardo ""Lal�n"" Ganiza y su primo Francisco ""Paco"" Jerte y a sus bellas acompa�antes Rosa Melcacho y Alma Mar�a Rico. </p>
<p>Espero que hayan disfrutado esta cr�nica, tanto como yo disfrute de la fiesta.....</p>

22172,"<p>A beautiful young blonde woman boards a plane to New York with a ticket for the coach section. She looks at the seats in coach and then looks into the forward cabin at the first class seats. Seeing that the first class seats appear to be much larger and more comfortable, she moves forward to the last empty one. The flight attendant checks her ticket and tells the woman that her seat is in coach. The blonde replies, ''I'm young, blonde and beautiful, and I'm going to sit here all the way to New York.'' Flustered, the flight attendant goes to the cockpit and informs the captain of the blonde problem. The captain goes back and tells the woman that her assigned seat is in coach. Again, the blonde replies, ''I'm young, blonde and beautiful, and I'm going to sit here all the way to New York.'' The captain doesn't want to cause a commotion, and so returns to the cockpit to discuss the blonde with the co-pilot. The co-pilot says that he has a blonde girlfriend, and that he can take care of the problem. He then goes back and briefly whispers something into the blonde's ear. She immediately gets up, says, ''Thank you so much.'' hugs the co-pilot, and rushes back to her seat in the coach section. The pilot and flight attendant, who were watching with rapt attention, together ask the co-pilot what he had said to the woman. He replies, ''I just told her that the first class section isn't going to New York.''</p>

<p>""Why so little,"" she asked the pet store owner. The owner looked at her and said, ""Look, I should tell you first that this bird used to live in a whorehouse, a house of prostitution, and sometimes it says some pretty vulgar stuff.""</p>
<p>The woman thought about this, but decided she had to have the bird anyway. She took it home and hung the bird's cage up in her living room and waited for it to say something. The bird looked around the room, then at her, and said, ""New house, new madam."" </p>

<p>her two teenage daughters returned from school the bird saw them and said, ""New house, new madam, new girls.""</p>

<p>""Well,"" the bartender says, ""first you have to go over to that 200-pound bouncer and knock him out. After that, I've got a mean-tempered pitbull in the backroom who needs a tooth pulled. Then you have to go and f**k the 80-year-old lady who lives upstairs."" </p>

22208,"<p>El DAS ten�a una vacante para un asesino. Estas posiciones altamente calificadas son duras de llenar y hay muchas pruebas y verificaci�n de referencias implicadas antes de que usted pueda incluso ser considerado para la posici�n.</p>
<p>Despu�s de evaluar a algunos aspirantes a trav�s de las verificaciones, entrenamientos y pruebas, las opciones se redujeron a dos hombres y una mujer para la �nica posici�n disponible.</p>
<p>Lleg� el d�a de la prueba final para definir qui�n conseguir�a el trabajo. Los agentes que administraban la prueba llevaron a uno de los hombres a una puerta grande de metal y le dieron un arma.</p>
<p>""Debemos confirmar que usted seguir� nuestras instrucciones sin importar bajo qu� circunstancias. Dentro de este sitio, usted encontrar� a su esposa sentada en una silla. Tome esta arma y m�tela"".</p>
<p>El hombre, con una mirada de asombro, respondi�:</p>
<p>""Usted no puede estar hablando en serio. Yo nunca podr�a matar a mi propia esposa"".</p>
<p>""Bien. Entonces, usted definitivamente no es la persona adecuada para este trabajo"".</p>
<p>As�, que trajeron al segundo hombre a la misma puerta, le entregaron el arma y le explicaron los mismos par�metros de la prueba. El segundo hombre mir� algo sobresaltado, pero sin embargo tomo el arma y entr� al cuarto. Todo estuvo en silencio por cerca de 5 minutos, entonces la puerta se abri�. El hombre sali� del cuarto con l�grimas en sus ojos y dijo:</p>
<p>""Intent� matarla, pero simplemente no pude halar el gatillo. Supongo que no soy el hombre adecuado para el trabajo"".</p>
<p>""No, usted no tiene lo que se necesita para esto. Tome a su esposa y vaya a casa"".</p>
<p>Ahora s�lo les quedaba la mujer. La conducen a la misma puerta y le dan la misma arma.</p>
<p>""Como prueba final, debemos estar seguros de que usted seguir� las instrucciones sin importar las circunstancias. Adentro encontrar� a su marido sentado en una silla. Tome esta arma y m�telo"".</p>
<p>La mujer tom� el arma y abri� la puerta. Antes, incluso de que la puerta se cerrara completamente, los agentes oyeron a la mujer descargar, uno por uno, cada tiro disponible en el cargador.</p>
<p>Entonces el mismo infierno se apoder� de aquel cuarto. Se oyeron gritos, desgarramientos, golpes en las paredes. Esto continu� por varios minutos y finalmente todo qued� en silencio. La puerta se abri� lentamente y all� estaba parada la mujer. Se limpi� el sudor de la frente y dijo:</p>
<p>""�Mierda! No me dijeron que el arma estaba cargada con balas de salva, as� que tuve que matarlo a co�azos con la silla"".</p>

22256,"<p>It was getting a little crowded in heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. </p>
<p>The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have a real bummer of a day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.</p>
<p>The next day at 12:01, the first person comes to the gates of heaven. </p>
<p>The angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly says to the man,<br /> 'Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died.'</p>
<p>'No problem,' the man says. 'I came home to my 25th floor apartment in my lunch hour and caught my wife half-naked and appearing to be having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. I immediately began searching for him. My wife was yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. Just as I was about to give<br /> up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of that guy!</p>
<p>'Well, I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But wouldn't you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn't die. This ticked me off even more. In a rage, I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him. Oddly enough, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony, and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 storeys and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.'</p>
<p>The angel sits back and thinks for a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day. It was a crime of passion. So, the angel announces,<br /> 'OK sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,' and lets him in. </p>
<p>A few seconds later the next guy comes up. </p>
<p>'Before I can let you in, I need to hear about what your day was like when you died.'</p>
<p>The man says, 'No problem. But you're not going to believe this. I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side!</p>
<p>'Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, starts cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom that broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I'm laying there face up on the ground, unable to move, and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator of all things off the balcony. It falls the 25 floors and lands on top of me, killing me instantly.'</p>
<p>The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. </p>
<p>'I could get used to this new policy,' he thinks to himself. 'Very well,' the angel announces, 'welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,' and he lets the man enter.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, a third man comes up to the gate. The angel is warming up to his task.<br /> 'OK, please tell me what it was like the day you died.'</p>
<p>The man says, 'OK, picture this. I'm naked inside this refrigerator. . .'</p>

22272,"<p>An Irishman, a black guy, and a white guy were driving through the desert when they suddenly ran out of gas. They all decided to start walking to the nearest town (which they had passed 50 miles back) to get some help. A rancher was sitting on his front porch that evening when he saw the white guy top the horizon and walk toward him. The rancher noticed that the white guy was carrying a glass of water, so when he was within hearing distance, the rancher said, ""Hi there...what are you doing carring a glass of water through the desert?"" The white guy explained his predicament and explained that since he had a long way to go, he might get thirsty, so that's why he was carrying the water. A little while later the rancher noticed the black guy walking toward him with a loaf of bread in his hand. ""What are you doing?"" asked the rancher again. As before, the black guy explained the situation and said that since he had a long way to go, he might get hungry and that's why he had the bread. Finally the Irishman appeared, dragging a car door through the sand. More curious than ever, the rancher asked, ""Hey, why are you dragging that car door?"" ""Well,"" he said, ""I have a long way to go, so if it gets too hot, I'll roll down the window.""</p>

22283,"<p>One day a cat dies of natural causes and goes to heaven. Greeting him the Lord says, ""You've lived a good life. If there is any way I can make your stay in Heaven more comfortable, please let Me know.""</p>
<p>The cat thinks for a minute and says ""Well, all my life I lived with a poor family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor..."" The Lord stops the cat and says ""Say no more!"" Just then a wonderful fluffy pillow appears and the cat contentedly wanders off to find a good place to nap.</p>
<p>A few days later six mice killed in a tragic farming accident go to heaven. The Lord is there to greet them with the same offer. The mice answer: ""All of our lives we've been chased. We've had to run from cats, from tractors, even from that farmer's wife with her broom. We're tired of running..."" ""Say no more!"" The Lord replies. In a flash, eachmouse is fitted with a beautiful new pair of roller skates, and they skate happily off to explore the Heavenly landscape.</p>
<p>About a week later The Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him snoozing away. He gently wakes the cat and asks, ""How are things since you got here?""</p>

<p>A SOCIALIST:<br /> You have two cows. The government takes one and gives it to your neighbor. </p>
<p>A REPUBLICAN:<br /> You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. So what? </p>
<p>A DEMOCRAT:<br /> You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. You feel guilty for being successful. You vote people into office who tax your cows, forcing you to sell one to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for then take the tax money and buy a cow and give it to your neighbor. You feel righteous. </p>
<p>A COMMUNIST:<br /> You have two cows. The government seizes both and provides you with milk. </p>
<p>A FASCIST:<br /> You have two cows. The government seizes both and sells you the milk. You join the underground and start a campaign of sabotage. </p>
<p>DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE:<br /> You have two cows. The government taxes you to the point you have to sell both to support a man in a foreign country who has only one cow, which was a gift from your government. </p>
<p>CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE:<br /> You have two cows. You sell one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows. </p>
<p>BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE:<br /> You have two cows. The government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other, pays you for the milk, then pours the milk down the drain. </p>
<p>AN AMERICAN CORPORATION:<br /> You have two cows. You sell one, and force the other to produce the milk of four cows. You are surprised when the cow drops dead. </p>
<p>A FRENCH CORPORATION:<br /> You have two cows. You go on strike because you want three cows. </p>
<p>A JAPANESE CORPORATION:<br /> You have two cows. You redesign them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. </p>
<p>A GERMAN CORPORATION:<br /> You have two cows. You reengineer them so they live for 100 years, eat once a month, and milk themselves. </p>
<p>AN ITALIAN CORPORATION:<br /> You have two cows but you don't know where they are. You break for lunch. </p>
<p>A RUSSIAN CORPORATION:<br /> You have two cows. You count them and learn you have five cows. You count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open another bottle of vodka. </p>
<p>A MEXICAN CORPORATION:<br /> You think you have two cows, but you don't know what a cow looks like. You take a nap. </p>
<p>A SWISS CORPORATION:<br /> You have 5000 cows, none of which belongs to you. You charge for storing them for others. </p>
<p>A BRAZILIAN CORPORATION:<br /> You have two cows. You enter into a partnership with an American corporation. Soon you have 1000 cows and the American corporation declares bankruptcy. </p>

22288,"<p>Indifference will be the downfall of mankind, but who cares?</p>
"
22289,"<p>A little old lady entered the main branch of a large downtown bank with a large grocery bag in her arms. </p>
<p>She told the teller that she wanted to open an account to make a substantial deposit, in excess of $200,000. </p>
<p>Further, she said that since such a large sum was involved, she would deal only with the president of the bank to make the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>The teller looked in the bag and confirmed that it was, in fact, full of cash. He called upstairs and explained the situation to the bank president, who agreed to see the woman. </p>
<p>The teller escorted her to the presidents office, and the president invited her to have a seat, which she accepted.</p>
<p>She repeated her request to open an account. The  president said he would take care of it personally,  but his curiosity was killing him. </p>
<p>He said, ""Mind if  I ask how you happened to come into such a large sum of cash?""</p>
<p>""Not at all,"" was her reply.</p>
<p>""I bet.""</p>
<p>""You bet?"" he countered.</p>
<p>""At the racetrack, or on professional sports, or in casinos...?""</p>
<p>""Nothing like that,"" she said.</p>
<p>""I just ... bet. For example, I'll bet you $50,000 that by tomorrow morning your balls will be square.""</p>
<p>The president chuckled but, seeing that the lady had the funds to back up such a wild bet, agreed. </p>
<p>They shook hands on it, and she promised to return at nine the next morning to follow up, and left.</p>
<p>As the day wore on, the president found himself frequently checking to make sure that all was in order. It was, but just as a precaution he cancelled his regular Tuesday-afternoon golf match and went home early.</p>
<p>The next morning when he showered, he was actually quite relieved to find that nothing had changed drastically while he slept. </p>
<p>He confidently headed for the bank, laughing all the way at the unexpected windfall that was about to become his.</p>
<p>The little old lady showed up promptly at the appointed hour, accompanied by a young man. When the president asked who he was, she replied that he was her lawyer, who she always brought along when payoffs involving significant sums were involved.</p>
<p>The president told her that sorry, she had lost that particular bet, so the funds would be outgoing rather than incoming. </p>
<p>She insisted on examining the evidence for herself, considering the amount at stake. He deemed it a reasonable request under the circumstances, so he stood up, unbuckled his belt and dropped his pants. </p>
<p>She proceeded to closely inspect his jewels for any abnormalities. As she did, the president noticed that her lawyer was standing in the corner, banging his head against the wall. He asked the lady, ""What's the matter with him?""</p>
<p>She paused her inspection long enough to glance at the lawyer and replied, </p>
<p>""Oh, him. I bet him $250,000 that before ten A.M. today I'd have the president of the bank by the balls.""</p>

There they  found three large<br /> potato sacks.  They each climbed into one and as the last one<br /> closed his sack up they hear two police officers enter.</p>
<p>The deputy went up to the first bag and kicked it....</p>
<p>""Woof Woof""  responded the man attempting to sound like a dog.<br /> the deputy told the sheriff that it was a dog inside.</p>
<p>Next he went and kicked the second of the three sacks....</p>
<p>""Meow Meow""  said the man in the sack in an attempt to sound<br /> like a cat.  again, he told the sheriff what he heard...</p>
<p>He went to the third sack and gave it a good kick</p>

22300,"<p>Introduction: Why Do We Need Humans? </p>
<p>So you've decided to get yourself a human being. In doing so, you've joined the millions of other cats who have acquired these strange and often frustrating creatures. There will be any number of times, during the course of your association with humans, when you will wonder why you have bothered to grace them with your presence. </p>
<p>What's so great about humans, anyway? Why not just hang around with other cats? Our greatest philosophers have struggled with this question for centuries, but the answer is actually rather simple:</p>
<p>THEY HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS.</p>
<p>Which makes them the perfect tools for such tasks as opening doors, getting the lids off of cat food cans, changing television stations and other activities that we, despite our other obvious advantages, find difficult to do ourselves. True, chimps, orangutans and lemurs also have opposable thumbs, but they are nowhere as easy to train.</p>
<p>How And When to Get Your Human's Attention </p>
<p>Humans often erroneously assume that there are other, more important activities than taking care of your immediate needs, such as conducting business, spending time with their families or even sleeping. </p>
<p>Though this is dreadfully inconvenient, you can make this work to your advantage by pestering your human at the moment it is the busiest. It is usually so flustered that it will do whatever you want it to do, just to get you out of its hair. Not coincidentally, human teenagers follow this same practice.</p>
<p>Here are some tried and true methods of getting your human to do what you want: </p>
<p>Sitting on paper: An oldie but a goodie. If a human has paper in front of it, chances are good it's something they assume is more important than you. They will often offer you a snack to lure you away. Establish your supremacy over this wood pulp product at every opportunity. This practice also works well with computer keyboards, remote controls, car keys and small children. </p>
<p>Waking your human at odd hours: A cat's ""golden time"" is between 3:30 and 4:30 in the morning. If you paw at your human's sleeping face during this time, you have a better than even chance that it will get up and, in an incoherent haze, do exactly what you want. You may actually have to scratch deep sleepers to get their attention; remember to vary the scratch site to keep the human from getting suspicious.</p>
<p>Punishing Your Human Being</p>
<p>Sometimes, despite your best training efforts, your human will stubbornly resist bending to your whim. In these extreme circumstances, you may have to punish your human. Obvious punishments, such as scratching furniture or eating household plants, are likely to backfire; the unsophisticated humans are likely to misinterpret the activities and then try to discipline YOU. Instead, we offer these subtle but nonetheless effective alternatives: </p>
<p>Use the cat box during an important formal dinner. </p>
<p>Stare impassively at your human while it is attempting a romantic interlude. </p>
<p>Stand over an important piece of electronic equipment and feign a hairball attack. </p>
<p>After your human has watched a particularly disturbing horror film, stand by the hall closet and then slowly back away, hissing and yowling. </p>
<p>While your human is sleeping, lie on its face.</p>
<p>Rewarding Your Human: </p>
<p>Should Your Gift Still Be Alive? </p>
<p>The cat world is divided over the etiquette of presenting humans with the thoughtful gift of a recently disembowelled animal. Some believe that humans prefer these gifts already dead, while others maintain that humans enjoy a slowly expiring cricket or rodent just as much as we do, given their jumpy and playful movements in picking the creatures up after they've been presented. </p>
<p>After much consideration of the human psyche, we recommend the following: cold blooded animals (large insects, frogs, lizards, garden snakes and the occasional earthworm) should be presented dead, while warm blooded animals (birds, rodents, your neighbour's Pomeranian) are better still living. When you see the expression on your human's face, you'll know it's worth it.</p>
<p>How Long Should You Keep Your Human? </p>
<p>You are only obligated to your human for one of your lives. The other eight are up to you. We recommend mixing and matching, though in the end, most humans (at least the ones that are worth living with) are pretty much the same. But what do you expect? They're humans, after all. Opposable thumbs will only take you so far.</p>

22301,"<p>Julie, the blonde, was getting pretty desperate for money. She decided to go to the nicer, richer neighborhoods around town and look for odd jobs as a handy woman. </p>
<p>The first house she came to, a man answered the door and told Julie,""Yeah, I have a job for you. How would you like to paint the porch?"" </p>
<p>""Sure that sounds great!"" said Julie. </p>
<p>""Well, how much do you want me to pay you?"" asked the man. </p>
<p>""Is fifty bucks all right?"" Julie asked. </p>
<p>""Yeah, great. You'll find the paint and ladders you'll need in the garage."" </p>
<p>The man went back into his house to his wife who had been listening. ""Fifty bucks! Does she know the porch goes all the way around the house?"" asked the wife. ""Well, she must, she was standing right on it!"" her husband replied. </p>
<p>About 45 minutes later, Julie knocked on the door. </p>
<p>""I'm all finished,"" she told the surprised homeowner. </p>
<p>The man was amazed. ""You painted the whole porch?"" </p>
<p>""Yeah,"" Julie replied, ""I even had some paint left, so I put on two coats!"" </p>
<p>The man reached into his wallet to pay Julie. </p>
<p>""Oh, and by the way,"" said Julie, ""That's not a Porch, it's a Ferrari.""</p>

22309,"<p>Two guys were on a ship that sank in the middle of the ocean. They managed to<br /> inflate a rubber life raft and grab a box of provisions before their ship<br /> slipped under the surface.</p>
<p>After floating under a blazing heat for six days, they ran out of food and<br /> water. On the tenth day, bleary eyed and half dead from heat, thirst, and<br /> starvation, they spotted a small object floating toward them in the water. As it<br /> drew near, they were ecstatic to find that it was an old oil lamp. They grabbed<br /> the lamp and rubbed it.</p>
<p>Out popped a tired old genie who said, ""Okay, I've been doing this 3-wishes<br /> stuff for a while now guys, and, quite frankly, I'm burned out. You guys only<br /> get one wish and then I'm outtalk here... so make it a good one.""</p>
<p>The first guy blurted out, without thinking, ""Give us all the beer we can<br /> drink for the rest of our lives!""</p>
<p>""Fine,"" said the genie, and the entire ocean to beer was instantly turned into<br /> beer.</p>
<p>""Great move, Einstein,"" said the second guy, slapping the first guy on<br /> the side of the head. ""Now we're going to have to piss in the boat.""</p>

<p>Ten minutes after they arrived home, Roger grabbed the car keys and started heading out the door.<br /> ""Where are you going?"" Jane asked.<br /> ""I have a little errand to run. I should be back soon"" he replied.</p>
<p>Jane waited impatiently for Roger's return. After an agonizing 3 hour absence, Roger returned, sporting a very wide and wicked grin. ""Honey, I managed to get tomorrow's question and answer!""</p>
<p>""What is it?"" she cried excitedly.<br /> ""OK. The question is: 'What are the three main parts of the male anatomy?'<br /> And the answer is 'The head, the heart, and the penis.'""</p>
<p>Shortly after that, the couple went to sleep with Jane, now feeling confident and at ease, plummeting into a deep and restful slumber. At 3:30 in the morning, however, Jane was shaken awake by Roger, who was asking her the quiz show question.<br /> ""The head, the heart, and the  penis,"" Jane replied groggily before returning to sleep.</p>
<p>And Roger asked her again in the morning, this time as Jane was brushing her teeth. Once again, Jane replied correctly. So it was that Jane was once again on the set of the quiz show. Even  though she knew the question and answer, she could feel the butterflies conquering her stomach and nervousness running through her veins.</p>
<p>The cameras began running and the host, after reminding the audience<br /> of the previous days events, faced Jane and asked the big question.</p>
<p>""Jane, for $65,000, what are the main parts of the male anatomy? You have 10 seconds.""</p>
<p>""Hmm, uhm, the head?"" she said nervously. ""Very good.<br /> Six seconds."" ""Eh, uh, the heart?"" ""Very good! Four seconds.""</p>
<p>""I, uhh, ooooooohh, darn! My husband drilled it into me last night and I had it on the tip of my tongue this morning...""<br /> ""That's close enough,"" said the game show host, ""CONGRATULATIONS!!""</p>

""I am God, I have heard your prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first."" The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about to go to work on the nun. After the Hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, ""Ha ha, I'm the hippie!!""

<p>Your Pa read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 minutes of<br /> your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last<br /> family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so they wouldn't<br /> have to change their address. </p>
<p>This place is really nice. I even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works<br /> so well, though, Last week I put a load of clothes in and pulled the chain, we<br /> haven't seen it since. The weather isn't bad here. </p>
<p>It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second<br /> time for fourdays. About that coat you wanted me to send; your Uncle said it<br /> would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off<br /> and put them in the pockets. </p>
<p>Bablu locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it<br /> took him two hours to get me and your father out. Your sister had a baby this<br /> morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you are an<br /> aunt or uncle. </p>
<p>The baby looks just like your brother. Uncle Rakesh fell into a swimming pool<br /> last week. Some men tried to pull him out but he fought them off and drowned. We<br /> had him cremated; he burned for three days. </p>
<p>Three of your friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck. Bablu was driving.<br /> He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in the<br /> back, they drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down. </p>
<p>I am now closing this letter and will share more good news with you again next<br /> time. Your Favorite Aunt, </p>
<p>P.S...If this letter does not reach you, please let me know, I will send u<br /> another.</p>

22378,"<p>There was an old man in a nursing home who always fell out of his wheelchair. Finally, the nurses decided to do something about it, so they appointed a nurse to watch him all the time. He started to lean foward so the nurse stuck a pillow in front of him. Then he started to lean backward so she stuck a pillow behind him. Then he started to lean to the left so she stuck a pillow to the left of him. Then he leaned to the right and she stuck a pillow to the right of him. Later on that day, his son came to visit him. ''Dad, why do you have all those pillows around you''? ''Well, the nurses around here won't let me fart!""</p>

22385,"<p>All believable, but un-verrified at this time. 22 November 1996 -- Any More Complaints?   The controller working a busy pattern told the 727 on downwind to make  a three-sixty (do a complete circle, usually to provide spacing between  aircraft). The pilot of the 727 complained, 'Do you know it costs us  two thousand dollars to make a three-sixty in this airplane?'    Without missing a beat the controller replied, 'Roger, give me four thousand dollars worth!'    15 November 1996 -- What the...?!   PSA was following United, taxiing out for departure. PSA called the  tower and said 'Tower, this is United 586. We've got a little problem,  so go ahead and let PSA go first'. The tower promptly cleared PSA for  takeoff before United had a chance to object to the impersonation! 8 November 1996 -- Which Exit Did You Say That Was?   A DC-10 had an exceedingly long landing roll out after landing with his  Approach speed just a little too high. San Jose Tower: 'American 751  Heavy, turn right at the end if able. If not able, take the Guadeloupe  exit off of Highway 101 back to the airport.'  1 November 1996 -- Ouch!   Western Airlines had a term for its second officers. The term was  'GIB,' which stood for, 'Guy In Back.' The term was strictly unofficial  and was actually frowned upon by the management at Western. It seems  that some wise-guy pilot had been browsing through a dictionary and  had made the discovery that a 'gib' is a castrated tomcat. A male pilot is a confused soul who talks about women when he's flying  and about flying when he's with a woman. 11 October 1996 -- What Is That Thang?   It was a really nice day, right about dusk, and a Piper Malibu was  being vectored into a long line of airliners in order to land at  Kansas City.    KC Approach: 'Malibu three-two-Charlie, you're following a 727, one o'clock and three miles.'   Three-two-Charlie: 'We've got him.  We'll follow him.'    KC Approach:  'Delta 105, your traffic to follow is a Malibu, eleven o'clock and three miles. Do you have that traffic?'     Delta 105: (long pause and then in a thick southern drawl): 'Well ... I've Got something down there. Can't quite tell if it's a Malibu or a Chevelle, though.'  13 September 1996 -- Mama Didn't Raise No Fools!    Unknown Aircraft: 'I'm f--king bored!'   Air Traffic Control: 'Last aircraft transmitting, identify yourself  immediately!!'    Unknown Aircraft: 'I said I was f--king bored, not f--king stupid!' 6 September 1994 -- Mmmm, Mmmm, Good!   Tower: 'Eastern 702, cleared for takeoff, contact Departure on 124.7.'    Eastern 702: 'Tower, Eastern 702 switching to Departure ... by the way, as we lifted off, we saw some kind of dead animal on the far  end of the runway.'    Tower: 'Continental 635, cleared for takeoff, contact Departure on 124.7 ...did you copy the report from Eastern?'     Continental 635: 'Continental 635, cleared for takeoff ... and, yes, we copied Eastern and we've already notified Eastern's caterers.' 28 June 1996 -- No, That's Not What I Said!   O'Hare Approach Control: 'United 329, traffic is a Fokker, one  o'clock, 3 miles, eastbound.' United 329: 'Approach, I've always  wanted to say this ... I've got that Fokker in sight.'</p>

22393,"<p>Following a distinguished legal career, a man arrived at the Gates of Heaven, accompanied by the Pope, who had the misfortune to expire on the same day. The Pope was greeted first by St. Peter, who escorted him to his quarters. The room was somewhat shabby and small, similar to that found in a low grade Motel 6 type establishment. The lawyer was then taken to his room, which was a palatial suite including a private swimming pool, a garden, and a terrace overlooking the Gates. The attorney was somewhat taken aback, and told St. Peter, ""I'm really quite surprised at these rooms, seeing as how the Pope was given such small accommodations."" St. Peter replied, ""We have over a hundred Popes here, and we're really very bored with them. We've never had a lawyer.""</p>

He approached the man and asked reverently, ""Aren't you Moses?"" But the man wouldn't listen to him and continued walking. George asked him again, ''Aren't you Moses?'' The old man continued ignoring him, even turning his back on little Bush. George grabs the man's arm, looks him right in the eye and insists, ""Answer me -- Aren't you Moses?"" The man replies, ""I'm not saying a thing! The last time I spoke to a Bush I ended up roaming the desert for 40 years!""</p>

22396,"<p>Bill Gates suddenly dies and finds himself face to face with God. God stood over Bill Gates and said, ""Well Bill, I'm really confused on this one. It's a tough decision; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95 among other indiscretions. I believe I'll do something I've never done before; I'll let you decide where you want to go.""Bill pushed up his glasses, looked up at God and replied, ""Could you briefly explain the difference between the two?"" Looking slightly puzzled, God said, ""Better yet, why don't I let you visit both places briefly, then you can make your decision. Which do you choose to see first, Heaven or Hell?""Bill played with his pocket protector for a moment, then looked back at God and said, ""I think I'll try Hell first."" So, with a flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke, Bill Gates went to Hell.When he materialized in Hell, Bill looked around. It was a beautiful and clean place, a bit warm, with sandy beaches and tall mountains, clear skies, pristine water, and beautiful women frolicking about. A smile came across Bill's face as he took in a deep breath of the clean air. ""This is great,"" he thought, ""if this is Hell, I can't wait to see heaven.""Within seconds of his thought, another flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke appeared, and Bill was off to Heaven. Heaven was a place high above the clouds, where angels were drifting about playing their harps and singing in a beautiful chorus. It was a very nice place, Bill thought, but not as enticing as Hell.Bill looked up, cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled for God and Bill Gates was sent to Hell for eternity.Time passed, and God decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was progressing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill Gates shackled to a wall in a dark cave amid bone thin men and tongues of fire, being burned and tortured by demons.""So, how is everything going?"" God asked.Bill responded with a crackling voice filled with anguish and disappointment, ""This is awful! It's nothing like the Hell I visited the first time!! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to the other place....with the beaches and the mountains and the beautiful women?""That was the demo,"" replied God.</p>

22406,"<p>New research delivers enlightening insight into the sex life of the Scottish male.PreparationFriday night is very much love night for the Scottish man. Arriving back from the pub, having partaken of the traditional Scottish aphrodisiac 12 pints of heavy, a white pudding supper and three pickled onions his mind is set on one thing: love.His lust at fever pitch after the sensuous excitement of a hard night's dominoes, he approaches his beloved wife, enticing her with gentle words of passion, 'Any chance of na nookie?'The good lady in question, perhaps over excited by the erotic smell of stale beer or the sensuous vision of pickled onions sticking to his chin, is at first somewhat reluctant. This coy reluctance is expressed with the flirtatious reply, 'Awaity f*** ya bam.'ForeplayForeplay is very important indeed. This basically consists of the male casting off his lightly soiled Y fronts provocatively at his wife, usually landing skid mark down, as he approaches the bed and singing the ancient Gaelic fertility chant, 'Here we go, here we go, here we go.' Upon reaching the bed, he comments proudly on his rampant 8 inches. This is a classic example of alcohol induced double vision.Initial problemsAfter 12 pints, sometimes the man's Wee Willie Winkle is a trifle reluctant to extend itself (literally). Impotence is very much a blow to the man's self esteem and the wife has to be very tactful. She will offer gentle and sensitive words of encouragement such as, 'Ya useless bastard,' or possibly, 'It never happens tae ra milkman.'FellatioOral sex is a great favorite with the Scotsman. He approaches his wife with a cheeky invitation, 'Howl ya like to put yer teeth roon this?'The woman nods willingly and points suggestively to her falsies smiling happily in a bedside tumbler. 'Go on yersel,' she says, 'list dinnae disturb me.'Down to businessEventually the moment comes to consummate their tender love. Again, alcohol induced double vision is an important factor as the man decides which of his willies to use. Sometimes in his excitement, he may suffer from premature ejaculation, a phenomenon he explains to his wife using the poetic phrase, 'F*** me, I've shot ma load.'If this does occur, it is essential he makes up for disappointing his wife by uttering tender and loving compliments such as informing her she's the nicest woman he's ever come across. An imaginative lover, the Scotsman, possibly having read that women like to be spoken to dirty, says such things as, 'Shite, arsehole.'The woman is speechless. The man is now thrusting away, his mind a kaleidoscope of jumbled erotic thoughts. The woman wonders if they should repaint the ceiling. Sometimes she utters a word of encouragement such as, 'Are you sure it's in?'Given his level of sexual expertise, the Scotsman's ideal partner should be a versatile lover specializing in the faked orgasm. This takes the form of a breathless shout, 'Ooyah, ooyah, gallus big man.'Eventually it's all over. The man rolls over, wipes his dick on her nightie, falls asleep and commences snoring like a pig.There's no one in the world that performs quite like a Scotsman a veritable prince in the kingdom of sex.</p>

22410,"<p>Osama bin Laden finally gets his due when a one-ton tomahawk </p>
<p>missile lands </p>
<p>on his tent one day. He immediately goes to </p>
<p>hell, where the devil is waiting </p>
<p>for him. </p>
<p>""I don't know what to do here,"" says the devil. ""You are on </p>
<p>my list, but I have no room for you. You definitely have to </p>
<p>stay here, </p>
<p>so I'll tell you what I'm going to do: I've got a </p>
<p>couple of people here </p>
<p>who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll </p>
<p>let one of them go, but you have </p>
<p>to take their place. I'll </p>
<p>even let YOU decide who leaves."" </p>
<p>Osama bin </p>

<p>opened the first room. </p>

<p>surfacing empty-handed. Over and over and over. </p>

<p>next room. In it was the Ayatollah </p>
<p>Khomeini with a sledge-hammer and a </p>
<p>room full of rocks. All </p>
<p>he did was swing that hammer, time after time after </p>
<p>time. </p>
<p>""No, I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in </p>
<p>constant </p>
<p>agony if all I could do was break rocks all day,"" </p>

<p>and his legs staked </p>
<p>in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was </p>

<p>looked in disbelief and finally said, ""Yeah, </p>

<p>Someone's passing creates a vacancy that will be difficult to fill. </p>

<p>Whenever leadership was mentioned, this wonderful person was looked to for inspiration as well as results, ""Someone Else can work with that group.""</p>
<p>It was common knowledge that Someone Else was among the most liberal givers in our church. Whenever there was a financial need, everyone just assumed Someone Else would make up the difference.</p>
<p>Someone Else was a wonderful person, sometimes appearing superhuman. Were the truth known, everybody expected too much of Someone Else. Now Someone Else is gone! We wonder what we are going to do.</p>
<p>Someone Else left a wonderful example to follow, but who is going to follow it? Who is going to do the things Someone Else did?</p>

Others were lining up behind satan who was throwing most of them into the eternal fires of hell.  Every once in while, though, instead of tossing a poor soul into the fire, he would toss him/her to one side. After watching for hours, the fellow could not resist. He gave up his place in line and went over and tapped satan on the shoulder. 'Excuse me, sir,' he said. 'I'm supposed to be in line for judgment (didn't want satan to mistake him for someone who had already been condemned to hell) but I couldn't help but wonder why some of these people are being tossed aside instead of into the fires of hell?' 'Oh,' satan said with a snicker. 'Those are Oregonians. They're too wet to burn.'</p>

22446,"<p>The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will be the official language of the EU rather than German, which was the other possibility. </p>
<p>As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a five-year-phase in plan that would be known as 'EuroEnglish':</p>
<p>In the first year, 's' will replace the soft 'c'. Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. </p>
<p>The hard 'c' will be dropped in favor of the 'k'. This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter.</p>
<p>There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the troublesome 'ph' will be replaced with the 'f'. This will make words like 'fotograf' 20 percent shorter.</p>
<p>In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. </p>
<p>Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent 'e' in the language is disgraceful, and it should go away.</p>
<p>By the 4th yar, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing 'th' with 'z' and 'w' with 'v'. </p>
<p>During ze fifz year, ze unesesary 'o' kan be dropd from vords kontaning 'ou' and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters.</p>

22451,"<p>Al Davis had finally put together the perfect Raiders team for '99. The<br /> only thing he was missing was a good quarterback. </p>
<p>He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools, and he<br /> couldn't find a ringer quarterback that would ensure a SuperBowl win.</p>
<p>Then one night, watching CNN, he saw the war zone in Bosnia. In the<br /> background, out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a young Bosnian<br /> soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand grenade straight into<br /> a 15th story window 200 yards away... ka-boom! He threw another hand<br /> grenade into a group of about 10 soldiers a good 110 yards<br /> away--ka-blooey! A car passes going 90 miles an hour--bulls-eye! Right<br /> into the barely open window. </p>
<p>""I've got to get this guy,"" Al says to himself. ""He has the perfect arm!""</p>
<p>So he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football.<br /> Predictably, the young man breaks all the NFL records for completed<br /> passes, and the Raiders go on to win the SuperBowl.</p>
<p>The young Bosnian is lionized as the Great Hero of that year's SuperBowl,<br /> and when Al asks him what he wants, all the young man wants to do is to<br /> call his mother. ""Mom,"" the young man says into the receiver, ""I just won<br /> the SuperBowl."" </p>
<p>""I don't want to talk to you,"" the old woman says. ""You deserted us.<br /> You're not my son."" </p>
<p>""I don't think you understand, mother,"" the young man pleads. ""I just won<br /> the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm in the middle of thousands<br /> of adoring fans.""</p>
<p>""No, let me tell you,"" the mother implores. ""At this very moment, there<br /> are gun shots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your<br /> two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and this<br /> week your sister was raped in broad daylight...."" The old lady pauses, in<br /> tears, ""...I'll never forgive you for moving us to Oakland!""</p>

22464,"<p>Seems there was this nasty biker riding his hawg down the icey highway one cold day in Colorado, when he spots a cat lying in the middle of the road. The biker thinks to himself, ""I'll cut that cat in two,"" and he bears down on it hard. As he gets closer, he suddenly realizes that it's not a cat, it's a large piece of metal lying in the road. Too late! His front wheel plows into it and he's sent flying over the handlebars onto the road at 80 MPH. </p>
<p>Well, when he arrives in Hell, who should be welcoming the new arrivals but the Devil himself. As the Devil shakes the (ex)biker's hand, he asks mockingly, ""So, how do you like it here?"" </p>
<p>The bad-a** biker replies, ""Man, this is one COOL place!"" </p>
<p>The old Devil was just a little miffed at this upstart, so he decides to crank up the thermostat a notch.</p>
<p>The next day, the Devil seeks out the biker and asks, ""So, how do you like it now?"" </p>
<p>Still the bad-a** biker responds by saying, ""This is great! Reminds me of those drug runs to Sonora during the hot afternoons in August."" </p>
<p>Naturally, the Devil is only more angered, and cranks the heat up as far as it can go. The next day, Hell is as hot as it gets. The Devil again asks the biker how he likes it. </p>
<p>Undaunted, the biker proclaims, ""It's almost as hot as the time I beat and robbed those vacationers out in Death Valley. I love it!"" </p>
<p>Now the Devil is just plain upset, so he turns the thermostat all the way down. </p>
<p>The next morning, he finds the biker again and asks, ""OK smart-arse, how do you like it NOW?"" </p>
<p>With icicles hanging from every part of his body, the biker inquires, ""W-w-w-what h-h-hhappened, d-d-d-did the Broncos f-f-finally w-w-win the Super Bowl?""</p>

She raises her right arm, revealing a big hairy armpit as she points to all the people sitting at the bar and asks, 'What man out there will buy a lady a drink?'The whole bar goes dead silent as the patrons try to ignore her. At the end of the bar, a skinny little piss head slams his hand on the bar and says, 'Barman, I want to buy that ballerina a drink.'The barman pours the drink and the woman chugs it down. After she's completed the drink, she turns again to the throng and points around at all of them, again revealing the hairy armpit, saying,'What man out there will buy a lady a drink?'Once again, the little drunk slaps his hand down on the bar and slurs to the barman, 'Sir, I would like to buy the ballerina another drink.'After serving the lady her second drink, the barman approaches the little drunkard and says, 'It's your business if you want to buy the lady a drink, but why do you keep calling her a ballerina?'To which, the drunk replies, 'Sir, in my eyes, any woman who can lift her leg up that high has got to be a ballerina.'</p>

The fight continues in the court room until the Judge finally brings calm with the use of his hammer, shouting ""Silence in Court."" The court room goes silent and Paddy (the best man) stands up and says, ""Judge.. I was the best man at the wedding and I think I should explain what happened."" The Judge agrees and asks Paddy to take the stand. Paddy begins his explanation by telling the court that it is traditional in a Cavan wedding that the Best Man gets the first dance with the Bride. The judge says ""OK."" ""Well"", said Paddy, ""After I had finished the first dance, the music kept going, so I continued dancing to the second song, and after that the music kept going and I was dancing to the third song.. when all of a sudden the Groom leapt over the table, ran towards us and gave the Bride an unmerciful kick in her privates.""

<p>The Monsignor leads them into a room, and tells them to undress, and a small bell is tied to each man's penis.</p>
<p>In comes a beautiful woman, wearing a sexy belly-dancer costume. She begins to dance sensually around the first candidate.</p>

"
22495,"<p>These rules of golf are for good players whose scores would reflect their true<br /> ability, if only they got an even break once in awhile. They were adapted from<br /> those proposed by the Union Printers Golf Club in Baltimore and have some<br /> appealing provisions: </p>
<p>1. A ball sliced or hooked into the rough shall be lifted and placed on the<br /> fairway at a point equal to the distance it carried or rolled in the rough. Such<br /> veering right or left frequently results from friction between the face of the<br /> club and the cover of the ball, and the player should not be penalized for the<br /> erratic behavior of the ball resulting from such uncontrollable mechanical<br /> phenomena. </p>
<p>2. A ball hitting a tree shall be deemed not to have hit the tree. Hitting a<br /> tree is simply bad luck and has no place in a scientific game. The player should<br /> estimate the distance the ball would have traveled if it had not hit the tree<br /> and play the ball from there, preferably from atop a nice firm tuft of grass. </p>
<p>3. There shall be no such thing as a lost ball. The missing ball is on or near<br /> the course somewhere and eventually will be found and pocketed by someone else.<br /> It thus becomes a stolen ball, and the player should not compound the felony by<br /> charging himself with a penalty stroke. </p>
<p>4. In or near a bunker or sand trap, a ball rolling back toward the player may<br /> be hit again on the roll without counting an extra stroke or strokes. In any<br /> case, no more than two strokes are to be counted in playing from a bunker, since<br /> it is reasonable to assume that if the player had time to concentrate on his<br /> shot, instead of hurrying it so as not to delay his playing partners, he would<br /> be out in two. </p>
<p>5. If a putt passed over the hole without dropping, it is deemed to have<br /> dropped. The law of gravity holds that any object attempting to maintain a<br /> position in the atmosphere without something to support it must drop. The law of<br /> gravity supersedes the law of golf. (Same thing goes for a ball that stops on<br /> the brink of the hole and hangs there, defying gravity. You cannot defy the<br /> law). (Same thing goes for a ball that rims the cup. A ball should not go<br /> sideways. This violates the laws of physics). </p>
<p>6. A putt that stops close enough to the hole to inspire such comments as,<br /> ""You could blow it in"" . . . may be blown in. This rule does not apply if the<br /> ball is more than three inches from the hole, because no one wants to make a<br /> travesty of the game.</p>

22517,"<p>A team of archaeologists was excavating in Israel when they came<br /> upon a cave. Written on the wall of the cave were the following<br /> symbols in order of appearance:</p>
<p>1. A dog 2. A donkey 3. A shovel 4. A fish 5. A Star of David</p>
<p>They decided that this was a unique find and the writings were<br /> at least more than three thousand years old. They chopped out<br /> the piece of stone and had it brought to the museum where<br /> archaeologists from all over the world came to study the ancient<br /> symbols.</p>
<p>They held a huge meeting after months of conferences to discuss<br /> what they could agree was the meaning of the markings. The<br /> President of their Society stood up and pointed at the first<br /> drawing and said, ""This looks like a dog. We can judge that this<br /> was a highly intelligent race as they knew how to have animals<br /> for companionship. To prove this statement you can see that the<br /> next symbol resembles a donkey, so, they were even smart enough<br /> to have animals help them till the soil. The next drawing looks<br /> like a shovel of some sort, which means they even had tools to<br /> help them. Even further proof of their high intelligence is the<br /> fish which means that they had a famine that hit the earth<br /> whereby the food didn't grow, they would take to the sea for<br /> food. The last symbol appears to be the Star of David which<br /> means they were evidently Hebrews.""</p>
<p>The audience applauded enthusiastically and the President smiled<br /> and said, ""I'm glad to see that you are all in full agreement<br /> with our interpretations.""</p>
<p>Suddenly, a little old Jewish man stood up in the back of the<br /> room and said, ""I object to every word. The explanation of what<br /> the writings say is quite simple. First of all, everyone knows<br /> that Hebrews don't read from left to right, but from right to<br /> left. Now, look again, It now says: HOLY MACKEREL, DIG THE ASS<br /> ON THAT BITCH!""</p>

22568,"<p>WHY E-MAIL IS LIKE A PENIS</p>
<p>Some folks have it, some don't. Those who have it would be devastated if it were ever cut off. They think that those who don't have it are somehow inferior. They think it gives them power. They are wrong. Those who don't have it may agree that it's a nifty toy, but think it's not worth the fuss that those who do have it make about it.  Still, many of those who don't have it would like to try it.</p>
<p>It can be up or down. It's more fun when it's up, but it makes it hard to get any real work done.</p>
<p>In the long-distant past, its only purpose was to transmit information considered vital to the survival of the species. Some people still think that's the only thing it should be used for, but most folks today use it for fun most of the time.</p>
<p>Once you've started playing with it, it's hard to stop. Some people would just play with it all day if they didn't have work to do.</p>
<p>It provides a way to interact with other people. Some people take this interaction very seriously, others treat it as a lark. Sometimes it's hard to tell what kind of person you're dealing with until it's too late.</p>
<p>If you don't apply the appropriate protective measures, it can spread viruses.</p>
<p>It has no brain of its own. Instead, it uses yours. If you use it too much, you'll find it becomes more and more difficult to think coherently.</p>
<p>We attach an importance to it that is far greater than its actual size and influence warrant.</p>
<p>If you're not careful what you do with it, it can get you in big trouble.</p>
<p>It has its own agenda. Somehow, no matter how good your intentions, it will warp your behavior. Later you may ask yourself ""Why on earth did I do that?""</p>
<p>It has no conscience and no memory. Left to its own devices, it will just do the same damn dumb things it did before.</p>

<p>""Lord, I know you created this place for me, with all this<br /> lovely food and all of the beautiful animals, but I am lonely.""</p>

<p>""What's a ""woman"", Lord?""</p>
<p>""This ""woman"" will be the most intelligent, sensitive, caring,<br /> and beautiful creature I have ever created.</p>
<p>She will be so intelligent that she can figure out what you<br /> want, even before you want it. She will be so sensitive and<br /> caring that she will know your every mood and how to make you<br /> happy. Her beauty will rival that of the heavens and earth.

22591,"<p>MICROSOFT Bids to Acquire Catholic ChurchBy Hank VorjesVATICAN CITY (AP) -- In a joint press conference in St. Peter's Square this morning, MICROSOFT Corp. and the Vatican announced that the Redmond software giant will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for an unspecified number of shares of MICROSOFT common stock. If the deal goes through, it will be the first time a computer software company has acquired a major world religion.With the acquisition, Pope John Paul II will become the senior vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software Division, while MICROSOFT senior vice-presidents Michael Maples and Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said MICROSOFT Chairman Bill Gates.""We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years,"" said Gates.""The combined resources of MICROSOFT and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people.""Through the MICROSOFT Network, the company's new on-line service, ""we will make the sacraments available on-line for the first time"" and revive the popular pre-Counter-Reformation practice of selling indulgences, said Gates.""You can get Communion, confess your sins, receive absolution -- even reduce your time in Purgatory -- all without leaving your home.""A new software application, MICROSOFT Church, will include a macro language which you can program to download heavenly graces automatically while you are away from your computer.An estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St Peter's Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello -- in character as Father Guido Sarducci -- hosted the event, which was broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide.Pope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello chided Gates, ""Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats,"" the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained.The deal grants MICROSOFT exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such masters as Michelangelo and Da Vinci. But critics say MICROSOFT will face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to these key intellectual properties.""The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures,"" said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia.""You take the parting of the Red Sea -- we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came on the scene.""But others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a common Abrahamic heritage.""The Catholic Church has just been more successful in marketing it to a larger audience,"" notes Notre Dame theologian Father Kenneth Madigan. Over the last 2,000 years, the Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted by Christianity, lags behind.Historically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor, leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and entering into exclusive licensing arrangements in various kingdoms whereby all subjects were instilled with Catholicism, whether or not they planned to use it. Today Christianity is available from several denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used. The Church's mission is to reach ""the four corners of the earth,"" echoing MICROSOFT's vision of ""a computer on every desktop and in every home"".Gates described MICROSOFT's long-term strategy to develop a scalable religious architecture that will support all religions through emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of interfaces according to the religion desired -- ""One religion, a couple of different implementations,"" said Gates.The MICROSOFT move could spark a wave of mergers and acquisitions, according to Herb Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Baptist Conference, as other churches scramble to strengthen their position in the increasingly competitive religious market.</p>

22598,"<p>There was a young man who had just complete his schooling to<br /> become a minister. He had went back to his home town and went to<br /> his pastor and ask if he could deliver the message that Sunday.<br /> The minister agreed. </p>
<p>Sunday morning the young man went to his pastor and said he was<br /> too nervous to preach. The priest took him in the kitchen and<br /> pored him some clear whiskey. The man took a drink and refilled<br /> his glass. The priest told him to take it out and set it on the<br /> pulpet. It would calm his nerves and it was clear so the<br /> congregation would think it was water. </p>
<p>The young man did exactly what the priest said. After the<br /> service and everyone had left the young minister asked the<br /> priest how he did. The priest said fine but we must get three<br /> things straight. Mother Mary is not Big Mama. The Holy Ghost<br /> isn't the Spook from Hell And they crucified Jesus they didn't<br /> just nail his ass to a tree.</p>

22614,"<p>Trouser was normally a happy-go-lucky dog. He would chase tennis balls, play with other doggies, and eat his dinner without a fuss. He was a dog without a care. But on that fateful autumn afternoon, it was to be different. Trouser's owners were walking him along a trail at the park, when suddenly from out of the bushes jumped a man all dressed in black. He had white paint on his face, and was gesturing annoyingly at Trouser's masters. This strange person spoke not a word, but proceeded to pretend that he was trapped in a box and that he was pulling on a long rope. Seeing the sheer horror on his masters' faces, Trouser took it upon himself to rectify the situation. With a low growl he jumped and sank his teeth into this annoying pseudo clown's leg. Trouser immediately got a sickened look in his eyes and began to vomit wildly. He then dragged his tongue all over the ground in an effort to remove the man's foul essence from his mouth. For Trouser had learned that .... a mime is a terrible thing to taste.</p>

22627,"<p>If Dear Abby Was A Man...</p>
<p>Q: My fiance still has feelings for his old girlfriends. I'm afraid he will not be faithful.</p>
<p>A: A man's capacity to love is boundless. It has been proven to increase with the number of sexual partners.&nbsp; Thus, by having a few other women, your partner is really increasing his love for you. Best thing to do is to buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal and don't mention this aspect of his behavior.</p>
<p>Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.</p>
<p>A: This is perfectly natural behaviour - and it should be encouraged. The man is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. Far from being pleasurable, a night out with the boys is a stressful affair, and to get back to you is a relief for your partner. Just look back at how emotional and happy the man is when he returns to his stable home. Best thing to do is to buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal and don't mention this aspect of his behaviour.</p>
<p>Q: My husband wants to experience three-in-a-bed-sex with me and my sister.</p>
<p>A: Your husband is clearly devoted to you. He cannot get enough of you, so he goes for the next best thing - your sister.&nbsp;Far from being an issue, this will bring all of the family together. Why not get some cousins involved? If you are still apprehensive, then let him go with your relatives, buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal and on't mention this aspect of his behaviour.</p>
<p>Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex with him.</p>
<p>A: Do it. Sperm is not only great tasting, but has only 10 calories a spoonful. It is nutritious and helps you to keep your figure and gives a great glow to the skin. Interestingly, a man knows this. His offer to you to perform oral sex with him is totally selfless. Oral sex is extremely painful for a man. This shows he loves you. Best thing to do is to thank him, buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal.</p>
<p>Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.</p>
<p>A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with it, do it in your own time. To help with the family budget you may wish to video tape yourself while doing this, and to sell it at car-boot sales. To ease your selfish guilt, buy your man a nice expensive present, and cook him a delicious meal.</p>
<p>Q: My husband goes straight to sleep after making love - we have no time to talk.</p>
<p>A: Sex is an extremely difficult task for a man. Afterwards he needs rest. In fact, the more he loves you, the more hard work his love-making is, and the more rest he needs. Stop putting pressure on him. Buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal.</p>
<p>Q: My husband's efforts at lovemaking only last 30 seconds.</p>
<p>A: Your husband loves you very much. He is so turned on by you that he cannot control himself. In fact, the shorter the 'effort' the more he loves you. Return this love by buying a nice, expensive present, and cooking him a nice meal.</p>
<p>Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.</p>
<p>A: Foreplay to a man is very hurtful. What it means is that you do not love your man as much as you should - he has to work a lot to get you in the mood. Abandon all wishes in this area, and make it up to him by buying a nice expensive present, and cooking a nice meal.</p>
<p>Q: My husband has never given me an orgasm.</p>
<p>A: The female orgasm is a myth. It is fostered by militant, man-hating feminists and is a danger to the family unit. Don't mention it again to him and show your love to him by buying a nice expensive present ..and don't forget to cook him a delicious meal.</p>

22645,"<p>So, it seems that some friars were behind on their belfry payments, so<br /> they opened up a small florist shop to raise the funds.  Since everyone<br /> liked to buy flowers from the men of God, the rival florist across town<br /> thought the competition was unfair.  He asked the good fathers to close<br /> down, but they would not.  He went back and begged the friars to close.<br /> They ignored him.  He asked his mother to go and ask the friars to get<br /> out of business.  They ignored her too.  So, the rival florist hired Hugh<br /> MacTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to ""persuade"" them<br /> to close.  Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store, saying he'd<br /> be back if they didn't close up shop.  Terrified, they did so.  Thereby<br /> proving that Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.</p>

22650,"<p>A little old lady goes into the Chase Manhattan Bank, and says she wants to open a savings account. The accounts person asks her how much she would like to deposit to open the account and the little old lady says, ""Three million dollars.""The accounts person is startled, and says, ""In what form?""and the little old lady says, ""Cash. I've got it here in this bag...""The accounts person looks and, sure enough, the lady has a big grocery bag just chock full of green stuff in big denominations. This is a highly unusual event, and the accounts person excuses herself to get the president of the bank to handle this one. He arrives, and escorts the little old lady to his office to handle it personally. Once in his office, he asks the little old lady where she got so much money. She says, ""Gambling.""""Gambling?,"" he says.""What sort of gambling?""""Oh, I make bets with people on all sorts of things, and I usually win. For example, I've got $100,000 right here that says that by noon tomorrow your balls will be square, and I'll even give you 4:1 odds. You got $25,000 you'd be willing to wager on that?""The bank president is shocked at this sort of thing coming from a sweet little old lady, but he didn't get to be the president of the Chase Manhattan Bank without knowing something about money.""I suppose I could come up with enough to cover that sort of wager, but I wouldn't feel right taking it from you...there's no way you can win a bet like that!"" The little old lady just shook the bag, and said, ""I know what I'm doing...and I can afford to lose, though I'm not going to. Is it a bet?""""Ok, have it your way,"" said the president, and they shook hands on it.""See you at 11:55 tomorrow morning,"" said the little old lady, and with that she left. Next morning at 11:55 the little old lady arrives with a younger man in a three-piece suit, and is escorted to the bank president's office. The president is a nervous wreck, though a happy one. He'd gotten almost no sleep the night before, waking every few minutes to feel his balls to check for impending squareness, but nothing happened all night. He had checked hundreds of times that morning, but still nothing; perfectly normal. When the little old lady arrived he started to relax, knowing he had won.""Come in, please have a seat! Who might this gentleman be?""said the president.""He's my lawyer. For a bet of this size I want to have a witness. Any objections?""""No, perfectly understandable,"" said the president.""Well, it's now noon, and I'm still unchanged, so I guess I win!"" he said happily.""Not so fast!"" said the little old lady.""For a hundred grand I want to verify things personally! Please drop your pants.""The bank president is a bit flustered, but agrees that in her position he'd want proof as well, so he drops his pants. The little old lady goes over to him and reaches out to feel the organs in question.""Ok, you win, here's your $100,000,"" says the little old lady, handing over a bag of bills. As she does so, her lawyer starts banging his head against the wall and moaning.""What's wrong with him?""asks the bank president.""Oh, he's just upset. Poor loser if you ask me. You see, I had a bet for $1,000,000 with him that I would have the President of the Chase Manhattan Bank by the balls by noon today.""</p>

22681,"<p>Once upon a time, long, long ago there was a season when neither the Packers nor the Vikings made the post season playoffs. It seemed so unusual that the management of both teams got together and decided that there should be some sort of competition between the two teams, because of their great rivalry. So, they decided on a week long ice fishing competition. The team that catches the most fish at the end of the week wins. </p>
<p>So on a cold northern Wisconsin lake they began their contest. </p>
<p>The first day after 8 hours of fishing the Vikings had caught 100 fish and the Packers had 0. At the end of the 2nd day the Vikings had caught 200 fish and the Packers 0. </p>
<p>That evening the Packers coach got his team together and said, ""I suspect some kind of cheating is taking place."" So the next morning he dressed one of his players in purple and gold and sent him over to the Viking camp to act as a spy. At the end of the day he came back to report to the coach. The coach asked, ""Well, how about it, are they cheating?"" </p>
<p>""They sure are!"" the player reported, ""They're cutting holes in the ice.""</p>

<p>After a few minutes, the woman says to the man, ""I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara."" </p>

<p>The African king pauses for a while. He whips out his cellular phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, ""Okay, okay. I build. I build."" </p>
<p>Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. </p>
<p>She takes her time to think and finally she gets an idea, a sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, ""Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch penis."" </p>
<p>The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table, all the while muttering in African dialect. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the king shakes his head, looking really sad, and says to the woman, ""Okay, okay. I cut. I cut.""</p>

So God called a male angel and sent him down to earth for a time. When the male angel returned, he went to God and told him - yes, the earth was in decline. Ninety-five percent were bad and 5 percent were good.God said that this was not good. He would send a letter to the 5 percent of people that were good to encourage them and give them something to help keep them going.

These trades will be much sought-after in the coming Empire Of The Beast-King.- Stock up on Hostess Fruit Pies.  This may not keep you alive for long, but while it does... oh, baby.- Decide now whether you want to focus on raping or pillaging when the end comes.- Learn basic survival skills... the Tae-Bo� way.- Develop the ability to convert sunlight into energy using the chlorophyll in your body.- Build yourself a moonshine still.  Actually, this is a good idea almost any time.- Integrate yourself into sewer-based C.H.U.D. tribes now, before they think you're just jumping on the post-apocalyptic bandwagon.- Don't stand close to a computer at midnight on New Year's Eve.

It would be like, ""Excuse me...oops, never mind. I didn't see your sign.""It's like before my wife and I moved. Our house was full of boxes and there was a U-Haul truck in our driveway. My friend comes over and says ""Hey, you moving?"" ""Nope. We just pack our stuff up once or twice a week to see how many boxes it takes. Here's your sign.""A couple of months ago I went fishing with a buddy of mine, we pulled his boat into the dock, I lifted up this big 'ol stringer of bass and this idiot on the dock goes, ""Hey, y'all catch all them fish?"" ""Nope -Talked 'em into giving up. Here's your sign.""I was watching one of those animal shows on the Discovery Channel. There was a guy inventing a shark bite suit.

""Well, all right, but hold my sign. I don't wanna lose it.""Last time I had a flat tire, I pulled my truck into one of those side-of-the-road gas stations. The attendant walks out, looks at my truck, looks at me, and I SWEAR he said, ""Tire go flat?"" I couldn't resist. said, ""Nope. I was driving around and those other three just swelled right up on me. Here's your sign.""We were trying to sell our car about a year ago. A guy came over to the house and drove the car around for about 45 minutes. We get back to the house, he gets out of the car, reaches down and grabs the exhaust pipe, then says, ""Darn that's hot!"" See? If he'd been wearing his sign, I could have stopped him.I learned to drive an 18 wheeler in my days of adventure. Wouldn't ya know I misjudged the height of a bridge. The truck got stuck and I couldn't get it out no matter how I tried. I radioed in for help and eventually a local cop shows up to take the report. He went through his basic questioning..ok..no problem. I thought sure he was clear of needing a sign...until he asked ""So..is your truck stuck?"" I couldn't help myself! I looked at him, looked back at the rig and then back to him and said ""no I'm delivering' a bridge...here's your sign.""I stayed late at work one night and a co-worker looked at me and said ""Are you still here?"" I replied, ""No. I left about 10 minutes ago. Here's your sign.""</p>

22762,"<p>Recently I was honored to be selected as an Outstanding Famous Celebrity in Texas: to be a judge at a chili cook-off because no one else wanted to do it.  Also the original person called in sick at the last moment; and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted this as being one of those burdens you endure when you're an internet writer, and therefore known and adored by all.Here are the scorecards from the  event:Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster ChiliJUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor Very mild.FRANK: Holy smokes, what is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These people are crazy.********************************************** Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner ChiliJUDGE ONE: Smoky (barbecue?) with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain.  I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Hemlich maneuver.  Shoved my way to the front of the beer line.  The barmaid looks like a professional wrestler after a bad night.  She was so irritated over my gagging sounds that the snake tatoo under her eye started to twitch.  She has arms like Popeye and a face like WInston ChurchHill.  I will not pick a fight with Her.********************************************** Chili # 3:  Fred's Famous Burn Down The Barn Chili:JUDGE ONE:Excellent Firehouse chili!  Great kick. Needs more beans.JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.FRANK: This has got to be a joke. Call the EPA, I've located a freakin' Uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been sneezing Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now and got out of my way so I could make it to the beer wagon.  Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front of my chest.  She said her friends call her 'Sally.'  Probably behind her back they call her 'Forklift'**********************************************************************Chili # 4: Bubba's Black MagicJUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally was standing behind me with fresh refills so I wouldn't have to dash over to see her.  When she winked at me her snake sort of  coiled and uncoiled....it's kinda cute. **********************************************Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip RemoverJUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground adding considerable kick. Very impressive.JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.FRANK: My ears are ringing and I can no longer focus my eyes. I belched and four people in front of me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed hurt when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. Sort of irritates me that one of the other judges asked me to stop screaming.*********************************************Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian VarietyJUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except Sally. I asked if she wants to go dancing later.**********************************************Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation ChiliJUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef threw in canned chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge Number 3, he appears to be in a lot of distress.FRANK: You could put a hand grenade in my mouth and pull the pin and wouldn't feel it. I've lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water.  My clothes are covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth at some point.  Good, at my autopsy they'll know what killed me.  Go Sally, save yourself before it is too  late.  Tell our children I'm sorry I  was not there to conceive them.   I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful and I am not getting  any oxygen anyway.  If I need air I'll just let it in through the hole  in my stomach.  Call the X-Files people and tell them I have found a  super nova on my tongue.***********************************************Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint ChiliJUDGE ONE: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor hot.

22764,"<p>One sunny day a rabbit came out of her hole in the ground to enjoy the fine<br /> weather. The day was so nice that she became careless and a fox snuck up behind<br /> her and caught her.<br /> ""I am going to eat you for lunch!"" said the fox.<br /> ""Wait!"" replied the rabbit, ""You should at least wait a few days.""<br /> ""Oh yeah? Why should I wait?""<br /> ""Well, I am just finishing my thesis on 'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes<br /> and Wolves.'""<br /> ""Are you crazy? I should eat you right now! Everybody knows that a fox will<br /> always win over a rabbit.""<br /> ""Not really, not according to my research. If you like, you can come into my<br /> hole and read it for yourself. If you are not convinced, you can go ahead and<br /> have me for lunch.""<br /> ""You really are crazy!"" But since the fox was curious and had nothing to lose,<br /> it went with the rabbit. The fox never came out.<br /> A few days later the rabbit was again taking a break from writing and sure<br /> enough, a wolf came out of the bushes and was ready to set upon her.<br /> ""Wait!"" yelled the rabbit, ""You can't eat me right now.""<br /> ""And why might that be, my furry appetizer?""<br /> ""I am almost finished writing my thesis on 'The Superiority of Rabbits over<br /> Foxes and Wolves.'""<br /> The wolf laughed so hard that it almost lost its grip on the rabbit. ""Maybe I<br /> shouldn't eat you; you really are sick ... in the head. You might have something<br /> contagious.""<br /> ""Come and read it for yourself; you can eat me afterward if you disagree with<br /> my conclusions.""<br /> So the wolf went down into the rabbit's hole and never came out.<br /> The rabbit finished her thesis and was out celebrating in the local lettuce<br /> patch. Another rabbit came along and asked, ""What's up? You seem very happy.""<br /> ""Yup, I just finished my thesis.""<br /> ""Congratulations. What's it about?""<br /> ""'The Superiority of Rabbits over Foxes and Wolves.'""<br /> ""Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.""<br /> ""Oh yes. Come and read it for yourself."" So together they went down into the<br /> rabbit's hole.<br /> As they entered, the friend saw the typical graduate abode, albeit a rather<br /> messy one after writing a thesis. The computer with the controversial work was<br /> in one corner. And to the right there was a pile of fox bones, on the left a<br /> pile of wolf bones. And in the middle was a large, well-fed lion.<br /> The Moral of the Story:<br /> The title of your thesis doesn't matter. The subject doesn't matter. The<br /> research doesn't matter. All that matters is who your advisor is.</p>

22766,"<p>Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him, but was moved by Arthur's youthful happiness. So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer; if, after a year, he still had no answer, he would be killed.</p>
<p>The Question: What do women really want?</p>
<p>Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and, to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query.</p>
<p>Well, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess, the prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester. In all, he spoke with everyone but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What most people did tell him was to consult the old witch, as only she would know the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.</p>
<p>The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept her price first: The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! Young Arthur as horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage water and often made obscene noises. He had never run across such a repugnant creature. He refused to force his friend to marry her and have to endure such a burden.</p>
<p>Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He told him that nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table.</p>
<p>Hence, their wedding was proclaimed, and the witch answered Arthur's question:</p>
<p>What a woman really wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life.</p>
<p>Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it went. The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total freedom.</p>
<p>What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief and anguish.</p>
<p>Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old witch put her worst manners on display. She ate with her hands, belched and farted, and made everyone uncomfortable. The wedding night approached.</p>
<p>Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific night, entered the bedroom. What a sight awaited! The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him! Gawain was astounded and asked what had happened.</p>
<p>The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her (when she'd been a witch), half the time she would be her horrible, deformed self, and the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self. Which would he want her to be during the day and which during the night?</p>
<p>What a cruel question! Gawain began to think of his predicament:</p>
<p>During the day a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch? Or would he prefer having by day a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful woman to enjoy many intimate moments?</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read until you've made your own choice.</p>
<p>......................</p>
<p>.....................</p>
<p>....................</p>
<p>Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself!</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time, because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own life.</p>
<p>Isn't that beautiful?</p>
<p>But really now, what is the moral of this story?</p>
<p>If you don't respect women, things are gonna get ugly!</p>

22785,"<p>In the days when you couldn't count on a public facility to have<br /> indoor plumbing, an English woman was planning a trip to Europe.</p>
<p>She was registered to stay in a small guest house owned by the<br /> local schoolmaster. She was concerned as to whether the guest<br /> house contained a WC. In England, a bathroom is commonly called<br /> a WC which stands for water closet. She wrote the schoolmaster<br /> inquiring into the location of the nearest WC.</p>
<p>The school master, not fluent in English, asked the local priest<br /> if he knew the meaning of WC. Together they pondered possible<br /> meanings of the letters and concluded that the lady wanted to<br /> know if there was a ""Wayside Chapel"" near the house . . . a<br /> bathroom never entered their minds. So the schoolmaster wrote<br /> the following reply:</p>
<p>Dear Madam,<br /> I take great pleasure in informing you that the WC is located 9<br /> miles from the house. It is located in the middle of a grove of<br /> pine trees, surrounded by lovely grounds. It is capable of<br /> holding 229 people and is open on Sundays and Thursdays. As<br /> there are many people expected in the summer months, I suggest<br /> you arrive early. There is, however, plenty of standing room.<br /> This is an unfortunate situation especially if you are in the<br /> habit of going regularly.</p>
<p>It may be of some interest to you that my daughter was married<br /> in the WC as it was there that she met her husband. It was a<br /> wonderful event. There were 10 people in every seat. It was<br /> wonderful to see the expressions on their faces. My wife, sadly,<br /> has been ill and unable to go recently. It has been almost a<br /> year since she went last, which pains her greatly.</p>
<p>You will be pleased to know that many people bring their lunch<br /> and make a day of it. Others prefer to wait till the last minute<br /> and arrive just in time! I would recommend your ladyship plan to<br /> go on a Thursday as there is an organ accompaniment. The<br /> acoustics are excellent and even the most delicate sounds can be<br /> heard everywhere.</p>
<p>The newest addition is a bell which rings every time a person<br /> enters. We are holding a bazaar to provide plush seats for all<br /> since many feel it is long needed. I look forward to escorting<br /> you there myself and seating you in a place where you can be<br /> seen by all.</p>
<p>With deepest regards,<br /> The Schoolmaster</p>

22845,"<p>Last time the circus came to town, an ad for an animal trainer was placed in the local paper.</p>
<p>Only two applicants showed up: a male and a female.</p>
<p>The owner said he could only afford one animal trainer, so he would choose the one with the best act.</p>
<p>At first glance it appeared that the female was much better prepared, since she came to the interview in a very long flowing cape, with a whip &amp; chair. She looked more like a model than a trainer.</p>
<p>The man's only distinguishing feature was a soggy cigar stuffed between his cracked and leathery lips.</p>
<p>The owner asked who would like to go first, and the man said, ""Ladies before Gentleman.""</p>
<p>So the lady asked for her special music to be played, and once the music started she entered the cage with a flurry of whip snapping. She motioned the attendant to release the tiger.</p>
<p>The tiger leaped into the cage snarling. The young lady threw aside her whip, tossed back her cape and sat on the chair as naked as the day she was born.</p>
<p>The tiger then circled her, sniffing the air,... then suddenly leaped toward her, put its face between her legs and started licking. </p>
<p>She threw back her head moaning, holding the tiger by the ears with her thighs. She rode on the tiger's face all around the cage.</p>
<p>Then the owner looked at the man and said, ""That's quite an act,... Think you can do better than that?""</p>
<p>The man spit out his cigar, licked his lips and said, ""No problem, just get that tiger out of the cage!""</p>

22851,"<p>The Darwin Awards are out for 2004 ...Yes these are all true. They are finally out again. It's an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. And this year's nominees in reverse order are:7. A young Canadian man, searching for a way of getting drunk cheaply, because he had no money with which to buy alcohol, mixed gasoline with milk. Not surprisingly, this concoction made him ill, and he vomited into the fireplace in his house. This resulting explosion and fire burned his house down, killing both him and his sister.6. A 34-year-old white male found dead in the basement of his home died of suffocation, according to police. He was approximately 6' 2 tall and weighed 225 pounds. He was wearing a pleated skirt, white bra, black and white saddle shoes, and a woman's wig. It appeared that he was trying to create a schoolgirl's uniform look. He was also wearing a military gas mask that had the filter canister removed and a rubber hose attached in its place. The other end of the hose was connected to one end of a hollow tube approx. 12 long and 3 in diameter. The tube's other end was inserted into his rectum for reasons unknown, and was the cause of his suffocation. Police found the task of explaining the circumstances of his death to his family very awkward.5. Three Brazilian men were flying in a light aircraft at low altitude when another plane approached. It appears that they decided to moon the occupants of the other plane, but lost control of their own aircraft and crashed. They were all found dead in the wreckage with their pants around their ankles.4. A 22-year-old, Glade Drive, Reston, VA, man was found dead after he tried to use octopus straps to bungee jump off a 70 foot railroad trestle. Fairfax County police said Eric Barcia, a fast-food worker, taped a bunch of these straps together, wrapped one end around one foot, anchored the other end to the trestle at Lake Accotink Park, jumped and hit the pavement. Warren Carmichael, a police spokesman, said investigators think Barcia was alone because his car was found nearby. The length of the cord that he assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the ground Carmichael said. Police say the apparent cause of death was Major trauma.3. A man in Alabama died from rattlesnake bites. It seems that he and a friend were playing a game of catch, using the rattlesnake as a ball. The friend, no doubt a future Darwin Awards candidate, was hospitalized.2. Employees in a medium sized warehouse in west Texas noticed the smell of a gas leak. Sensibly, management evacuated the building, extinguishing all potential sources of ignition; lights, power, etc. After the building had been evacuated, two technicians from the gas company were dispatched. Upon entering the building, they found they had difficulty navigating in the dark. To their frustration, none of the lights worked. Witnesses later described the sight of one of the technicians reaching into his pocket and retrieving an object that resembled a cigarette lighter. Upon operation of the lighter-like object, the gas in the warehouse exploded, sending pieces of it up to three miles away. Nothing was found of the technicians, but the lighter was virtually untouched by the explosion. His peers had never thought of the technician suspected of causing the blasts 'bright'.AND THE WINNER.....1. Based on a bet by the other members of his threesome, Everitt Sanchez tried to wash his own balls in a ball washer at the local golf course. Proving once again that beer and testosterone are a bad mix, Sanchez managed to straddle the ball washer and dangle his scrotum in the machine. Much to his dismay, one of his buddies upped the ante by spinning the crank on the machine with Sanchez's scrotum in place, thus wedging them solidly in the mechanism. Sanchez, who immediately passed his threshold of pain, collapsed and tumbled from his perch. Unfortunately for Sanchez, the height of the ball washer was more than a foot higher off the ground than his testicles are in a normal stance, and the scrotum was the weakest link. Sanchez's scrotum was ripped open during the fall, and one testicle was plucked from him forever and remained in the ball washer, while the other testicle was compressed and flattened as it was pulled between the housing of the washer, and the rotating machinery inside. To add insult to injury, Sanchez broke a new $300.00 driver that he had just purchased from the pro shop, and was using to balance himself. Sanchez was rushed to the hospital for surgery, and the remaining threesome was asked to leave the course.NB: This last one wouldn't normally count, because the idiot didn't die. But because he cannot reproduce as a result of his qualifying act of stupidity, we have allowed it.</p>

22854,"<p>Scientists at NASA have developed a gun built specifically to<br /> launch dead chickens at the windshields of airliners, military<br /> jets and the space shuttle, all traveling at maximum velocity.</p>
<p>The idea is to simulate the frequent incidents of collisions<br /> with airborne fowl to test the strength of the windshields.<br /> British engineers heard about the gun and were eager to test it<br /> on the windshields of their new high speed trains.</p>
<p>Arrangements were made. But when the gun was fired, the<br /> engineers stood shocked as the chicken hurled out of the<br /> barrel, crashed into the shatterproof shield, smashed it to<br /> smithereens, crashed through the control console, snapped the<br /> engineer's backrest in two and embedded itself in the back wall<br /> of the cabin.</p>

22865,"<p>We've all been there but don't like to admit it. We've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the 2001 Survival Guide for taking a dump at work. Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure. </p>
<p>ESCAPEE.<br /> Definition: a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. </p>
<p>JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE).<br /> Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred. </p>
<p>COURTESY FLUSH.<br /> Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME. </p>
<p>WALK OF SHAME.<br /> Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH. </p>
<p>OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER.<br /> Definition: A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it. You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom. </p>
<p>THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN).<br /> Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS. </p>
<p>SAFE HAVENS.<br /> Definition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom. </p>
<p>TURD BURGLAR:<br /> Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact. </p>
<p>CAMO-COUGH.<br /> Definition: A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE. </p>
<p>ASTAIRE.<br /> Definition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace. </p>
<p>WATERMELON.<br /> Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. </p>
<p>HAVANA OMELET.<br /> Definition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire. </p>
<p>UNCLE TED.<br /> Definition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. </p>
<p>FLY BY.<br /> Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.</p>

22917,"<p>A man in a state of excessive inebriation rolled up at a fairground rifle range booth and threw down the necessary money. The booth operator at first refused to let him have a turn, considering that his inebriated state would endanger the public. But the drunk insisted and was given a gun.</p>
<p>He aimed unsteadily in the general direction of the target and after tying to focus, pulled the trigger three times. The booth owner, on inspecting the target, was astonished to see that he had scored three bullseyes. The star prize for the evening was a large set of glassware, but the showman was certain that the drunk wasn't aware of what he had done, and gave him instead a consolation prize, a turtle. The drunk wandered off into the crowd.</p>
<p>An hour or so later he came back, even more drunk than before. Once again the showman demurred, but once again the drunk insisted, and once more scored three bullseyes and was given another turtle.</p>
<p>Eventually the drunk rolled up again and insisted on a third attempt. Once more he picked up the rifle, waved it around in the general direction of the target, and pulled the trigger three times. Once more he had scored three bullseyes. But this time there was an onlooker with good eyesight.</p>
<p>""That's fantastic"", the man said. ""Hasn't he scored three bulls?""</p>
<p>The showman, cursing his luck, made a play of going over to the target and inspecting it closely.</p>
<p>""Yes Sir!"" , he announced to the crowd. ""This is fantastic! Congratulations, sir, you have won the star prize, this magnificent 68-piece set of glassware""</p>
<p>""I don't want any bloody glasses"", the drunk replied. ""Give me another one of those delicious crusty meat pies.""</p>

22918,"<p>Some time ago Mr. Clinton was hosting a state dinner when at the last<br /> minute his regular cook took ill and they had to get a replacement at<br /> short notice. The fellow arrived and turned out to be a very grubby<br /> looking man named Jon. The President voiced his concerns to his chief of<br /> staff but was told that this was the best they could do at such short<br /> notice.</p>
<p>Just before the meal, the President noticed the cook sticking his fingers<br /> in the soup to taste it and again he complained to the chief of staff<br /> about the cook, but he was told that this man was supposed to be a very<br /> good chef. The meal went okay but the President was sure that the soup<br /> tasted a little off, and by the time dessert came, he was starting to have<br /> stomach cramps and nausea.</p>
<p>It was getting worse and worse till finally he had to excuse himself from<br /> the state dinner to look for the bathroom. Passing through the kitchen, he<br /> caught sight of the cook, Jon, scratching his rear end and this made him<br /> feel even worse. By now he was desperately ill with violent cramps and was<br /> so disorientated that he couldn't remember which door led to the bathroom.</p>
<p>He was on the verge of passing out from the pain when he finally found a<br /> door that opened and as he undid his trousers and ran in, he realised to<br /> his horror that he had stumbled into Monica Lewinsky's office with his<br /> trousers around his knees.</p>
<p>As he was just about to pass out, she bent over him and heard her<br /> president whisper in a barely audible voice, ""sack my cook"".</p>
<p>And that is how the whole misunderstanding occurred.</p>

After driving a few miles the truck driver<br /> saw an attorney walking along the highway. As was his custom, the truck driver<br /> swerved to hit the attorney but, at the last moment, remembered he had the Nun<br /> as a passenger and abruptly swerved away to avoid hitting the attorney.<br /> Surprised upon hearing a loud 'thump' as he passed the attorney, the truck<br /> driver peered in his rear view only to see the attorney lying injured along side<br /> of the road. ""I'm so sorry Sister, I thought I missed hitting that attorney!""<br /> the truck driver pleads. ""You did my son, but I got him with the door!"" gleed<br /> the Nun.</p>

Tom said that it was bullshit and went down to the end of the bar, but again before he could say anything, the stranger said, ""since you were a child you have had an inferior left eye, Be heal and see the world the way God intended.

22985,"<p>Police arrested Malcolm Davidson, a 27 year-old white male resident of Wilmington, NC, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 PM Friday. </p>
<p>Davidson will be charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public intoxication at the county courthouse on Monday. </p>
<p>The suspect allegedly stated that as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he decided to stop. </p>
<p>""You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there wasn't,"" he stated in a phone interview from the county courthouse jail. </p>
<p>Davidson went on to state that he pulled over to the side of the road, picked out pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his alleged ""need.""</p>
<p>""I guess I was just really into it, you know?"" he commented with evident embarrassment. </p>
<p>In the process, Davidson apparently failed to notice the Wilmington Municipal police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until officer Brenda Taylor approached him. </p>
<p>""It was an unusual situation, that's for sure,"" said officer Taylor. ""I walked up to him and he's... just working away at this pumpkin."" </p>
<p>Taylor went on to describe what happened when she approached Davidson. She just went up and said, ""Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you are screwing a pumpkin?""</p>
<p>""He got real surprised as you'd expect and then looked me straight in the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn... is it midnight already?'"" </p>

22992,"<p>With Viagra such a hit, Pfizer is bringing forth a whole line of drugs oriented towards improving the performance of men in today's society. (This is making the rounds.) </p>
<p>DIRECTRA - A dose of this drug given to men before leaving on car trips caused 72 percent of them to stop and ask for directions when they got lost, compared to a control group where only 0.2 percent asked for directions. </p>
<p>PROJECTRA - Men given this experimental new drug were far more likely to actually finish a household repair project before starting a new one. </p>
<p>CHILDAGRA - Men taking this drug reported a sudden, overwhelming urge to perform more child-care tasks -- especially cleaning up spills and little accidents. </p>
<p>COMPLIMENTRA - In clinical trials, 82 percent of middle-aged men administered this drug noticed that their wives had a new hairstyle. Currently being tested to see if its effects extend to noticing new clothing. </p>
<p>BUYAGRA - Married and otherwise attached men reported a sudden urge to buy their sweeties expensive jewelry and gifts after taking this drug for only two days. Still to be seen: whether the drug can be continued for a period longer than your favorites store's return limit. </p>
<p>NEGA-VIAGRA - Has the exact opposite effect of Viagra. Currently undergoing clinical trials on sitting U.S. presidents. </p>
<p>NEGA-SPORTAGRA - This drug had the strange effect of making men want to turn off televised sports and actually converse with other family members. </p>
<p>CAPAGRA - Caused test subjects to become uncharacteristically fastidious about lowering toilet seats and replacing toothpaste caps. Subjects on higher doses were seen dusting furniture. </p>
<p>PRYAGRA - About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men in the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal affairs of other people. Note: Apparent over-dose turned three test subjects into special prosecutors. </p>
<p>LIAGRA - This drug causes men to be less than truthful when they are asked about their sexual affairs. Will be available in Regular, Grand Jury and Presidential Strength versions.</p>
