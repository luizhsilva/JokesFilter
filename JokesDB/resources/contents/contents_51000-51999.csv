51028,"<p>Dear Civilians,<br /> We know that the current state of affairs in our great nation have many civilians up in arms and excited to join the military. For those of you who can't join, you can still lend a hand. Here are a few of the areas we would like your assistance with:</p>
<p>1.) The next time you see an adult talking during the playing of the National Anthem...kick their ass.</p>
<p>2.) When you witness first hand someone burning the American Flag in protest...kick their ass.</p>
<p>3.) Regardless of the rank they held while they served, pay the highest amount of respect to all veterans. If you see anyone doing otherwise, quietly pull them aside and explain how these Veterans fought for the very freedom they bask in every second. Enlighten them on the many sacrifices these Veterans made to make this Nation great. Then hold them down while a Disabled Veteran kicks their ass.</p>
<p>4.) If you were never in the military, DO NOT pretend that you were. Wearing battle dress uniforms (BDU's), telling others that you used to be ""Special Forces,"" and collecting GI Joe memorabilia, might have been okay if you were still seven. Now, it will only make you look stupid and get your ass kicked.<br /> Personal Note: I ran into a FEW of these Guys and they really piss me off!</p>
<p>5.) If you witness someone calling an enlisted ""Sir,"" stand back...a Marine will kick their ass.</p>
<p>6.) Next time you come across an Air Force member, do not ask them, ""Do you fly a jet?"" Not everyone in the Air Force is a pilot. Such ignorance deserves an ass kickin' (children are exempt).</p>
<p>7.) Roseanne Barr's singing of the National Anthem is not a blooper...it was a disgrace and disrespectful. Laugh, and sooner or later your ass will be kicked.</p>
<p>8.) Next time Old Glory prances by during a parade, get on your damn feet and pay homage to her by placing your hand over your heart. Quietly thank the military member or veteran lucky enough to be carrying her...... of course, failure to do either of those could earn you a severe ass kicking.</p>
<p>9.) What Jane Fonda did during the Vietnam War makes her the enemy. The proper word to describe her is ""traitor."" Just mention her nomination for ""Woman of the Year"" and get your ass kicked.</p>
<p>10.) Don't try to discuss politics with a military member or a veteran. We are Americans and we all bleed the same regardless of our party affiliation. Our Chain of Command, is to include our commander in Chief. The President (for those who didn't know) is our CIC regardless of political party. We have no inside track on what happens inside those big important buildings where all those ""representatives"" meet. All we know is that when those civilian Representatives screw up the situation, they call upon the military to go straighten it out. The military member might direct you to Oliver North. (I can see him kicking your ass already.)</p>
<p>11.) ""Your mama wears combat boots"" never made sense to me...stop saying it! If she did, she would most likely be a vet and probably kick your ass!</p>
<p>12.) Bin Laden and the Taliban are not communists, so stop saying ""Let's go kill those Commie's!!!"" And stop asking us where he is!!!! Crystal balls are not standard issue in the military. That reminds me...if you see anyone calling those damn psychic phone numbers, let me know, so I can go kick their ass.</p>
<p>13.) Bus Driver, Jar Head, Grunt, Swabbie etc, are terms of endearment we use describing each other. Unless you are a service member or vet, you have not earned the right to use them. It could get your ass kicked.</p>
<p>14.) Last but not least, whether or not you become a member of the military, support our troops and their families. Every Thanksgiving and religious holiday that you enjoy with family and friends please remember that there are, literally, thousands of troops overseas wishing they could be with their families. Thank God for our military and the sacrifices they make every day. Without them, our country would get its ass kicked.</p>

<p>The next day, the doctor decided to call and check up on her and<br /> her husband. Their son answered.</p>

51038,"<p>This guy just got fired and was feeling very down-and-out. He<br /> was walking down the street when he noticed a whore house he had<br /> never seen before. So he decided to do something fun for<br /> himself. He walked inside, went strait to the front desk,<br /> slapped the $200 he had left in his wallet down, and said, ""Give<br /> the best thing you've got""</p>
<p>""Well,"" said the clerk, ""the best thing we got is right over<br /> there, behind that door. You go in there and you'll see a duck,<br /> and it gives the greatest head you've ever gotten, guarunteed. I<br /> got a petition  back here signed by some guys who've had it<br /> saying it is.""</p>
<p>This seemed strange, but the guy was so depressed he would've<br /> tried anything. When he got inside it was all black, except for<br /> one light shining on a duck walking towards him. The duck<br /> proceeded to give the man the best head he had ever had in his<br /> entire life. </p>
<p>The next day the guy was feeling one-hundered percent better<br /> from the day before. He was giving smiles to everyone, and<br /> occasionally just hugged a complete stranger. He went to the<br /> bank and took out two hundred dollars. Then he went back to the<br /> whore house and said, ""I'd like to sign that petition about the<br /> duck please."" When he was done with that he asked the clerk,<br /> ""Could I get head from the duck again?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" the clerk said, ""the duck's off for today, but what i<br /> can do for, for another $200, is send you into that room over<br /> there where you can watch a guy get fucked by a dog.""</p>
<p>The man thought for a minute, then decided that if duck was<br /> good, this had to be good as well. He payed the clerk and went<br /> into the room. Inside there were about 7 other guys sitting and<br /> waiting. He sat down next to a big fat guy with a red face. The<br /> a light came on and there was a dog fucking a man inside a<br /> little room. It was the most hillarious thing he had ever seen.<br /> He sat there laughing with the other guys until, finaly, it was<br /> over. </p>
<p>As they got up to leave the guy turned to the red-faced man and<br /> said, ""That was great. The best show I've ever seen.""</p>
<p>The red faced guy turned to him and said, ""Ahhh, you should've<br /> been here yesterday....some guy got head from a duck.""</p>

<p>""Well,"" said the woman, ""I like to be... Ohh... Ah... Ummm... I'm sorry doctor, but I'm too ashamed to talk about it.""</p>

<p>So the woman again tried to explain, but got so embarrassed that she just turned bright red and looked as though she might faint. It was then the doctor had a bright idea.</p>
<p>""Look,"" he said, ""I'm a bit of a pervert myself. So if you show me what your perversion is, I'll show you what mine is. Okay? Is it a deal?""</p>
<p>The woman considered the offer and after a short while agreed that it was a fair request. So after a slight pause, she said, ""Well my perversion is... My perversion... Oh... I like to be kissed on the bottom!""</p>
<p>""Shit, is that ALL!"" said the doctor. ""Look, go behind that screen, take all your clothes off, and I'll come round and show you what MY perversion is! Hee Hee!""</p>
<p>So the woman does as she is told and undresses behind the screen. She gets down on all fours thinking to herself, ""Hmmmm, perhaps he might kiss me on the bum.""</p>
<p>Anyway, five minutes pass and nothing has happened. So the woman peers around the side of the screen to see the doctor sitting behind his desk, his feet up on the table, reading a newspaper and whistling to himself. ""Hey!"" shouted the woman, ""I thought you said you were a pervert?""</p>
<p>""Oh I am,"" said the doctor, ""I've just shit in your handbag!""</p>

51042,"<p>Day 1. </p>
<p>Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to celebrate. When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, he locked himself in the bathroom and cried. </p>
<p>Day 2. </p>
<p>Today, he says he has a big secret to tell me. He's impotent, he says, and he wants me to be the first to know. Why doesn't he tell me something I don't know! I mean, he actually thinks I haven't noticed. </p>
<p>Day 3. </p>
<p>This marriage is in trouble. A woman has needs. Yesterday, I saw a picture of the Washington Monument and burst into tears. </p>
<p>Day 4. </p>
<p>A miracle has happened! There's a new drug on the market that will fix his problem. It's called Viagra. I told him that if he takes Viagra things will be just like they were on our wedding night. I think this will work. I replaced his Prozac with the Viagra, hoping to lift something other than his mood. </p>
<p>Day 5. </p>
<p>What absolute bliss!!. </p>
<p>Day 6. </p>
<p>Isn't life wonderful but it's difficult to write while he's doing that. </p>
<p>Day 7. </p>
<p>This Viagra thing has gone to his head. No pun intended! Yesterday, at Burger King, the manager asked me if I'd like a Whopper. He thought they were talking about him. But, I have to admit it's very nice - I don't think I've ever been so happy. </p>
<p>Day 8. </p>
<p>I think he took too many over the weekend. Yesterday, instead of mowing the lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed wacker. I'm also getting a bit sore down there. </p>
<p>Day 9. </p>
<p>No time to write. He might catch me. </p>
<p>Day 10. </p>
<p>Okay, I admit it. I'm hiding. I mean, a girl can only take so much. And to make matters worse, he's washing the Viagra down with whip cream and whisky! What am I going to do? I feel tacky all over.... </p>
<p>Day 11. </p>
<p>I'm basically being screwed to death. It's like living with a Black and Decker drill. I woke up this morning hot-glued to the bed. Even my armpits hurt. He's a complete pig. </p>
<p>Day 12. </p>
<p>I wish he was gay. I've stopped wearing make-up, cleaning my teeth or even washing but he still keeps coming after me! Even yawning has become dangerous ... </p>
<p>Day 13. </p>
<p>Every time I shut my eyes, there's a sneak attack! It's like going to bed with a scud missile. I can hardly walk and if he tries that ""Oops, sorry"", thing again, I'll kill the *******. </p>
<p>Day 14. </p>
<p>I've done everything to turn him off. Nothing is working. I even started dressing like a nun but this just seems to make him hornier. Help me. </p>
<p>Day 15. </p>
<p>I think I'll have to kill him. The cat and dog won't go near him and our friends don't come over any more. Last night I told him to go and f... himself and he did. </p>
<p>Day 16. </p>
<p>The ******* has started to complain about headaches. I hope the bloody thing explodes. I did suggest he might try stopping the Viagra and going back on Prozac. </p>
<p>Day 17. </p>
<p>Switched the pills but it doesn't seem to have made any difference... Christ! Here he comes again! </p>
<p>Day 18. </p>
<p>He's back on Prozac. The lazy sod just sits there in front of the telly all day with that remote control in his hand and expects me to do everything for him. What absolute bliss!</p>

51043,"<p>At a posh Las Vegas casino, a blackjack dealer and a player with a 13 count in his hand are arguing about whether or not it is appropriate to tip the dealer.</p>
<p>The player says, ""When I get bad cards, it's not the dealer's fault. Accordingly, when I get good cards, the dealer obviously has nothing to do with that either, so why should I tip him?""</p>
<p>The dealer replies, ""When you eat at a restaurant do you tip the waiter?""</p>
<p>""Yes,"" the gambler concedes.</p>
<p>""Well then, he serves you food; whether it's good or bad isn't up to him. By the same token, I'm serving you cards, so you should tip me.""</p>
<p>""OK,"" says the gambler, ""but the waiter gives me what I ask for. I'll take an 8.""</p>

51044,"<p>'Newbie computer user questions'1. Compaq is considering changing the command 'Press Any Key' to 'Press Return Key' because of the many calls asking where the 'Any' key is.2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was hard to control with the dust cover on.  The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old diskettes.  After trouble- shooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer labeled the diskettes by rolling them into a typewriter to type on them.4.  Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective diskettes.  A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along with xeroxed copies of the floppies.5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door.  The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was then heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room.6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything.  After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the technician discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the 'send' key.7. Another Dell customer needed help setting up a new program, so a Dell tech suggested he go to the local Egghead.  'Yea, I got me a couple of friends,' the customer replied.  When told 'Egghead' was a software store, the man said, 'Oh, I thought you meant for me to find a couple of geeks.'8. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer worked.  He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them individually.9. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged because his computer had told him he was 'bad and an invalid'.  The tech explained that the computer's 'bad command' and 'invalid' responses shouldn't be taken personally.10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get her new Dell Computer to turn on.  After ensuring that the computer was plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button.  Her response, 'I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens.'  The 'foot pedal' turned out to be the computer's mouse.11. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand-new computer wouldn't work.  She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in, and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen.  When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she asked 'What power switch?'12. True story from Novell NetWire SysOp:Caller:  'Hello, is this Tech Support?'Tech:  'Yes, it is. How may I help you?'Caller:  'The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my warranty period.  How do I go about getting that fixed?'Tech:  'I'm sorry, but did you say a 'cup holder'?Caller:  'Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer.'Tech: 'Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped; it's because I am.  Did you receive this as part of a promotion, like at a trade show?  How did you get this cup holder?  Does it have any trademark on it?'Caller: 'It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a promotional.  It just has '4X' on it.'At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't stand it.  The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive!!Another well-known one that I can add is the true tale of the user who called up complaining that the instructions said to load the four diskettes into 'Drive A' but he couldn't possibly get more than two in.</p>

51073,"<p>Leaders of the Evangelical Laodicean Church in America last week<br /> announced the publication of a new hymnal. ""This is truly a<br /> hymnal for the new century,"" said Presiding Bishop Luke W. Armm.</p>
<p>""This collection of hymns really captures the essence of our<br /> tradition,"" Bishop Armm explained. ""At the core of our belief is<br /> the motto, 'Moderation in all things,' and that applies to our<br /> faith life as well. We just don't like to get carried away.""</p>
<p>When asked if the new hymnal will help the Laodicean Church<br /> attract new members, Bishop Armm replied, ""Yeah, sure. You<br /> Betcha! People in today's society get kind of uncomfortable with<br /> too much talk about things like commitment and dedication.<br /> They'd much rather have a religion that they can turn on or off<br /> at will. Our church seeks to pander--uh...I mean--meet that<br /> need. This hymnal will help with that, I think.""</p>
<p>Editor in chief of the new hymnal, Priscilla (""Presh"") S.<br /> Moment, explained some of the difficulty the committee had in<br /> choosing hymns. ""Many of the old favorites just won't cut it<br /> among Laodiceans,"" said Moment. ""We had to change a lot of the<br /> wording to make them fit with our style. We tried to incorporate<br /> some new songs into the book, but we had trouble finding<br /> Laodiceans interested in writing new music. Oh, well!""</p>
<p>The title of the new hymnal, Church Songs, was chosen very<br /> carefully, explained Moment. ""We didn't want to turn anybody off<br /> with threatening words that no one understands any more like<br /> 'Worship' or 'Hymn.'""</p>

"
51075,"<p>It was a starry night and the snowflakes drifted down gently.<br /> The snowcrust sparkled in the lamplight at the North Pole.<br /> Sleigh bells jingled in the distance. It was supposed to be a<br /> happy time, but it wasn't.</p>
<p>Santa was really pissed off. It was Christmas Eve and NOTHING<br /> was going right. Mrs. Claus had burned all the Christmas<br /> cookies. The elves were bitching about not getting paid for the<br /> overtime they had put in while making toys. And to top it all<br /> off, the reindeer had been drinking all afternoon and were<br /> completely useless. They had taken the sleigh out for a spin<br /> earlier in the day and crashed it into a tree, breaking off one<br /> of the runners. They were still stumbling around outside,<br /> giggling and shaking their sleigh bells. Santa was redder than<br /> usual with anger. He drank another slug of scotch, and then<br /> bellowed, ""I CAN'T believe it! I've got to deliver millions of<br /> presents all over the world in just a few hours from now and all<br /> my reindeer are drunk, my elves are on strike and I don't even<br /> have a Christmas tree! AND I sent that stupid little angel out<br /> HOURS ago to find a tree and he isn't even back yet! What the<br /> HELL am I going to do?""</p>
<p>Just at that moment, the little angel opened the front door and<br /> stepped in from the snowy night, dragging a Christmas tree<br /> behind him. He said, ""Yo, Santa, where do you want me to stick<br /> the Christmas Tree this year?"" And thus the tradition of angels<br /> perched atop the Christmas trees came to pass.</p>

51088,"<p>The media, both entertainment and news, have grotesquely skewed the public image of women who choose to responsibly own firearms for self-defense.  Unfortunately, constant exposure to public image can affect self-image.  That can be dangerous, whether the result is a woman who becomes anorexic or a woman who allows herself to be talked out of exercising her absolute right to effective personal protection.</p>
<p>This Armed Woman's Attitude Test is offered in the hopes of putting some of the false images into a proper perspective.  Please circle A, B, or C in answer to each question.</p>
<p>  What is the real meaning of that pink T-shirt with a revolver on it   that says, ""The ultimate in feminine protection?""<br />     A. Obviously a plot by seditious gun fanatics from the NRA.<br />     B. Ultimate force equals ultimate personal protection.<br />     C. A 9mm for ""light days"" and a .44 Magnum for ""heavy days.</p>
<p>  For rape and assault prevention, a whistle is:<br />     A. All you'll ever need.<br />     B. Next to useless with nothing to back it up.<br />     C. The signal to ""Fire!""</p>
<p>  The movie _Thelma_&amp;_Louise_ was:<br />     A. An insidious Hollywood plot to stamp out femininity and glorify mindless violence by women.<br />     B. A female buddy film that included allegories of empowerment.<br />     C. A training film.</p>
<p>What was technically wrong with the scene in Thelma &amp; Louise where  the two women disarmed a Texas State Police Officer.<br />     A. Real women would never do anything as tacky, tasteless, and altogether gauche as pointing guns at a man, let alone taking his icky, disgusting gun for their own use.<br />     B. There is no Texas State Police per se, but rather a Department of Public Safety that includes a Highway Patrol; they do not authorize the .45 1911 auto for carry except by Texas Rangers; the ammo on the officer's belt was revolver cartridges in single loops, not appropriate auto pistol ammo in magazines.<br />     C. The dumb broads left a perfectly good shotgun clamped to the dashboards of the cruiser.</p>
<p>  A mouse runs across the kitchen floor.  The proper response it to:<br />     A. Climb onto a high stool and scream for a man to help you.<br />     B. Call the exterminator.<br />     C. Link up the belt feed to the M-60.</p>
<p>You are discussing the depressing local crime statistics with your good-hearted neighbor, Ralph, who suggests that you buy a .25 caliber pistol for home defense.  You reply:<br />     A. ""Never! A woman who buys a gun has humiliatingly surrendered to the evil ethos of mindless macho sexist brute force!""<br />     B. ""An amusing suggestion, Ralph, but don't you think it's a little light for the purpose?""<br />     C. ""Only to plant in the dead hand of the next little weasel stupid enough to give me wimpy advice like that!""</p>
<p>  What is your reaction to the concept of a bra holster?<br />     A. ""Yeech!  It would be an obscene juxtaposition of the icon of death with the symbol of nurturing!""<br />     B. ""Uncomfortable and impractical, designed by males for females.""<br />     C. ""Not a bad idea, so long as it doesn't get in the way when you reach for the MAC-10 sub-machinegun in your shoulder sling.""</p>
<p>  Define ""male.""<br />     A. The first syllable of ""malevolance,"" which in turn is only one letter short of ""male violence.""<br />     B. An individual of the opposite sex.<br />     C. A quaint anachronism, once useful for protection of females, but rendered obsolete by contemporary firepower.</p>
<p>  Where, in the scheme of things defensive, do such spray products as Mace and CapStun belong?<br />     A. Nowhere!  If you just show your attacker compassion and understanding, you won't need nasty things like that.<br />     B. At the lower-threat levels of the Use of Force Continuum.<br />     C. In the medicine cabinet; real women use mace instead of Feminique.</p>
<p>  You are cornered in your home by a knife-wielding intruder.  He ignores your command to halt, and charges you with the knife upraised.  How many shots should you fire?<br />     A. None.  It would be better to die than sacrifice moral victory by using ""his"" kind of force.<br />     B. As many shots as are necessary to stop the attack.<br />     C. A minimum of fifty shots.  Hey, when is the next time you'll get a chance like this to express yourself, and get in touch with your feelings?</p>

<p>     If 8 or more (80 %) of your answers were ""A,"" it is time to check into a Reality Clinic.  Perhaps the meek will inherit the earth, but only when the rest of us are done with it.</p>

<p>      If 8 or more of your answers were ""C,"" don't feel too bad.  Society may not have a place for you, but Hollywood will, as soon as they start casting for the lead role in _Bride_of_Rambo_.</p>

<p>    If A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X<br />     Y Z<br />     can be represented as:<br />     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20<br />     21 22 23 24 25 26<br />     Then,<br />     H A R D W O R K<br />     8 1 18 4 23 15 18 11 = 98% only<br />     K N O W L E D G E<br />     11 14 15 23 12 5 4 7 5 = 96% only </p>
<p>    But, </p>
<p>    A T T I T U D E<br />     1 20 20 9 20 21 4 5 = 100 %<br />     However,<br />     B U L L S H I T<br />     2 21 12 12 19 8 9 20 = 103%<br />     It stands to reason that hardwork and knowledge<br />     will get you close, but<br />     attitude and bullshit will put you over the top!</p>

51115,"<p>Three women escaped from prison. One was a redhead, one a brunette, and one a blonde. They ran for miles until they came upon an old barn where they decided to hide in the hayloft and rest. When they climbed up, they found three large gunnysacks and decided to climb into them for camouflage. </p>
<p>About an hour later the sheriff and his deputy came into the barn. The sheriff told his deputy to go up and check out the hayloft. When he got up there the sheriff asked him what he saw and the deputy yelled back, ""Just three gunnysacks."" </p>
<p>The sheriff told him to find out what was in them, so the deputy kicked the first sack, which had the redhead in it. She went, ""Bow-wow"", so the deputy told the sheriff there was a dog in it. </p>
<p>Then he kicked the sack with the brunette in it. She went, ""Meow"", so the deputy told the sheriff there was a cat in it. </p>
<p>Then he kicked the one with the blonde in it, and there was no sound at all. So he kicked it again, and finally the blonde said, ""Potatoes"".</p>
"
51116,"<p>And the Lord spoke to Noah and said, ""In six months I'm going to make it<br /> rain until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people<br /> are destroyed. But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind<br /> of living thing on the planet. I am commanding you to build an Ark."" And<br /> in a flash of lightning, He delivered the specifications for an Ark. </p>
<p>""Okay,"" said Noah, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints.<br /> Six months passed, the skies clouded up and rain began to fall. The Lord<br /> saw that there was no Ark. </p>
<p>""Noah,"" shouted the Lord, ""Where is the Ark?"" </p>
<p>""Lord, please forgive me!"" begged Noah. ""I did my best. But there were big<br /> problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction<br /> project, and your plans didn't meet code. So I had to hire an engineer to<br /> redraw the plans.""</p>
<p>""Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark needed a fire<br /> sprinkler system. ""</p>
<p>""Then my neighbor objected, claiming I was violating zoning by building<br /> the Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city<br /> planning commission.""</p>
<p>""Then I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark, because there was a<br /> ban on cutting trees to save the Spotted Owl. I had to convince the U.S.<br /> Fish and Wildlife that I need the wood to save the owls. But they wouldn't<br /> let me catch any owls. So, no owls.""</p>
<p>""The carpenters formed a union and went out on strike. I had to negotiate<br /> a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board before anyone would<br /> pick up a saw or hammer. Now we have sixteen carpenters going on the boat,<br /> and still no owls.""</p>
<p>""Just when I got the suit dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn't<br /> complete the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your<br /> proposed flood. They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no<br /> jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being.""</p>
<p>""Then the Army Corp of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed new flood<br /> plain. I sent them a globe. The IRS has seized all my assets, claiming I'm<br /> trying to avoid paying taxes by leaving the country.""</p>
<p>""I really don't think I can finish the Ark for at least another five<br /> years,"" The sky began to clear. The sun began to shine. A rainbow arched<br /> across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled. </p>
<p>""You mean you're not going to destroy the earth?"" Noah asked hopefully. </p>
<p>""No,"" said the Lord sadly. ""The government already has.""</p>

51141,"<p>One day, Bob asked a beautiful girl out. Her name was Tammy. He<br /> asked her if she wanted to go to the drive-in movie. She said<br /> ""sure"". Bob was really excited, so when he got home he told his<br /> Mom and asked her if she could make him a can of beans. Bob was<br /> in so much of a rush that he gulped down the beans, got changed,<br /> had a shower, an hour before he had to go pick her up.</p>
<p>Anyway, he finally left to go pick her up. She got in the car<br /> and away they went. They started watching the movie and Bob all<br /> of a sudden had a terrible cramp and he needed to fart. ""Shit!""<br /> he said to himself. ""I need to fart but I can't because I'm with<br /> a beautiful girl and, and, oh shit!""</p>
<p>He thought that he could just wait until the intermission to go<br /> to the washroom. Finally it was intermission and he asked Tammy<br /> if she would like some pop and popcorn. She said sure.</p>
<p>He got to the washroom, opened the door and saw a big line up.<br /> ""Fuck!"" he said. I guess I'll wait until the end of the movie.<br /> He went back to the car and covered his stomach.</p>
<p>Finally, it was the end of the movie. He said to Tammy that<br /> he'll be right back, he has just got to go to the washroom. He<br /> got there, opened the door and there was still a big line up.<br /> ""Damn! I guess I'll wait until after I drop her off.""</p>
<p>So they're driving home and Bob's intestines are about to<br /> explode. They pulled up in Tammy's driveway and Tammy said, ""Oh!<br /> My Grandparents are here, come in and say hello.""</p>
<p>Bob thinks to himself, ""Damn! I need to fart but I have to go<br /> in."" So he said ""Okay"". They are all sitting down at the dinner<br /> table and Bob is about to explode. He says to himself, ""I've<br /> really got to fart so I'll just let a little bit go at a time.""<br /> Meanwhile the dog, Duke, is sitting right beside him. ""Bllllght!""</p>
<p>Tammy's father said ""Duke!"" and sat back down.</p>
<p>""Oh my God! They think it's the dog!""</p>
<p>""Bllllght!""</p>

<p>St. Peter agreed to be his guide. </p>
<p>Since Bill had been such an important person on earth, St. Peter decided to allow him to make a choice between Heaven and Hell. </p>
<p>So Bill was first escorted to a tour of Hell, it was not at all what he expected. </p>
<p>It was actually a pleasant spot, with good food, wine, and music, entertainment, beautiful women an all around very fine place. </p>
<p>St. Peter and Bill then toured Heaven; again Bill was surprised it was a stark and dreary place, very simple and pastoral with only very basic amenities.</p>
<p>Bill was not impressed, and so he chose Hell as his preferred destination.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, St Peter paid a visit to Hell to check in on Bill. </p>
<p>Bill was extremely unhappy, tied up to a post with flames all around him, burning, hungry, and scared. </p>
<p>He called out to St. Peter, ""Hey, this is not what I expected! What went wrong? How could I have made such a mistake?"" </p>
<p>St. Peter listened patiently and then replied, ""Bill, I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, but what you first saw was only a demo!""</p>

51169,"<p>According to a news report, a certain private school in Washington recently<br /> was faced with a unique problem. A number of 12-year-old girls were beginning to<br /> use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom.<br /> That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their<br /> lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints. </p>
<p>Every night, the maintenance man would remove them and the next day, the girls<br /> would put them back. Finally the principal decided that something had to be<br /> done. She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the<br /> maintenance man. She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major<br /> problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night. </p>
<p>To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she asked the<br /> maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required. He took out a<br /> long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the mirror with it.<br /> Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirror. </p>

51172,"<p>Jane was a first time contestant on the $65,000 quiz show. Lady<br /> luck had smiled in her favor, as Jane had a gained substantial<br /> lead over her opponents. She even managed to win the game but,<br /> unfortunately, time had run out before the show's host could ask<br /> her the big question.</p>
<p>Jane agreed to return the following day. Jane was nervous as her<br /> husband drove them home. ""I've just gotta win tomorrow. I wish I<br /> knew what the answers are! You know I'm not going to sleep at<br /> all tonight. I will probably look like garbage tomorrow.</p>
<p>""Relax honey,"" her husband, Roger, reassured her, ""It will all<br /> be OK.""</p>
<p>Ten minutes after they arrived home, Roger grabbed the car keys<br /> and started heading out the door. ""Where are you going?"" Jane<br /> asked.</p>
<p>""I have a little errand to run. I should be back soon.""</p>
<p>After an agonizing 3 hour absence, Roger returned, sporting a<br /> very wide and wicked grin. ""Honey, I managed to get tomorrow's<br /> question and answer!""</p>
<p>""What is it?"" she cried excitedly.</p>
<p>""OK. The question is 'What are the three main parts of the male<br /> anatomy?' And the answer is 'The head, the heart, and the<br /> penis.'"" The couple went to sleep with Jane, now feeling at<br /> ease, plummeting into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>At 3:30 a.m., however, Jane was shaken awake by Roger, who was<br /> asking her the quiz show question. ""The head, the heart, and the<br /> penis,"" Jane replied groggily before returning to sleep. And<br /> Roger asked her again in the</p>
<p>morning, this time as Jane was brushing her teeth. Once again,<br /> Jane replied correctly.</p>
<p>So it was that Jane was once again on the set of the quiz show.<br /> Even though she knew the question and answer, she could feel<br /> butterflies. The cameras began running and the host, after<br /> reminding the audience of the previous days' events, faced Jane<br /> and asked the big question.</p>
<p>""Jane, for $65,000, what are the main parts of the male anatomy?<br /> You have 10 seconds.""</p>
<p>""Hmm, uhm, the head?"" she said nervously.</p>
<p>""Very good. Six seconds.""</p>
<p>""Eh, uh, the heart?""</p>
<p>""Very good! Four seconds.""</p>
<p>""I, uhh, ooooooohh, darn! My husband drilled it into me last<br /> night and I had it on the tip of my tongue this morning...""</p>
<p>""That's close enough!"" said the game show host,<br /> ""CONGRATULATIONS!!""</p>

51179,"<p>Extract from an Australian Mills &amp; Boon (one of those romance books)We met in a secluded field, the sun nearly kissing the evening horizon. The warm breeze was full of that earthly, musky scent that only those fortunate enough to live outside the urban rat race know, and quiet whispering of the leaves in the Weeping Willow overhead added the final touch to the most romantic scene.We lay there, both naked, I knew I had to have her and have her now. Without a word being spoken, I managed to move myself to a position of dominance. I could feel instantly that this was what she had been waiting for as she frantically thrust her pelvis at my approaching organ.I moved slowly at first, inch by inch, until I was fully inside her. Then as tension rose, we began the ultimate in sex. Although inexperienced, she approached every change of position with enthusiasm, moaning with despair every time I withdrew to prevent myself from ending it all too soon.As sexual tension heightened towards the inevitable mind-blowing climax, it was all I could do to hold out until the moment we had been both waiting for was upon us. As it did we rolled together in thenow damp grass. As the last deep orange glow of the long set sun meltedinto the darkness of approaching night, as we lay there still entwined in an amorous embrace, I kissed her long and loving and whispered how good she had been, she tenderly and sensuously licked my inner ear and whispered:""Baaaa"", then re-joined the flock.</p>

51195,"<p>There once was this boy and he always got into trouble. One day<br /> he and his mother were shopping and he saw this bicycle that he<br /> fell in love with. He asked his mother if she would buy it for<br /> him and she said that if he became a good boy that she would.</p>
<p>The boy then goes home and writes a letter to Jesus saying: Dear<br /> Jesus, I really want this bicycle. If you let me have the<br /> bicycle I will be a good boy for a whole year. The boy then<br /> folds the letter and puts it in his pocket.</p>
<p>He goes outside for a walk and finds his dad taking in the<br /> groceries. All of a sudden, his dad trips on the roller skate he<br /> was supposed to put away. His dad starts to yell at him and the<br /> boy goes back inside and crosses out the letter. He rewrites it<br /> saying: Dear Jesus, if you let me have the bicycle that I really<br /> want, I will be good for one month.</p>
<p>Then he walks into his sisters room and starts to doodle on some<br /> note paper. When his sister comes home, she begins to yell at<br /> him saying that the notepaper he was writing on was her report<br /> that was due the next day. He tries to apologize but she<br /> wouldn't listen.</p>
<p>He goes goes into the kichen and rewrites the letter this time<br /> saying: Dear Jesus, if I can have that bicycle I will be a good<br /> boy for a day.</p>
<p>Right when he finishes the letter, his mother screams from the<br /> other end of the house saying that he forgot to clean his room.<br /> He had been too preoccupied with trying to be good that he had<br /> forgotten.</p>
<p>He has lost hope. He tip-toes into his mother's room and<br /> carefully takes the statue of the Holy Mary off her drawer. He<br /> wraps it in a towel and gently takes it into his room. He places<br /> it in his bottom drawer and takes out the letter and rewrites it<br /> for the last time saying: Dear Jesus, if you ever want to see<br /> your mother again...</p>

51196,"<p>My friend Jim is a pretty wild and<br /> crazy guy who sometimes gets bored<br /> and has to dream up new and exiting ways to get his kicks.<br /> One afternoon, Jim put a frog in his shirt pocket and walked into a<br /> local drinking establishment.  The cocktail waitress came over and asked<br /> him what he would like to drink.  After taking his order, the waitress<br /> said, ""Hey, what's with the frog in your pocket?""<br /> Jim said, ""Oh, the frog eats pussy.""<br /> The waitress just smiled and got Jim his drink.  About 15 minutes later,<br /> the waitress came over and asked Jim if she could borrow his frog for a<br /> while.  Jim said sure, and the waitress hurried off to the back room with<br /> the frog.  A half hour or so passed, and Jim figured he better go check up<br /> on his frog.  He walked into the back room to find the waitress lying down<br /> on a table in the appropriate position, with the frog in the appropriate<br /> place, and everything else quite appropriate (use your imagination).<br /> The waitress said, ""Hey mister, this frog doesn't do anything.""<br /> Jim said, ""Get out of the way frog, now this is the last time I am going to<br /> show you how to do this.""</p>

51199,"<p>Two weeks ago was my 44th birthday and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning. I went down to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say ""Happy Birthday"" and probably have a present for me. She didn't even say ""Good Morning"", let alone any ""Happy Birthday."" I thought, ""Well, that's wives for you. The children will remember. ""The children came down to breakfast and didn't say a word.</p>
<p>When I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet said, ""Good Morning, Boss, Happy Birthday."" I felt a little better. Someone had remembered. I worked until noon, then Janet knocked on my door and said, ""You know it is such a beautiful day outside and it is your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me."" I said, ""By George, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go.</p>
<p>We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go. We went out into the country to a little private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. On the way back to the office, she said, ""You know, it is such a beautiful day, we don't need to go back to the office, do we?"" I said, ""No, I guess not."" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment.""</p>
<p>After arriving at her apartment she said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable. Sure,"" I excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes she came out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my wife, children and dozens of our friends. They were all singing Happy Birthday.......and there I sat on the couch.......naked.</p>

At a kennel specialising in Christian trained pets, they found a dog they liked quite a lot. When they asked the dog to fetch the Bible, he did it in a flash.When they instructed him to look up Psalm 23, he complied equally fast, using his paws with dexterity. They were impressed, purchased the animal, and went home. That night they had friends over. They were so proud of their new dog and his major skills, that they called the dog over and had him show off his Bible fetching ability.The friends were very impressed, and asked whether the dog was able to do any of the usual dog tricks, as well. This stopped the couple cold, as they hadn't thought about ""normal"" tricks. Well, they said, ""let's try this out.""Once more they called the dog, and they clearly pronounced the command, ""Heel!""Quick as a wink, the dog jumped up, put his paw on the man's forehead, closed his eyes in concentration, and bowed his head.</p>

51235,"<p>IT'S A WONDERFUL MACHINE The Sweetest Christmas Movie Frank Capra Never Made  -- by David PogueI guess I shouldn't have gone to a party where the eggnog was spiked, and maybe I shouldn't have watched the movie It's a Wonderful Life while leafing through MacWeek. But anyway, I had the weirdest dream last night -- like a bizarre black-and-white movie that went like this: Jimmy Stewart stars as Steve 'Jobs' Bailey, who runs a beleaguered but beloved small-town computer company. For years, big monopolist Bill 'Gates' Potter has been wielding his power and money to gain control of the town. And for years, Steve has fought for survival: 'This town needs my measly, one-horse computer, if only to have something for people to use instead of Windows!'But now an angry mob is banging on Apple's front door, panicking. 'The press says your company is doomed!' yells one man. 'You killed the clones! We're going to Windows!' calls another. 'We want out of our investment!' they shout.Steve, a master showman, calms them. 'Don't do it! If Potter gets complete control of the desktop, you'll be forced to buy his bloatware and pay for his cruddy upgrades forever! We can get through this, but we've got to have faith and stick together!' The crowd decides to give him one more chance.But the day before Christmas, something terrible happens: On his way to the bank, the company's financial man, Uncle Gilly, somehow manages to lose $1.7 billion. With eyes flashing, Steve grabs the befuddled Gilly by the lapels. 'Where's that money, you stupid old fool? Don't you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal! Get out of my company -- and don't come back!'Desperate and afraid, Steve heads to Martini's, a local Internet cafe, and drowns his sorrows in an iced cappuccino. Surfing the Web at one of the cafe's Macs, all he finds online is second-guessing, sniping by critics, and terrible market-share numbers.As a blizzard rages, Steve drives his car crazily toward the river. 'Oh, what's the use?!' he exclaims. 'We've lost the war. Windows rules the world. After everything I've worked for, the Mac is going to be obliterated! Think of all the passion and effort these last 15 years -- wasted! Think of the billions of dollars, hundreds of companies, millions of people....' He stands on the bridge, staring at the freezing, roiling river below -- and finally hurls himself over the &gt;railing.After a moment of floundering in the chilly water, however, he's pulled to safety by a bulbous-nosed oddball. 'Who are you?!' Steve splutters angrily.'Name's Clarence -- I mean Claris,' says the guy. 'I'm your guardian &gt;angel. I've been sent down to help you -- it's my last chance to earn my &gt;wings.''Nobody can help me,' says Steve bitterly. 'If I hadn't created the Mac, everybody'd be a lot happier: Mr. Potter, the media, even our customers. Hell, we'd all be better off if the Mac had never been invented at all!'Music swirls. The wind howls. The tattoo on Steve's right buttock -- Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story -- vanishes. Steve pats the empty pocket where he usually carries his Newton. 'What gives?''You've got your wish,' says Claris. 'You never invented the Mac. It never existed. You haven't a care in the world.''Look, little fella, go off and haunt somebody else,' Steve mutters. He heads over to Martini's Internet cafe for a good stiff drink. But he's shocked at the difference inside. 'My God, look at the people using these computers! Both of them -- they look like math professors!''They are,' says Claris.'What is this, a museum? It looks like those computers are running DOS!''Good eye!' says Claris. 'DOS version 25.01, in fact -- the very latest.''I don't get it,' Steve says.'DOS is a lot better and faster these days, but it hasn't occurred to anybody to market a computer with icons and menus yet. There's no such thing as Windows -- after all, there never was a Mac interface for &gt;Microsoft to copy.''But this equipment is ancient!' Steve exclaims. 'No sound, no CD-ROM drive, not even 3.5-inch floppies!''Those aren't antiques!' Claris says. 'They're state-of-the-art Compaqs, complete with the latest 12X, 5-inch-floppy drives. Don't forget, Steve: The Mac introduced and standardized all that good stuff you named.''But that's nuts!' Steve explodes. 'You mean to tell me that the 46 percent of American households with computers are all using DOS?''Correction: All 9 percent of American households,' says Claris cheerfully.  'Without a graphic interface, computers are still too complicated to be popular.''Bartender!' shouts Steve. 'You don't have a copy of Wired here, do you? I've got to read up on this crazy reality!'The bartender glares. 'I don't know what you're wired on, pal, but either stop talking crazy or get outta my shop.''No such thing as Wired,' whispers Claris. 'Never was. Before you wished the Mac away, most magazines were produced entirely on the Mac. Besides, Wired would be awfully thin without the Web.''Without the -- now, wait just a minute!' Horrified, Steve rushes over to one of the PCs and connects to the Internet. 'You call this the Net? It looks like a text-only BBS -- and there's practically nobody online! &gt;Where's Navigator? Where's Internet Explorer? Where's the Web, for Pete's &gt;sake?''Oh, I see,' Claris smiles sympathetically. 'You must be referring to all those technologies that spun off from the concept of a graphic interface. Look, Steve. Until the Mac made the mouse standard, there was no such thing as point and click. And without clicking, there could be no Web... and no Web companies. Believe it or not, Marc Andreesen works in a Burger King in Cincinnati.'Steve scoffs. 'Well, look, if you apply that logic, then PageMaker wouldn't exist either. Photoshop, Illustrator, FreeHand, America Online, digital movies -- all that stuff began life on the Mac.''You're getting it,' Claris says. He holds up a copy of Time magazine. 'Check out the cover price.' Steve gasps. 'Eight bucks? They've got a lot of nerve!''Labor costs. They're still pasting type onto master pages with hot wax.''You're crazy!' screams Steve. 'I'm going back to my office at Apple!' He drives like a madman back to Cupertino--but the sign that greets him there doesn't say, 'Welcome to Apple.' It says, 'Welcome to Microsoft South.''Sorry, Steve; Apple went out of business in 1985,' says Claris. 'You see, you really did have a wonderful machine! See what a mistake it was to wish it away?'Steve is sobbing, barely listening. 'OK, then -- I'll go to my office at Pixar!''You don't have an office at Pixar,' Claris reminds him. 'There was no Mac to make you rich enough to buy Pixar!'Steve has had enough. He rushes desperately back to the icy bridge over the river. 'Please, God, bring it back! Bring it back! I don't care about market share! Please! I want the Mac to live again!'Music, wind, heavenly voices -- and then snow begins softly falling.'Hey, Steve! You all right?' calls out Steve's friend Larry from a passing helicopter. Steve pats his pocket -- the Newton is there again! It's all back! Steve runs through the town, delirious with joy. 'Merry Christmas, Wired! Merry Christmas, Internet! Merry Christmas, wonderful old Microsoft!'And now his office is filled with smiling people whose lives the Mac has touched. There's old Mr. Chiat/Day the adman. There's Yanni the musician. And there's Mr. Spielberg the moviemaker. As the Apple board starts singing 'Auld Lang Syne,' somebody boots up a Power Mac.Steve smiles at the startup sound. 'You know what they say,' he tells the crowd. 'Every time you hear a startup chime, an angel just got his wings.'</p>

51238,"<p>It is said that a guy wrote the following letter to his sister. He is a commercial diver for Global Divers out of Louisiana. Anytime you think you have had a bad day at the office, remember this letter....April, 1998Hi Sue,Just another note from your bottom dwelling brother. Last week I had a bad day at the office. Before I can tell you what happened to me, I first must bore you with a few technicalities of my job. As you know, my office lies at the bottom of the sea. I wear a suit to the office. It's a wetsuit. This time of year the water is quite cold. So what we do to keep warm is this: We have a diesel powered industrial water heater. This $20,000 piece of shit sucks the water out of the sea. It heats it to a delightful temp. It then pumps it down to the diver through a garden hose which is taped to the air hose.Now this sounds like a damn good plan, and I've used it several times with no complaints. What I do, when I get to the bottom and start working, is I take the hose and stuff it down the back of my neck. This floods my whole suit with warm water. It's like working in a jacuzzi. Everything was going well until all of a sudden, my ass started to itch. So, of course, I scratched it. This only made things worse. Within a few seconds my ass started to burn. I pulled the hose out from my back, but the damage was done. In agony I realized what had happened to me. The hot water machine had sucked up a jellyfish and pumped it into my suit. This is even worse than the poison ivy you once had under your cast. Now I had that hose down my back. I don't have any hair on my back, so the jellyfish couldn't get stuck to my back. My butt was not as fortunate. When I scratched what I thought was an itch, I was actually grinding the jellyfish into my rear.I informed the dive supervisor of my dilemma over the comms. His instructions were unclear due to the fact that he along with five other divers were laughing hysterically. Needless to say I aborted the dive. I was instructed to make three agonizing water stops totaling 35 minutes before I could come to the surface. I got to the surface wearing nothing but my brass helmet. My suit and gear were tied to the bell. When I got on board the medic, with tears of laughter running down his face, handed me a tube of cream and told me to shove it up my ass when I got in the chamber. The cream put the fire out, but I couldn't shit for two days because my asshole was swollen shut. I later found out that this could easily have been prevented if the suction hose was placed on the leeward side of the ship.Anyway, the next time you have a bad day at the office, think of me. Think about how much worse your day would be if you were to shove a jellyfish up your ass. I hope you have no bad days at the office. But if you do, I hope that thought will make it a little more tolerable.Take care, and I hope to hear from you soon.Love,  Brian</p>

51259,"<p>A WW II American soldier had been on the front lines in Europe for three months when he was finally given a week of R&amp;R.  He caught a supply boat to a base in the south of England, then caught a train to London.  The train was extremely crowded and he could not find a seat. He was dead on his feet and walked the length of the train looking for any place to sit.</p>
<p>Finally he found a compartment with seats facing each other. There was room for two people on each seat.  On one side sat only a proper looking, older British lady, with a small dog sitting in the empty seat beside her.  ""Could I please sit in that seat"" he asked. </p>
<p>The lady was insulted. ""You Americans are so rude"" she said, ""can't you see my dog is sitting there""?</p>
<p>He walked through the train more and still could not find a seat. He found himself back at the same place.  ""Lady, I love dogs - have a couple at home - so I would be glad to hold your dog if I could sit down"" he said.</p>
<p>The lady replied, ""You Americans are not only rude you are arrogant"" she said. </p>
<p>He leaned against the wall for a time, but was so tired he finally said, ""Lady, I've been on the front lines in Europe for three months with not a decent rest for all that time. Could I please sit there and hold your dog?"" </p>
<p>The lady replied, ""You Americans are not only rude and arrogant, you are also obnoxious.""</p>
<p>With that comment, the soldier calmly stepped in, picked up the dog, threw it out the widow, and sat down.</p>
<p>The lady was speechless.</p>
<p>An older, neatly dressed Englishman sitting across on the other seat spoke up. </p>
<p>""Young man, I do not know if all you Americans fit the lady's description of you or not.  But I do know that you Americans do a lot of things wrong.  You drive on the wrong side of the road, you hold your fork with the wrong hand, and now you have just thrown the wrong bitch out of the window!""</p>

<p>The Devil was even madder at this, so he turned the thermostat all the way up to maximum temperature. The Devil waited some time and then went back to Sven and Olie. This time he found they had only unzipped their coats, but still had all their winter clothes on.<br /> The Devil couldn't understand what was going on. The punishment down here was supposed to be the unbearable heat.  It wasn't working on these two. He had to ask again what the deal was. Sven replied, ""We are Minnesotans and we just got over a freezing winter.  This is really great for Olie and Me.</p>
<p>A light flickered in the Devil's mind.  He went to the thermostat and turned it off. He thought if the heat wasn't a punishment, maybe he'd give them some freezing temperatures. A little while later the Devil came back to check in on Sven and Olie only to find them cheering and giving each other high fives, happier than ever! The Devil questioned them on their actions and Sven said happily, ""Back home they always said, the Vikings will win the Super Bowl when Hell freezes over!!!""</p>

51272,"<p>One day, a man had an accident at work, which resulted in him getting his eye<br /> gouged out. He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency<br /> operation, was told by the doctor that he'd been given a glass eye. The man<br /> looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his<br /> original eye color was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged.<br /> ''I can't walk around like this!!""<br /> ""Sir,"" the doctor said, ""there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to<br /> give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it<br /> here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.''<br /> A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a<br /> big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the<br /> road before finally hitting a tree. The man screeched to a halt, and ran down<br /> the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled<br /> out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye! As it was so<br /> late at night and during such a big storm, no one was about. So the man<br /> proceeded to get a screwdriver and removed one of the deceased man's blue eyes,<br /> replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to<br /> have the replacement blue eye fitted. A few days later, the man was driving<br /> along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene<br /> and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to<br /> him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads.<br /> ''Excuse me, sir,"" said the policeman. ""Do you know anything about this at<br /> all?''<br /> ''No, constable'', said the man.<br /> ''Well, we can't figure this out. Somehow, this bloke managed to drive 40<br /> miles with two glass eyes!''</p>

51277,"<p>Bill Gates dies and finds himself being sized up by God...</p>
<p>""Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call. I'm not sure whether to send<br /> you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by putting<br /> a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly<br /> Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before. I'm going to let<br /> you decide where you want to go.""</p>
<p>Bill replied, ""Well, what's the difference between the two?""</p>
<p>God said, ""I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, to see if it will<br /> help your decision.""</p>
<p>""Fine, but where should I go first?"" Bill asked.</p>
<p>""I'll leave that up to you,"" God replied.</p>
<p>""Okay then,"" said Bill, ""let's try Hell first.""</p>
<p>So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters<br /> and lots of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and<br /> frolicking about. The sun was shining; the temperature perfect. He was very<br /> pleased. ""This is great,"" he told God. ""If this is<br /> hell, I really want to see Heaven.""</p>
<p>""Fine,"" said God, and off they went. Heaven was a place high in the clouds,<br /> with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as<br /> enticing as ell. Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision.</p>
<p>""Hmm. I think I'd prefer Hell,"" he told God.</p>
<p>""Fine,"" replied God, ""as you desire.""</p>
<p>So Bill Gates went to Hell.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, God decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he<br /> was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall,<br /> screaming amongst hot flames in dark carves, being burned and tortured by<br /> demons, with no one to help him out of his dilemma, no matter how loud he<br /> screamed.</p>
<p>""How's everything going?"" He asked Bill.</p>
<p>Bill responded with his voice filled with anguish and tormented<br /> disappointment. ""This is awful. This is nothing like the Hell I visited two<br /> weeks ago. I can't believe this is happening. What happened to that other place,<br /> with the beaches and the beautiful women playing in the water?""</p>

51282,"<p>Psychologists have discovered that the manner in which people eat Oreo cookies<br /> provides great insight into their personalities. Choose which method best<br /> describes your favorite method of eating Oreos:</p>
<p>1. The whole thing all at once.<br /> 2. One bite at a time<br /> 3. Slow and methodical nibbles examining the results of each bite afterwards.<br /> 4. In little feverish nibbles.<br /> 5. Dunked in some liquid (milk, coffee...).<br /> 6. Twisted apart, the inside, then the cookie.<br /> 7. Twisted apart, the inside, and toss the cookie.<br /> 8. Just the cookie, not the inside.<br /> 9. I just like to lick them, not eat them.<br /> 10. I don't have a favorite way because I don't like Oreos.</p>
<p>Your Personality:</p>
<p>1. The whole thing - this means you consume life with abandon, you are fun to<br /> be with, exciting, carefree with some hint of recklessness. You are totally<br /> irresponsible. No one should trust you with his or her children.</p>
<p>2. One bite at a time. You are lucky to be one of the 5.4 billion other people<br /> who eat their Oreos this very same way. Just like them, you lack imagination,<br /> but that's OK, not to worry, you're normal.</p>
<p>3. Slow and Methodical. You follow the rules. You're very tidy and orderly.<br /> You're very meticulous in every detail with every thing you do to the Point of<br /> being anal retentive and irritating to others. Stay out of the fast lane if<br /> you're only going to go the speed limit</p>
<p>4. Feverish Nibbles. Your boss likes you because you get your work done<br /> quickly. You always have a million things to do and never enough time to do<br /> them. Mental breakdowns run in your family. Valium and Ritalin would do you<br /> good.</p>
<p>5. Dunked. Every one likes you because you are always upbeat. You like<br /> to sugar coat unpleasant experiences and rationalize bad situations in to good<br /> ones. You are in total denial about the shambles you call a life. You have a<br /> propensity towards narcotic addiction.</p>
<p>6. Twisted apart, the inside, and then the cookie. You have a highly curious<br /> nature. You take pleasure in breaking things apart to find out how they work,<br /> though not always able to put them back together, so you destroy all the<br /> evidence of your activities. You deny your involvement when things go wrong. You<br /> are a compulsive liar and exhibit deviant, if not criminal, behavior.</p>
<p>7. Twisted apart, the inside, and then toss the cookie. You are good at<br /> business and take risk that pay off. You take what you want and throw the rest<br /> away. You are greedy, selfish, mean, and lack feelings for others. You should be<br /> ashamed of yourself. But that's OK, you don't care, you got yours.</p>
<p>8. Just the cookie, not the inside. You enjoy pain.</p>
<p>9. I just like to lick them, not eat them. Stay away from small furry animals<br /> and seek professional medical help- immediately.</p>
<p>10. I don't have a favorite way, I don't like Oreo cookies. You probably come<br /> from a rich family, and like to wear nice things, and go to up-scale<br /> restaurants. You are particular and fussy about the things you buy, own, and<br /> wear. Things have to be just right. You like to be pampered. You are a prima<br /> Donna. There's just no pleasing you.</p>

51314,"<p>A tourist in Vienna is going through a graveyard and all of a<br /> sudden he hears some music. No one is around, so he starts<br /> searching for the source.</p>
<p>He finally locates the origin and finds it is coming from a<br /> grave with a headstone that reads: Ludwig van Beethoven,<br /> 1770-1827. Then he realizes that the music is the Ninth Symphony<br /> and it is being played backward! Puzzled, he leaves the<br /> graveyard and persuades a friend to return with him.</p>
<p>By the time they arrive back at the grave, the music has<br /> changed. This time it is the Seventh Symphony, but like the<br /> previous piece, it is being played backward. Curious, the men<br /> agree to consult a music scholar.</p>
<p>When they return with the expert, the Fifth Symphony is playing,<br /> again backward. The expert notices that the symphonies are being<br /> played in the reverse order in which they were composed, the<br /> 9th, then the 7th, then the 5th.</p>
<p>By the next day the word has spread and a throng has gathered<br /> around the grave. They are all listening to the Second Symphony<br /> being played backward. Just then the graveyard's caretaker<br /> ambles up to the group. Someone in the crowd asks him if he has<br /> an explanation for the music.</p>
<p>""Don't you get it?"" the caretaker said. ""He's decomposing!""</p>

51318,"<p>Four men were bragging about how smart their dogs  were.  The first man was an Engineer, the second an  Accountant, the third man a Chemist, and the fourth  a Government worker.To show off, the Engineer called to his dog, 'T-Square,  do your stuff!'  T-Square trotted over to the desk, took  out some paper and a pen and promptly drew a circle,  a square, and a triangle.  Everyone agreed that  T-Square was pretty smart!Then the Accountant said his dog could do better.  He  called his dog and said, 'Spreadsheet, show them how  smart you are!'  Spreadsheet went out into the kitchen,  and returned with a dozen cookies.  He divided them  into 4 equal piles of 3 cookies each.  Everyone agreed,  that was good!Yet the Chemist said his dog could do even better.  He  called his dog and said, 'Measure, do your thing!'   Measure got up, walked over to the fridge, took out a  quart of milk, got a 10-ounce glass from the cupboard  and poured exactly 8 ounces without spilling a drop.   Everyone oohed and ahhhed and was quite impressed!Then the three men turned to the Government Worker,  and said, 'What can your dog do?'  The Government  Worker called to his dog and said, 'Coffee Break, do  your stuff!!'  Coffee Break jumped to his feet, ate all the  cookies, drank the milk, pooped on the paper, sexually  assaulted the other three dogs, claimed he injured his  back while doing so, filed a grievance report for unsafe  working conditions, put in for Worker's Compensation,  and went home for the rest of the day on sick leave!!!!</p>

51322,"<p>Dear Mom and Dad,<br /> Our scoutmaster told us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search &amp; rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning. </p>
<p>Scoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back. </p>
<p>We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. </p>
<p>Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks. </p>
<p>This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood. Scoutmaster Webb isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. </p>
<p>He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken, he said they got sick that way with the food they ate in prison. I'm so glad he got out and become our scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time. </p>
<p>I have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine. </p>
<p>Love, Cole</p>

Meanwhile, the husband, suspecting his wife of cheating, demands to know where the guy is hiding. He tears the apartment up, then in a rage, picks up the fridge and throws it out the window. The strain caused him to have a massive heart attack and he dies. At the gates of Heaven, he is greeted by St Peter and is asked, ""How did you die?"" He replies, ""I came home from work, thought my wife had a man in the apartment, got pissed, threw the fridge out the window, had a heart attack and died"" St Peter wrote this in his book, then asked this naked guy beside of the businessman hiw he had died. The guy says, ""Well, I was just sitting in this refrigerator, minding my own business""</p>

51325,"<p>There was this preacher who was an avid golfer. Every chance he could get, he<br /> could be found on the golf course swinging away. It was an obsession. One Sunday<br /> was a picture perfect day for golfing. The sun was out, no clouds in the sky,<br /> and the temperature was just right. </p>
<p>The preacher was in a quandary as to what to do, and shortly, the urge to play<br /> golf overcame him. He called an assistant to tell him that he was sick and could<br /> not do church, packed the car up, and drove three hours to a golf course where<br /> no one would recognize him. Happily, he began to play the course. </p>
<p>An angel up above was watching the preacher and was quite perturbed. He went<br /> to God and said, ""Look at the preacher. He should be punished for what he is<br /> doing."" </p>
<p>God nodded in agreement. The preacher teed up on the first hole. He swung at<br /> the ball, and it sailed effortlessly through the air and landed right in the cup<br /> three hundred and fifty yards away. A picture perfect hole-in-one. He was amazed<br /> and excited. </p>
<p>The angel was a little shocked. He turned to God and said, ""Begging Your<br /> pardon, but I thought you were going to punish him?!"" </p>

51354,"<p>One day, the teacher walks into her classroom and announces to the class that on each Friday, she will ask a question to the class and anyone who answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday.</p>
<p>On the first Friday, the teacher asks, ""How many grains of sand are in the beach?"" Needless to say, no one could answer.</p>
<p>The following Friday, the teacher asks the class, ""How many stars are in the sky?"" </p>
<p>Again no one could answer. </p>
<p>Frustrated, little Johnny decides that the next Friday, he would somehow answer the question and get a 3 day weekend.</p>
<p>So Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping-pong balls and paints them black. </p>
<p>The next day, he brings them to school in a paper bag. At the end of the day, just when the teacher says, ""Here's this week's question,"" Johnny empties the bag to the floor sending the ping-pong balls rolling to the front of the room. </p>
<p>Because they are young kids who find any disruption of class amusing, the entire class starts laughing.</p>
<p>The teacher says, "" Okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?""</p>
<p>Immediately, little Johnny stands up and says, ""Bill Cosby, see ya on Tuesday!""</p>

51355,"<p>A New Zealander, a sheep and a dog were survivors of a terrible shipwreck. </p>
<p>They found themselves stranded on a desert island and after being there for a while they got into the habit of going to the beach every evening to watch the sun go down.</p>
<p>One particular evening, the sky was red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze was warm and gentle; a perfect night for romance. As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the Kiwi.</p>
<p>Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. </p>
<p>But the dog got jealous, growling fiercely until the Kiwi took his arm from around the sheep. </p>
<p>After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling.</p>
<p>A few weeks passed by and lo, and behold, there was another shipwreck. </p>
<p>The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the Kiwi had ever seen. </p>
<p>She was in a pretty bad way when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health.</p>
<p>When the young maiden was well enough, they introduced her to their evening beach ritual.</p>
<p>It was another beautiful evening: red cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze; perfect for a night of romance.</p>
<p>Pretty soon the New Zealander started to get 'those feelings' again. He fought them as long as he could, but he finally gave in and leaned over to the young woman, cautiously, and whispered in her ear...</p>

<p>The strange man exclaimed that he was a genie and the vase they<br /> broke freed him, and would give them two wishes and would keep<br /> the last wish for himself.</p>
<p>They talked a while and asked for a mansion. The genie said,<br /> ""When you return you shall have a house so huge nothing could<br /> come close in comparison to it."" For the second wish, they asked<br /> to both (sometime in their life) be in the PGA tour and win. The<br /> genie repied, ""You will not only win but will also hold an<br /> outstanding new record.""</p>
<p>Now this was a very horny genie, so for his third wish he wished<br /> to fuck the man's wife. They thought it over and decided it was<br /> fair, so the genie fucks her every way in the book.</p>
<p>Afterwards the woman asked the genie what it felt like trapped<br /> in a vase all those years, and the genie replyed. ""You still<br /> believe in that genie shit?""</p>

51370,"<p>Dear Abby: Q: My fiance still has feelings for his old    girlfriends. I'm afraid he will not be faithful. A: A man's capacity to love is boundless. It has been    proven to increase with the number of sexual    partners. Thus, by having a few other women, your    partner is really increasing his love for you. Best    thing to do is to buy him a nice, expensive present,    and cook him a nice meal and don't mention this    aspect of his behaviour.Q: My husband wants to experience three-in-a-bed-sex    with me and my sister. A: Your husband is clearly devoted to you. He cannot    get enough of you, so he goes for the next best    thing - your sister. Far from being an issue, this    will bring all of the family together. Why not get    some cousins involved? If you are still    apprehensive, then let him go with your relatives,    buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a    nice meal and don't mention this aspect of his    behaviour.Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex    with him. A: Do it. Sperm is not only great tasting, but has only    10 calories a spoonful. It is nutritious and helps    you to keep your figure and gives a great glow to    the skin. Interestingly, a man knows this. His offer    to you to perform oral sex with him is totally    selfless. Oral sex is extremely painful for a man.    This shows he loves you. Best thing to do is to    thank him, buy him a nice, expensive present, and    cook him a nice meal.Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is. A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If    you must mess with it, do it in your own time. To    help with the family budget you may wish to    videotape yourself while doing this, and to sell it    at car-boot sales. To ease your selfish guilt, buy    your man a nice expensive present, and cook him a    delicious meal.Q: My husband goes straight to sleep after making love    - we have no time to talk. A: Sex is an extremely difficult task for a man.    Afterwards he needs rest. In fact, the more he loves    you, the more hard work his lovemaking is, and the    more rest he needs. Stop putting pressure on him.    Buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a    nice meal.Q: My husband's efforts at lovemaking only last 30    seconds. A: Your husband loves you very much. He is so turned on    by you that he cannot control himself. In fact, the    shorter the 'effort' the more he loves you. Return    this love by buying a nice, expensive present, and    cooking him a nice meal.Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.A: Foreplay to a man is very hurtful. What it means is    that you do not love your man as much as you should    - he has to work a lot to get you in the mood.    Abandon all wishes in this area, and make it up to    him by buying a nice expensive present, and cooking    a nice meal.     Q: My husband has never given me an orgasm. A: The female orgasm is a myth. It is fostered by    militant, man-hating feminists and is a danger to    the family unit. Don't mention it again to him and    show your love to him by buying a nice expensive    present ..and don't forget to cook him a delicious    meal.</p>

51371,"<p>Three desperately ill men met with their doctor one day to discuss their options. One was an alcoholic, one was a chain smoker, and one was a homosexual sex addict.</p>
<p>The doctor, addressing all three of them, said, ""If any of you indulge in your vices one more time, you will surely die.""</p>
<p>The men left the doctor's office, each convinced that he would never again indulge himself in his vice.</p>
<p>While walking toward the subway for their return trip to the suburbs, they passed a bar. The alcoholic, hearing the loud music and seeing the lights, could not stop himself. His buddies accompanied him into the bar, where he had a shot of whiskey. No sooner had he replaced the shot glass on the bar, he fell off his stool, stone cold dead.</p>
<p>His companions, somewhat shaken up, left the bar, realizing how seriously they must take the doctor's words.</p>
<p>As they walked along, they came upon a cigarette butt lying on the ground, still burning. The homosexual looked at the chain smoker and said, ""If you bend over to pick that up, we're both dead.""</p>

<p>One day Little Red Riding Hood came upon a Fox. The fox looked at Little Red and says ""Little Red Riding hood, what are you doing walking in the forest by yourself. You know if the wolf catches you he will rip your clothes off and fondle your titties.""</p>
<p>Little Red sighs and smiles at the fox and slowly opens her basket and shows the fox her gun and says ""No he won't, see I have a gun to protect myself."" She smiles and skips away from the fox to her grandmother's house.</p>
<p>Little red gets deep within the forest when she comes upon a bear who wanders up to her and smells the yummy food in the basket then thinks to himself for a second and says, ""What are you, stupid, Little Red?

<p>Little Red shows the bear the big gun in her basket and smiles, ""No he won't I have a big gun in my basket ...."" She pulls out the gun ""See, nothing can harm me."" Little Red smiles and skips to grandmother's house.</p>

51384,"<p>***The Rules Of Bedroom Golf!***</p>
<p>1.  Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play - normally one club and two balls.</p>
<p>2.  Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.</p>
<p>3.  Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out.</p>
<p>4.  For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.<br /> Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.</p>
<p>5.  Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to the hole.</p>
<p>6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary<br /> until the course owner is satisfied that play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.</p>
<p>7.  It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special attention to well formed bunkers.</p>
<p>8.  Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played , or are currently playing, to the owner of the course being played. Upset course owners have been known to damage players equipment for this reason.</p>
<p>9.  Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection.</p>
<p>10. Players should ensure themselves that their match has been<br /> properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time. Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course.</p>
<p>11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all<br /> times. Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course<br /> to be temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play when this is the case.</p>

51396,"<p>The following is from an actual 1950's Home Economics textbook intended for High School girls, teaching them how to prepare for married life:<br /> 1. Have dinner ready: Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious meal - on time. This is a way of letting him know that you have been thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs. Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospects of a good meal are part of the warm welcome needed. </p>
<p>2. Prepare yourself: Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed when he arrives. Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. Be a little gay and a little more interesting. His boring day may need a lift. </p>
<p>3. Clear away clutter. Make one last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up school books, toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your husband will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and it will give you a lift too. </p>
<p>4. Prepare the children. Take a few minutes to wash the children's hands and faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if necessary, change their clothes. They are little treasures and he would like to see them playing the part. </p>
<p>5. Minimize the noise: At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of washer, dryer, or vacuum. Try to encourage the children to be quiet. Greet him with a warm smile and be glad to see him. </p>
<p>6. Some DON'TS: Don't greet him with problems or complaints. Don't complain if he's late for dinner. Count this as minor compared with what he might have gone through that day. </p>
<p>7. Make him comfortable. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or suggest he lay down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready for him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in a low, soft, soothing and pleasant voice. Allow him to relax and unwind. </p>
<p>8. Listen to him: You may have a dozen things to tell him, but the moment of his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first. </p>
<p>9. Make the evening his: Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner or to other places of entertainment; instead try to understand his world of strain and pressure and his need to be home and relax. </p>
<p>10. The Goal: try to make your home a place of peace and order where your husband can relax.</p>

<p>1. it can cause excessive sweating and vomiting 2. it is a major component in acid rain 3. it can cause severe burns in its gaseous state 4. accidental inhalation can kill you 5. it contributes to erosion 6. it decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes 7. it has been found in tumors of terminal cancer patients</p>

51431,"<p>AUG 12 Moved to our new home in upstate New York. It is so<br /> beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can hardly wait<br /> to see them with snow on them. I love it here.</p>
<p>OCT 14 Upstate New York is the most beautiful place on earth.<br /> The leaves are turned all the colors and shades of red and<br /> orange. Went for a ride through the beautiful mountains and saw<br /> some deer. They are so graceful, certainly they are the most<br /> wonderful animal on earth. This must be paradise. I love it here.</p>
<p>NOV 11 Deer season will start soon. I can't imagine anyone<br /> wanting to kill such a gorgeous creature. Hope it will snow<br /> soon. I love it here.</p>
<p>DEC 2 It snowed last night. Woke up to find everything blanketed<br /> with white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and<br /> cleaned the snow off the steps and shoveled the driveway. We had<br /> a snowball fight (I won), and when the snow plow came by, we had<br /> to shovel again. What a beautiful place. I love upstate New York.</p>
<p>DEC 12 More snow last night. I love it. The snow plow did his<br /> trick again to the driveway. I love it here!</p>
<p>DEC 19 More snow last night. Couldn't get out of the driveway to<br /> get to work. I am exhausted from shoveling. Fucking snow plow.</p>
<p>DEC 22 More of that white shit fell last night. I've got<br /> blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides<br /> around the curve and waits until I'm done shoveling the<br /> driveway. Asshole!</p>
<p>DEC 25 Merry Fucking Christmas! More friggin snow. If I ever get<br /> my hands on that son-of-a-bitch who drives that snow plow, I<br /> swear I'll kill the bastard. Don't know why they don't use more<br /> salt on the roads to melt the fucking ice.</p>
<p>DEC 27 More white shit last night. Been inside for 3 days except<br /> for shoveling out the driveway after that snow plow goes through<br /> every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of<br /> white shit. The weatherman says to expect another 10"" of the<br /> shit again tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow<br /> 10"" is?</p>
<p>DEC 28 The fucking weatherman was wrong. We got 34"" of that<br /> white shit this time. At this rate it won't melt before next<br /> summer. The snow plow got stuck up the road and that bastard<br /> came to the door and asked to borrow my shovel. After I told him<br /> I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the shit he<br /> pushed into the driveway, I broke my last one over his fucking<br /> head.</p>
<p>JAN 4 Finally out of the house today. Went to the store to get<br /> food and on the way back a damned deer ran in front of the car<br /> and I hit it. Did about $3,000 damage to the car. Those fucking<br /> beasts should be killed. Wish the hunters had killed them all<br /> last November.</p>

51434,"<p>There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things mechanical. After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired.</p>
<p>Several years later, the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.</p>
<p>The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small ""x"" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated, ""This is where your problem is.""</p>
<p>The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his services. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges.</p>
<p>The engineer responded:</p>
<p>One chalk mark . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1<br /> Knowing where to put it . . . . . . . $49,999</p>

51445,"<p>The other day I went to the local religious book store, where I saw a HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car, and I'm really glad I did. What an uplifting experience followed!</p>
<p>I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, ""Jesus Christ!"" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, ""GO JESUS CHRIST,GO!""</p>
<p>Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.</p>
<p>Several cars behind, a very nice man stepped out of his car and yelled something. I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like, ""Mother trucker,"" or ""Mother's from there."" Maybe he was from Florida, too. He must really love the Lord.</p>
<p>A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed to yellow, and stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away.</p>

51446,"<p>****GM vs MICROSOFT***** At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated: ''If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1000 miles to the gallon.'' </p>
<p>In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating (by Mr Welch himself): </p>
<p>If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics: </p>
<p>1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day. </p>
<p>2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have tobuy a new car. </p>
<p>3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, andyou would just accept this, restart and drive on. </p>
<p>4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine. </p>
<p>5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought ''Car95'' or ''CarNT.'' But then you would have to buy more seats. </p>
<p>6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five per cent of the roads. </p>
<p>7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single ''general car default'' warning light. </p>
<p>8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt. </p>
<p>9. The airbag system would say ''Are you sure?'' before going off. </p>
<p>10. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grab hold of the radio antenna. </p>
<p>11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50% or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department. </p>
<p>12. Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car. </p>
<p>13. You'd press the ''start'' button to shut off the engine.</p>

<p>A Genie apears and says ""Thank you for freeing me from the bottle of which I have been trapped for thousands of years!I grant you three wishes. </p>

<p>""Hey Presto"" says the Genie.""You are a beautiful young woman!"" </p>
<p>The young woman stares in the mirror at her new lavashing beauty and youth and says""Wow this is really exciting!,I look like I'm 24 again!"" </p>
<p>The Genie says""Your second wish?"" </p>

<p>""Hey Presto!""says the Genie.""Your are the richest woman this universe!"" </p>

51472,"<p>There was this couple, Mary and John, who believed they would return in<br /> another life. </p>
<p>They got married and, as part of their wedding vows, promised that if one<br /> died, the other would attend a s�ance exactly four weeks later and contact the<br /> other. </p>
<p>Twenty happy years later, the man dies, and the woman, Mary, sticks to her vow<br /> and visits a s�ance four weeks later. It went something like this:<br /> Mary: ""Is there anybody there? I'm seeking my deceased husband John. Is he<br /> there?""</p>
<p>Strange, booming voice: ""Mary? Is that you, Mary?""</p>
<p>Mary: ""Yes John, is that you?""</p>
<p>John: ""Yes, it's me.""</p>
<p>Mary: ""How are things where you are, John? What's it like?""</p>
<p>John: ""Great, Mary. Everyday after breakfast we make love until lunchtime,<br /> which lasts about half-hour, and then we make love until dinner. After dinner,<br /> we make love until we fall asleep. It's great. I can't wait until you get<br /> here.""</p>
<p>Mary (shocked): ""Is that what Heaven's like?""</p>
<p>John: ""I'm not in Heaven."" </p>
<p>Mary (fearing the worst): ""Then where are you?""</p>
<p>John: ""I'm a rabbit in Florida!""</p>

<p>        She was driving to a workshop in Atlanta from her home in Ohio.<br /> It was about 10 am, and she'd been driving the entire preceding day and night<br /> herself, and she was consequently not in the best of tempers as she searched<br /> for a motel in which to crash.</p>
<p>        A Georgia state policeman pulled her over, got out of his cruiser,<br /> swaggered up to her driver's window, bent down, and drawled, ""Lookie here,<br /> darlin',""--uh oh, everybody duck--""Lookie here, darlin', nobody blows<br /> through Georgia that fast.""</p>
<p>        Said the feminist Yankee overtired psychology professor: ""Sherman did.""</p>
<p>        She says he was not satisfied merely to give her a speeding ticket;<br /> he made her follow him fifty miles out of her way to Nowheresburg, GA, and<br /> wait at the police station until three in the afternoon for a circuit judge<br /> to arrive so that he could explain to her why it wasn't the best idea in<br /> the world to be impolite to policemen, who were after all interested only<br /> in creating the safest possible environment for everybody including her,<br /> etc. etc.  The lecture went on for about two hours, she says, after which<br /> she was released to drive the fifty miles back to her route and resume her<br /> search for someplace to crash.</p>

51510,"<p>Reportedly a true story:On a British Airways flight from Johannesburg, South Africa; a middle-aged, visibly well-off white South African lady found herself sitting next to a well dressed black gentleman.She called the cabin attendant over to complain about her seating. 'What seems to be the problem, Madam?' asked the attendant. 'Can't you see?' she loudly snapped, 'You've sat me next to a Kaffir.  I can't possibly sit next to this disgusting man.  Find me another seat!' 'Please try to be calm, Mam,' the stewardess replied.  'I believe the economy section is completely full today, but I'll go and check to see if we have any upgraded seats available in club or first class.'The woman cocked a snooty look at the outraged black man beside her (as well as many of the other nearby passengers). Minutes later the stewardess returned. 'Mam, as I suspected, economy is full.  I've spoken to the cabin services director, and club is also full.  However, we do have one seat in first class.'  Before the lady had a chance to answer, the stewardess continued:  'Please realize, it is most extraordinary to make this kind of upgrade. I have had to get special permission from the captain.  But, given the extreme circumstances, the captain felt that it was outrageous that one of our passengers should be forced to sit next such an obnoxious person.' The lady, cannot help but look at the people around her with a smug and self-satisfied grin. With that, the stewardess turned to the black man and said:  'So if you'd like to get your things, sir, I have your first-class seat ready for you...'  At which point, the surrounding passengers burst into a standing ovation while the man walked to the front of the plane.</p>

Well, the teacher was not very happy and<br /> put the girl in time out. After her five minutes of time out the<br /> teacher again asked her what her name really was. Again, the<br /> girl answered ""My name is Happy Butt."". So she said in time out<br /> again. Five minutes later the teacher came up to her and said<br /> ""If you don't tell me your real name you will have to go to the<br /> principal."". The girl still replied with Happy Butt. So, she<br /> went to the principal. She waited for the principal to come and<br /> talk to her. The principal came in, and asked her what her name<br /> was. She said ""My name is Happy Butt."" The prinicipal said ""If<br /> you don't tell me the truth I will call your Mom."" So the little<br /> girl again responed ""My name is Happy Butt."" So, the principal<br /> called the girl's mother. The prinicipal asked the girl's mom<br /> what her name really was. The mother answered ""Her name is<br /> Gladice"". So the principal said Thanks and hung up.

<p>I finally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to bed. The very next day we went shopping at a big unnamed department store... I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them. </p>
<p>She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say OK. And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond earrings. Let me tell you ...she was so excited. She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don't think she cared. I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she doesn't even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK. </p>
<p>She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have seen her face when she said, ""I'm ready to go, let's go to the cash register."" </p>
<p>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No, honey. I don't feel like buying all this stuff now."" You should have seen her face ... it went completely blank. I then said, ""Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while."" </p>
<p>And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a Man."" </p>
<p>I figure that I should be having sex again sometime during the Spring thaw.</p>

51621,"<p>The pope was once set to board a private plane at an airport.<br /> Word had gotten out on this event, and hordes of people lined up<br /> along the runway, hoping the pope would notice them as he was<br /> making his way towards the airplane. One such man was very<br /> anxious to see the pope, buying a mutli-hundred dollar suit, in<br /> hopes that the pope would notice the man and his well-groomed<br /> appearance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the pope slowly made his way along and as the<br /> well-dressed man became more and more nervous, the pope finally<br /> passed right by the man, without noticing a thing. Not only<br /> that, but the man noticed that the pope had actually taken the<br /> effort to stop and talk to a man dressed in ragged clothing!</p>
<p>The well-groomed man didn't understand why this happened, but he<br /> had an idea. As soon as the pope finished talking to the<br /> raggely-clothed man, the well-dressed man walked over the the<br /> ""bum"" and offered that they could swap clothing. The<br /> raggedly-clothed man agreed.</p>
<p>After a quick change of clothes, the well-grommed man, now<br /> dressed in the ragged clothes, dashed to the front of the line<br /> as the pope continued to walk his way down. As the pope neared,<br /> the man became just as nervous again, but confident that the<br /> pope would take the time to stop.</p>
<p>Finally, the pope had reached the now-ragged-clothed man. The<br /> pope looked the man up and down for a while, then stared in the<br /> man's face and said, ""I thought I told you if I ever saw your<br /> face around here again, I'd make sure you'd regret it for the<br /> rest of your life.""</p>

"
51640,"<p>Estas son las leyes m�s importantes que uno debe tomar en cuenta antes, durante y despu�s de que se descomponga la computadora.</p>
<p>BUENOS Y MALOS TRABAJOS</p>
<p>- Para que una computadora haga un trabajo bien tiene que destruir dos trabajos importantes.</p>
<p>- Si no se cuenta con trabajos importantes destruir� dos de los trabajos de mayor tama�o.</p>
<p>- Si no hay trabajos en absoluto destruir� dos de las aplicaciones m�s importantes.</p>
<p>- Si no hay aplicaciones importantes destruir� la estructura del sistema operativo.</p>
<p>- Si no hay sistema operativo es un televisor, no una computadora.</p>
<p>INTERNET</p>
<p>- La posibilidad de encontrar virus en Internet es la de encontrar bacterias en tu culo.</p>
<p>- La informaci�n falsa en Internet se duplica cada segundo que pasa.</p>
<p>a) Hay demasiada informaci�n falsa en Internet, pero nosotros creemos que la nuestra siempre es verdadera.<br /> b) Si sigue multiplic�ndose la informaci�n para el a�o 2010 ninguna b�squeda tendr� sentido.</p>
<p>- Siempre que olvidas la contrase�a para entrar a Internet es porque olvidaste d�nde demonios dejaste el saco donde guardaste el papel en el que la anotaste.</p>
<p>CAPACIDAD</p>
<p>- La computadora trabaja con los programas como una carreta: mientras tiene cosas mejores y grandes, m�s huevos te toma levantarla.</p>
<p>FUNCIONAMIENTO</p>
<p>- El funcionamiento de la computadora depende de la fuerza con que le sueltes los porrazos.</p>
<p>- Si la computadora no responde es ya sea porque hiciste algo bien o porque la golpeaste demasiado.</p>
<p>... Y recuerden, la computadora es como una mujer: si le das m�s y mejores cosas menos caso te va a hacer.</p>

After careful consideration, I reluctantly agreed and finally proceeded with the unpleasant task. I withdrew the cork from the first bottle and poured the contents down the sink with the exception of one glass, which I drank. Then, I withdrew the cork from the second bottle and did likewise with it, with the exception of one glass, which I drank. I then withdrew the cork from the third bottle and poured the whiskey down the sink which I drank. I pulled the cork from the fourth bottle down the sink and poured the bottle down the glass, which I drank. I pulled the bottle from the cork of the next and drank one sink out of it, and threw the rest down the glass. I pulled the sink out of the next glass and poured the cork down the bottle. Then, I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the drink and drank the pour. When I had everything emptied, I steadied the house with one hand, counted the glasses, corks, bottles, and sinks with the other, which were twenty-nine, and as the houses came by I counted them again, and finally I had all the houses in one bottle, which I drank.

51706,"<p>There was once a clairvoyant little boy, who could foresee the future. One night while saying his prayers, the little boy was heard to finish, ""God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Grandma, goodbye Grandpa."" The next day his grandfather dropped dead of a heart attack.A few weeks later, the little boy was praying, ""God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, goodbye Grandma."" The next day his poor grandmother was hit by a bus while crossing the street -- she never felt a thing.A month or so later, the little boy was praying and said, ""God bless Mommy, goodbye Daddy.""His father panicked. He had himself driven, very carefully and slowly, to work, by an armed guard in an armored security truck he hired. He couldn't concentrate, however, thinking about those words, ""Goodbye Daddy."" He finally came home early, but very carefully.He was met at the front door by his wife, who said, ""What do you think happened today, dear? The most awful thing -- the milkman dropped dead on the back porch.""</p>

51708,"<p>Two girls go out one weekend without their husbands and got somewhat inebriated.</p>
<p>Staggering on their way home, they both desperately need a wee and with no public toilets in sight the nearest venue was a cemetery, so they both ducked behind the fence to relieve themselves. After they'd<br /> finished, the first woman took off her knickers to wipe herself and then<br /> threw them away. The other woman, realising she was wearing some</p>
<p>very expensive knickers, didn't want to throw hers away and so looked<br /> around for something else and decided on using the ribbon off a nearby<br /> wreath.</p>
<p>So now, feeling a lot better, they carried on with their stagger home. </p>
<p>The following morning the two husbands were talking to each other on the phone. One commented, ""I think we need to start keeping a closer eye on our wives you know. I reckon they're up to no good. My wife came home last night without any knickers on!""</p>
<p>The other one replied, ""Tell me about it! If you think that's bad, my wife<br /> came home with a card stuck to her arse that read - ""All the members of the District Fire Brigade will never forget you"".</p>

""Doc, why's my penis orange?"" he asks. The doctor goes, ""Hmm. Never seen anything like it. Here, take a couple of these pills and come back here tomorrow.""<br /> So the guy takes the pills back home and uses it that night. The next day, he goes back to the doctor and the stuff doesn't do anything. So, the doctor gives him some stronger stuff and tells him to come back the next day. He takes it home and the next day, his penis is still orange. He goes back to the doctor and he gives him the strongest stuff they have. You know, he'll be out for twelve hours and he can't eat or drink anything during that time, etc. He comes back a couple days later and his penis is still orange. </p>

51749,"<p>'WORDS OF WISDOM AT THE HALF CENTURY MARK'      From the book, 'Dave Barry Turns 50' 1. The badness of a movie is directly proportional to the number of    helicopters in it.2. You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling    reason why we observe 'Daylight Saving Time'.3. People who feel the need to tell you that they have an excellent    sense of humor are telling you that they have no sense of humor.4. The most valuable function performed by the federal government is    entertainment.5. You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests    you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging    from her at that moment.6. A penny saved is worthless.7. They can hold all the peace talks they want, but there will never be    peace in the Middle East. Billions of years from now, when Earth is    hurtling toward the Sun and there is nothing left alive on the planet    except a few microorganisms, the microorganisms living in the Middle    East will be bitter enemies.8. The most powerful force in the universe is gossip.9. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age,    gender, religion, economic status, or ethnic background, is that, deep    down inside, we all believe that we are above-average drivers.10. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to     make a big deal about your birthday.  That time is age 11.11. There is a very fine line between 'hobby' and 'mental illness'.12. People who want to share their religious views with you almost     never want you to share yours with them.13. There apparently exists, somewhere in Los Angeles, a computer that     generates concepts for television sitcoms.  When TV executives need a     new concept, they turn on this computer; after sorting through     millions of possible plot premises, it spits out 'THREE QUIRKY BUT     ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT', and the executives turn     this concept into a show.  The next time they need an idea, the     computer spits out 'SIX QUIRKY BUT ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE LIVING IN AN     APARTMENT'.  Then the next time, it spits out 'FOUR QUIRKY BUT     ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT'.  And so on. We need to     locate this computer and destroy it with hammers.14. Nobody is normal.15. At least once per year, some group of scientists will become very     excited and announce:      -the universe is even bigger than they thought!      -there are even more subatomic particles than they thought!      -whatever they announced last year about global warming is wrong.16. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race     has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that     word would be 'meetings'.17. The main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to     annoy people who are not in them.18. The value of advertising is that it tells you the exact opposite of     what the advertiser actually thinks.  For example:                -If Coke and Pepsi spend billions of dollars to                 convince you that there are significant differences                 between these two products, both companies realize that                 Pepsi and Coke are virtually identical;                -If the advertisement strongly suggests that Nike                 shoes enable athletes to perform amazing feats, Nike                 wants you to disregard the fact that shoe brand is                 unrelated to athletic ability;                -If Budweiser runs an elaborate advertising campaign                 stressing the critical importance of a beer's 'born-on'                 date, Budweiser knows this factor has virtually nothing                 to do with how good a beer tastes.And so on. On those rare occasions when advertising dares to poke fun at the product - as in the classic Volkswagen Beetle campaign - it's because the advertiser actually thinks the product is pretty good.  If a politician ever ran for president under a slogan such as 'Harlan Frubert: Basically, He Wants Attention', I would quit my job to work for his campaign. 19. If there really is a God who created the entire universe with all of     its glories, and He decides to deliver a message to humanity, He     will not use, as His messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad     hairstyle.20. You should not confuse your career with your life.21. A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice     person.22. No matter what happens, somebody will find a way to take it too     seriously.23. When trouble arises and things look bad, there is always one     individual who perceives a solution and is willing to take command.     Very often, that individual is crazy.24. Your friends love you anyway.25. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.</p>

51784,"<p>An engineer, a physicist, and a lawyer were being interviewed for a position<br /> as chief executive officer of a large corporation.<br /> The engineer was interviewed first, and was asked a long list of questions,<br /> ending with ""How much is two plus two?""

51785,"<p>Hi:</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you know that I have recently been diagnosed with a very<br /> serious condition and there's no hope I will ever recover. The scientific<br /> world is frantically searching for a cure.  This is an ailment many of us<br /> suffer from and may not as yet have been diagnosed, however now you may be<br /> able to discuss it with your loved ones and try to explain what really<br /> happened to you all those times you tried so hard to accomplish something<br /> and didn't.</p>
<p>I call it the ""But First Syndrome.""</p>
<p>You know, it's when I decide to do the laundry, start down the hall and<br /> notice the newspaper on the table. OK, I'm going to do the laundry....</p>
<p>....But first I'm going to read the newspaper. After that, I notice the mail on the<br /> table. OK, I'll just put the newspaper in the recycle rack.</p>
<p>....But first I'll look through that pile of mail and see if there are any bills to be<br /> paid. Yes, now where's the checkbook? Oops......there's the empty glass<br /> from yesterday on the coffee table. I'm going to look for that checkbook,</p>
<p>....But first I need to put the glass in the sink. I head for the kitchen, look out the<br /> window, notice my poor flowers need a drink of water. I put the glass in<br /> the sink, and darn it, there's the remote for the TV on the kitchen<br /> counter. What's it doing here? I'll just put it away....</p>
<p>....But first I need to water those plants. Head for door and.... Stepped on the dog. Dog<br /> needs to be fed. Okay, I'll put that remote away and water the plants....</p>
<p>....But first I need to feed the dog.....</p>
<p>End of day: Laundry is not done, newspapers are still on the floor, glass<br /> is still in the sink, bills are unpaid, checkbook is still lost, and the<br /> dog ate the remote control ........  And, when I try to figure out how come<br /> nothing got done all day, I'm baffled because.... I know I was busy all<br /> day!</p>
<p>I realize this condition is serious...and I'd get help...</p>
<p>....But first... I think I'll check my email!</p>

51805,"<p>Dear Mom &amp; Dad:</p>
<p>We are having a great time here at Lake Typhoid. Scoutmaster Webb is<br /> making us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and<br /> worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed<br /> away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the<br /> mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad's<br /> mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to<br /> ride in one of the search &amp; rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have<br /> found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning. Scoutmaster<br /> Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone.<br /> Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably<br /> didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can<br /> will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did.<br /> Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows<br /> back. We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed.<br /> It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left.<br /> Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to<br /> break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think<br /> it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if its hot,<br /> sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10<br /> people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the<br /> highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. Scoutmaster Webb is a neat<br /> guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Terry how<br /> to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there<br /> isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks. This<br /> morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the<br /> lake. Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was<br /> afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe<br /> across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under<br /> the water from the flood. Scoutmaster Webb isn't crabby like some<br /> scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. He has to<br /> spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him<br /> any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges.<br /> When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet<br /> works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was<br /> just food poisoning from the leftover chicken. I have to go now. We are<br /> going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about<br /> anything. We are fine.</p>
<p>Love,<br /> Cole</p>
<p>P.S. How long has it been since I had a tetanus shot?</p>

51832,"<p>Doris and Fred had started their retirement years and decided to<br /> raise some extra cash by advertising for a lodger in their<br /> terrace house. After a few days, a young attractive woman<br /> applied for the room and explained that she was a model working<br /> in a nearby city center studio for a few weeks and that she<br /> would like the room from Mondays to Thursdays, but would pay for<br /> the whole week. Doris showed her the house and they agreed to<br /> start straight away.</p>
<p>""There's just one problem,"" explained the model. ""Because of my<br /> job, I have to have a bath every night, and I notice you don't<br /> have a bath. "" ""That's not a problem,"" replied Doris. ""We have a<br /> tin bath out in the yard and we bring it in to the living room<br /> in front of the fire and fill it with hot water."" ""What about<br /> your husband?"" asked the model. ""Oh, he plays darts most<br /> weekdays, so he will be out in the evenings,"" replied Doris.<br /> ""Good,"" said the model. ""Now that's been settled, I'll go to the<br /> studio and see you tonight.""</p>
<p>That evening, Fred dutifully went to his darts match while Doris<br /> prepared the bath for the model. After stripping off, the model<br /> stepped into the bath. Doris was amazed to see that she has no<br /> pubic hair. The model noticed Doris' staring eyes, so she smiled<br /> and explained that it is part of her job to shave herself,<br /> especially when modeling swimmer or underclothes.</p>
<p>Later when Fred returned, Doris related this oddity and he does<br /> not believe her. ""It's true, I tell you!"" said Doris. ""Look, if<br /> you don't believe me, tomorrow night I'll leave the curtains<br /> slightly open and you can peek in and see for yourself.""</p>
<p>The next night, Fred left as usual and Doris prepared the bath<br /> for the model. As the model stepped naked into the bath, Doris<br /> stood behind her. Doris looked towards the curtains and pointed<br /> towards the model's naked pubic Area. Then she lifted up her<br /> skirt and wearing no panties, pointed to her own hairy mass.</p>
<p>Later Fred returned and they retired to bed. ""Well, do you<br /> believe me now?"" she asked Fred. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""I've never<br /> seen anything like it in my life. But why did you lift up your<br /> skirt and show yourself?""</p>
<p>""Just to show you the difference."" answered Doris. ""But I guess<br /> you've seen me millions of times."" ""Yes,"" said Fred, ""I have -<br /> but the rest of the dart team hadn't.""</p>

51848,"<p>Muere Ch�vez en el golpe de estado y va al purgatorio. Dios y el diablo se pelean porque ninguno de los dos quiere recibirlo.</p>
<p>En vista de que ninguno cede y no hay acuerdo, recurren a mediadores; �stos deciden una propuesta de aceptaci�n obligatoria: que alterne un mes en el Cielo y otro en el Infierno.</p>
<p>El primer mes Ch�vez va al Cielo. Dios no sabe que hacer, se vuelve loco. Ch�vez le da la vuelta a todo, privatiza los elementos de la Oraci�n y Liturgia, disuelve el sistema de asesor�a personal de los �ngeles, subasta las nubes, le regala un kilometro cuadrado de cielo al Infierno, nombra arc�ngeles provisionales, le interviene las comunicaciones a los Santos, cambia los cilindros a las cerraduras de las puertas de san Pedro, env�a un proyecto de ley para reformar los diez mandamientos y darle amnist�a a Lucifer, tambi�n le cambio las aureolas a los �ngeles por boinas rojas y convoc� una asamblea constituyente para promulgar la nueva Biblia.</p>
<p>En el Cielo todo es 'revolucionado', la gente, dividida entre escu�lidos y santa chusma, lo odia y Dios no ve la hora en que se cumplan los 30 d�as para que se largue al Infierno. Cuando Ch�vez va al Infierno, Dios respira aliviado, pero al acercarse el d�a 20 comienza a sufrir nuevamente, pensando que en 10 d�as tiene que volver a verlo. Sin embargo, llega el primer d�a del siguiente mes y nada, el quinto d�a y nada, no aparece.</p>
<p>Primero Dios estaba feliz pero luego se quedo pensando:</p>
<p>""�Acaso se ha quedado m�s tiempo en el infierno para que luego puedan tocarle dos meses seguidos en el Para�so?""</p>
<p>Con solo pensarlo se desespera y decide llamar por tel�fono al Infierno para preguntarle al diablo que es lo que ocurre.</p>

<p>""Por favor, con el demonio"".</p>
<p>""�Cu�l de los dos?"", contesta el empleado. ""El pana colorado con cuernos o el co�o de su madre de la boina roja"".</p>

<p>""READ!?"" says his father, ""No kidding! What do I have to do to get him in<br /> that program?""</p>
<p>""Just send $2,500, I'll get him in the class."" So his father sends the<br /> money.</p>

<p>The sargent asked ""Did she give you head?"". </p>

<p>Ken Starr has informed<br /> every person on earth...<br /> We know it all,<br /> except his legnth and his girth. </p>
<p>We really don't care<br /> about all the sexual facts,<br /> We're more concerned<br /> with the dignity he lacks. </p>
<p>We want a President<br /> we know we can trust,<br /> Not one that we think of<br /> and hope they will bust. </p>

<p>For she is alive to relate all the facts<br /> REMEMBER...<br /> witnesses usually lay in graves,<br /> on their backs. </p>
<p>""It's all a coincidence""<br /> so many should die,<br /> Or is the coincidence<br /> so many WOULDN'T LIE? </p>

<p>He uses our laws<br /> to do as he will,<br /> Laws are for common folks,<br /> not for Slick Bill! </p>
<p>Go Ahead,<br /> watch ""Friends"" on TV,<br /> don't get involved.....<br /> since you really can't see. </p>
<p>Just sit there and complain<br /> about Kenneth Starr,<br /> over a drink<br /> at your favorite bar. </p>
<p>Get it all over with,<br /> My heads in the sand,<br /> Bill's a Great Guy,<br /> I think he's just GRAND!! </p>
<p>Excuse the Scoundrel that<br /> will bury us all<br /> But, don't complain to me,<br /> if the country does fall. </p>
<p>Sorry Buddy, is our reply,<br /> We love this country<br /> and Bill's BOLOGNA<br /> just DON'T FLY!!! </p>
<p>Now, on the real issues<br /> Bill's covered every track.<br /> Hillary's made sure to<br /> give him no slack. </p>
<p>But, Starr is confident...<br /> in every way,<br /> 'cause when Slick Willie is horny<br /> he just has to play! </p>
<p>Slick Willie is careless<br /> when Little Willie wants out,<br /> He'll call Monica<br /> She'll come....No doubt!! </p>
<p>She'll even bring Pizza<br /> and we can party in here,<br /> Everyone will keep quiet,<br /> My henchmen are near! </p>
<p>And Willie was sloppy<br /> as we all know,<br /> He let it all hang-out<br /> Woops....There it goes!!! </p>

"
51865,"<p>One dark night outside a small town, a fire started inside the local chemical plant. Before long it exploded into flames and an alarm went out to fire Departments from miles around. After fighting the fire for over an hour, the chemical company president approached the fire chief and said, ""All of our secret formulas are in the vault in the center of the plant. They must be saved! I will give $50,000 to the engine company that brings them out safely!"" As soon as the chief heard this, he ordered the firemen to strengthen their attack on the blaze. After two more hours of attacking the fire, president of the company offered $100,000 to the engine company that could bring out the company's secret files. </p>
<p>From the distance a long siren was heard and another fire truck came into sight. It was a local volunteer fire company composed entirely of men over 65. To everyone's amazement the little fire engine raced through the chemical plant gates and drove straight into the middle of the inferno. In the distance the other firemen watched as the old timers hopped off of their rig and began to fight the fire with an effort that they had never seen before. After an hour of intense fighting the volunteer company had extinguished the fire and saved the secret formulas. Joyous the chemical company president announced that he would double the reward to $200,000 and walked over to personally thank each of the volunteers. </p>
<p>After thanking each of the old men individually the president asked the group what they intended to do with the money. The fire truck driver looked him right in the eye and said - ""The first thing we're going to do is fix the blasted brakes on that truck!""</p>

"
51877,"<p>Some of us Southerners are pretty skeptical of horoscopes and the people that read them. If we are to ever fully understand all the star signs and the people they represent, we need symbols that all true Southerners understand: See the list below...</p>
<p>OKRA (Dec 22 - Jan 20) Are tough on the outside but tender on the inside. Okras have tremendous influence. An older Okra can look back over his life and see the seeds of his influence everywhere. You can do something good each day if you try.</p>
<p>CHITLIN (Jan 21 - Feb 19) Chitlins come from humble backgrounds. A Chitlin, however, will make something of himself if he is motivated and has lots of seasoning. In dealing with Chitlins, be careful they may surprise you. They can erupt like Vesuvius. Chitlins are best with Catfish and Okra.</p>
<p>BOLL WEEVIL (Feb 20 - March 20) You have an overwhelming curiosity. You're unsatisfied with the surface of things, and you feel the need to bore deep into the interior of everything. Needless to say, you are very intense and driven as if you had some inner hunger. You love to stay busy and tend to work too much. Nobody in their right mind is going to marry you, so don't worry about it.</p>
<p>MOON PIE (March 21 - April 20) You're the type that spends a lot of time on the front porch. A cinch to recognize the physical appearance of Moon Pies. Big and round are the key words here. You should marry anybody who you can get remotely interested in the idea. It's not going to be easy. You always have a big smile and are happy. This might be the year to think about aerobics. Maybe not.</p>
<p>POSSUM (April 21 - May 21) When confronted with life's difficulties, possums have a marked tendency to withdraw and develop a don't-bother-me-about-it attitude. Sometimes you become so withdrawn, people actually think you're dead. This strategy is probably not psychologically healthy but seems to work for you. You are a rare breed. Most folks love to watch you work and play. You are a night person and mind your own business.</p>
<p>CRAWFISH (May 22 - June 21) Crawfish is a water sign. If you work in an office, you're hanging around the water cooler. Crawfish prefer the beach to the mountains, the pool to the golf course, and the bathtub to the living room. You tend not to be particularly attractive physically, but you have very, very good heads.</p>
<p>COLLARDS (June 22 - July 23) Collards have a genius for communication. They love to get in the melting pot of life and share their essence with the essence of those around them. Collards make good social workers, psychologists, and baseball managers. As far as your personal life goes, if you are Collards, stay away from Crawfish. It just won't work. Save yourself a lot of heartache.</p>
<p>CATFISH (July 24 - Aug 23) Catfish are traditionalists in matters of the heart, although one's whiskers may cause problems for loved ones. You Catfish are never easy people to understand. You run fast. You work and play hard. Even though you prefer the muddy bottoms to the clear surface of life, you are liked by most. Above all else, Catfish should stay away from Moon Pies.</p>
<p>GRITS (Aug 24 - Sept 23) Your highest aim is to be with others like yourself. You like to huddle together with a big crowd of other Grits. You love to travel though, so maybe you should think about joining a club. Where do you like to go? Anywhere they have cheese, gravy, bacon, butter, or eggs and a good time. If you can go somewhere where they have all these things, that serves you well. You are pure in heart.</p>
<p>BOILED PEANUTS (Sept 24 - Oct 23) You have a passionate desire to help your fellow man. Unfortunately, those who know you best, your friends and loved ones, may find that your personality is much too salty, and their criticism will affect you deeply because you are really much softer than you appear. You should go right ahead and marry anybody you want to because in a certain way, yours is a charmed life. On the road of life, you can be sure that people will always pull over and stop for you.</p>
<p>BUTTER BEAN (Oct 24 - Nov 22) Always invite a Butter Bean to a party because Butter Beans get along well with everybody. You, as a Butter Bean, should be proud. You've grown on the vine of life, and you feel at home no matter what the setting. You can sit next to anybody. However, you, too, shouldn't have anything to do with Moon Pies.</p>
<p>ARMADILLO (Nov 23 - Dec 21) You have a tendency to develop a tough exterior, but you are actually quite gentle and kind inside. A good evening for you? Old friends, a fire, some roots, fruit, worms, and insects. You are a throwback. You're not concerned with today's fashions and trends. You're not concerned with anything about today. You're almost prehistoric in your interests and behavior patterns. You probably want to marry another Armadillo, but a Possum is another somewhat kinky mating possibility.</p>

51882,"<p>When the old golfer died, Peter met him at the gates of<br /> heaven.  ""Sorry, old man,"" Peter said, ""But I can't let you in.<br /> You see the big book here says you committed one unpardonable sin<br /> back in 1978 -- You took the Lord's name in vain during a golf game.""</p>
<p>""Oh, yes. I'll never forget that one, and I'm terribly sorry Peter,<br /> but I can explain..."", the old golfer blithered.</p>
<p>""Well,"" said Peter, ""You'll have to take it up with The Big Guy.""</p>
<p>So Peter led the old golfer down a long golden hallway, to God's<br /> office. ""We've got another code 6 here, sir! Says he can explain...""</p>
<p>""So,"" booms God, ""You've been taking my name in vain.""</p>
<p>""Only once, your Almighty, Sir. But I can explain!""</p>
<p>""OK. Try me, "" replied the Lord.</p>
<p>""Well you see sir, I was playing my best game of golf ever, and I<br /> made it to the 18th hole, and I'd win the tournament if I could<br /> just make par on this hole. I made my shot from the<br /> tee, and it was sailing beautifully, when suddenly the wind<br /> shifted, and took my ball off into the woods, and right behind<br /> this enormous oak tree...""</p>
<p>""And that's when you took my name in vain?""</p>
<p>""Oh, no, sir!  I just took out my 6 iron and knocked that ball<br /> clear out of the woods with one swing!  It was gliding beautifully<br /> toward the green, when suddenly it lost speed, and dropped into<br /> a sand trap, right smack in the middle of a deep hole...""</p>
<p>""So, that is when you took my name in vain?""</p>
<p>""No, not then.  I just took out my nine, and with one swing, drove<br /> that ball right onto the green, and it rolled within two inches of the<br /> hole...""</p>

51901,"<p>So the other day in Cleveland, a Total Blond went with friends to a 'Ladies Night Club'  [think Chippendales]. One of the women wanted to impress her pals so she pulled out a $10 bill.  The dancer came over, she licked the $10 and stuck it on his butt. Not to be outdone, the next woman pulls out a $50 bill.  She called the guy back over, licks the $50 bill, and sticks it on his other butt cheek. Now the attention is focused on The Blond.  What could she do to top that?  She got out her wallet, thought for a minute, then the 'shopper' in her took over.  She got her ATM card, swiped it down his crack, grabbed the 60 bucks, and went home.</p>

51918,"<p>A man had to go to a strange town to be the guest speaker at a business meeting. When he arrived at the Motel in town, he found that he had a lot of time before the meeting. He asked the clerk where the nearest golf course was and was given directions on how to get there.</p>
<p>While playing on the front nine, he was going over the speech in his mind and became confused as to where he was on the course. Looking around, he saw a Lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her and told her about his big meeting and the speech he was to make and his confusion about where he was on the course, asked her if she knew what hole he was playing.</p>
<p>She replied ""I'm on the 7th hole and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole.""</p>
<p>He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the back nine the same thing happened. and he approached her again with the same request.</p>
<p>She said ""I'm on the 14th, you are a hole behind me, So you must be on the 13th.""</p>
<p>Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. He finished his round and went into the club house where he saw the Lady sitting at the end of the bar. He asked the bartender if he knew the Lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. He approached her and said, ""let me buy you a drink to show my appreciation for your help. I understand that you are a sales lady, well I am in sales also. What do you sell""?</p>
<p>She replied, ""if I told you, you would only laugh."" ""No I wouldn't"", he said and persisted that she tell him what she sold.</p>
<p>""Well if you must know"", she answered, ""I sell Tampax.""</p>

"
51921,"<p>1. Never leave diskettes in the disk drive, as data can leak out of the<br /> disk and corrode the inner mechanics of the drive. Diskettes should be<br /> rolled up and stored in pencil holders. </p>
<p>2. Diskettes should be cleaned and waxed once a week. Microscopic metal<br /> particles can be removed by waving a powerful magnet over the surface of<br /> the disk. Any stubborn metallic shavings can be removed with scouring<br /> powder and soap. When waxing diskettes, make sure application is even.<br /> This will allow the diskettes to spin faster, resulting in better access<br /> time. </p>
<p>3. Do not fold diskettes unless they do not fit in the drive. ""Big""<br /> diskettes may be folded and used in ""little"" disk drives. </p>
<p>4. Never insert a disk into the drive upside down. The data can fall off<br /> the surface of the disk and jam the intricate mechanics of the drive. </p>
<p>5. Diskettes cannot be backed up by running them through the xerox<br /> machine. If your data is going to need to be backed up, simply insert two<br /> diskettes together into the drive. Whenever you update a document, the<br /> data will be recorded on both diskettes. </p>
<p>6. Diskettes should not be inserted into or removed from the drive while<br /> the red light is flashing. Doing so could result in smeared or possibly<br /> unreadable text. Occasionally the red light continues to flash in what is<br /> known as a ""hung"" or ""hooked"" state. If your system is ""hooking"" you, you<br /> will probably need to insert a few coins before being allowed to access<br /> the disk drive. </p>
<p>7. If your diskette is full and you need more storage space, remove the<br /> disk from the drive and shake vigorously for two minutes. This will pack<br /> the data enough (Data Compression) to allow for more storage. Be sure to<br /> cover all the openings with scotch tape to prevent loss of data. </p>
<p>8. Data access time can be greatly improved by cutting more holes in the<br /> diskette jacket. This will provide more simultaneous access points to the<br /> disk. </p>
<p>9.Diskettes can be used as coasters for beverage glasses, provided they<br /> have been properly waxed beforehand. Be sure to wipe the diskettes dry<br /> before inserting into drive. (see item #2 above.) </p>
<p>10. Never use scissors and glue to manually edit documents. The data<br /> stored is much too small to be seen with the naked eye, and you may end up<br /> with data from some other document stuck in the middle of your document.<br /> Razor blades and scotch tape may be used, provided the user is equipped<br /> with an electron microscope. </p>
<p>11. Periodically spray diskettes with insecticide to prevent system bugs<br /> from spreading.</p>

I noticed him as I walked by and could tell he had flown before because his seeing eye dog lay quietly underneath the seats in front of him throughout the entire flight.  I could also tell he had flown this very flight before because the pilot approached him and, calling him by name, said, ""Keith, we're in Sacramento for almost an hour. Would you like to get off and stretch your legs?""Keith replied, ""No thanks, but maybe my dog would like to stretch his legs. Would you take him for me please?""Now picture this.

51947,"<p>A snake and a rabbit were racing along a pair of intersecting forest pathways one day, when they collided at the intersection. They immediately began to argue with one another as to who was at fault for the mishap. When the snake remarked that he had been blind since birth, and thus should be given additional leeway, the rabbit said that he, too, had been blind since birth. The two animals then forgot about the collision and began commiserating concerning the problems of being blind. The snake said that his greatest regret was the loss of his identity. He had never been able to see his reflection in the water, and for that reason did not know exactly what he looked like, or even what he was. The rabbit declared that he had the same problem. Seeing a way that they could help each other, the rabbit proposed that one feel the other from head to toe, and then try to describe what the other animal was. The snake agreed, and started by winding himself around the rabbit. After a few moments, he announced, ""You've got very soft, fuzzy fur, long ears, big rear feet, and a little fuzzy ball for a tail. I think that you must be a bunny rabbit!"" The rabbit was much relieved to find his identity, and proceeded to return the favor to the snake. After feeling about the snake's body for a few minutes, he asserted, ""Well, you're scaly, you're slimy, you've got beady little eyes, you squirm and slither all the time, and you've got a forked tongue. I think you're a lawyer!""</p>

51948,"<p>The manager of a ladies' dress shop realized it was time to give<br /> one her sales clerks a little talk. ""Alice, your figures are<br /> well below any of our other salespeople's. In fact, unless you<br /> can improve your record soon, I'm afraid I'll have to let you<br /> go.""</p>
<p>""I'm sorry, Ma'am,"" said a humbled Alice. ""Can you give me any<br /> advice on how to do better?""</p>
<p>""Well, there is an old trick I can tell you about. It sounds<br /> silly, but it's worked for me in the past. Get hold of a<br /> dictionary and go through it until you come to a word that had<br /> particular power for you. Memorize it, work it into your sales<br /> pitch whenever it seems appropriate, and you'll be amazed at the<br /> results.""</p>
<p>Sure enough, Alice's sales figures went way up, and at the end<br /> of the month, the manager called her in again and congratulated<br /> her. ""Did you try my little trick?"" she asked.</p>
<p>Alice nodded. ""It took me a whole weekend to find the right<br /> word, but I did: 'fantastic.'""</p>
<p>""'Fantastic.' What a good word,"" said the manager encouragingly.<br /> ""How've you been using it?""</p>
<p>""Well, my first customer on Monday was a woman who told me her<br /> little girl had just been accepted at the most exclusive prep<br /> school in the city. I said, 'Fantastic.' She went on to tell me<br /> how her daughter always got straight A's and was the most<br /> popular girl in her class, I said 'Fantastic' and she bought<br /> $300 worth of clothing. My next customer said she needed a<br /> formal dress for the spring ball at the country club, which she<br /> was in charge of. I said 'Fantastic.' She went on to tell she<br /> had the best figure of anyone on the committee and her husband<br /> makes the most money. I said 'Fantastic' and she not only bought<br /> the designer gown, but hundreds of dollars of other merchandise.<br /> It's been like that all week: the customers keep boasting, I<br /> keep saying 'Fantastic', and they keep buying.""</p>
<p>""Excellent work, Alice,"" complimented her boss. ""Just as a point<br /> of interest, what did you say to customers before you discovered<br /> your power word?""</p>
<p>Alice shrugged. ""I used to say, 'Who gives a damn?'""</p>

<p>He opens the first envelope and finds a letter from his predecessor saying:<br /> ""These three envelopes will save you a world of trouble. In case of emergency,<br /> please open these envelopes in sequential order; envelope one first, envelope<br /> two second, and envelope three third.""</p>
<p>The manager shrugs, puts the envelopes back, and forgets about them.</p>
<p>Six months later, the workers go on strike. The company closes, and is losing<br /> money fast.</p>
<p>After a lengthy day negotiating with the union, he remembers the 3 envelopes.<br /> So he opens the first one and it says: ""Blame me, your predecessor for<br /> everything"". </p>
<p>Wonderful idea he thinks, and indeed it works and the crisis comes to its end.<br /> His job is saved, and everybody's happy.</p>
<p>A few month later, another strike hits. He goes to the drawer and opens the<br /> second envelope. It reads, ""Blame the government for everything"". </p>
<p>It works like a charm, and he breathes a sigh of relief as his job is, once<br /> again, saved.</p>
<p>A month later the workers declare another strike. The manager goes directly to<br /> the third envelope and it reads, ""Prepare 4 new envelopes"".</p>

51973,"<p>The not necessarily well-prepared student sat in his life science classroom staring at a question on the final exam paper. The question directed: ""Give four advantages of breast milk.""What to write? He sighed, and began to scribble whatever came into his head, hoping for the best:    1. No need to boil.    2. Cats can't steal it.    3. Available whenever necessary.Ummm... So far so good... maybe... But the exam demanded a four-part answer. Again, what to write? Once more, he sighed. He frowned. He scowled, then sighed again. But suddenly, he brightened. He grabbed his pen, and triumphantly, he scribbled his definitive answer:    4. Available in attractive containers.</p>
