<p>The theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into women. To test the finding, 100 men were fed eight pints of beer each. It was then observed that 100 percent of the men gained weight, talked excessively without making sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally, argued over nothing and refused to apologize when wrong.</p>

11049,"<p>Theorem: All positive integers are equal.Proof: Sufficient to show that for any two positive integers, A and B, A = B.Further, it is sufficient to show that for all N &gt; 0, if A and B (positive integers) satisfy (MAX(A, B) = N) then A = B.Proceed by induction.If N = 1, then A and B, being positive integers, must both be 1. So A = B.Assume that the theorem is true for some value k.  Take A and B with MAX(A, B) = k+1.  Then  MAX((A-1), (B-1)) = k.  And hence (A-1) = (B-1).  Consequently, A = B.</p>

<p>The fellow replies, ""well I've got these two horses (sniff, sniff), and<br /> well... I can't tell them apart. I don't know if I'm mixing up riding times or<br /> even feeding them the right foods."" </p>
<p>The bartender, feeling sorry for the guy, tries to think of something he can<br /> do. ""Why don't you try shaving the tail of one of the horses?"" </p>
<p>The man stops crying and says, ""that sounds like a good idea, I think I'll try<br /> it�. </p>
<p>A few months later he comes back to the bar in worse condition than he was<br /> before. ""What's the matter now?"" the bartender asks. </p>
<p>The fellow, in no condition to be in public, answers, ""I shaved the tail of<br /> one of the horses (sob, sob), but it grew back and I can't tell them apart<br /> again!"" </p>
<p>The bartender, now just wanting him to shut up or leave says, ""Why don't you<br /> try shaving the mane, maybe that will not grow back�. </p>
<p>The fellow stops crying, has a few drinks, and leaves. A few months later the<br /> fellow is back in the bar. The bartender has never seen anybody in this sorry of<br /> a state. Without the bartender even asking the fellow breaks into his problems.<br /> ""I. I shaved the (sob) mane of one of the (sniff) horses, and. it... it... grew<br /> back!"" </p>
<p>The bartender, now furious at the guy's general stupidity, yells, ""For crying<br /> out loud, just measure the stupid horses. Perhaps one is slightly taller that<br /> the other one!"" The fellow cannot believe what the bartender has said and storms<br /> out of the bar. </p>
<p>The next day the fellow comes running back into the bar as if he had just won<br /> the lottery. ""It worked, it worked!"" he exclaims. ""I measured the horses and the<br /> black one is two inches taller than the white one!""</p>

11099,"<p>One day a mime is visiting the zoo and attempts to earn some money as a<br /> street performer. As soon as he starts to draw a crowd, the zoo keeper<br /> grabs him and drags him into his office.</p>
<p>The zoo keeper explains to the mime that the zoo's most popular<br /> attraction, a gorilla, died suddenly and the keeper fears that attendance<br /> at the zoo will fall off. He offers the mime a job to dress up as the<br /> gorilla until they can get another one. The mime accepts.</p>
<p>So the next morning before the crowd arrives the mime puts on the gorilla<br /> suit and enters the cage. He discovers that it's a great job. He can sleep<br /> all he wants, play and make fun of people and he draws larger crowds than<br /> he ever did as a mime on the street.</p>
<p>However, eventually the crowd tires of him and he tires of just swinging<br /> on auto tires. He notices that the people are paying more attention to the<br /> lion in the next cage. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience,<br /> he climbs to the top of his cage, crawls across a partition, and dangles<br /> from the top of the lion's cage. Of course, this makes the lion furious,<br /> but the crowd loves it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and<br /> gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction.</p>
<p>Well, this goes on for some time, the mime keeps taunting the lion, the<br /> crowd grows larger, and his salary keeps going up.</p>
<p>Then one day when he is dangling over the top of the lion's cage, he slips<br /> and falls. The mime is terrified. The lion raises himself up and prepares<br /> to pounce. The mime is so scared that he begins to run around the cage<br /> with the lion in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>Finally, the mime starts screaming and yelling, ""Help! Help me!""</p>
<p>The lion is quick and pounces. The mime soon finds himself flat on his<br /> back looking up at the angry lion.</p>
<p>The lion says, ""Shut up you idiot or we'll both lose our jobs!""</p>

"
11118,"<p>Here are some actual statements by several airline flights crews, and occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the ""In-flight safety lecture"" a bit more entertaining. Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported. </p>
<p>""As we prepare for takeoff, please make sure your tray tables and seat backs are fully upright in their most uncomfortable position."" </p>
<p>""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane..."" </p>
<p>""Your seat cushions can be used for flotation, and in the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments."" </p>
<p>""We do feature a smoking section on this flight; if you must smoke, contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort you to the wing of the airplane."" </p>
<p>""Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane immediately."" </p>
<p>Pilot - ""Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land... it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern."" </p>
<p>And, after landing: ""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride."" </p>
<p>As we waited just off the runway for another airliner to cross in front of us, some of the passengers were beginning to retrieve luggage from the overhead bins. The lead attendant announced on the intercom, ""This aircraft is equipped with a video surveillance system that monitors the cabin during taxiing. Any passengers not remaining in their seats until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop at the gate will be strip-searched as they leave the aircraft."" </p>
<p>Once on a Southwest flight, the pilot said, ""We've reached our cruising altitude now, and I'm turning off the seat belt sign. I'm switching on the auto pilot, too, so I can come back there and visit with all of you for the rest of the flight."" </p>
<p>As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice came over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella.WHOA..!"" </p>
<p>""Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting children or adults acting like children."" </p>
<p>""As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses."" </p>
<p>""Last one off the plane must clean it."" </p>
<p>And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry... Unfortunately none of them are on this flight!"" </p>
<p>This is an actual joke I heard on Southwest Airlines, just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City; one of the most bone jarring I've experienced,. the flight attendant came on the intercom and said, ""That was quite a bump and I know what ya'll are thinking. I'm here to tell you, it wasn't the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendants' fault...it was the asphalt!"" </p>
<p>From an apparently disgruntled Southwest Airlines employee.... ""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX, to ABC. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt, and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. Id you are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love most."" </p>
<p>""The weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive."" </p>
<p>""Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest Airlines.""</p>
<p>Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach the Captain was really having to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA and announced, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate."" </p>
<p>Another Flight Attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask that you please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.""</p>

11125,"<p>A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist named Jon complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them.""Not very long,"" answered the Mexican.""But then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?"" asked Jon.The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family.Mr. Berg asked, ""But what do you do with the rest of your time?""""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and fuck the shit out of my wife. In the evenings I go into the village to see my friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, get a quick blowjob and sing a few songs. I have a full life.""Our intrepid Mr. Berg interrupted, ""I have a M.BA. from Stanford and I can help you.You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers. Instead of selling your fish to a middle man, you can negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant. You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los Angeles, or even New Jersey! From there you can direct your huge enterprise.""""How long would that take?"" asked the Mexican.""Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years,"" replied Jon.""And after that?""""Afterwards? That's when it gets really interesting,"" answered Jon, laughing. ""When your business gets really big, you can start selling stocks and make millions!""""Millions? Really? And after that?""""After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, fuck the shit out of your wife, and spend your evenings drinking and playing the guitar with your friends!""</p>

<p>The woman notices his erection, comes over to him grinning sweetly and says: ""Sir, did you call for me?"" Bob replies: ""No, what do you mean?"" She says: ""You must be new here; let me explain. It's a rule here that if I give you an erection, it implies you called for me."" Smiling, she then leads him to the side of a pool, lays down on a towel, eagerly pulls him to her and happily lets him have his way with her.</p>
<p>Bob continues exploring the facilities. He enters a sauna, sits down, and farts. Within a few seconds a huge, horribly corpulent, hairy man with a firm erection lumbers out of the steam towards him. The Huge Man says: ""Sir, did you call for me?"" Bob replies: ""No, what do you mean?"" The Huge Man: ""You must be new here; it is a rule that when you fart, it implies you called for me."" The huge man then easily spins Bob around, bends him over the bench and has his way with him.</p>
<p>Bob rushes back to the colony office. He is greeted by the smiling naked receptionist: ""May I help you?"" Bob says: ""Here is your card and key back. You can keep the $500 joining fee.""

11142,"<p>Once there was an explorer lost in the deepest part of the Amazon. After a<br /> few days, he finds himself suddenly surrounded by hundreds of<br /> blood-thirsty natives. He looks up to the sky and says, ""Oh my God, I'm<br /> screwed!!"" All of a sudden, the sky opens up, and then there is a beam of<br /> light streaming down on him, and a voice booms out, ""No, you are NOT<br /> screwed. Pick up that stone at your foot, and smash it onto the skull of<br /> the chief."" So the explorer looks down, and sees the stone. He picks it<br /> up, and bash the life out of the cheif, who is standing right in front of<br /> him. And he stands on the chief, triumphant, puffing and puffing, with the<br /> bloody stone in his hand. And the chief is down on the ground, bleeding<br /> and lifeless, with his tribesmen in shock and disbelief. Now, the sky<br /> opens up once again, and the voice booms out... ""NOW, you're screwed.""</p>

11143,"<p>A herd of buffalo can move only as fast as the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular culling of the weakest members. </p>
<p>In much the same way the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills off brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.</p>

11144,"<p>This fellow had been suffering from excruciating headaches for some time, and finally went to a doctor. After a thorough exam, the physician called the fellow into his office and said, ""Well, I'm not exactly sure what is causing your headaches, but we've found a cure for them: you'll have to be castrated.""</p>
<p>The man, needless to say, was taken aback, and told his doctor that he believed he would try to bear the pain. But as time went on, the headaches only got worse, and finally, the poor fellow was driven back to the doctor.</p>
<p>""All right, I guess I'll have the operation,"" he said.</p>
<p>When it was all over, the man was understandably depressed, and his physician told him, ""I recommend you begin life anew. Start over from this point.""</p>
<p>So the man decided to take the advice and went to a men's shop for a new set of clothes. The proprietor said, ""Starting with the suit, looks like you take about a 38-regular.""</p>
<p>""That's right,"" exclaimed the man, ""How'd you know?""</p>
<p>""Well, when you've been in the business as long as I have, you get pretty good at sizing a man up,"" replied the salesman. ""Now, for a shirt, looks like about a 15 long.""</p>
<p>""Right again,"" the man said.</p>
<p>The proprietor suggested, ""And for undershorts, I'd say a size 36.""<br /> ""There's your first mistake,"" the man said, ""I've worn 34's for years.""</p>
<p>""No, you're a size 36 if I've ever seen one,"" said the owner.<br /> The man replied, ""I ought to know what size undershorts I wear, and I'll take 34.""</p>
<p>The owner replied, ""Well all right, if you insist, but they're going to pinch your balls and give you headaches!!""</p>

<p>It was summer holidays for the children and the parents were all<br /> working, so, just to let the kids play they decided to leave<br /> them all at their grandparents [just a reminder aged 66 and 70]<br /> for thursday and friday every week until they had stopped the<br /> working year and gone on holidays.</p>
<p>The children knew that their grandparents were over protective,<br /> and also liked to chat a lot. So when the first day came, they<br /> sat themselves down on the couch to watch some TV.<br /> ""NO NO NO! you cant just sit in front of the TV all day, you<br /> have to go outside FIRST just for a little bit."" lectured the<br /> grandmother.<br /> the grandfather had left just a few minutes earlier and wouldnt<br /> have objected to TV, it was peace and quiet for him.</p>
<p>So the kids went outside to find something to do. Andrew, the<br /> oldest son of the oldest son, was bored and didnt want to play<br /> anything, so he sat down and read a book. The other 3 had a<br /> water fight with water pistols and water bombs and everything!<br /> When the grandmother came out, she cracked a fit and let them<br /> all watch TV.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes later, the grandmother returned and said to<br /> Andrew, the oldest,<br /> ""Now Andrew, you've got 3 children in your hands now!""<br /> ""oh Gosh!"" exclaims Andrew.<br /> ""Because im going out and you HAVE to be responsible!""<br /> ""Yeah whatever""<br /> ""WHATEVER!??!?!?! its not just WHATEVER, its 3 children, YOU<br /> have to be responsible for them, you're nearly 16!""<br /> ""and ill be driving soon, away, FAR away.""<br /> ""You should learn to be responsible!""<br /> any way this continues for about another hour and finally when<br /> the grandmother is satisfyed that Andrew will be responsible,<br /> she ends it:<br /> ""fine, im going now.""<br /> ""Grandma, where are you going?""asks the youngest one.<br /> ""To the letter box, to check the mail.""</p>

11161,"<p>I, THE UNDERSIGNED, AGREE THAT...<br /> 1. In the unlikely event of my not having an orgasm after you've drunkenly rolled on top of me and pumped away for five minutes, wheezing like an old man with emphysema, I shall politely fake one. And it'll be a really good act too, with me saying stuff like ""So THIS is screwing!"" and howling like a cat that's being repeatedly jabbed with a needle. </p>
<p>2. I fully understand that a woman's main role in any relationship is to take the blame. So when you stub your toe in the bathroom or your football teams lose, I agree that - by some complex scientific equation incomprehensible to woman - it will be my fault. Even if I wasn't there. </p>
<p>3. Whenever my friends and I get together for a girlie chat, I will tell them that you are better hung than a large-balled Himalayan yak. </p>
<p>4. And I will also mention this to YOUR friends. A lot. </p>
<p>5. After sex (which I will NEVER refer to as ""making love""), I will not expect you to cuddle me for hours till your arm goes dead. Nor will I let my hair annoyingly get in your face. </p>
<p>6. I will never, ever give your penis a ""cute"" nickname. </p>
<p>7. In bed, I will be happy as can be to try any novel sexual position you fancy. Especially ones where I do all the work and you just lie there, grinning. </p>
<p>8. I will ruthlessly interrogate my attractive female friends and inform you if any of them have the slightest bisexual tendencies. Then I'll invite them around for dinner. And hide their car keys so they have to stay. </p>
<p>9. After we split up, I will never sleep with any of your friends or colleagues. Or anyone else you have ever met. Or may one day meet. And if men attempt to chat me up, I will solemnly inform them that you have ""ruined me for other men."" </p>
<p>10. I understand that mechanical objects like cars, computers, and remote control devices are beyond the comprehension of women. I will only make a fool of myself if I attempt to operate them, so you're in charge of the lot. Except for the oven, iron and the washing machine, of course. </p>

<p>The dealer tells him, ""Look, I have a lot of models, but why<br /> don't you save yourself a lot of time and aggravation and get<br /> the top-of- the-line model. This chainsaw will cut a hundred<br /> cords of wood for you in one day.""</p>

<p>He says, ""I was coming home from work one day early, and when I walked in the door, I had a strange suspicion that my wife was cheating on me.  I walk into our room and surely enough, find her sprawled out nekkid alone on our bed.  Sure that the guy was in the house, I searched frantically to find him... Under the bed, in the closet... Finally I found him hanging from our ledge on our balcony.  Furious, I stepped on his hand and he went plummetting two stories down.  However, he landed in a bush and I wasn't sure if he was dead yet.  So I lifted the refrigerator and tossed it onto him.  Later, I felt so guilty I committed suicide.""</p>

Soon, he sees another sign which says SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION - 5 MILES and realizes that these signs are for real.  When he drives past a third sign saying SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION NEXT RIGHT, his curiosity gets the best of him and he pulls into the drive.On the far side of the parking lot is a somber stone building with a small sign next to the door reading SISTERS OF MERCY.  He climbs the steps and rings the bell.  The door is answered by a nun in a long black habit who asks, ""What may we do for you, my son?""  He answers, ""I saw your signs along the highway, and was interested in possibly doing business.""""Very well, my son.  Please follow me."" He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented.  The nun stops at a closed door, and tells the man, ""Please knock on this door"".  He does as he is told and this door is answered by another nun in a long habit and holding a tin cup.  This nun instructs, ""Please place $50 in the cup, then go through the large wooden door at the end of this hallway.""  He gets $50 out of his wallet and places it in the second nun's cup.  He trots eagerly down the hall and slips through the door, pulling it shut behind him.  As the door locks behind him, he finds himself back in the parking lot, facing another small sign: GO IN PEACE, YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SCREWED BY THE SISTERS OF MERCY.</p>

As the<br /> final hour approachs, each man is trying to think of a way to escape his<br /> inevitable doom.  The time comes for the execution and the American is<br /> brought first in front of the firing squad.  As the blindfold is being tied<br /> around his head, he decides that he will attempt his escape by diverting<br /> the attention of his executioners at the final moment, and then running<br /> away.</p>
<p>The officer in charge of the executions starts his countdown: ""10, 9, 8,......""</p>
<p>Just before the officer reaches ""1,"" the American shouts,<br /> ""Flood!""</p>
<p>Startled, all of the gunmen look up from their rifles and turn around<br /> searching for the onrush of water.  In all of this confusion, the American<br /> manages to take off his blindfold and run away.  By the time the<br /> executioners are aware of what happened, the American has made his way deep<br /> into the woods.  And, of course, for the purposes of this joke, no attempt<br /> is made to catch the runaway.</p>
<p>The German is called on next to appear before the squad. Seeing the<br /> American's success, the German decides to attempt a similar escape. He<br /> knows, though, that his executioners will not fall for the 'flood' trick<br /> Again. Instead, he decides to use another natural disaster.</p>

11199,"<p>It seems that The Count on Sesame Street was giving a lecture on his<br /> thoughts on Godel's Theorem and there was a great need for extra transportation<br /> services to this event. After all, people like Gordon, Bob, Maria, Mr. Hooper,<br /> and all can only take so much of the ""Which is not like the other"" mentality.<br /> Anyway, since the Speedy Delivery Service run by Mr.McFeeley (what a name for<br /> a character on a children's show!) was being pushed out of Mr. Roger's<br /> Neighborhood by Federal Express, he thought he would sign on as a bus driver<br /> for the Sesame Street Bus Company. Besides, he was do for another trip to the<br /> Magic Kingdom and that was getting expensive these days. </p>
<p>        On the morning of the big event he kissed his wife goodbye and hopped<br /> onto his bus and began driving his route. At the first stop there were two<br /> rather plump twins, so he stopped. As they got on he said ""Hi there! Welcome to<br /> the Sesame St. bus! I'm Mr. McFeeley, who are you?"" The twins said ""We're<br /> named Patty"" and they then waddled to their seats. He started to drive and at<br /> the next stop he saw a rather dejected looking man and stopped to pick him up.<br /> ""Hi there"", said Mr. McFeeley,""why do you look so said?"" The man said, "" I have<br /> no friends and I'm terribly lonely."" With that Mr. Mcfeeley replied,""what is<br /> your name?"" The man replied, ""Saul"". ""Well, you can be my special friend Saul"",<br /> said Mr. McFeeley. The man looked much happier and skipped to his seat. Mr.<br /> McFeeley then went on his way to the next bus stop and saw two men waiting,<br /> though one looked rather familiar. He stopped and gave his greeting to the<br /> first man. Mr. McFeeley learned that his name was Lester Cheese. Mr. McFeeley<br /> then recognized the other man to be Don Rickles. Apparently he looked to be<br /> in some kind of pain. ""Welcome to the Sesame Street Bus Mr. Rickles! You look<br /> like you're in a lot of pain."" ""That's right, I've got bunyons you hockey puck!""<br /> And with that Mr. McFeeley completed his route to the symposium.</p>
<p> When Mr. McFeeley returned home his wife said, ""How did it go today<br /> dear?"" Mr. McFeeley replied, ""Just great! I had two obese Patties, a special<br /> friend Saul, Lester Cheese, and Don Rickles with Bunyons all on the Sesame<br /> Bus!"" They then took their valium and went to the Magic Kingdom.</p>

11243,"<p>A very drunk man goes into a bar and orders a drink. The bartender serves him and asks him if he would like to try the bar game of darts. Three in the bullseye and win a prize.. Only a dollar for three darts.<br /> The drunk agrees and throws the first dart. A bullseye!! Downs another drink, takes aim on wobbly feet, lets go...Two bulls eyes!!!! Two more quick drinks go down. Barely able to stand, he lets go with the last dart. </p>
<p>Three bulls eyes!!! </p>
<p>All are astounded. No one has ever won. The bartender searches for a prize... grabs a turtle from the bar's terrarium and presents it to the drunk as his prize. </p>
<p>Three weeks pass... The drunk returns and orders more drinks, then announces he would like to try the dart game again. To the total amazement and wonderment of all the local drunks, he scores three more bulls eyes and demands his prize. </p>
<p>The bartender, being a sort of drunk himself, and a bit short of memory, doesn't know what to give, and he asks the drunk "" Say, what did you win the last time?"" </p>
<p>And the drunk responds ""A roast beef sandwich on a hard roll!""</p>

<p>They begin talking. After about five minutes Saddam presses the first button. A boxing glove springs out of a box on the desk and punches Clinton in the face. </p>
<p>Confused, Clinton carries on talking as Saddam laughs. </p>

11255,"<p>1. If they want to loan you money, tell them you just filed for bankruptcy and you could sure use some money. Ask, ""How long can I keep it? Do I have to ever pay it back, or is it like the other money I borrowed before my bankruptcy?""</p>
<p>2. If they start out with, ""How are you today?"" say, ""Why do you want to know?"" Or you can say, ""I'm so glad you asked, because no one seems to care these days and I have all these problems, my sciatica is acting up, my eyelashes are sore, my dog just died . . ."" When they try to get back to the sales process, just continue on with telling about your problems. </p>
<p>3. If the person says he's Joe Doe from the XYZ Company, ask him to spell his name, then ask him to spell the company name, then ask where it is located. Continue asking personal questions or questions about the company for as long as necessary.</p>
<p>4. This one works better if you are male: Telemarketer: ""Hi, my name is Judy and I'm with Canter and Siegel services....<br /> You: ""Hang on a second."" (few seconds pause) ""Okay, (in a really husky voice) what are you wearing?""</p>
<p>5. Crying out, in well-simulated tones of pleasure and surprise, ""Judy!! Is this really you? I can't believe it! Judy, how have you BEEN?"" Hopefully, this will give Judy a few brief moments of terror as she tries to figure out where the heck she could know you from.</p>
<p>6. Say, ""No,"" over and over. Be sure to vary the sound of each no, and keep an even tempo even as they're trying to speak. This is the most fun if you can keep going until they hang up.</p>
<p>7. If MCI calls trying to get you to sign up with their Family and Friends plan, reply, in as sinister a voice as you can muster, ""I don't have any friends . . . would you be my friend?""</p>
<p>8. If they clean rugs: ""Can you get blood out, you can? Well, how about goat blood or HUMAN blood - chicken blood too?""</p>
<p>9. Let the person go through their spiel, providing minimal but necessary feedback in the form of an occasional ""Uh-huh, really, or, ""That's fascinating."" Finally, when they ask you to buy, ask them to marry you. They get all flustered, but just tell them you couldn't give your credit card number to someone who's a complete stranger.</p>
<p>10. Tell them you work for the same company they work for.<br /> Example: Telemarketer: ""This is Bill from Watertronics.""<br /> You: ""Watertronics!! Hey I work for them too. Where are you&lt; calling from?""<br /> Telemarketer: ""Uh, Dallas, Texas.""<br /> You: ""Great, they have a group there too? How's business/the weather? Too bad the company has a policy against selling to employees! Oh well, see ya.""</p>
<p>11. Tell the Telemarketer you are busy and if they will give you their phone number you will call them back. If they say they are not allowed to give out their number, then ask them for their home number and tell them you will call them at home (this is usually the most effective method of getting rid of Telemarketers). If the person says, ""Well, I don't really want to get a call at home,"" say, ""Yeah! Now you know how I feel."" (smiling, of course...)</p>

11261,"<p>A married couple went to he hospital to have their baby delivered.  Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine  that would transfer a portion of the mother's labour pain to the father.He asked if they were willing to try it out.  They were both very much in favour of it.  The doctor set the pain transfer dial to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before.But as the labour progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch.  The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer.  The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing.At this point they decided to try for 50%.The husband continued to feel quite well.  Since it was obviously helping out his wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him.  The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.She and her husband were ecstatic.  When they got home, the mailman was dead on their porch.</p>

It can cause excessive sweating and vomiting<br /> 2. It is a major component of acid rain<br /> 3. It can cause severe burns in its gaseous state<br /> 4. Accidental inhalation can kill you<br /> 5. It contributes to erosion<br /> 6. It decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes<br /> 7. It has been found in tumors of terminal cancer<br /> He asked fifty people if they supported a ban of the<br /> chemical. </p>

I want to thank you for flying with us today, and I hope you enjoy your stay in Toronto.  He forgets to switch off the intercom. The whole plane can now hear the conversation from the cockpit.

11325,"<p>Hi Erma,This perfectly delightful note is being sent on paper I made myself to tell you what I have been up to. Since it snowed last night, I got up early and made a sled with old barn wood and a glue gun. I hand painted it in gold leaf, got out my loom, and made a blanket in peaches and mauves. Then to make the sled complete, I made a white horse to pull it, from DNA that I had just sitting around in my craft room.By then, it was time to start making the place mats and napkins for my 20 breakfast guests. I'm serving the old standard Stewart twelve-course breakfast, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I didn't have time to make the tables and chairs this morning, so I used the ones I had on hand.Before I moved the table into the dining room, I decided to add just a touch of the holidays. So I repainted the room in pinks and stenciled gold stars on the ceiling. Then, while the homemade bread was rising, I took antique candle molds and made the dishes (exactly the same shade of pink) to use for breakfast. These were made from Hungarian clay, which you can get at almost any Hungarian craft store.Well, I must run. I need to finish the buttonholes on the dress I'm wearing for breakfast. I'll get out the sled and drive this note to the post office as soon as the glue dries on the envelope I'll be making. Hope my breakfast guests don't stay too long, I have 40,000 cranberries to string with bay leaves before my speaking engagement at noon. It's a good thing.Love, Martha StewartP.S. When I made the ribbon for this typewriter, I used 1/8-inch gold gauze. I soaked the gauze in a mixture of white grapes and blackberries which I grew, picked, and crushed last week just for fun.Response from Erma Bombeck:Dear Martha, I'm writing this on the back of an old shopping list, pay no attention to the coffee and jelly stains. I'm 20 minutes late getting my daughter up for school, packing a lunch with one hand, on the phone with the dog pound, seems old Ruff needs bailing out again. Burnt my arm on the curling iron when I was trying to make those cute curly fries, how DO they do that? Still can't find the scissors to cut out some snowflakes, tried using an old disposable razor ... trashed the tablecloth. Tried that cranberry thing, frozen cranberries mushed up after I defrosted them in the microwave. Oh, and don't use Fruity Pebbles as a substitute in that Rice Krispie snowball recipe, unless you happen to like a disgusting shade that resembles puke! The smoke alarm is going off, talk to ya later. Love, Erma</p>

11330,"<p>A young man wished to buy a pair of gloves for his sweetheart's birthday. So he went to an expensive boutique, bought the finest gloves available, and asked the saleswoman to have them delivered with a note. </p>
<p>While wrapping up the gloves, a clerk accidentally mixed up the order and sent a pair of panties instead. </p>
<p>Here is the note the young man wrote to his sweetheart: Darling, I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but because your sister wears the short ones that are so easy to remove, I decided to get the same style for you. Although these are a delicate shade, the lady I bought them from showed me a pair she had been wearing for three weeks, and they hardly soiled. I had the sales girl try them on for me and she really looked smart... I wish I could be there to put them on for you for the first time. No doubt, many other hands will touch them before I see you again. When you take them off, remember to blow on them before putting them away, as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. And be sure to keep them on while cleaning them so they won't shrink. Just think how many times I will kiss then during the coming year! I hope you like them and will wear them for me on Friday night. </p>
<p>All my love, Hollingsworth </p>
<p>P.S. The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing.</p>

11332,"<p>Many people are at a loss for a response when someone gives them that quaint American phrase,<br /> 'You don't know Jack Schitt.' </p>
<p>This is how to handle the situation.</p>
<p>Jack is the only son of Awe Schitt and 0. Schitt. </p>
<p>The fertilizer magnate married 0. Schitt, the owner of Knee-Deep Schitt Inc. </p>
<p>In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt and the deeply religious couple produced six children, Holie Schitt, The twins Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Giva Schitt and Bull Schitt, a high school dropout.</p>
<p>Noe later married Mr Sherlock and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock.</p>
<p>Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt and they produced a cowardly son, Chicken Schitt. Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt were inseparable throughout childhood and consequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony.</p>
<p>The Schitt-Happens children are Dawg, Byrd, and Horse. Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned with his bride, Pisa Schitt.</p>
<p>Now, when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt!' You can correct them.</p>

11353,"<p>Jack was going to be married to Jill, so his father sat him down for a little fireside chat......  </p>
<p>He says ""Jack, let me tell you something. On my wedding night in our honeymoon suite, I took off my pants and handed them to your mother,        and said, here - try these on.""  </p>
<p>So, she did and said, ""These are too big, I can't wear them"". </p>
<p>I replied, ""...exactly. I wear the pants in this family and I always will. Ever since that night we have never had any problems.""        </p>
<p>""Hmmm,"" says Jack. He thinks that might be a good thing to try.</p>
<p>So on his honeymoon, Jack takes off his pants and says to Jill, ""Here try these on."" </p>
<p>So she does and says, ""these are too large, they don't fit me.""</p>
<p>Jack says, ""...exactly. I wear the pants in this family and I always will, and I don't want you to ever forget that.""</p>
<p>Then Jill takes off her pants and hands them to Jack and says, ""Here, you try on mine."" </p>
<p>So he does and says, ""I can't get into your pants."" </p>

<p>Disadvantages: User might have translated document to Navajo without<br /> meaning to.</p>
<p>Symptoms: More than six stopped jobs in UNIX, a 2:1 code-to-letter ratio<br /> in WordPerfect</p>
<p>Real Case: One user came in complaining that his WordPerfect document was<br /> underlined. When I used reveal codes on it, I found that he'd set and<br /> unset underline more than fifty times in his document. </p>

<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Princess (unfair, perhaps, as these tend, overwhelmingly, to be males) ""I<br /> need a Mac, and someone's got the one I like reserved, would you please<br /> garrote him and put him in the paper recycling bin?"" </p>

11384,"<p>A wise old gentleman retired and purchased a modest home near a junior high<br /> school. He spent the first few weeks of his retirement in peace and contentment.<br /> Then a new school year began. The very next afternoon three young boys, full of<br /> youthful, after-school enthusiasm, came down his street, beating merrily on<br /> every trashcan they encountered. The crashing percussion continued day after<br /> day, until finally the wise old man decided it was time to take some action.<br /> The next afternoon, he walked out to meet the young percussionists as they<br /> banged their way down the street. Stopping them, he said, ""You kids are a lot of<br /> fun. I like to see you express your exuberance like that. In fact, I used to do<br /> the same thing when I was your age. Will you do me a favor? I'll give you each a<br /> dollar if you'll promise to come around every day and do your thing."" </p>
<p>The kids were elated and continued to do a bang-up job on the trashcans. </p>
<p>After a few days, the old-timer greeted the kids again, but this time he had a<br /> sad smile on his face. ""This recession's really putting a big dent in my<br /> income,"" he told them. ""From now on, I'll only be able to pay you 50 cents to<br /> beat on the cans."" </p>
<p>The noisemakers were obviously displeased, but they accepted his offer and<br /> continued their afternoon ruckus. A few days later, the wily retiree approached<br /> them again as they drummed their way down the street. </p>
<p>""Look,"" he said, ""I haven't received my Social Security check yet, so I'm not<br /> going to be able to give you more than 25 cents. Will that be okay?"" </p>
<p>""A freaking' quarter?"" the drum leader exclaimed. ""If you think we're going to<br /> waste our time, beating these cans around for a quarter, you're nuts! No way,<br /> dude. We quit!"" And the old man enjoyed peace and serenity for the rest of his<br /> days.</p>

My husband's home early!""""I can't jump out the window!"" came the strangled reply from beneath the sheets, ""It's raining out there!""""If my husband catches us in here, he'll kill us both!"" she replied. ""He's got a very quick temper and a very large gun! The rain is the least of your problems.""So the boyfriend scoots out of bed, grabs his clothes and jumps out the window! As he begins running down the street in the pouring rain, he quickly discovers he has run right into the middle of the town's annualmarathon. So he starts running along beside the others, about 300 of them.Being naked, with his clothes tucked under his arm, he tries to ""blend in"" as best he can. After a little while, a small group of runners, who had been studying him with some curiosity, jogged closer. ""Do you always run in the nude?"" one asked.""Oh yes"" he replied, gasping in air. ""It feels so wonderfully free having the air blow over all your skin while you're running.""Another runner moved alongside. ""Do you always run carrying your clothes with you under your arm?""""Oh, yes"" our friend answered breathlessly. ""That way I can get dressed right at the end of the run and get in my car to go home!""Then a third runner cast his eyes a little lower and queried. ""Do you always wear a condom when you run?""""Only if it's raining.""</p>

11393,"<p>A flea had oiled up his little flea legs and his little flea arms, had spread out his blanket, and was proceeding to soak up the Miami sun when who should stumble by on the beach but an old flea friend of his. </p>
<p>""Oscar, what happened to you?"", asked the flea, because Oscarlooked terrible, wrapped up in a blanket, his nose running, his eyes red, and his teeth chattering. </p>
<p>""I got a ride down here in some guy's mustache and he came down here by motorcycle. I nearly froze my nuts off,"" wheezed Oscar. </p>
<p>""Let me give you a tip, old pal,"" said the first flea, spreading some more suntan oil on his shoulders. ""You go to the stewardess lounge at the airport, see, and you get up on the toilet seat, and when an Air Florida stewardess comes in to take a leak, you hop on for a nice warm ride. Got it?"" </p>
<p>So you can imagine the flea's surprise when, a month or so later,while stretched out all warm and comfortable on the beach, who should he see but Oscar - looking more chilled and miserable than before. </p>
<p>""Listen,"" said Oscar, ""I did everything you said. I made it to the stewardess lounge and waited till a really cute one came in, and made a perfect landing and got so warm and cozy that I dozed right off.""</p>

<p>VIOLENT DRILL TEAM </p>
<p>A nationwide bio-terrorism drill was kicked off in Seattle<br /> last week, as a mock explosion of a dirty bomb tested the<br /> preparedness of firefighters, police, and other emergency<br /> workers. </p>
<p>The Seattle drill is said to have run smoothly until news<br /> of the wartime re-enactment reached a group of nearby Civil<br /> War buffs, who excitedly set up a basecamp and attempted to<br /> saw off victims' legs. </p>
<p>According to Seattle mayor Greg Nickels, such an event is<br /> crucial to national security because, quote, ""homeland<br /> security really begins at home."" Nickels is actually<br /> speaking literally. Homeland security really does begin at<br /> his home as Tom Ridge is crashing on his couch for a couple<br /> of days. </p>
<p>BLAIRLY LEGAL </p>
<p>The New York Times recently printed an exhaustive front-<br /> page story flagellating itself for the deceptions of a<br /> Times reporter, Jayson Blair, while also providing the<br /> first evidence we've seen in years that newspapers have any<br /> sense of shame. </p>
<p>Blair was discovered to have falsified and plagiarized<br /> dozens of stories for the Times. One glaring example of<br /> Blair's deception were his vivid bedside descriptions of<br /> wounded Marines at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. The<br /> hitch is, he was never there but interviewed them by phone.<br /> This fact should have been more apparent when he relied on<br /> one heavily sedated Marine's description of the other as ""a<br /> quiet purple centaur with TV coming from his mouth."" </p>
<p>Expense reports show Blair was at home in Brooklyn when he<br /> was supposed to be in Maryland covering the sniper story.<br /> One embarrassingly false report that made the front page of<br /> the Times was titled, ""Boy, There Sure is a Lot of Sniping<br /> Going on Here Where I Am. Maryland That is... Where I Am at<br /> Presently. Dang. Look Around at Maryland.""</p>

11402,"<p>Johnny was 8 years old and like other boys his age rather<br /> curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about 'courting' from<br /> the older boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done.<br /> One day he took his question to his mother, who became rather<br /> flustered. </p>
<p>Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide<br /> behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her<br /> boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described<br /> EVERYTHING to his mother. ""Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked<br /> for a while, then he started kissing and hugging herI figured<br /> 'Sis must be getting sickbecause her face started looking funny.<br /> He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her<br /> blouse to feel her heart, just &gt; the way the doctor would.<br /> Except he's not as smart as the docotr because he seemed to have<br /> trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too,<br /> because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all<br /> out of breath. His other hand must have been cold because he put<br /> it under her skirt. About this time 'Sis got worse and began to<br /> moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of<br /> the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a<br /> fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. Finally, I<br /> found out what was making them so sick -- a big eel had gotten<br /> inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and<br /> stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway he grabbed it<br /> in one hand to keep it from getting away. When Sis saw it, she<br /> got really scared -- her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open,<br /> and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said<br /> it was the biggest one she's ever seen; I should tell her about<br /> the ones down at the lake by our house! Anyway, Sis got brave<br /> and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a<br /> sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he<br /> took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel's<br /> head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her<br /> legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by<br /> lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis<br /> started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset<br /> the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it<br /> between them. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed<br /> the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of<br /> its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a<br /> little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting<br /> anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the<br /> eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight<br /> again. I guess eels are like cats -- they have nine lives or<br /> something. This time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill it by<br /> sitting on it. After about a 35 minute struggle, they finally<br /> killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because I saw Sis's<br /> boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet.</p>

11431,"<p>Here's a story about a guy who got a credit card bill stating that he owed $0.00. </p>
<p>He ignored it and threw it away. Next month he got another, did the same thing. The next month they sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his credit card if he didn't send them $0.00. </p>
<p>He called them, talked to them, they said it was ""a glitch"" and told him they'd take care of it. The following month he tried to charge something and couldn't. </p>
<p>He called the credit card company who again said they'd take care of it. The next day he got his bill for $0.00 stating that he was very delinquent. The man figured the credit card company would take care of it, so he didn't worry. </p>
<p>The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay or his account was going to collection. He mailed the credit card company a check for $0.00, and the credit card company's computer processed it, noting that his account was now paid in full. </p>
<p>A week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00. He explained and they said, ""uell, your $0.00 check has caused our check processing software to fail. We now can't process ANY of our checks from that day electronically because that $0.00 check is causing the program to abort."" </p>
<p>The man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.</p>

11464,"<p>Joe, a college student, was taking a course in ornithology, the study of<br /> birds. The night before the biggest test of the semester, Joe spent all night<br /> studying. He had the textbook nearly memorized. He knew his class notes backward<br /> and forward. Joe was ready.<br /> The morning of the test, Joe entered the auditorium and took a seat in the<br /> front row. On the table in the front was a row of ten stuffed birds. Each bird<br /> had a sack covering its body, and only the legs were showing. When class<br /> started, the professor announced that the students were to identify each bird by<br /> looking at its legs and give its common name, species, habitat, mating habits,<br /> etc.<br /> Joe looked at each of the birds' legs. They all looked the same to him. He<br /> started to get angry. He had stayed up all night studying for this test and now<br /> he had to identify birds by their LEGS? The more he thought about the situation,<br /> the angrier he got.<br /> Finally he reached his boiling point. He stood up, marched up to the<br /> professor's desk, crumpled up his exam paper and threw it on the desk. ""What a<br /> ridiculous test!"" he told the prof. ""How could anyone tell the difference<br /> between these birds by looking at their legs? This exam is the biggest rip-off<br /> I've ever seen!""<br /> With that, Joe turned and stormed toward the exit. The professor was a bit<br /> shocked, and it took him a moment to regain his composure. Then, just as Joe was<br /> about to walk out the door, the prof shouted out, ""Wait a minute, young man,<br /> what's your name?""<br /> Joe turned around, pulled up his pant legs and hollered, ""You tell me, prof!<br /> You tell me!""</p>

11471,"<p>Roy Collette and his brother-in-law have been exchanging the same pair of pants as a Christmas present for 11 years - and each time the package gets harder to open. This year the pants came wrapped in a car mashed into a 3-foot cube. The trousers are in the glove compartment of a 1974 Gremlin. </p>
<p>Now Collette's plotting his revenge--if he can get them out. It all started when Collette received a pair of moleskin trousers from his brother-in-law, Larry Kunkel of Bensenville, Ill. Kunkel's mother had given her son the britches when he was a college student. He wore them a few times, but they froze stiff in cold weather and he didn't like them. So he gave them to Collette. </p>
<p>Collette, who called the moleskins ""miserable"", wore them three times, then wrapped them up and gave them back to Kunkel for Christmas the next year. The friendly exchange continued routinely until Collette twisted the pants tightly, stuffed them into a 3-foot-long, 1-inch wide tube and gave them back to Kunkel. </p>
<p>The next Christmas, Kunkel compressed the pants into a 7-inch square, wrapped them with wire and gave the ""bale"" to Collette. </p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the next year Collette put the pants into a 2-foot-square crate filled with stones, nailed it shut, banded it with steel and gave the trusty trousers back to Kunkel. </p>
<p>The brothers agreed to end the caper if the trousers were damaged. But they were as careful as they were clever. Kunkel had the pants mounted inside an insulated window that had a 20-year guarantee and shipped them off to Collette. </p>
<p>Collette broke the glass, recovered the trousers, stuffed them into a 5-inch coffee can and soldered it shut. The can was put in a 5-gallon container filled with concrete and reinforcing rods and given to Kunkel the following Christmas. </p>
<p>Two years ago, Kunkel installed the pants in a 225-pound homemade steel ashtray made from 8-inch steel casings and etched Collette's name on the side. Collette had trouble retrieving the treasured trousers, but succeeded without burning them with a cutting torch. </p>
<p>Last Christmas, Collette found a 600-pound safe and hauled it to Viracon Inc. in Owatonna, where the shipping department decorated it with red and green stripes, put the pants inside and welded the safe shut. The safe was then shipped to Kunkel, who is the plant manager for Viracon's outlet in Bensenville. </p>
<p>Last week, the pants were trucked to Owatonna, 55 miles south of Minneapolis, in a drab green, 3-foot cube that once was a car with 95,000 miles on it. A note attached to the 2,000-pound scrunched car advised Collette that the pants were inside the glove compartment. </p>
<p>""This will take some planning,"" Collette said. ""I will definitely get them out. I'm confident."" But he's waiting until January to think about how to recover the bothersome britches. ""Wait until next year,"" he warned. ""I'm on the offensive again.""</p>

<p>So the lady gives him the pole and he says, ""That pole is worth $45."" She was amazed at how cheap that was. </p>
<p>So then she picked up another really nice pole, hands it to the man and he says, ""This pole is worth $55."" she decided that was also really cheap. </p>
<p>And then she picks the nicest looking pole in the place and handed it to the man and he says, ""This pole is our best and it is $70."" she told him that she would take it. </p>
<p>As she was getting the fishing pole all rung up, she had to fart really really badly. She decided since the man was blind that it really wouldn't matter if she farted in front of him so she just let it loose. </p>
<p>All of a sudden the man says, ""It all comes up to $80."" </p>

11501,"<p>A butcher is working, and really busy. He notices a dog in his shop and shoos him away. Later, he notices the dog is back again. He walks over to the dog, and notices the dog has a note in his mouth. The butcher takes the note, and it reads, ""Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please."" </p>
<p>The butcher looks, and lo and behold, in the dog's mouth, there is a ten dollar bill. So the butcher takes the money, puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, and places it in the dog's mouth. The butcher is very impressed, and since it's closing time, he decides to close up shop and follow the dog. </p>
<p>So, off he goes. The dog is walking down the street and comes to a crossing. The dog puts down the bag, jumps up and presses the crossing button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the lights to change. They do, and he walks across the road, with the butcher following. </p>
<p>The dog then comes to a bus stop, and starts looking at the timetable. The butcher is in awe at this stage. The dog checks out the times, and sits on one of the seats to wait for the bus. </p>
<p>Along comes a bus. The dog walks to the front of the bus, looks at the number, and goes back to his seat. Another bus comes. Again the dog goes and looks at the number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on. </p>
<p>The butcher, by now open-mouthed, follows him onto the bus. The bus travels thru town and out to the suburbs. Eventually the dog gets up, moves to the front of the bus, and standing on his hind legs, pushes the button to stop the bus. The dog gets off, groceries still in his mouth, and the butcher still following. </p>
<p>They walk down the road, and the dog approaches a house. He walks up the path, and drops the groceries on the step. Then he walks back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door. He goes back down the path, takes another run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door again! </p>
<p>There's no answer at the door, so the dog goes back down the path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter of the garden. He gets to a window, and bangs his head against it several times. He walks back, jumps off the wall, and waits at the door. The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door, and starts laying into the dog, really yelling at him. </p>
<p>The butcher runs up and stops the guy. ""What the heck are you doing? This dog is a genius. He could be on TV, for God's sake!"" </p>
<p>To which the guy responds, ""Clever, my ass. This is the second time this week he's forgotten his key!""</p>

11528,"<p>A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist named Jon complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them.""Not very long,"" answered the Mexican.</p>
<p>""But then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?"" asked Jon.</p>
<p>The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family.</p>
<p>Mr. Berg asked, ""But what do you do with the rest of your time?""</p>
<p>""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and fuck the shit out of my wife. In the evenings I go into the village to see my friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, get a quick blowjob and sing a few songs. I have a full life.""</p>
<p>Our intrepid Mr. Berg interrupted, ""I have a M.BA. from Stanford and I can help you.You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers. Instead of selling your fish to a middle man, you can negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant. You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los Angeles, or even New Jersey! From there you can direct your huge enterprise.""</p>
<p>""How long would that take?"" asked the Mexican.</p>
<p>""Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years,"" replied Jon.</p>
<p>""And after that?""</p>
<p>""Afterwards? That's when it gets really interesting,"" answered Jon, laughing. ""When your business gets really big, you can start selling stocks and make millions!""</p>
<p>""Millions? Really? And after that?""</p>
<p>""After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, fuck the shit out of your wife, and spend your evenings drinking and playing the guitar with your friends!""</p>

Pulling over to offer the Nun a ride to the nearest service station, the Nun graciously thanked the driver for stopping and accepted his offer.

<p>""Why, of course, sir. What's on your mind?"" </p>
<p>""Uh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is<br /> not your brother or your sister. Who is it?"" </p>

He immediately calls a meeting of other<br /> senior senators, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody<br /> can come up with an answer. Finally, in desperation, Helms calls Colin Powell at<br /> the State Department and explains his problem. </p>

The ball was kicked deep with<br /> no return. I ran the ball to mid-field but decided to go to the<br /> passing game. The passing play didn't work because of a rain<br /> delay. When the game resumed, the next down was when the running<br /> back took it to the 10 yard line. With 1st and goal, the action<br /> moved from the Hupper to the Quarterback and then thre was a<br /> quarterback sneak. The game turned out to be the highest scoring<br /> Fiesta Bowl ever!! Play 3. I was tacked in the massive pile<br /> up... Play 4. It was 3rd down and inches on the 20 yard line but<br /> on the Field Goal attempt I was short. Play 5.

It was the last performance of the season, Beethoven�s 9th Symphony, which required extra effort from the basses at the end.

As he stood in front of his orchestra, his worst fear was realized; it was the bottom of the 9th, no score and the basses were loaded.</p>

11668,"<p>After Mrs. Jacobs found out her husband was sterile, the couple decided to hire a proxy father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Jacobs kissed his wife and said 'I'm off to work, Lydia. The guy should be here soon.' Wouldn't you know it, a door-to-door baby photographer came by half an hour later, hoping to make a sale. Mrs. Jacobs answered the door. 'Good morning, ma'am. You don't know me, but I've come to...' 'Oh yes, I know why you're here. Harry told me you'd be coming soon.' 'He did? But I...' 'Come right in! No use wasting time .' 'Very well, then.' The photographer took out his briefcase and sat down. 'As you may already know, I've made a specialty of babies.' 'Good, I'm glad,' said Mrs. Jacobs. 'That's just what Harry and I were looking for.' 'I usually like to try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed,' said the photographer. 'The living room floor is fun too...you can really spread out.' 'Bathtub? Living room floor? No wonder it never worked for Harry and me.' 'Well, ma'am, none of us can guarantee a perfect one every time, but if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven different angles, I think you'll be quite pleased with the results.' 'I certainly hope we can get this over with quickly,' Mrs. Jacobs gasped nervously. 'Ma'am, in my line of work a man must take his time. I'd like to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.' 'Don't I know!' said Mrs. Jacobs. The photographer pulled out a portfolio of his pictures. 'This one was done on top of a bus in downtown London,' he said, showing Mrs. Jacobs the picture. 'Oh my God!' exclaimed Mrs. Jacobs, tugging on her handkerchief. 'And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider the fact that their mother was so difficult to work with.' He showed Mrs. Jacobs another picture. 'She was difficult?' questioned Mrs. Jacobs. 'Extremely,' said the photographer. 'I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job done right. People were crowding around, four and five deep, just to get a good look.' 'Four and five deep!' Mrs. Jacobs was amazed. 'Yes,' said the photographer. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then, it started getting dark and I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels started nibbling on my equipment. I just packed it all in.' Mrs. Jacobs leaned forward. 'You mean the squirrels actually chewed on your, um...equipment?' 'Yes, ma'am. Thank God, no real damage was done. Well, we'll get to work as soon as I set up my tripod.' 'Tripod? ' Mrs. Jacobs looked extremely worried now. 'Of course. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much to big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action. Ma'am...ma'am...good God, she's fainted!'</p>

<p>Adam said, ""Lord, when I was in the garden, you walked with me<br /> every day. Now I do not see you anymore. I am lonesome here and<br /> it is difficult for me to remember how much you love me.""</p>
<p>And God said, ""No problem! I will create a companion for you<br /> that will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of my<br /> love for you, so that you will love me even when you cannot see<br /> me. Regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may<br /> be, this new companion will accept you as you are and will love<br /> you as I do, in spite of yourself.""</p>
<p>And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam. And it<br /> was a good animal. And God was pleased. And the new animal was<br /> pleased to be with Adam and he wagged his tail. And Adam said,<br /> ""Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom and I<br /> cannot think of a name for this new animal.""</p>
<p>And God said, ""No problem! Because I have created this new<br /> animal to be a reflection of my love for you, his name will be a<br /> reflection of my own name, and you will call him DOG.""</p>
<p>And Dog lived with Adam and was a companion to him and loved<br /> him. And Adam was comforted. And God was pleased. And Dog was<br /> content and wagged his tail.</p>
<p>After a while, it came to pass that Adam's guardian angel came<br /> to the Lord and said, ""Lord, Adam has become filled with pride.<br /> He struts and preens like a peacock and he believes he is worthy<br /> of adoration. Dog has indeed taught him that he is loved, but<br /> perhaps too well.""</p>
<p>And the Lord said, ""No problem! I will create for him a<br /> companion who will be with him forever and who will see him as<br /> he is. The companion will remind him of his limitations, so he<br /> will know that he is not always worthy of adoration.""</p>
<p>And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam. And Cat would not<br /> obey Adam. And when Adam gazed into Cat's eyes, he was reminded<br /> that he was not the supreme being. And Adam learned humility.</p>

While she was busy plucking the coconut at the top, the old man under the tree then took a peep at her underwear.<br /> When she got the coconut down, the old man handed a $2 note to her. She ran back home happily with the money that she got and went to tell her mother about it. �Mummy, Mummy! I got $2 today. �<br /> After the girl finished telling her mother about what happened earlier, her mother scolded her, �Why are you so stupid?!! That old man is a sex pervert!

I won�t let him see my panties again.�<br /> The next day, on her way back from school, the little girl saw the same old man again, at the same coconut tree. The old man again, asked her to climb up the coconut tree to pluck a coconut for him and return, he will give her $2. The girl told him, �No! Mummy said that you are a sex pervert and I�m not going to help you this time.� The old man paused, and then he said, �Hmm, how about $4?� �Erm�No!� replied the girl. Old man quickly offered her $6.<br /> �$6?� She hesitated for a while before finally agreed to it. So she did the same thing like yesterday and went back home joyfully.<br /> Back home, she called out to her mother, �Mummy, Mummy! I got $6 today!� When the girl told her mother about the old man again, she scolded her, �Didn�t I told you about that old pervert!? Why did you let him see your panties again?� But the girl told her mum, �Don�t worry Mummy, he didn�t get to see my panties this time.� Surprised, her mother asked her why and the girl said,<br /> �Because I didn�t wear any today.�</p>

11719,"<p>This is an actual alert to IBM Field Engineers that went out to all IBM branch offices.  The person who wrote it was very serious.  The rest of us guys find it rather funny. ---- Abstract: Mouse Balls Available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit) Mouse balls are now available as FRU.  Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform eratically, it may need a ball replacement.Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse.  Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls.Ball removal procedures differ depending upon manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. Domestic balls are replaced using the twist-off method.Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive.  However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used immediately. It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction, and that any customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these necessary items.      To re-order, specify one of the following:      P/N 33F8462 - Domestic Mouse Balls      P/N 33F8461 - Foreign Mouse Balls</p>

<p>A thief burst into a Florida bank one day wearing a ski mask and carrying a gun. Aiming his gun at the guard, the thief yelled, ""FREEZE, MOTHER-STICKERS, THIS IS A FUCK-UP!"" For a moment, everyone was silent. Then the snickers started. The guard completely lost it and doubled over laughing. It probably saved his life, because he'd been about to draw his gun. He couldn't have drawn and fired before the thief got him. The thief ran away and is still at large. </p>
<p>Seems this Arkansas guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that he'd just throw a cinderblock through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinderblock and heaved it over his head at the window. The cinderblock bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. Seems the liquor store window was made of Plexiglas. The whole event was caught on videotape.</p>
<p>As a female shopper exited a New York convenience store, a man grabbed her purse and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately, and the woman was able to give them a detailed description of the snatcher. Within minutes, the police apprehended the snatcher. They put him in the car and drove back to the store. The thief was then taken out of the car and told to stand there for a positive ID. To which he replied, ""Yes, officer, that's her. That's the lady I stole the purse from.""</p>
<p>The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan, at 5 a.m., flashed a gun, and demanded cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn't open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion rings, the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast. The man, frustrated, walked away.</p>
<p>Kentucky: Two men tried to pull the front off a cash machine by running a chain from the machine to the bumper of their pickup truck. Instead of pulling the front panel off the machine, though, they pulled the bumper off their truck. Scared, they left the scene and drove home.</p>
<p>With the chain still attached to the machine. With their bumper still attached to the chain. With their vehicle's license plate still attached to the bumper. They were quickly arrested.</p>
<p>A 5-STAR STUPIDITY AWARD WINNER!<br /> When a man attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on a Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for. Police arrived at the scene to find an ill man curled up next to a motor home near spilled sewage. A police spokesman said that the man admitted to trying to steal gasoline and plugged his siphon hose into the motor home's sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to press charges, saying that it was the best laugh he'd ever had.</p>

<p>But there were equally good arguments that Jesus was black:<br /> 1. He called everybody ""brother.""<br /> 2. He liked Gospel.<br /> 3. He couldn't get a fair trial.</p>
<p>But there were equally good arguments that Jesus was Jewish:<br /> 1. He went into His Father's business.<br /> 2. He lived at home until he was 33.<br /> 3. He was sure his Mother was a virgin and his Mother was sure<br />    he was God.</p>
<p>But then there were equally good arguments that Jesus was<br /> Italian:<br /> 1. He talked with his hands.<br /> 2. He had wine with every meal.<br /> 3. He used olive oil.</p>
<p>But then there were equally good arguments that Jesus was a<br /> Californian:<br /> 1. He never cut his hair.<br /> 2. He walked around barefoot.<br /> 3. He started a new religion.</p>
<p>But then there were equally good arguments that Jesus was Irish<br /> 1. He never got married.<br /> 2. He was always telling stories.<br /> 3. He loved green pastures.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most compelling evidence is that Jesus was a<br /> woman:<br /> 1. He had to feed a crowd at a moment's notice when there was no<br />    food.<br /> 2. He kept trying to get the message across to a bunch of men<br />    who JUST DIDN'T GET IT.<br /> 3. Even when He was dead, He had to get up because there was<br />    more work for him to do.</p>

11874,"<p>Investigators at a major research institution have discovered the heaviest element known to science. This startling new discovery has been tentatively named Administratium. This new element has no protons or electrons, thus having an atomic number of 0. It does, however, have 1 neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons and 111 assistant vice neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by a force called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons. Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert. However, it can be detected as it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of Administratium causes one reaction to take over four days to complete when it would normally take less than a second. Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years; it does not decay but instead undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. In fact, an Administratium sample's mass will actually increase over time, since with each reorganization some of the morons inevitably become neutrons, forming new isotopes. This characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to speculate that Administratium is spontaneously formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as the ""Critical Morass."" You will know it when you see it.</p>

<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross the road without having their motives called into question. </p>

She takes one look at it an says, ""What's this for ....are you some kinda  pervert?"" He looks at at her, drops his shorts, and smiles kinda sexy. She smiles, her eyes now wide open and staring in disbelief at his penis  which hangs more that halfway to his knees. She then hears him say, ""Your  gonna have to draw a line somewhere baby"".</p>

11913,"<p>During his visit to the United States the Pope met with President Clinton. Instead of just an hour as scheduled, the meeting went on for two days. Finally, a weary President Clinton emerged to face the waiting news media. The President was smiling and announced the summit was a resounding success. He said he and the Pope agreed on 80% of the matters they discussed. Then Mr. Clinton declared he was going home to the White House to be with his family. A few minutes later the Pope came out to make his statement. He looked tired, discouraged and was practically in tears. Sadly he announced his meeting with the President was a failure. Incredulous, one reporter asked, ""But your Holiness, President Clinton just announced the summit was a great success and the two of you agreed on 80% of the items discussed"". Exasperated, the Pope answered, ""Yes, but we were talking about the Ten Commandments.""</p>

11916,"<p>A man dies ""in the act"" after taking viagra and rigor mortis has set into his private parts. The funeral director can't get the coffin lid nailed on and has to discuss the alternatives with the man's beautiful young widow. ""I'm afraid that the only way to get the lid on is either to pay another $3,000 for an extra large coffin or to amputate his member."" ""Well I have no more money,"" states the widow, ""and it is against my religion for me to bury my husband in more than one piece."" The funeral director thinks about this and then comes up with a brain-wave: He'll amputate the member and then stick it up the deceased's backside, in which case a more expensive coffin is unnecessary and the husband will still be, in a manner of speaking, in the one piece. The widow reluctantly agrees. On the day of the funeral, the deceased is displayed in an open casket. As the mourners file by, one mourner places flowers on the coffin and a drop of water from the flowers falls onto the deceased's face, looking for all the world like a teardrop. The next mourner to file by is the widow. She looks down at her lifeless husband, notices the ""teardrop"" and says to him quietly, ""See, I told you it hurts!""</p>

11923,"<p>A young couple decided to wed. As the big day approached, they grew apprehensive. Each had a problem they had never before shared with anyone, not even<br /> each other. The groom-to-be, overcoming his fear, decided to ask his father for advice. ""Father,"" he said, ""I am deeply concerned about the success of my<br /> marriage.""</p>
<p>His father replied, ""Don't you love this girl?""</p>
<p>""Oh yes, very much,"" he said, ""but you see, I have very smelly feet and I'm afraid that my fianc�e will be put off by them.""</p>
<p>""No problem,"" said dad, ""all you have to do is wash your feet as often as possible and always wear socks, even to bed."" Well, to him this seemed a workable<br /> solution.</p>
<p>The bride-to-be, overcoming her fear, decided to take her problem up with her mom."" Mom,"" she said, ""When I wake up in the morning, my breath is truly awful.""</p>
<p>""Honey,"" her mother consoled, ""everyone has bad breath in the morning.""</p>
<p>""No, you don't understand. My morning breath is so bad, I'm afraid that my fianc�e will not want to sleep in the same room with me.""</p>
<p>Her mother said simply, ""Try this. In the morning, get straight out of bed and head for the kitchen to make breakfast. While the family is busy eating, move on to the<br /> bathroom and brush your teeth. The key is, not to say a word until you've brushed your teeth.""</p>
<p>""I shouldn't say good morning or anything?"" the daughter asked.</p>
<p>""Not a word,"" her mother affirmed.</p>
<p>""Well, it's certainly worth a try,"" she thought.</p>
<p>The loving couple were finally married. Not forgetting the advice each had received, he with his perpetual socks and she with her morning silence, they managed<br /> quite well. That is, until about six months later.</p>
<p>Shortly before dawn one morning, the husband wakes with a start to find that one of his socks had come off. Fearful of the consequences, he frantically searches the<br /> bed. This, of course, wakes his bride and without thinking, she asks, ""What on earth are you doing?""</p>
<p>""Oh, my,"" he replies, ""you've swallowed my sock!""</p>

11947,"<p>'The Xmas-Files'by Frank Cammuso and Hart Seely  57 Elm Street Bethlehem, Pa. 11:51 p.m., December 24th.'We're too late! It's already been here.' 'Mulder, I hope you know what you're doing.' 'Look, Scully, just like the other homes: Douglas fir, truncated, mounted, transformed into a shrine; halls decked with boughs of holly; stockings hung by the chimney, with care.' 'You really think someone's been here?' 'Someone, or something.' 'Mulder, over here--it's a fruitcake.' 'Don't touch it! Those things can be lethal.' 'It's O.K. There's a note attached: 'Gonna find out who's naughty and nice.'' 'It's judging them, Scully. It's making a list.' 'Who? What are you talking about?' 'Ancient mythology tells of an obese humanoid entity who could travel at  great speed in a craft powered by antlered servants. Once a year, near the winter solstice, this creature is said to descend from the heavens to reward its followers and punish disbelievers with jagged chunks of anthracite.' 'But that's legend, Mulder--a story told by parents to frighten children. Surely you don't believe it?' 'Something was here tonight, Scully. Check out the bite marks on this gingerbread man. Whatever tore through this plate of cookies was massive--and in a hurry.' 'It left crumbs everywhere. And look, Mulder, this milk glass has been completely drained.' 'It gorged itself, Scully. It fed without remorse.' 'But why would they leave it milk and cookies?' 'Appeasement. Tonight is the Eve, and nothing can stop its wilding.' 'But if this thing does exist, how did it get in? The doors and windows were locked. There's no sign of forced entry.' 'Unless I miss my guess, it came through the fireplace.' 'Wait a minute, Mulder. If you're saying some huge creature landed on the roof and came down this chimney, you're crazy. The flue is barely six inches wide. Nothing could get down there.' 'But what if it could alter its shape, move in all directions at once?' 'You mean, like a bowl full of jelly?' 'Exactly. Scully, I've never told anyone this, but when I was a child my home was visited. I saw the creature. It had long white shanks of fur surrounding its ruddy, misshapen head. Its bloated torso was red and white. I'll never forget the horror. I turned away, and when I looked back it had somehow taken on the facial features of my father.' 'Impossible.' 'I know what I saw. And that night it read my mind. It brought me a Mr. Potato Head, Scully. It knew that I wanted a Mr. Potato Head!' 'I'm sorry, Mulder, but you're asking me to disregard the laws of physics. You want me to believe in some supernatural being who soars across the skies and brings gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen to what you're saying. Do you understand the repercussions? If this gets out, they'll close the X-files.' 'Scully, listen to me: It knows when you're sleeping. It knows when you're awake.' 'But we have no proof.' 'Last year, on this exact date, SETI radio telescopes detected bogeys in the airspace over twenty-seven states. The White House ordered a Condition Red.' 'But that was a meteor shower.' 'Officially. Two days ago, eight prized Scandinavian reindeer vanished from the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C. Nobody--not even the zookeeper--was told about it. The government doesn't want people to know about Project Kringle. They fear that if this thing is proved to exist the public will stop spending half its annual income in a holiday shopping frenzy. Retail markets will collapse. Scully, they cannot let the world believe this creature lives. There's too much at stake. They'll do whatever it takes to insure another silent night.' 'Mulder, I--' 'Sh-h-h. Do you hear what I hear?' 'On the roof. It sounds like ... a clatter.' 'The truth is up there. Let's see what's the matter.'</p>

11948,"<p>DETROIT--With third-quarter sales sluggish and its share of the domestic<br /> market down 11 percent since 1993, General Motors unveiled a new instant-win<br /> airbag contest Monday. The new airbags, which award fabulous prizes upon<br /> violent, high-speed impact with another car or stationary object, will come<br /> standard in all of the company's 1997 cars.</p>
<p>    ""Auto accidents have never been so exciting,"" said GM vice-president of<br /> marketing Roger Jenkins, who expects the contest to boost 1997 sales<br /> significantly. ""When you play the new GM Instant Win Airbag Game, your next<br /> fatal collision could mean a trip for two to Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans. Or<br /> a year's worth of free Mobil gasoline.""</p>
<p>    Though it does not officially begin until Jan. 1, 1997, the airbag<br /> promotion is already being tested in select cities, with feedback overwhelmingly<br /> positive. ""As soon as my car started to skid out of control, I thought to<br /> myself, 'Oh, boy, this could be it--I could be a big winner!'"" said Cincinnati's<br /> Martin Frelks, who lost his wife but won $50 Sunday when the Buick LeSabre they<br /> were driving hit an oil slick at 60 mph and slammed into an oncoming truck.<br /> ""When the car stopped rolling down the embankment, I knew Ellen was dead, but<br /> all I could think about was getting the blood and glass out of my eyes so I<br /> could read that airbag!""</p>
<p>    Hartford, CT, resident Jonathan Ryerson was killed Sunday when his 1997<br /> Pontiac LeMans hit a freight train. Ryerson won $50 in the accident. ""It's<br /> really addictive,"" said Sacramento, CA, resident Marjorie Kamp, speaking from<br /> her hospital bed, where she is listed in critical condition with severe brain<br /> hemorrhaging and a punctured right lung. ""I've already crashed four cars trying<br /> to win those Super Bowl tickets, but I still haven't won. I swear, I'm going to<br /> win those tickets--even if it kills me!"" </p>
<p>    Kamp said that as soon as she is well enough, she plans to buy a new<br /> Pontiac Bonneville and drive it into a tree.  GM officials are not surprised the<br /> airbag contest has been so well received. ""In the past, nobody really liked car<br /> wrecks, and that's understandable. After all, they're scary and dangerous and,<br /> sometimes, even fatal,"" GM CEO Paul Offerman said. ""But now, when you drive a<br /> new GM car or truck, your next serious crash could mean serious cash. Who<br /> wouldn't like that?"" </p>
<p>    Offerman added that in the event a motorist wins a prize but is killed,<br /> that prize will be awarded to the next of kin.   According to GM's official<br /> contest rules, odds of winning the grand prize, a brand-new 1997 Cutlass<br /> Supreme, are 1 in 43,000,000. Statistical experts, however, say the real chances<br /> of winning are significantly worse. ""If you factor in the odds of getting in a<br /> serious car accident in the first place--approximately 1 in 720,000--the actual<br /> odds of winning a prize each time you step in your car are more like 1 in 31<br /> trillion.""  Further, even if one is in an accident, there is no guarantee the<br /> airbag will inflate. ""I was recently broadsided by a drunk driver in my new<br /> Chevy Cavalier,"" said Erie, PA, resident Jerry Polaner. ""My car was totaled, and<br /> because it was the side of my car that got hit, my airbag didn't even inflate.<br /> But what really gets me is the fact that the drunk driver, who rammed my side<br /> with the front of his 1997 Buick Regal, won a $100 Office Depot gift<br /> certificate. That's just wrong.""</p>
"
11949,"<p>A Marine Colonel on his way home from work at the Pentagon came to a dead halt in traffic and thought to himself, ""Wow, this traffic seems worse than usual, nothing is moving.""</p>
<p>He notices a police officer walking back and forth between the lines of cars, so he rolls down his window and asks, ""Excuse me, Officer, what seems to be the hold up?""</p>
<p>The officer replies, ""The President is just so depressed that Hillary has moved to New York, and may leave him altogether that he just stopped his motorcade in the middle of the Beltway, and he's threatening to douse himself in gasoline and set himself on fire. </p>
<p>He says his family absolutely hates him and he doesn't have the $33.5 million he owes his lawyers for that whole Monica and Paula thing. </p>
<p>So I'm walking around taking up a collection for him.""</p>
<p>""Oh really? How much have you collected so far?""</p>
<p>""So far about three hundred gallons, but I've got a lot of folks still siphoning.""</p>

11963,"<p>Last year a friend of mine upgraded from BoyFriend 1.0 to Husband 1.0 and found that it's a memory hog, leaving very little system resources available for other applications.She is now noticing that Husband 1.0 is also spawning Child Processors which are further consuming valuable resources. No mention of this particular phenomena was included in the product brochure or the documentation, though other users have informed her that this is to be expected due to the nature of the application.Not only that, Husband 1.0 installs itself such, that it is always launched at system initialization, where it can monitor all other system activity. She's finding that some applications such as SpendingSpree 2.4, GirlsNight 3.5 and CocktailNight 7.0 are no longer able to run in the system at all, crashing the system when selected (even though they always worked fine before).During installation, Husband 1.0 provides no option as to the installation of undesired Plug-ins such as MotherInLaw 5.8 and BrotherInLaw Beta release. Also, system performance seems to diminish with each passing day.Some features she'd like to see in the upcoming Husband 2.0 include:1. A ""Yes I'll cook, clean etc."" button.2. An install shield feature that allows Husband 2.0 be installed with the option to uninstall at anytime without the loss of cache and other system resources.I myself decided to avoid the headache associated with Husband 1.0 by sticking with BoyFriend 2.0. Even here, however, I found many problems.Apparently you cannot install BoyFriend 2.0 on top of BoyFriend 1.0; each program begins damaging the other. You must uninstall BoyFriend 1.0 first. Other users say this is a long standing bug that I should have known about. You'd think they would have fixed such a stupid bug by now! To make matters worse, the uninstall program for BoyFriend 1.0 doesn't work very well, leaving undesirable traces of the application in the system.Another thing--all versions of BoyFriend 1.0 continually popup little annoying messages about the advantages of upgrading to Husband 1.0.Bug WarningHusband 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Lover 1.1 before uninstalling Husband 1.0, Husband 1.0 will delete MS Clothing allowance files, before doing the uninstall himself.More applications that won't run with Husband 1.0 include Chippendale 2.0, Netballwatching 3.5, Suremoreshoes 6.0, and Cleanup 4.3.Applications that run very well with Husband 1.0, however, include Bummingaround 1.0, Pubnight 2.3, Golfing 2.7, Pokernight 5.3, and Wanderingeyes 4.9.</p>

<p>""My sister-in law is from Oklahoma and has a slight accent. She has cats and when she lived in the south she would take them to the groomers and have what is called a Line Cut. To her a line cut is when all of the fur hanging down below the cat's tummy is taken off (because it gets matted or snarled). </p>
<p>When she moved to Chicago with my brother, one of the cats fur got all tangled up during the move so she took it in for a line cut. She was quite surprised when she heard the price as it was twice as much as it was down south. She confirmed with the groomer that he understood what a line cut was and he said ""yes, I know what a LION cut is."" It seems her accent came out sounding like LION not LINE and this is how her cat was returned to her. </p>

11966,"<p>Martha Stewart vs Me...</p>
<p>Martha's way: Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to prevent ice cream drips.<br /> My way: Just suck the ice cream out of the bottom of the cone, for Pete's sake, you are probably lying on the couch with your feet up eating it anyway.</p>
<p>Martha's way: Use a meat baster to ""squeeze"" your pancake batter onto the hot griddle and you'll get perfectly shape pancakes every time.<br /> My way: Buy the precooked kind you nuke in the microwave for 30 seconds. The hard part is getting them out of the plastic bag.</p>
<p>Martha's way: To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in thebag with the potatoes.<br /> My way: Buy Hungry Jack mashed potato mix and keep it in the pantry for up to a year.</p>
<p>Martha's way: To prevent egg shells from cracking, add a pinch of salt to the water before hard boiling.<br /> My way: Who cares if they crack, aren't you going to take the shells off anyway?</p>
<p>Martha's way: To get the most juice out of fresh lemons, bring them to room temperature and roll them under your palm against the kitchen counter before squeezing.<br /> My way: Sleep with the lemons in between the mattress and box springs.</p>
<p>Martha's way: To easily remove burnt-on food from your skillet, simply add a drop or two of dish soap and enough water to cover bottom of pan, and bring to a boil on stovetop.<br /> My way: Eat at Chili's every night and avoid cooking.</p>
<p>Martha's way: Spray your Tupperware with nonstick cooking spray before pouring in tomato based sauces and there won't be any stains.<br /> My way: Feed your garbage disposal and there won't be any leftovers.</p>
<p>Martha's way: When a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking pan, use a bit of the dry cake mix instead and there won't be any white mess on the outside of the cake.<br /> My way: Go to the bakery. They'll even decorate it for you. </p>
<p>Martha's way: If you accidentally over salt a dish while it's still cooking, drop in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess salt for an instant ""fix me up""<br /> My way: If you over salt a dish while you are cooking, that's too damn bad.<br /> My motto: I made it and you will eat it and I don't care how bad it tastes.</p>
<p>Martha's way: Wrap celery in aluminum foil when putting in the refrigerator and it will keep for weeks.<br /> My way: Celery? Never heard of the stuff.</p>
<p>Martha's way: Brush some beaten egg white over pie crust before baking to yield a beautiful glossy finish.<br /> My way: The Mrs. Smith frozen pie directions do not include brushing egg whites over the crust and so I don't do it.</p>
<p>Martha's way: Place a slice of apple inhardened brown sugar to soften it.<br /> My Way: Brown sugar is supposed to be ""soft""?</p>
<p>Martha's way: When boiling corn on the cob, add a pinch of sugar to help bring out the corn's natural sweetness.<br /> My Way: The only kind of corn I buy comes in a can.</p>
<p>Martha's way: To determine whether an egg is fresh, immerse it in a pan of cool, salted water. If it sinks, it is fresh, but if it rises to the surface, throw it away.<br /> My way: Eat, cook, or use the egg anyway. If you feel bad later, you will know it wasn't fresh.</p>
<p>Martha's way: Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your forehead. The throbbing will go away.<br /> My way: Martha, dear, the only reason this works is because you can't rub a lime on your forehead without getting lime juice in your eye, and then the problem isn't the headache anymore, it is because you are now blind.</p>
<p>Martha's way: Don't throw out all that leftover wine. Freeze into ice cubes for future use in casseroles and sauces.<br /> My way: Leftover wine?</p>
<p>Martha's way: If you have a problem opening jars: Try using latex dishwashing gloves. They give a non slip grip that makes opening jars easy.<br /> My way: Go ask the very cute neighbor to do it.</p>
<p>Martha's way: Potatoes will take food stains off your fingers. Just slice and rub raw potato on the stains and rinse with water.<br /> My way: Mashed potatoes will now be replacing the anti-bacterial soap in the handy dispenser next to my sink.</p>
<p>Martha's way: Now look what you can do with Alka Seltzer.<br /> * Clean a toilet. Drop in two Alka-Seltzer tablets, wait twenty minutes, brush and flush. The citric acid and effervescent action clean vitreous china.<br /> * Clean a vase. To remove a stain from the bottom of a glass vase or cruet, fill with water and drop in two Alka-Seltzer tablets.<br /> * Polish jewelry. Drop two Alka-Seltzer tablets into a glass of water and immerse the jewelry for two minutes.<br /> * Clean a thermos bottle. Fill the bottle with water, drop in four Alka-Seltzer tablets, and let soak for an hour (or longer, if necessary).<br /> My way: Put your jewelry, vases, and thermos in the toilet. Add some Alka-Seltzer and you have solved a whole bunch of problems at once.</p>

11977,"<p>Some excerpts from the Quarterly Review of Doublespeak </p>
<p>(NCTE)</p>
<p>A reader reports that when the patient died, the attending doctor recorded the following on the patient's chart: ""Patient failed to fulfill his wellness potential."" </p>
<p>Another doctor reports that in a recent issue of the American Journal of Family Practice fleas were called ""hematophagous arthropod vectors."" </p>
<p>The letter from the Air Force colonel in charge of safety said that rocket boosters weighing more than 300,000 pounds ""have an explosive force upon surface impact that is sufficient to exceed the accepted overpressure threshhold of physiological damage for exposed personnel."" In other words, if a 300,000-pound booster rocket falls on someone, he or she is not likely to survive. </p>
<p>A reader reports that the Army calls them ""vertically deployed anti-personnel devices."" You probably call them bombs. </p>
<p>At McClellan Air Force base in Sacramento, California, civilian mechanics were placed on ""non-duty, non-pay status."" That is, they were fired. </p>
<p>A personal ad from an unidentified mewspaper announces that a ""formerly single man"" seeks a single or married woman. </p>
<p>After taking the trip of a lifetime, our reader sent his twelve rolls of film to Kodak for developing (or ""processing,"" as Kodak likes to call it) only to receive the following notice: ""We must report that during the handling of your twelve 35mm Kodachrome slide orders, the films were involved in an unusual laboratory experience."" The use of the passive is a particularly nice touch, don't you think? Nobody did anything to the films; they just had a bad experience. Of course our reader can always go back to Tibet and take his pictures all over again, using the twelve replacement rolls Kodak so generously sent him. </p>
<p>The description on the package of Stouffer's Veal Tortellini with Tomato Sauce says it contains ""exquisite egg pasta."" The list of ingredients, however, includes ""cooked noodle product."" </p>
<p>In St. Louis there is an oriental rug store that advertizes ""semi-antique"" rugs. </p>
<p>The Minnesota Board of Education voted to consider requiring all students to do some ""volunteer work"" as a prerequisite to high school graduation. </p>
<p>Senator Orrin Hatch said that ""capital punishment is our society's recognition of the sanctity of human life."" </p>
<p>According to the tax bill signed by President Reagan on December 22, 1987, Don Tyson and his sister-in-law Barbara run a ""family farm."" Their ""farm"" has 25,000 employees and grosses $1.7 billion a year. But as a ""family farm"" they get tax breaks that save them $135 million a year. </p>
<p>Scott L. Pickard, spokesperson for the Massachusetts Department of Public Works, calls them ""ground-mounted confirmatory route markers."" You probably call them road signs, but then you don't work in a government agency. </p>
<p>It's not ""elderly"" or ""senior citizens"" anymore. Now it's ""chronologically experienced citizens."" </p>
<p>According to the FAA, the propeller blade didn't break off, it was just a case of ""uncontained blade liberation.""</p>

So, turning to guy No.1 he said ""what would you like as your wish?""""To be beautiful"" was his reply, and so it was done.God asked the question to man 2 and he also said to be beautiful.Then they all were saying it and when it got to guy number 14, number 100 at the back began to giggle ...Guy 28 was saying he wanted to be beautiful when man 100 laughed out loud, and he got a piercing stare from everyone.By the time it got to man 84, the number 100 was rollling on the floor laughing his head off!!! But they all ignored him.After man numero 99 said he wished to be hansome (a bit of variation!) the guy 100 finally got his wish.But first God asked why he was laughing, ""no reason"" he said; so God shrugged his shoulders and asked him the same question as all the others: ""what do you want?""The 100th guy said ""To make them all butt-ugly again!""</p>

11987,"<p>A Russian couple were walking down the street in Moscow one night, when the man felt a drop hit his nose. ''I think it's raining'', he said to his wife.   ''No, that felt more like snow to me'', she replied.   ''No, I'm sure it was just rain'', he said.   Well, as these things go, they were about to have a major argument about whether it was raining or snowing when they saw a communist party official walking toward them.   ''Let's not fight about it'', the man said, ''Let's ask Comrade Rudolph whether it's officially raining or snowing''.   As the official approached, the man said, ''Tell us, Comrade Rudolph, is it officially raining or snowing?''   ''It's raining, of course'', he replied, and walked on.   But the woman insisted: ''I know that felt like snow!''   To which the man quietly replied: ''Rudolph the Red knows rain, dear''</p>

11992,"<p>A Jewish lady named Mrs. Rosenberg who many years ago was stranded late one<br /> night at a fashionable resort on Cape Cod --one that did not admit Jews. </p>
<p>The desk clerk looked down at his book and said, 'Sorry, no room. The hotel is<br /> full.' The Jewish lady said, 'But your sign says that you have vacancies.' The<br /> desk clerk stammered and then said curtly, 'You know that we do not admit Jews.<br /> Now if you will try the other side of town...' </p>
<p>Mrs. Rosenberg stiffened noticeably and said, 'I'll have you know I converted<br /> to your religion.' </p>
<p>The desk clerk said, 'Oh, yeah, let me give you a little test. How was Jesus<br /> born?' </p>
<p>Mrs. Rosenberg replied, 'He was born to a virgin named Mary in a little town<br /> called Bethlehem.' </p>
<p>'Very good,' replied the hotel clerk. 'Tell me more.' </p>
<p>Mrs. Rosenberg replied, 'He was born in a manger.' </p>
<p>'That's right,' said the hotel clerk. 'And why was he born in a manger?' </p>
<p>Mrs. Rosenberg said loudly, 'Because a jerk like you in the hotel wouldn't<br /> give a Jewish lady a room for the night!'</p>

<p>Luego de escogerla, el vendedor le advierte que si la deja afuera mientras llueve, puede oxidarse, as� que le recomienda que siempre tenga un frasco de vaselina a la mano, para untarle a la moto.</p>

<p>She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking.</p>
<p>After becoming very frustrated with the ""no haggle"" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, ""Maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!""</p>
<p>The shopkeeper said, ""By all means, be my guest. Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!""</p>
<p>Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home, when he spotted the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand.</p>
<p>Just then, he saw a huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She took aim, killed the creature, and with a great deal of effort hauled it on to the swamp bank.</p>
<p>Lying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watched in amazement.</p>
<p>Just then the blonde flipped the alligator on its back. Frustrated, she shouts out, ""Damn it, this one isn't wearing any shoes either!""</p>
