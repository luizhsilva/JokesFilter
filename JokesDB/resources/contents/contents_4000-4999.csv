4025,"<p>Once upon a time there lived a king. The king had a beautiful daughter, the princess. But there was a problem. Everything the princess touched would melt. No matter what, metal, wood, plastic-anything she touched would melt!Because of this, men were afraid of her. Nobody would dare marry her. The king despaired. What could he do to help his daughter? He consulted his wizards and magicians. One wizard told the king, ""If your daughter touches one thing that does not melt in her hands, she will be cured,""The king was overjoyed. The next day, he held a competition. Any man that could bring his daughter an object that would not melt would marry her and inherit the king's wealth.Three young princes took up the challenge. The first prince brought a very hard alloy of titanium. But alas, once the princess touched it, it melted. The prince went away sadly.The second prince brought a huge diamond, thinking that diamond is the hardest substance in the world and will not melt. But alas, once the princess touched it, it melted. He too went away disappointed.The third prince approached. He told the princess, ""Put your hand in my pocket and feel what is in there."" The princess did as she was told, though she turned red. She felt something hard. She held it in her hand. And it did not melt!!! The king was overjoyed. Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed. And the third prince married the princess and they both lived happily ever after.Question:What was the object in the prince's pants?     (Scroll down for the answer.)What the princess touched was especially designed to melt in her mouth, not in her hand - it was an M&amp;M.      (Now what were you thinking?)</p>

As the lady tries it on, the furrier discreetly whispers to the man, ''Ah, sir, that particular fur goes for $65,000.''''No problem!  I'll write you a check!''''Very good, sir.'' says the shop owner. ''Today is Saturday. You may come by on Monday to pick it up, after the check has cleared.''So the man and the woman leave. On Monday, the fellow returns. The store owner is outraged, ''How dare you show your face in here?! There wasn`t a single penny in your checking account!!''''I just had to come by,'' grinned the guy, ''to thank you for the most wonderful weekend of my life!''</p>

4051,"<p>This just breaks my heart... please pass it on somore can help this unfortunate child...&gt; Dear Friend:&gt;    I am a very sick boy little boy. My mother is typing&gt; this for me, because I can't. She is crying.&gt;    Don't cry, Mommy! Mommy is always sad, but she says&gt; it's not my fault. I asked her if it was God's fault,&gt; but she didn't answer, and only started crying harder,&gt; so I don't ask her that anymore.&gt;    The reason she is so sad is that I'm so sick. I was&gt; born without a body. It doesn't hurt, except when I go&gt; to sleep.&gt;    The doctors gave me an artificial body. My body is a&gt; burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that&gt; was the best they could do on account of us having no&gt; money or insurance. I would like to have a body&gt; transplant, but we need more money.&gt;    Mommy doesn't work because she said employers don't&gt; hire crying people. I said, ""Don't cry, Mommy,"" and she&gt; hugged my burlap body. Mommy always gives me hugs, even&gt; though she's allergic to burlap, and it chafes her real&gt; bad.&gt;    I hope you will help me. You can help me if you&gt; forward this e-mail. Dr. Johansen said if you forward&gt; this e-mail then Bill Gates will team up with AOL and&gt; do a survey with NASA. Then the astronauts will collect&gt; prayers from school children all over America and take&gt; them up to space so that the angel can hear them&gt; better. Then they will go to the Pope, and he will take&gt; up a collection in church and send the money to the&gt; doctors. The doctors could help me better then.&gt;    Maybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Or&gt; maybe just use my lungs and heart, when the doctors&gt; make them. The doctors said that every time you forward&gt; this letter, the astronauts can take another prayer to&gt; the angels. Please help me. Mommy is so sad, and I want&gt; a body. I don't want my leaves to rot before I turn 10.&gt;    If you don't forward this e-mail, that's OK. Mommy&gt; says you're a mean heartless shithead who doesn't care&gt; about a poor little boy with only a head.&gt;    She says that if you don't stew in the raw pit of&gt; your own guilt-ridden stomach, she hopes you die a long&gt; slow horrible death so you can burn forever in hell.&gt; What kind of goddamned person are you that you can't&gt; take five minutes to forward this to all your friends so&gt; that they can feel guilt and shame for the rest of&gt; their day, and then maybe help a poor, bodiless&gt; nine-year-old boy?&gt;    Please help me. This really sucks. I try to be happy&gt; but it's hard. I wish I had a puppy. I wish I could&gt; hold a puppy.&gt;    Thank You.&gt;    Billy 'Smiles' Evans,&gt;    The boy with just a head.&gt;    And a burlap sack for a body.</p>

4079,"<p>This woman has her bridge club every Thursday night and after a peaceful game or two with the ladies, she goes home to fix her husband dinner when he gets home from work. Well, one Thursday, she's playing a great game and she has an incredible hand when she notices the time. ""Oh, no! I have to go fix my husband his dinner! He's going to be so angry if it's not ready on time."" And she dashes out of her friend's house, her great hand forgotten on the table.<br /> When she gets home, she realizes she has very little time, not enough time to go to the supermarket, and all she has in the cupboard is a wilted lettuce leaf, an egg, and a can of cat food. In a panic, she opens the can of cat food, stirs in the egg, and garnishes it with the lettuce leaf just as her husband is pulling up. She watches in horror as he sits down to his dinner, and then she realizes he is loving it! </p>
<p>""Mmmm, darling, this is the best dinner you have made for me in forty years of marriage. You can make this for me any old day, mmmmm!"" And that night they had sex for the first time in months and it was great! </p>
<p>Needless to say, every Thursday from then on, she made this dinner for her husband. She tells her bridge cronies about it and they are all horrified. </p>
<p>""You're going to kill him,"" they say, or ""He's just yanking your chain,"" but she continued to make him his cat food dinner and then, afterwards, they would bonk like fiends. </p>
<p>Two months later, her husband died and all the bridge women the Thursday after the funeral attacked our new widow for being so callous. ""You killed him! </p>
<p>We told you that feeding him that cat food every week would do him in! How can you just sit there so calmly and play bridge knowing you murdered your husband?"" </p>

4089,"<p>A young boy was in grade four and was having a terrible time with his math.<br /> His parents worked with him night after night but there was no improvement. </p>
<p>His math marks were dismal. His parents in desperation decided to transfer their son to a new school. They decided to try the Catholic school system but not until after they had given the matter serious consideration as both parents were not religious. </p>
<p>They checked around and the school seemed to have a good academic record. They reluctantly enrolled their son in the Catholic school. Immediately the boy's math marks soared. He went from a failing grade to become an A student. </p>
<p>His parents were surprised at the change and over dinner one night they asked their son about his improvement. ""Was it better teaching"" they asked and the boy said ""No the teachers are about the same"". ""Was it a different text book?"" Again the boy said ""No it is the same text book"" </p>
<p>Finally they asked their son why he thought he had made such a dramatic improvement. </p>
<p>The boy said ""the first day I went to school I knew they took their math seriously and that I had better do well or there would be serious consequences."" </p>
<p>Their parents asked what made him realize the school took math so seriously. </p>
<p>The boy answered ""the first thing I saw when I went into the classroom was a statue of some guy nailed to a plus sign.""</p>

4099,"<p>Stage 1 - SMART </p>
<p>This is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject in the known Universe. You know you know everything and want to pass on your knowledge to anyone who will listen. At this stage you are always RIGHT. And of course the person you are talking to is very WRONG. This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are SMART. </p>
<p>Stage 2 - GOOD LOOKING </p>
<p>This is when you realize that you are the BEST LOOKING person in the entire bar and that people fancy you. You can go up to a perfect stranger knowing they fancy you and really want to talk to you. Bear in mind that you are still SMART, so you can talk to this person about any subject under the sun. </p>
<p>Stage 3 - RICH </p>
<p>This is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world. You can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have an armored truck full of money parked behind the bar. You can also make bets at this stage, because of course, you are still SMART, so naturally you win all your bets. It doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are RICH. You will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are the BEST LOOKING person in the world. </p>
<p>Stage 4 - BULLET PROOF </p>
<p>You are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone especially those with whom you have been betting or arguing. This is because nothing can hurt you. At this point you can also go up to the partners of the people who you fancy and challenge to a battle of wits or money. You have no fear of losing this battle because you are SMART, you are RICH and hell, you're BETTER LOOKING than they are anyway! </p>
<p>Stage 5 - INVISIBLE </p>
<p>This is the Final Stage of Drunkenness. At this point you can do anything because NO ONE CAN SEE YOU. You dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you. You are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you. You can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still SMART you know all the words.</p>

4110,"<p>A wife and her husband were having a dinner party for all the major status figures in Rome, Italy. </p>
<p>The wife was very excited about this and wanted everything to be perfect.</p>
<p>At the very last minute, she realized that she didn't have any snails for this dinner party, so she asked her husband to run down to the beach with the bucket she was handing him to gather some snails. Very grudgingly he agreed.</p>
<p>He took the bucket, walked out the door, down the steps, and out to the beach. </p>
<p>As he was collecting the snails, he noticed a beautiful woman strolling alongside the water just a little further down the beach. </p>
<p>He kept thinking to himself, ""Wouldn't it be great if she would even just come down and talk to me?"" He went back to gathering the snails.</p>
<p>All of a sudden he looked up, and the beautiful woman was standing right over him. </p>
<p>They got to talking, and she invited him back to her place. </p>
<p>They were at her apartment a ways down the beach, and they started messing around. </p>
<p>It got so hot and heavy, that he was exhausted afterwards and passed out there.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock the next morning he woke up and exclaimed, ""Oh no, my wife's dinner party!""</p>
<p>He gathered all his clothes, put them on real fast, grabbed his bucket, and ran out the door. </p>
<p>He ran down the beach all the way to his apartment. He ran up the stairs of his apartment. He was in such a hurry that when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the bucket of snails.</p>
<p>There were snails all down the stairs. The door opened just then, with a very angry wife standing in the door way wondering where he's been all this time.</p>
<p>He looked at the snails on the steps, then he looked at her, then back at the snails and said, ""Come on guys, we're almost there!"" </p>

<p>The lion, with a mighty roar, bangs the rabbit to smithereens.</p>
<p>""No!"" the giraffe and the elephant cry. ""Why did you do that? All he was trying to do was to help you out!""</p>
<p>The lion replied, ""Damn rabbit always makes me run around the friggin' forest when he's on speed!""</p>

4119,"<p>A blonde tried to sell her old car. She was having a lot of problems selling it, because the car had 250,000 miles on it.</p>
<p>One day, she told her problem to a brunette she worked with at a salon. The brunette told her, ""There is a possibility to make the car easier to sell, but it's not legal.""</p>
<p>""That doesn't matter,"" replied the blonde, ""if I only can sell the car.""</p>
<p>""Okay,"" said the brunette. ""Here is the address of a friend of mine. He owns a car repair shop. Tell him I sent you and he will turn the counter on your car back to 50,000 miles. Then it should not be a problem to sell your car anymore.""</p>
<p>The following weekend, the blonde made the trip to the mechanic. About one month after that, the brunette asked the blonde, ""Did you sell your car?""</p>
<p>""No,"" replied the blonde, ""why should I? It only has 50,000 miles on it!""</p>

4120,"<p>The big-game hunter walked into the bar and bragged to everyone<br /> about his skills as a hunter. The man was undoubtedly a good<br /> shot and no one could dispute that. But then he said that he<br /> could recognize any animal's skin by feeling it, and he could<br /> tell what caliber rifle was used to shoot it by locating the<br /> bullet hole. This was a bit too much for the other customers,<br /> and soon a heated argument started.</p>
<p>The hunter said that he was willing to prove it if they would<br /> put up the drinks, and the bet was on. They blindfolded him and<br /> took him to his first animal skin.</p>
<p>After feeling it for a few moments, he announced, ""Springbok.""<br /> Then he felt for the bullet hole and declared, ""And it was shot<br /> with a .22 rifle."" He was right! The others could not believe it<br /> and the argument was even hotter than before. When someone<br /> suggested that he must have peeped, he said that he was prepared<br /> to do it again for another round.</p>
<p>So they blindfolded him again, very thoroughly this time, and<br /> they brought a skin that someone happened to have in the trunk<br /> of his car. He took a bit longer this time and then said,<br /> ""Kalahari Lion."" Fingering the bullet hole, he added, ""The rifle<br /> was a .308."" He was right again! This only made the crowd more<br /> curious, and he had to prove his skills over and over again,<br /> every time winning a round of drinks.</p>
<p>Finally he staggered home, bombed out of his mind, and went to<br /> sleep. The next morning he got up and saw in the mirror that he<br /> had one hell of a shiner. So he said to his wife, ""Listen, I<br /> know I was drunk last night, but not too drunk to know that I<br /> didn't get into a fight. So where did I get this black eye?"" His<br /> wife replied angrily, ""From me!"" ""What did I do?"" he asked. She<br /> replied, ""You got into bed and put your hand inside my panties.<br /> Then you fiddled around a bit and announced, 'Skunk, killed with<br /> an ax!'""</p>

Saint Peter goes through the books several times, furrows his brow, and says to the guy, ""You know, I can't see that you did anything really good in your life but, you never did anything bad either. Tell you what, if you can tell me of one REALLY good deed that you did in your life, you're in."" </p>
<p>The guy thinks for a moment and says, ""Yeah, there was this one time when I was drivin' down the highway and I saw a giant group of KKK Biker Gang Rapists assaulting this poor girl. I slowed down my car to see what was going on, and sure enough, there they were, about 50 of 'em torturing this chick. Infuriated, I get out of my car, grabbed a tire iron out of my trunk, and walked straight up to the leader of the gang, a huge guy with a studded leather jacket and a chain running from his nose to his ear. As I walked up to the leader, the KKK Biker Gang Rapists formed a circle around me. So, I rip the leader's chain off his face and smash him over the head with the tire iron. Then I turned around and yell to the rest of them, 'Leave this poor, innocent girl alone! You're all a bunch of sick, deranged animals! Go home before I teach you all a lesson in pain!'"" </p>

After the anthem he yelled, ''Down<br /> nuts!'' And they all sat.<br /> After a home run he yelled, ''Cheer nuts!'' And they all broke into applause<br /> and cheers.<br /> Thinking things were going very well; he decided to go get a beer and a hot<br /> dog, leaving his assistant in charge.<br /> When he returned there was a riot in progress. Finding his assistant, he asked<br /> what happened.<br /> The assistant replied, ''Well...everything was fine until some guy walked by<br /> and yelled, ''PEANUTS!''</p>

He answered that he had made a Harry Potter snowman, and that<br /> it took a while to find a pair of glasses.<br /> The third boy was out in the yard all day; in fact, he missed dinner.  When he<br /> finally came in, it was after dark, and his mother asked why it had taken him so<br /> long.  He answered that he had made a president George W.

4128,"<p>Late one Friday in Dublin, a policeman spotted a man driving very erratically. He pulled the man over and asked him if he had been drinking that evening. ''Aye, so I have. 'Tis Friday, you know, so me and the lads stopped by the pub where I had six or seven pints. And then there was something called 'Happy Hour' and they served these mar-gar-itos which are quite good. I had four or five o' those. Then I had to drive me friend Mike home and o' course I had to go in for a couple of Guinness -- couldn't be rude, ye know. Then I stopped on the way home to get another bottle for later...'' And the man fumbled around in his coat until he located his bottle of whiskey, which he held up for inspection. The officer sighed, and said, ''Sir, I'm afraid I'll need you to step out of the car and take a breathalyzer test.'' ''Why? Don't ye believe me?''</p>
"
4129,"<p>�And God created Adam and Eve�<br /> On yet another day in Eden, God decided to take a casual stroll away from his more-or-less successful creations�he didn�t get very far before being interrupted once again by the individuals created �in his likeness��theoretically anyway. The stampede of footsteps behind him signaled the arrival of the two �perfect� creations.<br /> �Father! Eve�s breaking one of the Commandments again!�<br /> God wearily wondered whether there were any of the one thousand two hundred and sixty four Commandments that had not yet been broken by those two�perhaps the last one: �Thou shalt not, in thine own conceit, force others to hear tired, old jokes, over and over again.� However, Adam�s facial expression indicated a transgression of a far worse caliber.<br /> �Father, tell Eve that you commanded us to walk around naked and unabashed! She�s not following the rules, she�s wearing UNDERWEAR!� Adam squealed.<br /> �So? There�s nothing wrong with it! Besides, you should consider covering up that �ding-dong� of yours, all the apes make fun of you!� Eve retorted.<br /> �I am superior to them in every aspect!�<br /> God raised an incredulous eyebrow.<br /> �Dad� Adam pressed, �Tell her you created me to be dominant in that aspect too!�<br /> God considered this for a moment, thinking back to the creation of all his creatures. Finally, he responded,<br /> �Well, I suppose I disregarded that tiny detail�I did give you a bigger brain though.�<br /> �Brain? Who needs a brain? I need my �banana� to be this loooong!�<br /> �Daddy, he just wants to be bigger than Joe Ape, hehehe�Once Joe showed him his �ding-dong� and Adam�s eyes bugged out in surprise, and envy�� Eve chimed in.<br /> �Liar! I just got something in my eye!�<br /> �And since then, he�s been trying to compensate for it by boasting to Joe �I got to shave first, and then I drank half a bottle of that water in Father�s cabinet and didn�t even feel tipsy when returning to the cave��<br /> �Ah, so that�s where all my good Old Spice has been disappearing to�.� God mumbled to himself.<br /> �Tattletale!  Besides, how do you know what I talk to Joe about? You probably wear that underwear to impress him! Soon you�ll start wearing a BRA! You�re dressing like�like� like a slut!� Adam rebutted.<br /> �Slut? There�s no such word! You just made it up! Besides, it wasn�t me trying to impress him by saying �I reproduced FIVE times last night!� You wish you could, you erotomaniac-wannabe. You�ve never gone more than three!�<br /> God could feel his blood pressure rising, despite his doctor�s warnings about stress and hypertension�<br /> �Erotomaniac? Now you made up a word! Besides, I just eat too much at dinner and my blood is redirected to improper places��<br /> �Excuses, excuses. Wrong place here, wrong timing there�you could at least try to be more creative�� Eve continued.<br /> God, heeding his doctor�s advice pulled out a vial and with a shaking hand placed a nitroglycerin pill under his tongue. He then sighed with relief, and with a few well-placed smacks on the butt effectively stopped the argument. He then prophesied, �I promise you, for the first two thousand years, all Eves will wear more and more progressively, then for the next two thousand they shall, in their vanity, gradually undress to impress all average Joe Apes, and so it shall continue until judgement day. And all Adams shall value not their brains, but their �ding-dongs� and compare their size with every Joe Ape��<br /> -Thus far, the prophecy hasn�t failed yet�</p>

4141,"<p>Gift Buying Rules For Men</p>
<p>Print this out and leave laying around where those of the Female<br /> persuasion can see it.</p>
<p>Rule #1:</p>
<p>When in doubt - buy him a cordless drill. It does not matter if he already<br /> has one.  I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain.  As a<br /> man, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #2:</p>
<p>If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word<br /> ratchet or socket in it.  Men love saying those two words. ""Hey George, can<br /> I borrow your ratchet?"" ""OK. By-the-way, are you through with my 3/8-inch<br /> socket yet?"" Again, no one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #3:</p>
<p>If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car, a 99-cent<br /> ice scraper, a small bottle of de-icer or something to hang from his rear<br /> view mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #4:</p>
<p>Do not buy men socks. Do not buy men ties. And never buy men bathrobes.<br /> Once I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, he wouldn't<br /> have invented Jockey shorts.</p>
<p>Rule #5:</p>
<p>You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn out.<br /> If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the little<br /> picture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips, and<br /> flips....</p>
<p>Rule #6:</p>
<p>Do not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. If you do, it will sit in a<br /> cupboard for 23 years. Real men drink whiskey or beer.</p>
<p>Rule #7:</p>
<p>Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after-shave or deodorant.<br /> I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy.</p>
<p>Rule #8:</p>
<p>Buy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a couple of<br /> weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. ""Socks. Shorts. Cups.<br /> Saucers.  Door.  Lock. Sink."" You get the idea. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #9:</p>
<p>Never buy a man anything that says ""some assembly required"" on the box. It<br /> will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.</p>
<p>Rule #10:</p>
<p>Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, ParrLumber, Home<br /> Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire.(NAPA Auto Parts<br /> and Sear's Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. It doesn't<br /> matter if he doesn't know what it is. ""From NAPA Auto, eh? Must be<br /> something I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane? Wow!<br /> Thanks."")</p>
<p>Rule #11:</p>
<p>Men enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue. Get<br /> him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him the gas line<br /> leaks. ""Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?""</p>
<p>Rule #12:</p>
<p>Tickets to a Seahawks game are a smart gift. However, he will not<br /> appreciate tickets to ""A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts."" Everyone<br /> knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #13:</p>
<p>Men love chainsaws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chainsaw. If you<br /> don't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets a<br /> label maker.</p>
<p>Rule #14:</p>
<p>It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension<br /> ladder. Never buy a real man a stepladder.  It must be an extension ladder.<br /> No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #15:</p>
<p>Rope.  Men love rope.  It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least<br /> the Boy Scouts.  Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8"" manila rope.<br /> No one knows why.</p>

4161,"<p>THE Y1K CRISIS </p>
<p>Canterbury, England. A.D. 999. </p>
<p>An atmosphere close to panic prevails today throughout Europe as the millennial year 1000 approaches, bringing with it the so-called ""Y1K Bug,"" a menace which, until recently, hardly anyone had ever heard of. Prophets of doom are warning that the entire fabric of Western Civilization, based as it now is upon monastic computations, could collapse, and that there is simply not enough time left to fix the problem. </p>
<p>Just how did this disaster-in-the-making ever arise? Why did no one anticipate that a change from a three-digit to a four-digit year would throw into total disarray all liturgical chants and all metrical verse in which any date is mentioned? Every formulaic hymn, prayer, ceremony and incantation dealing with dated events will have to be re-written to accommodate three extra syllables. </p>
<p>All tabular chronologies with three-space year columns, maintained for generations by scribes using carefully hand-ruled lines on vellum sheets, will now have to be converted to four-space columns, at enormous cost. In the meantime, the validity of every official event, from baptisms to burials, from confirmations to coronations, may be called into question. </p>
<p>""We should have seen it coming ,"" says Brother Cedric of St. Michael Abbey, here in Canterbury. ""What worries me most is that THOUSAND contains the word THOU, which occurs in nearly all our prayers, and of course always refers to God. Using it now in the name of the year will seem almost blasphemous, and is bound to cause terrible confusion. Of course, we could always use Latin, but that might be even worse -- The Latin word for Thousand is Mile which is the same as the Latin for mile. We won't know whether we are talking about time or distance!"" </p>
<p>Stonemasons are already reported threatening to demand a proportional pay increase for having to carve an extra numeral in all dates on tombstones, cornerstones and monuments. Together with its inevitable ripple effects, this alone could plunge the hitherto-stable medieval economy into chaos. </p>
<p>A conference of clerics has been called at Winchester to discuss the entire issue, but doomsayers are convinced that the matter is now one of personal survival.</p>

"
4164,"<p>When you're 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: ""Just because you've reached middle age, that doesn't mean you shouldn't take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it."" </p>
<p>This is the voice of Satan. </p>
<p>I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales. </p>
<p>I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. ""I'll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets"" is a typical breakfast order for me these days. </p>
<p>This is because I went snowboarding. </p>
<p>For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough. </p>
<p>These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, ""Cool."" </p>
<p>People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together. </p>
<p>We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill). </p>
<p>If anybody asks if you're OK, you say, ""I'm just catching my breath!"" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you're going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you're planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw. </p>
<p>At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance. </p>
<p>So I thought I'd take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing. </p>
<p>In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range. </p>
<p>Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can't stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you. </p>
<p>Skiers hate snowboarders. It's a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc. </p>
<p>Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd. </p>
<p>I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope. </p>
<p>Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who's going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete. </p>
<p>You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.) </p>
<p>We learned snowboarding via a two step method: </p>
<p>STEP ONE: Watching Brad do something. </p>
<p>STEP TWO: Trying to do it ourselves. </p>
<p>I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics. </p>
<p>I'd struggle to my feet, and I'd be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot. </p>
<p>""Keep your knees bent!"" Brad would yell, helpfully. </p>
<p>Have you noticed that whatever sport you're trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if THAT would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, ""FORGET MY KNEES! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE GRAVITY CHUNKS!"" </p>
<p>Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me. </p>
<p>If I hadn't gotten out of there, they'd have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding. </p>
<p>So I think, when my body heals, I'll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you'll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.</p>

On one such occasion, the lover of Shakespeare and the lover of Wordsworth met and whilst strolling along, were confronted by an elderly man with a very straight back and very bandy legs. Immediately the lover of Shakespeare said to his colleague.<br /> �How would your Wordsworth have described this chap�. Without any hesitation, he replied, �Wordsworth would have said,<br /> Lo! Here comes a venerable gent, his back is straight, though his legs are bent�. Then he immediately enquired of his friend,<br /> �What would your mate Shakespeare have said?� The reply was, �What manner of man is this, who approaches us with his Balls in Parenthesis�.</p>

"
4186,"<p>Good afternoon all. I'm Al Gore, and I'd like to tell you a<br /> little about myself. </p>
<p>I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a<br /> poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I<br /> was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands. I taught<br /> myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers<br /> and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi<br /> River steamboat. Frequently we would stop the ship and I would<br /> cut and split five cords of wood for fuel overnight for the<br /> steam engines. </p>
<p>My mother taught me the value of education, so every day, I<br /> would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a<br /> mischievous, fun loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one<br /> day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for<br /> ""Huckleberry Finn."" </p>
<p>Back then, we Jewish black folks in the south were second-class<br /> citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I<br /> asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee<br /> civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an<br /> impression. You see, the minister's name was Martin Luther King,<br /> Jr. </p>
<p>My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his<br /> knee and said, ""Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama,<br /> someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to<br /> an exclusive prep school."" As a young Hindu boy, these were very<br /> valuable lessons. But life of privilege was not for me. </p>
<p>Being Chinese, after getting my high school diploma, I took a<br /> job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the<br /> treatment of the workers there that I organized a union. Later,<br /> that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my<br /> close friends at the AFL-CIO call me ""Norma Rae."" </p>
<p>When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done,<br /> Harvard University called and offered me a scholarship. I<br /> captained the hockey team to four consecutive national<br /> championships, but I also played football and was good enough to<br /> win the Heisman Trophy. </p>
<p>During my college years, I lived in a housing project and<br /> moonlighted writing songs and playing lead guitar for a little<br /> rock band. You may have heard of us - The Rolling Stones. I'm<br /> the one with the lips. </p>
<p>But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my<br /> country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I<br /> was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier<br /> and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de<br /> Guerre. My battlefield expertise is current requisite reading<br /> material for Officers Candidates to this very day. My being a<br /> wounded female officer serving in disguise as a journalist was a<br /> full time project, but my military knowledge helped save tens of<br /> thousands of lives. Many cities in Southeast Asia are named<br /> after me to this very day. Statues of me are still commonplace<br /> in many official Government buildings in Viet Nam. </p>
<p>When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of<br /> ours. I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the<br /> mountain air, man, I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've<br /> been everywhere. I've hunted all the dangerous species of big<br /> game in five continents using only a handmade spear or my<br /> handmade laser sighted compound bow. </p>
<p>And the people I met at truck stops and campgrounds and homeless<br /> shelters on that journey all said the same thing: ""Al, we need<br /> you in Washington."" </p>
<p>I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some<br /> other business---building the World Trade Center, finding a low<br /> cost, more reliable nuclear weapon trigger design, founding the<br /> Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking<br /> caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field's<br /> chocolate chip cookies. I was, in fact, the third (still silent)<br /> partner of Ben &amp; Jerry with over half of the flavors personally<br /> developed by Tipper and me in our own kitchen.</p>
<p>My extensive knowledge of Arctic Sea life keeps me busy in the<br /> research laboratory, but those endangered species need love too!<br /> Translating the dead sea scrolls is one of my favorite hobbies,<br /> and my current volume is in print in over 73 languages and is<br /> being studied in Seminaries worldwide. Being Indian, both Native<br /> American and the Mid East kind, this is valuable experience for<br /> me. Have towel and Tee Pee, will travel.</p>
<p>Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee<br /> and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and<br /> the Senate. And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for<br /> no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once<br /> again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the<br /> United States. </p>
<p>I also invented the Internet. Since then, I've been part of the<br /> most successful administration in American history. My friend,<br /> Bill Gates has asked me many times why I gave him the ideas of<br /> software development and asked for no money. Gosh, it just<br /> wouldn't be right! </p>
<p>Many times President Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave<br /> decision and has asked me what to do. And when I would give him<br /> my thoughts, he would invariable say, ""Of course. That's<br /> brilliant. Why didn't I think of that?"" During the darkest days<br /> of the impeachment battles, the President told me he only wished<br /> he had listened when I told him to stay away form that<br /> dark-haired intern with the big hooters. </p>
<p>So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and<br /> asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my<br /> campaign. And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of<br /> advice-words I'll never forget. He looked me in the eye and he<br /> said, ""Al, just tell the truth, it's always worked well for me."" </p>
<p>Thanks, I'm Al Gore and I want to be your next President. You<br /> can trust and believe me.</p>

4197,"<p>Scientists have determined that the average time of intercourse lasts 4 minutes. The average number of strokes is 9 per minute, making the average intercourse 36 strokes long. Since the average length of a penis is about 6 inches, the average girl receives 216 inches of penis or 18 feet of penis per intercourse.</p>
<p>If the average girl does it 3 times a week, (that makes 156 times annually) 156 x 18 feet of penis makes 2808 feet, or just over a half mile of penis per year.</p>
<p>If a girl starts having sex at 16, and since the average life span of a woman is 75, you could say that you could be getting 2808 feet of penis x 59 years of sex makes 165,672 feet, or 55,224 yards, or a little over 31 miles of penis in your lifetime.</p>
<p>Anyone whose getting more than that, well, yer just a big ol slut.</p>

4218,"<p>A young guy out on the town with his mates spies the girl of his dreams across the dance floor. Having admired her from afar he plucks up the courage to talk to her. Everything goes better than expected and she agrees to accompany him on a date the following Saturday evening. </p>
<p>Saturday night arrives and the man arrives at her house laden with flowers and chocolates. To his amazement she answers the door in nothing but a towel. </p>
<p>""I'm sorry,"" she exclaims, ""I am running a bit late. Please come in and I'll introduce you to my parents who will entertain you while I finish getting dressed. I should warn you however, that they are both deaf mutes."" </p>
<p>With this she ushers him into the living room, introduces him to her parents and promptly disappears. As you can imagine this is a little uncomfortable as both parents are completely silent. Dad is sitting in his arm chair watching the soccer game, and Mom is busy knitting. After about ten minutes of complete silence, Mom suddenly jumps from her chair, pulls up her skirt pulls down her knickers and pours a glass of water over her arse. </p>
<p>Just as suddenly Dad launches himself across the room bends her over the couch and takes her from behind. He then sits back down in his chair and places a match stick under each eye lid. The room is plunged back into eerie silence and the young man is shocked into disbelief. After a further ten minutes the mother again rises from her chair, pulls up her skirt, pulls down her pants and throws another glass of water over her arse. Dad leaps up gives her one from behind and places two more match sticks under his eyelids. No sooner have they concluded this strange behaviour and the daughter returns fully dressed ready for their date. </p>
<p>The evening is a complete disaster with the young man completely distracted by the goings on in the living room. At the end of the evening the girl asks, ""What's the matter? Have I done something wrong?"" </p>
<p>""It's not you,"" replied her date, ""It's just that the strangest thing happened while I was waiting for you and I am still a bit shocked."" </p>
<p>After pleading with him to explain in more detail the young man reluctantly recounts the story. 'Well, first your Mother jumps from her chair and lifts up her skirt. She then pulls down her pants and throws a glass of water over her behind."" </p>
<p>""I see,"" says the girl, ""What happened then?"" </p>
<p>""Well, if that isn't enough your Father races from his chair leans Mom over the couch and does her from behind. He then sits back down and places a match stick under each eye lid.' </p>
<p>""Oh, is that all?"" replies the girl. </p>
<p>The young man can't believe the casual response to this weird practice. ""It's easily explained. Mom was simply saying, 'Are you going to get this asshole a drink?' and Dad was replying, 'No, fuck him. I'm watching the match.'""</p>

4226,"<p>Have you ever asked your child a question too many times? Well, I hope you remember my story when you start getting frustrated.</p>
<p>My three year old son had a lot of problems with potty training; and I was on him constantly.  One day we stopped at taco bell for a quick lunch in between errands, it was very busy, with a full dining room.</p>
<p>While enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny so of course I checked my seven month old daughter and she was clean.  Then I realized that Matt had not asked to go potty in a while, so I asked him and he said no.  I kept thinking, oh Lord that child has had an accident and I didn't have any clothes with me.</p>
<p>Then I said, Matt are you sure you did not have an accident?  I just knew that he must have had an accident, cause the smell was getting worse.  SOOO, I asked one more time MATT DID YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT?</p>
<p>This time with a little smirk on his face he jumped up and yanked down his pants, bent over and spread his cheeks and yelled, SEE MOM IT'S JUST GAS!!!!</p>
<p>While 100 people nearly choked to death on their tacos, he calmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if nothing happened. I was mortified, but some kind elderly people made me feel a lot better, when they came over and thanked me for the best laugh they had ever had.</p>

Well, I only had four bowls, so I had to borrow eight more from the neighbors to beat the eggs in, but the cake turned out fine!</p>
<p>Tuesday: I thought I'd surprise Bill with a fruit salad for supper. The recipe said ""serve without dressing"". Bill happened to bring a friend home for supper, and did they ever look surprised when I served that salad!</p>
<p>Wednesday: I decided to serve rice and found a recipe which said, ""wash thoroughly before steaming the rice"". So I heated some water and took a bath before steaming the rice. I can't say it improved the rice any.</p>
<p>Thursday: Today Bill asked for salad again. I tried a new recipe. It said, ""prepare ingredients, then toss on a bed of lettuce one hour before serving."" I went next door to my Mom's garden and tossed my salad into the bed of lettuce and stood over there one hour so the dog would not take it. Bill came over and asked if I felt all right. I wonder why?</p>
<p>Friday: Today I found an easy recipe for cookies. It said, ""put all ingredients in a bowl and beat it."" Beat it I did, right over to my mom's house. There must have been something wrong with the recipe, because when I came back home again it looked the same as when I left it.</p>
<p>Saturday: Bill went shopping today and brought home a chicken. He asked me to dress it for dinner. I sure don't know how chickens dress for dinner, but I found an old scarf and made a cute little pair of pants for it! I thought it looked darling!

<p>Sunday: Today Bill's folks came to dinner. I wanted to serve roast, but all we had in the fridge was hamburger. So I put the hamburger in my new oven and set the control for ""roast"". The oven must not be working right because it still came out hamburger!</p>

<p>Hi this is true, some time ago when my daughter Stephanie was 4 years old<br /> and it was winter near Christmas, setting the scene as it gets dark early. </p>
<p>I had taken her to the doctor and when we got out of the doctors it was dark already. I got her a happy meal from McDonalds to keep her quiet  because I had and errand to run before going home. No seat belts then. </p>
<p>She was standing in the back seat patting the back of my head and I kept telling her to sit down and eat her hamburger. She finally told me she was finished. </p>
<p>It was dark so I couldnt see what she was doing. </p>
<p>We went into a hardware store and people kept looking at me and smirking like 'lady there is something wrong with you and we are not going to tell you what.' </p>
<p>I felt uncomfortable finshed my purchase as quickly as possible. . </p>
<p>Even leaning over to write a<br /> check. The cashier snickered and looked away. Finally we were out of the store and I dropped my keys and as I bent over to pick them up, her<br /> hamburger fell out of my wig on the sidewalk. </p>
<p>I couldnt feel it because I had a wig on. </p>
<p>Thats what she was doing on the ride  to the store putting the hamburger in my wig so nicely patting me on the head. </p>
<p>I was so embarrassed I didnt go to that store for a long time. </p>
<p>My friends called me Mrs Hamburglerhead for awhile. We still go to Mc Donalds tho.</p>

4314,"<p>One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend<br /> suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything<br /> quicker and cheaper than a doctor.<br /> ''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your<br /> problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10."" Bill figured<br /> he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the<br /> drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.<br /> The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing.<br /> After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: ""You<br /> have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be<br /> better in two weeks.""<br /> Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how<br /> it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine<br /> could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog<br /> and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into<br /> the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in<br /> the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and<br /> printed out the following message:<br /> ""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him<br /> vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And if<br /> you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.""</p>

4318,"<p>Michael the Dragon Master was an official in King Arthur's court. He had a<br /> long standing obsession - to nuzzle the beautiful Queen's voluptuous breasts.<br /> But he knew the penalty for this would be death. One day he revealed his secret<br /> desire to his colleague, Horatio, who was the King's chief physician.<br /> Horatio said, ""I can arrange it, but I will need 1,000 gold coins to pay<br /> bribes"".<br /> Michael the Dragon Master readily agreed.<br /> The next day Horatio made up a batch of itching lotion. He then poured a<br /> little of it into the Queens brassiere while she was taking a bath. Soon after<br /> she dressed, the itching commenced and quickly grew in intensity.<br /> When called to the royal chambers, Horatio told the King that only special<br /> saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure his type of itch. He further<br /> explained that test had shown such saliva was only to be found in Michael the<br /> Dragon Master's mouth.<br /> King Arthur summoned Michael the Dragon Master and issued the Imperial<br /> command. Michael the Dragon Master slipped the antidote to the itching lotion,<br /> which Horatio had given him, into his mouth. For the next four hours he worked<br /> passionately on the Queen's magnificent breasts.<br /> Satisfied, he returned to his chamber and found Horatio demanding payment.<br /> However, with his obsession now satisfied, he refused to pay Horatio anything<br /> and shooed him away, knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the<br /> King.<br /> The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching lotion into<br /> King Arthur's loincloth. Michael the Dragon Master was again summoned by the<br /> King...</p>

4353,"<p>Stage 1 - SMART </p>
<p>This is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject in the known Universe. You know you know everything and want to pass on your knowledge to anyone who will listen. At this stage you are always RIGHT. And of course the person you are talking to is very WRONG. This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are SMART. </p>
<p>Stage 2 - GOOD LOOKING </p>
<p>This is when you realize that you are the BEST LOOKING person in the entire bar and that people fancy you. You can go up to a perfect stranger knowing they fancy you and really want to talk to you. Bear in mind that you are still SMART, so you can talk to this person about any subject under the sun. </p>
<p>Stage 3 - RICH </p>
<p>This is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world. You can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have an armored truck full of money parked behind the bar. You can also make bets at this stage, because of course, you are still SMART, so naturally you win all your bets. It doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are RICH. You will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are the BEST LOOKING person in the world. </p>
<p>Stage 4 - BULLET PROOF </p>
<p>You are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone especially those with whom you have been betting or arguing. This is because nothing can hurt you. At this point you can also go up to the partners of the people who you fancy and challenge to a battle of wits or money. You have no fear of losing this battle because you are SMART, you are RICH and hell, you're BETTER LOOKING than they are anyway!</p>
<p>Stage 5 - INVISIBLE </p>
<p>This is the Final Stage of Drunkenness. At this point you can do anything because NO ONE CAN SEE YOU. You dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you. You are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you. You can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still SMART you know all the words.</p>

After the lions, gorillas,<br /> giraffes and bears, they came upon the elephant exhibit. </p>

I slowed down, and sure enough, there they were, about 50 of 'em torturing this woman. Infuriated, I got out my car, grabbed a tire iron out of my trunk, and walked straight up to the leader of the gang. He was a huge guy with a studded leather jacket and a chain running from his nose to his ear. As I walked up to the leader, the gang members formed a circle around me.'So, I ripped the leader's chain out of his face and smashed him over the head with the tire iron,' the guy says.

The cop took a good look at the young bob and said, ""You don't even look like you have a job! Why I've never seen anyone so scruffy in my entire life!""Bob said, ""I've got a job! I have a good, well paying job!""The cop leaned in the window, and with the smell of day old donuts on his breath, said, ""What kind of a job would a bum like you have?""""I'm a cunt stretcher,"" replied Bob.""What you say, BOY?!!"" asked the patrolman. ""A cunt stretcher.""Of course the cop asked, ""What's a cunt stretcher do?""Bob explained, ""Girls call me up and say they want to be stretched so I go over there and start with a couple of fingers, then a couple more, and then one whole hand, then two. Then I pull them farther and farther apart until it's six feet across.""The cop, absorbed with the images in his mind, let down his guard and asked, ""What the hell do you do with a six foot cunt?""Bob nonchalantly commented, ""You give it a radar gun and stick it at the end of a bridge!""</p>

St. Peter<br /> asks the first blonde, ""What is Easter?"" The blonde replies, ""Oh, that's easy!<br /> It's the holiday in November when everyone gets together, eats turkey, and are<br /> thankful..."" ""Wrong!,"" replies St. Peter, and proceeds to ask the second blonde<br /> the same question, ""What is Easter?"" The second blonde replies, ""Easter is the<br /> holiday in December when we put up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate<br /> the birth of Jesus."" St. Peter looks at the second blonde, shakes his head in<br /> disgust, tells her she's wrong, and then peers over his glasses at the third<br /> blonde and asks, ""What is Easter?"" The third blonde smiles confidently and looks<br /> St. Peter in the eyes, ""I know what Easter is."" ""Oh?"" says St. Peter,<br /> incredulously. ""Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish<br /> celebration of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper<br /> and Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one of his<br /> disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the side,<br /> made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with nails through his<br /> hands. He was buried in a nearby cave which was sealed off by a large boulder.""<br /> St. Peter smiles broadly with delight. The third blonde continues, ""Every year<br /> the boulder is moved aside so that Jesus can come out... and, if he sees his<br /> shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter.""</p>

4478,"<p>A chicken and a horse were playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him to safety. The chicken runs to the farmer but the farmer cannot be found. So she drives the farmer's BMW back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. She then throws the other end of the rope to her friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking.  </p>
<p>A few days later the chicken and the horse were playing in the meadow again and the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, 'No, I think I can stand over the hole'. So he stretched his legs over the width of the hole and said, 'grab for my 'thingy' and pull yourself up'. So the chicken grabbed hold of the horse's ""thingy"" and pulled herself to safety.</p>

<p>Mike Stewart, 31, of Dallas, was filming a movie in 1983 on the dangers of low-level bridges when the truck he was standing on passed under a low-level bridge - and killed him.</p>
<p>Walter Hallas, a 26-year-old store clerk in Leeds, England, was so afraid of dentists that in 1979 he asked a fellow worker to try to cure his toothache by punching him in the jaw. The punch caused Hallas to fall down, hitting his head and he died of a fractured skull.</p>
<p>George Schwartz, owner of a factory in Providence, Rhode Island, narrowly escaped death when a 1983 blast flattened his factory except for one wall. After treatment for minor injuries, he returned to the scene to search for files. The remaining wall then collapsed, killing him.</p>
<p>Depressed that he could not find a job, 42-year-old Romolo Ribolla sat in his kitchen near Pisa, Italy, with a gun in his hand threatening to kill himself. His wife pleaded with him not to do it, and after about half an hour he burst into tears and threw the gun to the floor. It went off and killed his wife.</p>
<p>In 1976, a 22-year-old Irishman, Bob Finnegan, was crossing the busy Falls Road in Belfast when he was struck by a taxi and flung over its roof. The taxi drove away and, as Finnegan lay stunned in the road, another car ran into him, rolling him into the gutter. It too drove on. As a lot of gawkers gathered to examine the magnetic Irishman, a delivery van ploughed through the crowd, leaving in its wake three injured bystanders and an even more battered Bob Finnegan. When a fourth vehicle came along, the crowd wisely scattered and only one person was hit - Bob Finnegan. In the space of two minutes, Finnegan suffered a fractured skull, broken pelvis, broken leg, and other assorted injuries, but hospital officials said he would recover.</p>
<p>Hitting on a novel idea that he could end his wife's incessant nagging by giving her a good scare, Hungarian Jake Fen built an elaborate harness to make it look as if he had hanged himself. When his wife came home and saw him she fainted. Hearing a disturbance a neighbor came over and, finding what she thought were two corpses, seized the opportunity to loot the place. As she was leaving the room, her arms laden, the outraged and suspended Mr Fen kicked her stoutly in the backside. This so surprised the lady that she dropped dead of a heart attack. Happily, Mr Fen was acquitted of manslaughter and he and his wife were reconciled.</p>

<p>After she filled out all the proper forms and had waited about 20 minutes in the waiting room the doctor called her into his office, leaned back in his chair, folded his hands into a steeple and asked her how he could help.</p>
<p>""Doctor,"" she said, ""I have a very bad gas problem.""<br /> ""A gas problem?"" replied the doctor.</p>
<p>""Yes. Yesterday afternoon, I had lunch with the Secretary of State and his wife and had six, um, er, ahhh...silent gas emissions.</p>
<p>Last night, I had dinner with the governor and his wife and had (blush) four silent gas emissions.</p>
<p>Then, while sitting in your waiting room I had five silent gas emissions!<br /> Doctor, you've got to help me! What can we do?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" said the doctor, ""I think the first thing we're going to do is give you a hearing test!""</p>

<p>2. You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling reason why we observe daylight-saving time.</p>
<p>3. People who feel the need to tell you that they have an excellent sense of humor are telling you that they have no sense of humor.</p>
<p>4. The most valuable function performed by the federal government is entertainment.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her at that moment.</p>
<p>6. A penny saved is worthless.</p>
<p>7. They can hold all the peace talks they want, but there will never be peace in the Middle East.&nbsp; Billions of years from now, when Earth is hurtling toward the Sun and there is nothing left alive on the planet except a few microorganisms, the microorganisms living in the Middle East will be bitter enemies.</p>
<p>8. The most powerful force in the universe is gossip.</p>
<p>9. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status, or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we all believe that we are above-average drivers.</p>

<p>11. There is a very fine line between ""hobby"" and ""mental illness.""</p>
<p>12. People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them.</p>
<p>13. There apparently exists, somewhere in Los Angeles, a computer that generates concepts for television sitcoms.&nbsp; When TV executives need a new concept, they turn on this computer; after sorting through millions of possible plot premises, it spits out, ""THREE QUIRKY BUT ATTRACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT,"" and the executives turn this concept into a show.&nbsp; The next time they need an idea, the computer spits out, ""SIX QUIRKY BUT ATTRACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT.""

<p>17. The main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to annoy people who are not in them.</p>
<p>18. The value of advertising is that it tells you the exact opposite of what the advertiser actually thinks. For example:&nbsp; * If the advertisement says ""This is not your father's Oldsmobile,"" the advertiser is desperately concerned that this Oldsmobile, like all other Oldsmobiles, appeals primarily to old farts like your father. * If Coke and Pepsi spend billions of dollars to convince you that there are significant differences between these two products, both companies realize that Pepsi and Coke are virtually identical. * If the advertisement strongly suggests that Nike shoes enable athletes to perform amazing feats, Nike wants you to disregard the fact that shoe brand is unrelated to athletic ability. * If Budweiser runs an elaborate advertising campaign stressing the critical importance of a beer's ""born-on"" date, Budweiser knows this factor has virtually nothing to do with how good a beer tastes.</p>

4509,"<p>Most people don't know that, back in 1912, Hellman's mayonnaise was manufactured in England. </p>
<p>In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York.</p>
<p>This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. </p>
<p>But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost.</p>
<p>The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.</p>
<p>The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th and is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.</p>

4526,"<p>One bright, beautiful Sunday morning, everyone in tiny Smithville wakes up early and goes to their local church. </p>
<p>Before the service starts, the townspeople sit in their pews and talk about their lives, their families, etc.</p>
<p>Suddenly, at the altar, Satan appears!! </p>
<p>Everyone starts screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in their determined efforts to get away from Evil Incarnate.</p>
<p>Soon, everyone is evacuated from the church except for one man, who sit calmly in his pew, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy is in his presence. </p>
<p>This confuses Satan a bit. Satan walks up to the man and says, ""Hey, don't you know who I am?""</p>
<p>The man says, ""Yep, sure do.""</p>
<p>Satan says, ""Well, aren't you afraid of me?""</p>

<p>Satan, perturbed, says, ""And why aren't you afraid of me?""</p>

""Can you explain?""""Once upon a time I was an 11-year-old Choirboy at your very church. I too was walking by this stream when I was confronted by the wicked witch of the forest. 'Let me pass!' I cried, but to no avail. She called me a cheeky little boy and with a flash of her wand, turned me into the frog you now see before you."" ""That's an incredible story!"" said the priest.

""It is said that if a nice kind person would pick me up, take me home, give me food and warmth and a good night's sleep, I will wake up as a boy again.""""Today's your lucky day!"" said the priest, and forthwith picked up the frog and took him home. He gave him lots of  food, placed him by the fire, and at bedtime put the frog on the pillow beside him. And, lo! miracle of miracles, when he awoke the next morn, there was the 11 year old Choirboy beside him in bed. And that, your Honor, is the case for the Defense.</p>

4567,"<p>A woman was thinking about finding a pet to help keep her company at home. She decided she would like to find a beautiful parrot. It wouldn't be as much work as a dog, and it would be fun to hear it speak. She went to a pet shop and immediately spotted a large beautiful parrot. She went to the owner of the store and asked how much the bird cost.<br /> The owner said it was $50. </p>
<p>Delighted that such a rare looking and beautiful bird wasn't more expensive, she agreed to buy it. </p>
<p>The owner looked at her and said, ""Look, I should tell you first that this bird used to live in a whorehouse and sometimes it says some pretty vulgar stuff."" </p>
<p>The woman thought about this, but decided she had to have the bird. She told the owner that she still wanted the bird. The pet shop owner sold her the bird and she took it home. She hung the bird's cage up in her living room and waited for it to say something. The bird looked around the room, then at her, and said, ""New house, new madam."" </p>
<p>The woman was a bit shocked at the implication, but then thought ""that's not so bad,"" </p>
<p>A couple hours later, the woman's two teenage daughters returned from school. When they inspected the bird, it looked at them and said, ""New house, new madam, new whores."" The girls and the woman were a bit offended at first, but then began to laugh about the situation. </p>

Not wanting any tan lines to show, he sunbathed in the nude. Unfortunately, the young man fell asleep while on the roof, and managed to get a sunburn on his ""tool of the trade"". But the young man was determined not to miss his date, so he put some lotion on his manhood and wrapped it in gauze. The blonde showed up for the date at his apartment, and the young man treated her to a home cooked dinner, after which they went into the living room to watch a movie. During the movie, however, the young man's sunburn started acting up again. He asked to be excused, went into the kitchen, and poured a tall, cool glass of milk. He then placed his sunburned member in the milk and experienced immediate relief of his pain. The dumb blonde, however, wondering what he was doing, wandered into the kitchen to see him with his Johnson immersed in a glass of milk. Upon seeing this, the blonde exclaimed, ""So that's how you guys load those things!""</p>

<p>""I don't care!"" Jake says ""I think she's beautiful!"" </p>
<p>So Jake buys the horse, brings her home and sets her up in a newly cleaned stall. The next morning, Jake wakes to find that she has broken out and run off. After many hours of searching, he finds her and leads her home. Thinking maybe she didn't like her stall, he cleans out a different one (the barn had four) and leads her in, this time making sure to bolt the door. </p>
<p>The next morning, Jake wakes to find that the mare has broken out and run off. After many hours of searching, he finds her, and brings her home, again trying a different stall (the barn had four). </p>

<p>When he woke the next morning, the mare had chewed the rope, broken out and run off. He called Farmer Ben, furious at the horses behavior. ""I don't understand it! I keep her stall clean, locked, full of food, nothing I do keeps her from running off!"" </p>
<p>""I tried to tell you,"" Farmer Ben said ... ""She just can't seem to form a stable relationship!""</p>

4639,"<p>Little Johnny was playing with his father's wallet when he accidently<br /> swallowed a quarter. He went crying to him mom, choking on the quarter. They<br /> took him to a doctor, who said that the quarter was impossible to remove without<br /> surgery; they consulted a specialist who was of the same opinion. Then came a<br /> man who said he could get the money out in a jiffy. He turned little Johnny<br /> upside down and patted him with great precision on the back of neck and, sure<br /> enough, the quarter rolled out. Everyone was amazed, the father said �You must<br /> be an expert!� The man replied, �No sir I'm just a tax collector.�</p>

<p>�Que pas� entonces en el hotel? Hay dos versiones:</p>
<p>VERSI�N DE LA NOVIA:</p>
<p>""�l estaba de mal humor cuando nos encontramos en el caf�. Pens� que era porque hab�a llegado algo tarde, sin embargo, no me dijo nada al respecto. De mi peinado nuevo (me hab�a cortado tres dedos el pelo y bajado un tono mi tintura habitual) ni un comentario. No le gust�, pens�, pero no le dije nada. Nuestra conversaci�n era lenta y le propuse que era mejor hablar �ntimamente en un restaurante. �l acept�, pero cuando llegamos segu�a muy serio; trat� de hacerlo sonre�r, pero no hubo efecto. Le pregunt� si el problema ven�a de m� y me respondi� que no. En el taxi le dije te amo y �l me tom� la mano solamente mientras miraba hacia fuera. �Dios m�o, qu� le pasa! Ni siquiera me dijo yo tambi�n...</p>
<p>Al llegar al hotel pens� que la cosa empeoraba ya que segu�amos sin hablar. Trat� de preguntarle algo y me respondi�, creo por compromiso, mientras prend�a la tele. Luego se meti� en el ba�o. Un poco enfadada me quite la ropa y me met� en la cama mientras pensaba que quiz� lo mejor hubiese sido ir a mi casa.</p>
<p>Diez minutos despu�s se subi� a la cama y, como lo hab�amos previsto, hicimos el amor, aunque creo que con poca convicci�n. Pocas caricias y pocos besos... �l parec�a en otro mundo y yo no quer�a otra cosa que irme a casa inmediatamente; me intrigaba el saber qu� le estar�a pasando y ya comenzaba a dudar de todo... Tal vez habr�a encontrado otra chica, que s� yo.</p>
<p>Y ahora, estoy aqu� en casa, destruida, tratando de ordenar mis ideas y deseando saber c�mo seguir�n las cosas...</p>
<p>VERSION DEL NOVIO:</p>
<p>D�a dif�cil en el trabajo... �Pero al menos ech� mi polvito!</p>

4689,"<p>The following are excerpts from various American Medical Journals. Prepare yourself, they are pretty amazing and sick (But all are true)               You have been warned!!!!!     -----------------------------------FEMALE SOFA: A 500-pound woman from Illinois was examined in the hospital. During the examination, an asthma inhaler fell from under her armpit, a dime was found under one of her breasts, and a remote control was found lodged between the folds of her vulva. OUCH!     ----------------------------------A couple hobbled into a Washington emergency room covered in bloodied restaurant towels. The man had his arms around his waist, and the woman had hers around her head. They eventually explained to doctors that they had gone out that evening for a romantic dinner. Overcome with passion, the woman crept under the table to administer oral sex to the man. While in the act, she had an epileptic fit, which caused her mouth to clamp down on the man's member and wrenched it from side to side. In agony and desperation, the man grabbed a fork and stabbed her in the head until she let go.       --------------------------------SEX EDUCATION: A Californian doctor examining a young woman with abdominal pains sked her if she was sexually active. She said that she wasn't. A later examination showed that she was pregnant. Asked why she said that she was not sexually active, the woman replied, ""I'm not. I just lie there."" When asked if she knew who the father was, with a puzzled look she replied, ""No, who?""       --------------------------------BLIND DRUNK: A drunk staggered into a Pennsylvania ER complaining of severe pain while trying to remove his contact lenses. He said that they would come out halfway, but they always popped back in. A nurse tried to help using a suction pump, but without success. Finally, a doctor examined him and discovered that the man did not have his contact lenses in at all. He had been trying to rip out the membrane of his cornea.       --------------------------------GROWING SEASON: An old woman in a North Carolina ER complained of green vines growing from her vagina. Investigation revealed a large potato trapped in her womb. The woman then suddenly remembered that she had inserted it two weeks previously, because she thought that her uterus was falling out.       -------------------------------PRICKLY PAIR: In Michigan, a man came into the ER with lacerations to his penis. He complained that his wife had ""a rat in her vagina"" and it bit him during sex. After an examination of his wife, it was revealed that she had a surgical needle left inside her after a recent hysterectomy.       -------------------------------LAST STAND: A Cambridge man hobbled into the ER complaining of a permanent erection. He admitted to doctors that while on holiday in Cuba, he frequented many brothels, and in one he was given some erectile cream to keep him hard. He was told to use it sparingly. However, since he was aving so much fun, he kept using more and more. By the time he came to the ER, ll the blood vessels in his penis were swollen and his testicles had ballooned in size. Doctors could do nothing except prescribe pain killers, and told him that it would return to flaccidity in a few days. They also told him to enjoy his erection while it lasted, because it was going to be his last.       -------------------------------CALL THE BUM SQUAD! A World War II veteran came into a London clinic with a hemorrhoid problem. One painful pile would often hang down from the man's anus and he was in the habit of pushing it back up with an artillery shell. On this occasion, the shell got stuck. Doctors were going to remove it but the man told them the shell was still live. So the hospital called in the army bomb disposal squad, who built a lead box around the man's anus to defuse the shell so it could be removed.          ----------------------------------INNER SKELETON: A 63-year-old widow was admitted to the hospital in Recife, Brazil, suffering abdominal pains. X-rays showed that she was carrying a 20-inch long skeleton of a fetus which she conceived a decade earlier. It had ecome lodged outside the womb and was never expelled from her body.</p>

4707,"<p>Mr. Goldberg went to the zoo one day. While he was standing in<br /> front of the gorilla's enclosure, he noticed the gorilla watching him<br /> intently. The man waved at the gorilla, the gorilla waved back. He<br /> patted his stomach and the gorilla copied him. He jumped up and down,<br /> the gorilla started jumping. He made faces, pulled his hair, hopped on<br /> one foot, spun in a circle, and beat on his chest. His antics were<br /> copied exactly by the gorilla in the cage.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the wind gusted and he got some grit in his<br /> eye. Mr. Goldberg rubbed his eye, trying to make it better. While doing<br /> so he stepped closer and closer to the cage. As he pulled his<br /> eyelid down to dislodge the particle, the gorilla went crazy, banged<br /> against the bars, reached out, grabbed the nearly blinded Goldberg and<br /> beat him senseless. When the zoo keeper came to Mr. Goldberg,<br /> he told the keeper what had happened. The zoo keeper nodded and<br /> explained that in gorilla language pulling down your eyelid<br /> means ""fuck you.""</p>
<p>The explanation didn't make the gorilla's victim feel any better<br /> but he accepted it. As he left he became madder and madder. He plotted<br /> his revenge. The next day he purchased two large knives, two<br /> party hats, two party horns, and a large sausage. Putting the<br /> sausage in his pants, he hurried to the zoo and over to the gorilla's<br /> cage, into which he tossed a hat, a knife, and a party horn.</p>
<p>Knowing that the big ape liked to mimic people, he put on a party<br /> hat. The gorilla looked at him, and looked at the hat, and put it on.<br /> Next he picked up his horn and blew on it. The gorilla picked up his<br /> horn and did the same. He twirled in a circle blowing the horn. The<br /> gorilla did the same. Then Goldberg picked up his knife and waved it<br /> over his head. Again the gorilla copied it. Next he whipped the<br /> sausage out of his pants, and sliced it neatly in two.

4713,"<p>A friend just got back from a holiday ski trip to Utah with the kind of story that warms the cockles of anybody's heart. Conditions were perfect, 12 below, no feeling in the toes, basic numbness all over.  The ""Tell me when we're having fun"" kind of day.</p>
<p>One of the women in the group complained to her husband that she was in dire need of a restroom. He told her not to worry, that he was sure there was relief at the top of the lift in the form of a powder room for female skiers in distress. He was wrong, of course, and the pain did not go away.</p>
<p>If you've ever had nature hit its panic button in you, then you know That a temperature of 12 below zero doesn't help matters. So with time running out, she weighed her options.</p>
<p>Her husband, picking up on the intensity of the pain, suggested that since she was wearing an all white ski outfit, she should go off in the woods. No one would ever notice, he assured her. The white will provide more than adequate camouflage. So she headed for the tree line, began disrobing and proceeded to do her thing. If you've ever parked on the side of a slope, then you know there is a right way and a wrong way to set your skies so you don't move. Yup, you got it. She had the skies positioned the wrong way.</p>
<p>Steep slopes are not forgiving, even during embarrassing moments. Without any warning, the woman found herself skiing backward, out of control racing through the trees, somehow missing all of them, and on to the slope. Her derriere and the reverse side were still bare, her pants down around her knees, and she was picking up speed all the while she continued on backwards, totally out-of-control, creating an unusual sight for the other skiers.</p>
<p>The woman skied, if you define that verb loosely, back under the lift, and finally collided violently with a pylon. The bad news was she broke her arm and was unable to pull up the ski pants. At long last her husband arrived, put an end to her nude show, then went to the base of the mountain and summoned the ski patrol, who transported her to a hospital.</p>
<p>In the emergency room she was regrouping when a man with a broken leg was put in a bed next to hers.</p>
<p>""So, how'd you break your leg?"" She asked, making small talk.</p>
<p>""It was the darndest thing you ever saw,"" he said ""I was riding up this ski lift and suddenly I couldn't believe my eyes. There was this crazy woman skiing backwards out of control down the mountain with her bare bottom hanging out. I leaned over to get a better look and I guess I didn't realize how far I'd moved.  I fell out of the lift.""</p>
<p>""So how'd you break your arm?""</p>

''Our cars are demolished, yet we walk unharmed. This must be a sign from God that we are to be best friends for the rest of our lives,'' she spoke wisely. ''I agree completely, ma'am,'' the man replied. The woman stepped closer to examine the damage and noticed something shiny within her car. Reaching in, she pulled out an unbroken bottle. ''This bottle of wine wasn't even cracked. I think this is another sign that we are to drink a toast to our new friendship.'' ''That's a great idea, miss,'' the man answered taking the bottle from her. He popped the cork and drank his share. ''I'm sorry. How rude of me. Would you like some?'' ''No, thanks,'' came the reply.

4726,"<p>Everyone remembers the cartoon show Scooby-Doo from their early  childhood, right? But something you may not remember is what the show was  really about. As we've gotten older, it has become more clear what Fred,  Shaggy, Daphne, Velma, and Scooby were actually doing as they traversed the  continent foiling crimes of all sorts in the Mystery Machine. WHAT WE  REMEMBER: Four teenagers and their trusted dog gallop across the country in  their purple and green van solving mysteries of all sorts -- and in the  process meet all kinds of interesting people. THE TRUTH: Four high-school  dropouts and their sentient dog ride around the country in their psychedelic  love machine, earning their way by selling drugs. Oh, and they occasionally  take some old guys mask off to solve a mystery. It may be hard to swallow,  but just take a look at the evidence... Take Shaggy for example. Not only is  he the inspiration for the current 'grunge' scene, with his sloppy dress and  facial hair, but Shaggy is obviously a 'burner', i.e., he smokes marijuana.  Why do you think he is constantly hungry? Shaggy can make a six foot hoagie  and swallow it whole. And then there is Scooby himself. While dogs do not  generally smoke joints, Scooby gets his 'high' from Scooby-Snacks, which are  in fact Hash-Brownies. Whenever Scooby, or Shaggy for that matter, eats a  Scooby-Snack, they go ape! It just blows their mind and they do whatever  they are told, because they are so lit! Scooby is also hungry all the time. The other characters do not actively take part in the stoner-fest that  Shaggy and Scooby do, but they do condone the selling of it because it helps  support their jaunts across the country (and the world -- they drove to  China once). These other characters do have their own peculiarities  however... Fred and Daphne are always splintering off from the group to go  'solve the case' by themselves. It's no real mystery what these two are  really doing -- they're getting busy in the back of the Mystery Machine.  Daphne, with her pretty pink legs, and Fred are constantly bumping uglies. Fred is, by the way, pumped up on steroids. One thing that remains a mystery  though, is why he always wore that stupid scarf around his neck. And what  about Velma? Everyone's least favorite of the cast, was of course, a  lesbian. But, as it turned out in the later episodes, she was also into  beastiality. Where do you think Scrappy-Doo came from? Scrappy, who was a  dog yet spoke perfect English, was obviously a product of Velma and Scooby. So the kids spent their teenage years driving around the world, slangin'  dope, shooting steroids, eating hash brownies, and fucking their dog, while  all the while looking for the perfect 'hit'. Oh if we had only known these  things when we watched this cartoon as children...--sumitted by : Sarai Lockett</p>
"
4727,"<p>To the citizens of the United States of America:</p>
<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today.</p>
<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you&nbsp; noticed.</p>
<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:</p>
<p>1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up ""aluminium"" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.</p>
<p>Look up ""vocabulary"". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"".</p>
<p>2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.</p>
<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard.</p>
<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.</p>
<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.</p>
<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football.</p>
<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.</p>
<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for ""shit""</p>
<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day.</p>
<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.</p>
<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

4729,"<p>Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?</p>
<p>A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies.<br /> What does a cow eat? Hay and corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system.<br /> Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily allowance of vegetable slop.</p>

4731,"<p>There's gotta be a better way to spend December. Let's face it: once you're<br /> old enough to fall off of Santa's ""List"", Christmas loses some of its magic.<br /> Actually, it loses all its magic and turns into a super-commercialized orgy of<br /> over-eating, binge drinking, and familial Hell. But there isn't any ""bah,<br /> humbug"" here... no siree! We just think the venerable holiday could use some<br /> fresh changes, nothing big... just a couple of twists here and there. Like a new<br /> cover of ""White Christmas"" sung by Robert Downey Jr. perhaps, or maybe a Ninja<br /> Santa, or instead of giving presents, give advice. That way everyone gives and<br /> gets. So we kindly suggest that you enact some of these new traditions in your<br /> celebration of this holiday season. * Decorate your fireplace, tree, and house<br /> with long fatty strips of Christmas Bacon. * Fill a pair of galoshes with<br /> cottage cheese and leave them by the door Christmas Eve. Check back in the<br /> morning to look for Santa's little curds-slathered footprints. * Get rid of your<br /> Christmas Tree and invest in the new Yuletide rage... The Chia Christ! *<br /> Decorate your nipples with frosting, sprinkles, and tinsel. * Attend Midnight<br /> Mass and hoot ""boo-yah"" every time the priest mentions ""the savior"". * Carve<br /> stars in pumpkins, and hide painted eggs in your yard while dressed up like<br /> Abraham Lincoln. When your neighbors ask you what you're doing, respond, ""I was<br /> going to ask you freaks the same thing."" * Dress up like an elf, go to a<br /> playground, and collect lunch money from kids to ""pay for Santa's chemotherapy"".<br /> Buy a Christmas six pack with the proceeds. * Find out exactly how many cups of<br /> spiked eggnog it takes to get sugarplums to dance in your head. * Eat Christmas<br /> dinner at a soup kitchen in a suit and tie and complain loudly that the service<br /> is lousy, the creamed corn is lumpy, and someone smells like ""ripe ass"". *<br /> Casually hang out at a mall dressed like Santa. When hurried parents ask you if<br /> you're the on-duty Santa, smile and say ""No. I'm John Wayne Gacy"". * Get the<br /> crap beaten out of you for showing the ""Christmas Spirit"" by hugging strangers<br /> on the street. * Boil goat heads and festoon the outside of your house with<br /> them. Suggest to neighbors that they do the same because the skulls ""spook<br /> flying reindeer"". * Tell your parents you're bringing home someone special, and<br /> then arrive with a life-sized Gingerbread Man. If you're a man, tell your folks<br /> you're ""gay for gingerbread"". If you're a woman, tell them you have something<br /> else ""cooking in the oven"". * Make sure all your toy-sized nativity scenes come<br /> with spring-loaded attack sheep, kung-fu grip wise men, and shepherds that<br /> transform into robotic tarantulas. * Christmas Morning Happy Hour at Hooters,<br /> 6am 'til Noon.</p>

4732,"<p>I woke up early feeling a little depressed, because it was my<br /> birthday and I thought, ""another year older,"" but decided to<br /> make the best of it. So I showered and shaved, knowing when I<br /> went down to breakfast my wife would greet me with a big kiss<br /> and say, ""Happy Birthday, dear."" </p>
<p>All smiles I went into breakfast and there sat my wife reading<br /> the newspaper as usual. She didn't say one word. So I got myself<br /> a cup of coffee and thought to myself, ""oh well, she just<br /> forgot."" The kids will be in a few minutes all cheers and they<br /> will sing Happy Birthday and have a nice gift for me. </p>
<p>There I sat, enjoying my coffee and I waited. Finally the kids<br /> came running in yelling, ""Give me a slice of toast. I'm late.<br /> And where is my coat? I'm going to miss the bus!"" Feeling more<br /> depressed than ever, I left for the office. </p>
<p>When I walked into the office my secretary greeted me with a<br /> nice smile and a ""Happy Birthday, Boss"" and said, ""I'll get you<br /> some coffee."" Her remembering made me feel a lot better. Later<br /> in the morning my secretary knocked on my door and said since<br /> it's your birthday, why don't we have lunch together. Thinking<br /> it would make me feel better I said that's a good idea. </p>
<p>So we locked up the office and since it was my birthday I said,<br /> ""why don't we drive out of town and have lunch in the country<br /> instead of going to the usual place."" So we drove out of town<br /> and went to a little out of the way place. We had a couple of<br /> martinis, a nice lunch, and started driving back to town when my<br /> secretary said, ""why don't we go by my place and I will fix you<br /> another martini.""</p>
<p>It sounded like a good idea since we didn't have anything to do<br /> in the office anyway. So we went to her apartment and she fixed<br /> us both a martini. After a while she said, ""Will you excuse me,<br /> I think I will slip into something more comfortable,"" and left<br /> the room. In six minutes, she opened her bedroom door and came<br /> out carrying a big birthday cake. Following her were my wife and<br /> all my kids and there I sat, with nothing on but my socks.</p>

Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a holdup  and fired a few wild shots. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, promptly removing  him from the gene pool. Several other customers also drew their guns, but didn't fire.  No one else was hurt.</p>

4745,"<p>A bus filled with politicians was driving through the countryside one day, on the campaign trail. The bus driver, caught up in the beautiful scenery,loses control and crashes into the ditch. A farmer living nearby hears the horrible crash and rushes out to discover the wreckage. Finding the politicians, he buries them.</p>
<p>The next day, the police come to the farm to question the man. ""So you buried all the politicians?"" asked the police  officer. ""Were they all dead?""</p>
<p>The farmer answered, ""Some said they weren't, but you know how politicians lie.""</p>

4746,"<p>:The following is taken word-for-word from a Mormon pamphlet, 'For Young Men Only', published a number  years ago.  The Mormon's Guide to Avoiding Masturbation:1. Pray daily. Ask for the gifts of the spirit which    will strengthen you against temptation. Pray    fervently and out loud when the temptations are    strongest. When the temptation to masturbate is    strong, yell 'STOP' to those thoughts as loudly as    you can in your mind. Then recite a portion of the    Bible or sing a hymn.2. Set a goal of abstinence. Begin with a day, then a    week, a month and year. Finally, commit yourself to    never doing it again. Make a pocket calendar for a    month on a small card. Carry it with you but show it    to no one. If you masturbate, colour that day black.    Your goal will be to have no black days.  3. Set up a reward system. Each time you reach a goal    reward yourself with a quarter.4. When on the toilet or showering, leave the door    partly open.5. Avoid people, situations, and pictures and reading    material that might create sexual excitement. 6. Use physical restraints.7. Wear pajamas that are difficult to open, yet loose    and not binding. Put on several layers that would be    difficult to remove while half asleep. 8. In severe cases, tie your hands to the bed frame.9. Be aware of situations that depress you or that    cause you to feel lonely, bored, frustrated, or    discouraged. These emotional states can trigger the    desire to masturbate as a way of escape.  10. To cancel the pleasure of masturbating, associate    something very distasteful with the act. For    example, imagine bathing in a tub full of worms and    eating some of them.</p>

4758,"<p>Two Redneck hunters got a pilot to fly them into the far north for elk hunting. They were quite successful in their venture, and bagged six big bulls. The pilot came back as arranged to pick them up. They started loading their gear into the plane, including the six elk. </p>
<p>But the pilot objected he said, ""The plane can take out only four of your elk. You will have to leave two behind."" </p>
<p>One of the hunters pushed forward, ""Hey, last year our pilot let us take out six elk. It was the same model plane, same weather conditions, and everything. What's with this? We want you to allow us to fly out just like last year."" </p>
<p>Reluctantly the pilot finally permitted them to put all six elk aboard and the men all climbed in with their gear. But when they attempted to take off and fly out of the valley, the little plane could not make it. They crashed in the wilderness. Climbing out of the wreckage, one Redneck said to the other, ""Do you know where we are?"" </p>
<p>""I think so,"" replied the other Redneck. </p>
<p>""Yep! I think this is about 100 yards further along than where we crashed last year!""</p>

<p>The quarterback seethed, but he suppressed the language that might get him<br /> tossed from the game. ""What it comes down to,"" he bellowed, ""is that you stink!"" </p>
<p>The official stared a few more seconds. Then he bent down, picked up the<br /> ball, paced off 15 yards, and put the ball down. He turned to face the steaming<br /> quarterback. The official finally replied, ""and how do I smell from here,<br /> a******?""</p>

4768,"<p>Ebonics Version of Windows '98 Debuts!</p>
<p>Microsoft has announced that its special Ebonics version of Windows 98, titled  ""It be a fresh Window."" It has been leaked to several suburbs, causing confusion  for  unsuspecting users.</p>
<p>There are numerous differences between Windows 98 and the Ebonics version.</p>
<p>When opening the Ebonics version, the familiar windows chime is replaced With a ""phat getto track that melts 'em down wit dope-ass bass,"" The opening screen features a Windows logo that is spray painted on a brick wall - along with several gangsta signs, slogans and shout outs.</p>
<p>On the main screen, My Computer is replaced with ""Dis My Shit.""</p>
<p>The Recycle Bin has been replaced with a Goodwill dumpster.</p>
<p>If users are logged on to a network, the Network Neighborhood is replaced With ""Da Hood.""</p>
<p>Users have their choice of two animated screen savers: ""Marquee,"" a lil' G  spray- painting dirty words that move across the screen; or ""Flying Bullets,"" a '64 Olds' loaded with gangstas doing  a desktop drive by.</p>
<p>Users of the Ebonics version will notice several command and dialogue box changes:</p>
<p>1.   Break Back In = Re-entry<br /> 2.   Aww Shit = Error<br /> 3.   U Betta Recognize = Delete<br /> 4.   Itz All Good = OK<br /> 5.   4 Real Doe =Yes<br /> 6.   Hold Up, Dawg = Cancel<br /> 7.   Do Dat Shit Again = Reset<br /> 8.   R U Crazy = Are You Sure<br /> 9.   Hunt Dat Bitch Down = Find<br /> 10.  Put A Cap In It = Delete<br /> 11.  Games &amp; Shit = Programs<br /> 12.  Letter Shit = Documents</p>
<p>The Ebonics version comes standard with a special edition of Microsoft Works titled ""Homie Essentials.""</p>
<p>The word processing program greatly differs from the main-stream program. Several words on the title bar have been changed:</p>
<p>1.   Dat Thang = File<br /> 2.   I Be Seein' It = View<br /> 3.   Put Sumpin In = Insert<br /> 4.   Hook It Up = Format<br /> 5.   Stuff I Ain't gone Need =Tools<br /> 6.   Number Shit = Table<br /> 7.   Break In = Window<br /> 8.   What Da F*C@*K@? = Help</p>
<p>Note:  ""Stuff I ain't gone  need""  (Tools)  does not include spelling or grammar check options, and Auto Correct has been replaced with ""Keepin' it Real.""</p>

4769,"<p>There once was a brother and a sister, fraternal twins, who were approaching their high school graduation. It was getting near prom night and neither of them had a date for it. </p>
<p>So one day, the girl approaches her brother and says, ""Hey, you got a date for the prom yet?""</p>
<p>He says, ""No, why? You got someone lined up for me?"" </p>
<p>""You might say that. Why don't you take me to the prom?""</p>
<p>""Take you? You kidding? You're my sister!"" </p>
<p>""Well, are you taking somebody else out?""</p>
<p>""You know I don't have a date, sis."" </p>
<p>""And neither do I. But we both want to go to the prom, don't we?"" Her brother nods. </p>
<p>She continues, ""So we should go with each other.""</p>
<p>The brother can't see anything wrong with her reasoning, so he tells his sister that if neither of them has a date by Wednesday evening he will take her to the prom. </p>
<p>Wednesday evening rolls around. Neither of the siblings has a date, so the brother tells his sister that he'll take her to the prom on Friday.</p>
<p>At the prom, both of them have a good time. The brother is glad that his sister talked him into taking her. </p>
<p>Then, while he's standing at the punch bowl, his sister comes up to him again.</p>
<p>""Hey, brother, let's dance. ""</p>
<p>He looks around to make sure that nobody heard her. ""Look, sis, this is the Senior Prom, okay? I'm not going to dance with my own sister at the prom, okay?""</p>
<p>""Don't be so shy. Look, Jimmy Elder is dancing with his cousin. So why can't you dance with your sister?""</p>
<p>""Oh . . . all right. ""</p>
<p>So they dance, a slow number. The rest of the prom passes by and after a while it's over and time to go. Both of them have had a good time.</p>
<p>In the car, with the brother at the wheel, the sister looks over at him and says, ""Let's not go straight home.""</p>
<p>He gives her a curious look and says, ""What are we going to do instead?""</p>
<p>""Oh, I don't know. Just drive around.""</p>
<p>He agrees, and after they have driven around a while, out in the country, she looks over at him again and says, ""Want to find some place to park?""</p>
<p>""Hell,"" he says, ""are you crazy? You're my sister, I'm not going parking with you!""</p>
<p>""Who said anything about 'going parking'? Let's just pull over somewhere and talk for a while, okay? It's been a busy year for both of us, how long has it been since we've had a chance to talk to each other?""</p>
<p>So she finally talks her brother into pulling the car over on a secluded back road, and after a few minutes of idle talk, she looks over at him again.</p>
<p>""Hey . . . "" she says.</p>
<p>""What?""</p>
<p>""Why don't you kiss me?""</p>
<p>""You've been suggesting a lot of weird things lately, you know that? I'm not going to kiss you, you're my sister! ""And he reached for the ignition switch to start the car.</p>
<p>She reached out and took his hand. ""I know I'm your sister. You've mentioned that a lot lately. And you're my brother. And don't we love each other? Why shouldn't we kiss if we feel like it?"" She kissed him on the cheek and he kissed her back. After a few minutes of kissing, she whispered in his ear, ""Come on. Let's do it.""</p>
<p>""Do what?"" said her brother, but he had a good idea of what his sister had in mind.</p>
<p>""You know what,"" his sister replied.</p>
<p>""I can't do that with you, you're my. . . "" His voice trailed off.</p>
<p>While he was on top of her, his sister murmured, ""You know, you're a lot lighter than Dad.""</p>
<p>""I know,"" said her brother. ""Mom told me."" </p>

4775,"<p>New Corporate Cost-Cutting Policy Due to the current financial situation, changes will be made to the Business Travel standards and Procedures Manual. Effective Monday the following revised procedures apply: Lodging All employees are encouraged to stay with relatives and friends while on business travel. If weather permits, public areas such as parks should be used as temporary lodging sites. Bus terminals, train stations, and office lobbies may provide shelter in periods of inclement weather. Transportation Hitchhiking is the preferred mode of travel in lieu of commercial transport. Luminescent safety vests will be issued to all employees prior to their departure on business trips. Bus transportation will be used only when work schedules require such travel. Airline tickets will be authorized in extreme circumstances and the lowest fares will be used. For example, if a meeting is scheduled in Seattle, but the lower fare can be obtained by traveling to Detroit, then travel to Detroit will be substituted for travel to Seattle. Meals Expenditures for meals will be limited to an absolute minimum. It should be noted that certain grocery and specialty chains, such as Hickory Farms, General Nutrition centers, and, Costco, Sams stores etc. often provide free samples of promotional items. Entire meals can be obtained in this manner. Travelers should also be familiar with indigenous roots, berries, and other protein sources available at their destinations. If restaurants must be utilized, travelers should use ""all you can eat"" salad bars. This is especially effective for employees traveling together as one plate can be used to feed the entire group. Employees are also encouraged to bring their own food on business travel. Cans of tuna fish, Spam, and Beefaroni can be consumed at your leisure without the necessary bother of heating or costly preparation. Miscellaneous All employees are encouraged to devise innovative techniques in effort to save company dollars. One enterprising individual has already suggested that money could be raised during airport layover periods which could be used to defray travel expenses. In support of this idea, red caps will be issued to all employees prior to their departure so that they may earn tips by helping others with their luggage. Small plastic roses and ball point pens will also be available to employees so that sales may be made as time permits.</p>

4795,"<p>Questions concerning love and wisdom were posed to a group of children (ages 5 to 10). Their responses were amazingly astute and very enlightening, thus proving that all we need to know, we probably learned in kindergarten.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE PROPER AGE TO GET MARRIED?</p>
<p>""Eighty-four. Because at that age, you don't have to work anymore, and you can spend all your time loving each other."" (Judy, 8)</p>
<p>""Once I'm done with kindergarten, I'm going to find me a wife."" (Tommy, 5)</p>
<p>WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?</p>
<p>""On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date."" (Mike, 10)</p>
<p>WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?</p>
<p>""You should never kiss a girl unless you have enough bucks to buy her a big ring and her own VCR, 'cause she'll want to have videos of the wedding."" (Jim, 10)</p>
<p>""Never kiss in front of other people. It's a big embarrassing thing if anybody sees you. But if nobody sees you, I might be willing to try it with a handsome boy, but just for a few hours."" (Kally, 9)</p>
<p>THE GREAT DEBATE:</p>
<p>IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?</p>
<p>""It's better for girls to be single, but not for boys. Boys need somebody to clean up after them."" (Lynette, 9)</p>
<p>""It gives me a headache to think about that stuff. I'm just a kid. I don't need that kind of trouble."" (Kenny, 7)</p>
<p>CONCERNING WHY LOVE HAPPENS BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE:</p>
<p>""No one is sure why it happens, but I heard it has something to do with how you smell. That's why perfume and deodorant are so popular."" (Jan, 9)</p>
<p>""I think you're supposed to get shot with an arrow or something, but the rest of it isn't supposed to be so painful."" (Harlen, 8)</p>
<p>ON WHAT FALLING IN LOVE IS LIKE:</p>
<p>""Like an avalanche where you have to run for your life."" (Roger, 9) </p>
<p>""If falling in love is anything like learning to spell, I don't want to do it. It takes too long to learn."" (Leo, 7)</p>
<p>ON THE ROLE OF GOOD LOOKS IN LOVE AND ROMANCE:</p>
<p>""If you want to be loved by somebody who isn't already in your family, it doesn't hurt to be beautiful."" (Jeanne, 8)</p>
<p>""It isn't always just how you look. Look at me. I'm handsome like anything and I haven't got anybody to marry me yet."" (Gary, 7)</p>
<p>""Beauty is skin deep. But how rich you are can last a long time."" (Christine, 9)</p>
<p>CONCERNING WHY LOVERS OFTEN HOLD HANDS:</p>
<p>""They want to make sure their rings don't fall off, because they paid good money for them."" (David, 8)</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIAL OPINIONS ABOUT LOVE:</p>
<p>""I'm in favor of love as long as it doesn't happen when 'The Simpsons' are on TV."" (Anita, 6)</p>
<p>""Love will find you, even if you are trying to hide from it. I've been trying to hide from it since I was five, but the girls keep finding me."" (Bobby, 8)</p>
<p>""I'm not rushing into being in love. I'm finding fourth grade hard enough."" (Regina, 10)</p>
<p>PERSONAL QUALITIES NECESSARY TO BE A GOOD LOVER:</p>
<p>""One of you should know how to write a check. Because, even if you have tons of love, there is still going to be a lot of bills."" (Ava, 8)</p>
<p>SOME SUREFIRE WAYS TO MAKE A PERSON FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU:</p>
<p>""Tell them that you own a whole bunch of candy stores."" (Del, 6)</p>
<p>""Don't do things like have smelly, green sneakers. You might get attention, but attention ain't the same thing as love."" (Alonzo, 9)</p>
<p>""One way is to take the girl out to eat. Make sure it's something she likes to eat. French fries usually works for me."" (Bart, 9)</p>
<p>HOW CAN YOU TELL IF TWO ADULTS EATING DINNER AT A RESTAURANT ARE IN LOVE ?</p>
<p>""Just see if the man picks up the check. That's how you can tell if he's in love."" (John, 9)</p>
<p>""Lovers will just be staring at each other and their food will get cold. Other people care more about the food."" (Brad, 8)</p>
<p>""It's love if they order one of those desserts that are on fire. They like to order those because it's just like their hearts are on fire."" (Christine, 9)</p>
<p>WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE THINKING WHEN THEY SAY, ""I LOVE YOU"":</p>
<p>""The person is thinking: Yeah, I really do love him, but I hope he showers at least once a day.""     (Michelle, 9)</p>
<p>HOW A PERSON LEARNS TO KISS:</p>
<p>""You learn it right on the spot, when the 'gooshy' feelings get the best of you."" (Doug, 7)</p>
<p>""It might help if you watched soap operas all day."" (Carin, 9)</p>

<p>""It's never okay to kiss a boy. They always slobber all over you. That's why I stopped doing it."" (Jean, 10)</p>

<p>""Don't forget your wife's name...that will mess up the love."" (Roger,8)</p>
<p>""Be a good kisser. It might make your wife forget that you never take the trash out."" (Randy, 8)</p>

Once outside he<br /> stood up and fell flat on his face. So he decided to crawl the 4<br /> blocks to his home. When he arrived at the door he stood up and<br /> again fell flat on his face. He crawled through the door and<br /> into his bedroom.</p>

One little boy said, ""A tragedy would be if a school bus<br /> full of kids ran off a road and everybody died�. Mr. Clinton responded, ""No,<br /> that would be an accident�. Shocked, the class was silent for a moment when a<br /> bright young girl stood up and said, ""A tragedy would be if all the teachers in<br /> the world quit teaching�. Clinton thought for a moment and then said, ""No, that<br /> would be a great loss�. Finally another boy stood up and said, ""A tragedy would<br /> be if the President was in an airplane and it crashed and he died�. Clinton<br /> smiled and said, ""Good job, now that would be a tragedy. Can you explain to the<br /> class why that would be a tragedy?"" The little boy responded by saying, ""Well,<br /> it probably wouldn't be an accident and it certainly wouldn't be a great loss�.</p>

"
4883,"<p>I�m am writing this little story in the day of the lives of Laura and Randy. It all started on a Sunday mourning, bright and early, with boredom. We decided to spend a fun filled day with all the luxuries of our lives. We decided to start the day with a ride on his Harley, witch we both enjoy the freedom of the road. We road for a couple of hours and a took a well needed rest, so then we decided to take a cruise on my boat, which we also enjoy, because of all the quiet and alone time, with no one else around, not even a phone. We cruised for around a hour or so and decided it was time to get something to eat, so we returned home and jumped in the explorer and headed down the road to get something to eat. Well we hit the road and came across a Rite Aide, and I decided to ask him to pull in and get me some Captain Morgans, and he did just that. As he left the liquor store he put my alcohol in the back of the explore, now my day seemed to be complete. So with all he did with me and for me, I took it upon myself to make his day complete too. So I began to play with all his emotions, an got  quite carried away. The next thing I knew I heard a knock on the window and as I raised my head, I saw a Cop standing at the window, boy I couldn�t believe what was happening. As Randy�s eyes rolled back in his head, I didn�t know if he had seen the cop or was just enjoying the moment? Next thing I heard was the cop ask me to step out of the car, and as quick as I could pull myself back together I did what he asked. The next thing I new I was under arrest for  pubic drinking. Holy Crape I thought to myself. The officer explained this was better the being arrested for soliciting. At this time I wasn�t for sure what was any better than the other, but I calmly held my composure. Than the cop looked in the back seat of the explorer and saw the bottle of liquor, and without thinking Randy responded you can buy liquor on Sunday. O�boy the cop asked Randy to step out of the car, as he placed the handcuffs on me. He informed Randy, he also was under arrest for trying to sell his girlfriend to an officer. I believe the cop misunderstood Randy�s response, and thought he offered let him lick-her on Sunday so the officer placed handcuffs on Randy, and charged him with pandering. Shit o Shit what did we get ourselves into on such a beautiful Sunday afternoon? He then placed both of us in the back of the police car. Without thinking I said this really SUCKS. Then you won�t believe what happened next. The cop charged me with attempted bribery, or in other words sucking up to an officer. I knew we both were done for at this time, but it doesn�t end there, I again without thinking responded boy did I stick a foot in my mouth. The officer at this time lowered  his cheap sunglasses, and in amazement he laughed this crazy insane laugh I�ll never forget, believe that. He said to the both of us, I�m going to have to let you off on all charges, there was no way in hell he wanted to finish his police report ending with my statement, that I stuck 12 inches (a foot) in my mouth.  So with a sigh of relief we got back in the explorer and went on our way. Let this story be a warning to anyone considering pubic drinking, don�t try it unless you can swallow 12 inches. And if you can swallow that you probably swallowed this story too.</p>

4893,"<p>Two Indians and a Hillbilly were walking in the woods, all of a sudden one of the Indians ran up a hill to the mouth of a small cave.""</p>
<p>Wooooo! Wooooo! Wooooo!"" he called into the cave and then he listened very closely until he heard a answering, ""Wooooo! Wooooo! Wooooo!"" </p>
<p>He tore off his clothes and ran into the cave. </p>
<p>The Hillbilly was puzzled and asked the other Indian what that was all about, was the other Indian crazy or what? </p>
<p>""No,"" said the Indian.</p>
<p>""It is our custom during mating season when Indian men see cave, they holler 'Wooooo Wooooo! Wooooo!' into the opening. If they get an answer back, it means there is a girl in there waiting to mate.""</p>
<p>Just then they saw another cave. </p>
<p>The Indian ran up to the opening of the cave stopped, and hollered, ""Wooooo! Wooooo! Wooooo!"" </p>
<p>Immediately, there was an answering ""Wooooo! Wooooo! Wooooo!"" from deep inside the cave. He tore off his clothes and ran into the cave. </p>
<p>The Hillbilly wandered around in the woods alone for a while, and then he came upon a great big cave. As he looked in amazement at the size of the huge opening, he was thinking, ""Hoo, man! Look at the size of this cave!<br /> It is bigger than those the Indians found. There must be some really big, fine women in this cave!"" </p>
<p>He stood in front of the opening and hollered with all his might ""Wooooo! Wooooo! Wooooo!"" He grinned and closed his eyes in anticipation and then he heard the answering call, ""WOOOOOOOOO! WOOOOOOOOO! WOOOOOOOOO!"" </p>
<p>With a gleam in his eyes and a smile on his face, he raced into the cave, tearing off his clothes as he ran. </p>

<p>The professor is astonished. He takes off his glasses, takes a step back, and says, ""Son, all the years I've been giving this lecture, no one has ever claimed to have slept with a ghost. You've got to come up here and tell us about your experience."" </p>
<p>The redneck student replies with a nod and a grin, and begins to make his way up to the podium. </p>
<p>The professor says, ""Well, tell us what it's like to have sex with a ghost."" </p>
<p>The student replies, ""Ghost? Damn..... From back there I thought you said, 'Goats'!"" </p>

4932,"<p>TOP 10 WORST CARTOON CHARACTERS OF ALL TIME (WITH COMMENTARY)</p>
<p>#10- Tweety Bird- You know there's a problem when every single kid roots<br /> for the ""hero"" to be devoured in each episode.  No sense of humor. No<br /> personality. Annoying voice.  Plus he was always tattling.  I knew kids<br /> like this growing up.  Most of them ate paste, sat in the front of the<br /> bus, and got me in trouble.</p>
<p>#9- Grape Ape- A real moron.  All he knows how to say is his name.  And<br /> he does so non-stop for a half an hour.  I'd rather watch ""Davey and<br /> Goliath covet heir neighbors model airplane.""</p>
<p>#8- Olive Oyl- Am I the only one out there who thought this was one lady<br /> NOT worth fighting over?  And that's what they did every episode!  She<br /> talks like Edith Bunker and looks like a pipe cleaner with a cheap hat.<br /> Hey, Popeye,  you're a sailor... you can do better!  Plus Olive can<br /> never decide if she wants to date that jerk Brutus or not.  The girl is<br /> just bad news.</p>
<p>#7- Petunia Pig- Remember her?  Porky's girlfriend?  She was a real<br /> zero.  What was the point of her anyway?  To make Porky look good?  Come<br /> on, who did they think they're fooling.  We all know Porky is gay.</p>
<p>#6- Pebbles &amp; Bam-Bam, as teenagers-  What were they thinking? Were they<br /> trying to cash in on the ""Joanie loves Chachi"" thing?  And how come<br /> every cartoon teenager plays in crumby rock band?  An awful -and<br /> thankfully shortlived- idea.</p>
<p>#5- Pepe LePew- Hello, Warner Brothers, ever heard of sexual harassment?<br /> Let's take a good look at this character;  a horny, rapist skunk who's<br /> attracted to other species!  NOT good for the kids.  Plus, worse still,<br /> he's French.</p>
<p>#4- Alan, from Josie and the Pussy Cats-  How weak was this ""Fred""<br /> clone?  They even gave him an ascot, for crying out loud.  Well, I knew<br /> Fred.  I grew up with Fred.  Fred was like a friend of mine.  Let me<br /> tell you something... you're no Fred.</p>
<p>#3- Zan and Zana, the Wondertwins-  How many times do we have to say it?<br /> Leave the crimefighting to the professionals!  ""Form of... an idiot!""<br /> They should  have been voted out of the Hall of Justice a long time ago.<br /> There's no room for dead weight in this game.</p>
<p>#2- Kazoo, from the Flintstones- It's like ""Hmmm, a miniature, green<br /> spaceman who appears only to Fred Flintstone isn't enough of a stretch.<br /> I know!  Let's give him a snotty London accent!"" Um, could I get a drug<br /> test from Hanna Barbara, please?</p>
<p>#1- Scrappy Doo-  And, really, who else COULD it be?  This guy ruined<br /> Scooby Doo!  Just came in and ruined it!  Scrappy is the Yoko Ono of<br /> Saturday morning  cartoons.  I can't even talk about it anymore.  It's<br /> too upsetting.</p>

4949,"<p>A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's Mercedes back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking! A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow again and the chicken fell into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, ""I think I can stand over the hole!"" So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, ""Grab for my 'thingy' and pull yourself up."" And the chicken did and pulled himself to safety. </p>

<p>""I think we should send a message to everyone on Earth who engages in oral<br /> sex. The contents of that message should tell them exactly what will happen to<br /> them on judgment day if they do not stop this type of activity."" replied St.<br /> Peter. </p>
<p>""That is an effective solution,"" God stated, ""but I think that instead of<br /> punishing those who practice oral sex, we should reward those who = refrain from<br /> it.

4961,"<p>""Did you know that last month's (expletive) phone bill is over $450?"" my wife scolded me in her harshest, my-husband-the-child voice. ""That's more than twice the monthly payment you make for that (expletive)computer!"" she continued as she escalated to screaming.</p>
<p>""I confess! I confess!"" I sobbed. ""I'm just an on-line junkie. I'm addicted to my modem! I guess I'll just have to join Modems Anonymous before I owe my soul to the phone company. ""As a counselor for Modems Anonymous, I hear numerous variations of the preceding story every day. That insidious disease, modem fever, is exacting a tragically large toll from the cream of our society's computer users. Modem-mania is sweeping through the very foundations of our country and there seems to be no stopping it. This disease (yes, it is a social disease of almost epidemic proportions) is becoming a such calamity that soon there's even going to be a soap opera about on-line addiction named, ""All My Modems. ""</p>
<p>If you don't already own one of those evil instruments called a modem, take warning! Don't even think about buying one. Modem fever sets in very quietly; it sneaks up on you and then grabs you by the wallet, checkbook or, heaven forbid, credit cards.</p>
<p>Once you own a modem, you enter the insidious addictive trap by ""dialing up"" a friend who also has a modem. For some strange reason, typing messages to each other fascinates you. (Even if it is less than 10%of the speed that you can speak the same words over a normal voice phone link. )Of course, you make several attempts at hooking up before you finally figure out that at least one of you must be in the half-duplex mode; that discovery actually titillates you (sounds impossible, but it's true).</p>
<p>Then your modem-buddy (friend is too good a term) sows another seed on the road to on-line addiction by giving you the number of a local RBBS (Remote Bulletin Board Service). Once you get an RBBS phone number, you've taken the first fatal step in a journey that can only end in on-line addiction.</p>
<p>After you take the next step by dialing up the RBBS your modem-buddy told you about, you find that it's very easy to ""log-on. ""This weird form of conversation with an unattended computer is strangely exciting, much more so than just typing messages when you're on-line with your modem-buddy. The initial bulletins scroll by and inform you about the board, but you're too ""up"" to comprehend most of it. Then you read some of the messages in the message section and maybe, in a tentative manner, you enter one or two of your own.</p>
<p>That's fun, but the excitement starts to wear off; you're calming down. Thinking that it might be worthwhile to go back and re-read the log-on bulletins, you return to the main RBBS menu.</p>
<p>Then it happens. The RBBS provides the bait that entices you all the way into the fiery hell of modem addiction. As you look at the RBBS main menu to learn how to return to the log-on bulletins, you find an item called FILES. By asking your host computer for FILES, you thread the bait onto the hook of corruption; the FILES SUBMENU sets the hook. You start running with the line when you LIST the files; you leap into the air with the sheer joy of the fight when all those public domain program title sand descriptions scroll by. They're FREE!!! All you have to do is tell the bulletin board to download (transmit) them to you. You download your first program and you're landed, in the creel, cleaned and ready for the cooking fires. In just 55 minutes after you logged-onto the board, you've downloaded six programs, one of them is Andrew Fleugelman's PC-Talk, version 3 (truly an instrument for evil). </p>
<p>BBS-LIST. DQC, which is also among the files you downloaded, contains a list of a great number of bulletin boards throughout the country. (There's evil all around us, constantly tempting us!) You print the list and find about 60 RBBS phone numbers. (Have mercy on our souls!) The list also gives you the hours of operation, communications parameters and informs you about each board's specialty. You decide to try PC-Talk and use it to dial-up an RBBS about three states away. Since the line is busy, you pass the time entering all those RBBS phone numbers into PC-Talk's voluminous dialing directory.</p>
<p>You try the number again -- still busy. You think, ""Hey, there's one that specializes in Pascal programs. Maybe I'll try it. It's about half-way across the country, but it's after 5pm and the phone rates have changed. It won't be too expensive.""</p>
<p>The Pascal board answers. After 45 minutes you've downloaded another five programs. Then you call another board --only this one's completely across the country from California, in Florida. And so it goes on into the night . . . and the next night. . . and the next. . . . Some days it gets to you. You begin to feel the dirtiness of modem addiction, particularly when your wife makes you feel like a child by berating you for those astronomical phone bills -- if she hasn't divorced you by then. Every time you sit down before your PC to do some work, you dial up another RBBS instead. If that one's busy, you call another, and another, until you connect. Then you feel OK, almost ""high."" When you finally hang up, you still can't work; you can only dial up another RBBS.</p>
<p>Your downfall as an on-line addict is just another one of this society's terrible tragedies, such as polygamy or the compulsion to circle all the numbers on computer magazine ""bingo cards."" Eventually your whole social life relies upon only the messages you find on electronic bulletin boards; your only happiness is the programs you have downloaded. (You never try any of them, you only collect them. )Hope exists, however. We, the dedicated but under-paid staff of Modems Anonymous, have done extensive research to find a cure for modem mania, which has been ruining hundreds of lives. And we have succeeded in our quest.</p>
<p>The cure is really quite simple, yet effective:  Set up your own remote bulletin board service. Then all the other modem addicts will phone you, and their wives can nag at them about $450 phone bills, and you can find peace -- at last.</p>

<p>From the New England Journal of Medicine:</p>
<p>Great news for girl watchers: Ogling over women's breasts is good for a man's health and can add years to his life, medical experts have discovered.</p>
<p>According to the New England Journal of Medicine, ""Just 10 minutes of staring at the charms of a well-endowed female is roughly equivalent to a 30-minute aerobics work-out"" declared gerontologist Dr. Karen Weatherby.</p>
<p>Dr. Weatherby and fellow researchers at three hospitals in Frankfurt, Germany, reached the startling conclusion after comparing the health of 200 male outpatients - half of whom were instructed to look at busty females daily, the other half told to refrain from doing so.</p>
<p>The study revealed that after five years, the chest-watchers had lower blood pressure, slower resting pulse rates and fewer instances of coronary artery disease. ""Sexual excitement gets the heart pumping and improves blood circulation,"" explains Dr. Weatherby.  ""There's no question: Gazing at breasts makes men healthier.""</p>
<p>""Our study indicates that engaging in this activity a few minutes daily cuts the risk of stroke and heart attack in half.  We believe that by doing so consistently, the average man can extend his life four to five years.""<br /> ...hmmm - I wonder if PC boobies count?</p>

4984,"<p>Chocolate Chip Cookies:</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>1.) 532.35 cm3 gluten<br /> 2.) 4.9 cm3 NaHCO3<br /> 3.) 4.9 cm3 refined halite<br /> 4.) 236.6 cm3 partially hydrogenated tallow triglyceride<br /> 5.) 177.45 cm3 crystalline C12H22O11<br /> 6.) 177.45 cm3 unrefined C12H22O11<br /> 7.) 4.9 cm3 methyl ether of protocatechuic aldehyde<br /> 8.) Two calcium carbonate-encapsulated avian albumen-coated protein<br /> 9.) 473.2 cm3 theobroma cacao<br /> 10.) 236.6 cm3 de-encapsulated legume meats (sieve size #10)</p>
<p> To a 2-L jacketed round reactor vessel (reactor #1) with an overall heat transfer coefficient of about 100 Btu/F-ft2-hr, add ingredients one, two and three with constant agitation. In a second 2-L reactor vessel with a radial flow impeller operating at 100 rpm, add ingredients four, five, six, and seven until the mixture is homogenous.</p>
<p>To reactor #2, add ingredient eight, followed by three equal volumes of the homogenous mixture in reactor #1. Additionally, add ingredient nine and ten slowly, with constant agitation. Care must be taken at this point in the reaction to control any temperature rise that may be the result of an exothermic reaction.</p>
<p>Using a screw extrude attached to a #4 nodulizer, place the mixture piece-meal on a 316SS sheet (300 x 600 mm). Heat in a 460K oven for a period of time that is in agreement with Frank &amp; Johnston's first order rate expression (see JACOS, 21, 55), or until golden brown. Once the reaction is complete, place the sheet on a 25C heat-transfer table, allowing the product to come to equilibrium.</p>

<p>Q: Officer, who provided this description?<br /> A: The officer who responded to the scene. </p>
<p>Q: A fellow officer provided the description of this so-called offender. Do you trust your fellow officers?<br /> A: Yes sir, with my life. </p>

4992,"<p>An 85 year old couple, having been married almost 60 years, had died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten years mainly due to her interest in health food, and exercise. When they reached the pearly gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and master bath suite and Jacuzzi. As they ""oohed and aahed"" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost. ""It's free,"" Peter replied, ""this is Heaven."" Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, ""What are the green fees?"" Peter's reply, ""This is heaven, you play for free."" Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the world laid out. ""How much to eat?"" asked the old man. ""Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!"" Peter replied with some exasperation. ""Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?"" the old man asked timidly. Peter lectured, ""That's the best part . . . you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven."" With that the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and shrieking wildly. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong. The old man looked at his wife and said, ""This is all your fault. If it weren't for your bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!""</p>

4996,"<p>Once there was a man who died and went to hell.When he got<br /> there he saw the devil sitting in a corner behind a big desk.He<br /> walked over to him and said </p>
<p>"" excuse me. ""</p>
<p>"" what is it? "" said the devil "" im a very busy man, i dont have<br /> time for this ""</p>
<p>"" well i just died and...""</p>
<p>"" yes,yes i understand just follow me i dont have time to<br /> sentence you properly ""</p>
<p>     The devil lead the man to three doors and opened the first<br /> one. Inside there was a man chained against a wall and a woman<br /> standind on the other side with a whip, every couple of minutes<br /> the woman would start lashing violently at the man until the man<br /> was half dead. than like magic he would heal and it would start<br /> all over again.</p>
<p>"" no i dont want that one "" the man said. And they went to the<br /> next door.</p>
<p>     Inside there was, again, a man chained against the wall and<br /> like the other door there was a woman standing on the other side<br /> of the room, but instead of a whip, she had a knife with jagged<br /> spikes sticking out of the blade. every few minutes she would<br /> lunge forward, stick the knife into the mans stomach and twist<br /> it back and forth, than yank his organs out with it and it would<br /> start over again after it healed.</p>
<p>the man gulped and said "" no i dont want that one either ""</p>
<p>     So the devil lead him to the last door and opened it.<br /> Inside this one there was ,again, a man and a woman, but this<br /> time the man was not chained to the wall. instead he was<br /> sprawled out comfortably on a chair. they were both naked. the<br /> woman was giving him a blow-job.</p>
<p>the man suddenly said "" i want that one! ""</p>
<p>     so the devil walked up to them tapped the woman on the<br /> shoulder and said "" your excused! ""</p>

4997,"<p>One day Gateway conducted a call out meeting for the best computer geeks around.  The employers went to a deli, a vegan restaurant, and an Indian restaurant scouting for people using computers.  They found a handful of adept people in each place and brought them to Gateway headquarters.</p>
<p>A Gateway big wig asked the Jews from the deli, ""How good are you with computers?""</p>
<p>One Jew responded, ""Extremely good.  But I won't tolerate pigs in this business.""</p>
<p>The big wig frowned.  ""We have a computer model in a box patterned after a pig.  It's advertising our new pink computer targeted at females.""</p>
<p>The Jew said, ""I won't tolerate this.  I am kosher.""  All of the Jews got up and stormed out of the building.</p>
<p>""Okay..."" the executive said.  ""I guess this idea will not appeal to a certain demographic.""  He tossed the prototype out the window.</p>
<p>""Now, how good are you guys?"" he asked, looking at the vegans.</p>
<p>""Very proficient,"" they answered, ""but we will not be milked for all we're worth.""</p>
<p>""Okay...so what do you think of this model?"" The executive held up a black and white Gateway cow-patterned box.</p>
<p>""I will not tolerate this,"" one of the vegans said.  ""To me, this is like shoving dairy products down our throats.""  The vegans got up and stormed out of the building. </p>
<p>""Well, what about you guys?"" the executive asked, looking at the Hindus.</p>
<p>The Indians were already bowing down to the sacred Gateway cow box.</p>
