40003,"<p>Bill Gates is hanging out with the chairman of General Motors.

She says, ""Eloise, honey, look up there on the poc'h of dat house. Jess look at dat. I'll bet she be cool.""</p>

40018,"<p>I hate to be the bearer of sad news so it is with a heavy heart<br /> that I pass on the following: </p>
<p>Please join me in remembering a great icon -- the veteran<br /> Pillsbury spokesman. The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a<br /> yeast infection and complications from repeated pokes in the<br /> belly. He was 71. Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased<br /> coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects,<br /> including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins,<br /> Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch. The<br /> grave site was piled high with flours. His longtime friend, Aunt<br /> Jemima, delivered the eulogy, describing Doughboy as a man who<br /> never knew how much he was needed. Doughboy rose quickly in show<br /> business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was<br /> not considered a very ""smart""cookie, wasting much of his dough<br /> on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he<br /> even still, as a crusty old man, was considered a roll model for<br /> millions. Toward the end it was thought he would rise again, but<br /> alas, he was no tart. Doughboy had a wife, Play Dough; two<br /> children, John Dough and Jane Dough; plus they had one in the<br /> oven. He also had a elderly father, Pop Tart. The funeral was<br /> held at 3:50 for about twenty minutes.</p>
"
40019,"<p>A man who was having heart trouble went to the doctor to see what his options<br /> were. Naturally, the doctor recommended a heart transplant. The man reluctantly<br /> agreed, and asked if there were any hearts immediately available, considering<br /> that money was no object. </p>
<p>""I do have three hearts,"" said the doctor. ""The first is from an 18-year old<br /> kid, non-smoker, athletic, swimmer, with a great diet. He hit his head on the<br /> swimming pool and died. It's $100,000. The second is from a marathon runner, 25<br /> years old, great condition, very strong. He got hit by a bus. It's $150,000. The<br /> third is from a heavy drinker, cigar smoker, steak lover. It's $500,000."" </p>
<p>""Hey, why is that heart so expensive? He lived a terrible life!"" </p>
<p>""Yes, but it's from a laywer. It's never been used.""</p>

40020,"<p>The National Poetry Contest had come down to two, a Yale graduate and a redneck from Texas. They were given a word, then allowed two minutes to study the word and come up with a poem that contained the word. The word they were given was  ""Timbuktu.""</p>
<p>First to recite his poem was the Yale graduate. He stepped to the microphone and said:</p>
<p>Slowly across the desert sand<br /> Trekked a lonely caravan;<br /> Men on camels, two by two,<br /> Destination Timbuktu.</p>
<p>The crowd went crazy! No way could the redneck top that, they thought. The redneck calmly made his way to the microphone and recited:</p>
<p>Me and Tim a huntin' went.<br /> Met three whores in a pop up tent.<br /> They was three, and we was two,<br /> So I bucked one, and Timbuktu.</p>
<p>The redneck won hands down!</p>

40022,"<p>A lovely afternoon finds one fellow and his wife golfing. They have had a wonderful time and the man has had a near perfect game. The final hole, by far the most difficult, wraps around an old barn. </p>
<p>With a terrible slice the man puts the barn between his ball and the green. Knowing that the strokes that it will take to get around the barn will destroy his score, he begins to rant and rave. His wife hating to see him ruin such a great afternoon makes a suggestion.</p>
<p>""What if I were to hold open the barn doors? That way you could send it right through the barn onto the green.""</p>
<p>He thinks this over and decides that it will work. With his wife holding open the barn door he lines up with the hole and gives the ball a terrific ""whack""! The ball shoots through the air and right into the head of his wife, killing her instantly.</p>
<p>Months go by, the man mourning all the while. His friends, hating to see him in such a state, convince him to go golfing with them. They end up at the same course and on the final hole, oddly enough, another terrible slice puts the old barn between his ball and the green. </p>
<p>Again he begins to rant and rave at what this dilemma will do to his score. He friend, wanting to please him, makes a suggestion.</p>
<p>""What if I were to hold open the barn doors? That way you could send it right through the barn onto the green.""</p>
<p>""No,"" the man replies, ""last time I did that I got two over par.""</p>

40043,"<p>A team of archaeologists was excavating in Israel  when they came upon a cave.. Written across the wall of the cave were the following symbols, in this order of appearance:A women - A donkey - A shovel - A fish - and the Star of David.They decided that this was a unique find and the writings were at least three thousand years old. They chopped out the piece of stone and had it brought to the museum where archaeologists from all over the world came to study the ancient symbols. They held a huge meeting after months of conferences to discuss the meaning of the markings.The president of the society stood up and pointed at the first drawing and said:""This looks like a woman. We can judge that the race was family oriented and held women in high esteem.  You can also tell they were intelligent, as the next symbol resembles a donkey, so, they were smart enough to have animals help them till the soil.The next drawing looks like a shovel of some sort, which means they even had tools to help them.  Even further proof of their high intelligence was in the fish,  which means that if a famine had hit the earth, whereby the food didn't grow, they would take to the sea for food.The last symbol appears to be the Star of David which means they were evidently Hebrews.""The audience applauded enthusiastically.Suddenly a little old man stood up in the back of the room and said: ""Idiots! Hebrews read from right to left.  It says: Holy Mackerel, Dig the Ass on that Woman!""</p>

<p>For the first few seconds, the parrot swore a blue streak inside that freezer. Then, suddenly, the parrot fell silent. </p>

40059,"<p>Customer: How much is your paint?</p>
<p>Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends.</p>
<p>Customer: Depends on what?</p>
<p>Clerk: Actually, it depends on a number of things.</p>
<p>Customer: Well, what is your average price for a gallon of paint? </p>
<p>Clerk: Wow-that's too hard a question. The lowest price is $9 a gallon,<br /> but we have 150 different prices ranging up to $200 per gallon. </p>
<p>Customer: What's the difference in the paint?</p>
<p>Clerk: There isn't any difference. It's all the same paint.</p>
<p>Customer: Well, then, I'd like some of the $9 paint. </p>
<p>Clerk: Well, before I sell you that paint, you need to answer a few<br /> questions. First, when do you intend to use the paint? </p>
<p>Customer: I want to paint tomorrow, on my day off. </p>
<p>Clerk: Well, if you want to use the paint tomorrow, I can only sell you<br /> the $200 paint.</p>
<p>Customer: When would I have to paint in order to get the $9 paint?</p>
<p>Clerk: To get the $9 paint, you would have to use it three weeks from<br /> now, and you have to start painting on a Friday and continue to paint until<br /> Sunday night.</p>
<p>Customer: You've got to be kidding!</p>
<p>Clerk: Sir, we don't kid around here. Please wait while I check to see<br /> if we have any $9 paint.</p>
<p>Customer: There's some on the shelf right there-I can see it! </p>
<p>Clerk: That's the same paint all right but we can sell only a certain<br /> number of gallons for the weekend that you want to paint. Ooops-the price<br /> just went up to $17 a gallon.</p>
<p>Customer: You mean the price went up while we were talking? </p>
<p>Clerk: Yes, sir. You see, we change prices and rules thousands of times<br /> a day, and since you haven't actually left the store with your paint yet,<br /> we just decided to raise the price. Unless you want the same thing to<br /> happen again, I suggest you get on with your purchase. How many gallons<br /> do you want? </p>
<p>Customer: I don't know exactly. Maybe five gallons, no, make it six<br /> gallons so I'm sure I have enough.</p>
<p>Clerk: If you don't use all the paint, you'll be penalized.</p>
<p>Customer: But if I've already paid for the paint, what does it matter if<br /> I don't use all of it?</p>
<p>Clerk: That's just the way it is, sir.</p>
<p>Customer: Well, that does it! I'm going somewhere else to buy my paint.<br /> Clerk: Good luck, sir. All of our competitors have similar rules. You'd<br /> better just buy your paint here, while our lowest price is still $28 a<br /> gallon.</p>

40066,"<p>Bill Gates dies in a car accident. He finds himself being sized up by God....'Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call. I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created Windows'95.I'm going to do something I've never done before. In your case, I'm going to let you decide where you want to go.''Well, what's the difference between the two?' Bill asks.God says, 'I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision.''Fine, but where should I go first?''I'll leave that up to you.''Okay, then,' says Bill. 'Let me try Hell first.'So Bill goes to Hell. It's a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with  clear waters and lots of beautiful  women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking  about. The sun is shining, the  temperature is perfect.He is very pleased. 'This is great!' he tells God. 'If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!''Fine,' says God, and off they go.Heaven is a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It's nice, but not as enticing as Hell.Bill thinks for a quick minute and decides. 'Hmm. I think I'd prefer Hell,' he tells God.'Fine,' replies God. 'As you desire.'So Bill Gates goes to Hell. Two weeks later, God decides to check on the late billionaire to see how he is doing in Hell. When he gets there, he finds Bill shackled to a wall, screaming amidst hot flames in a dark cave, being burned and tortured by demons. 'How's everything going?' he asks Bill.Bill responds, his voice filled with anguish and disappointment,  'This is awful! This is nothing  like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other  place, with the beaches and the beautiful women playing in the water?''Oh ... that was the SCREENSAVER.</p>

<p>So when a guy from the office whom she really liked asked her out, she decided to take desperate measures. On the way home she stops at the butcher and buys a kilo of fresh liver.

40081,"<p>BEAVERTON, OREGON - Intel Corporation  announced a major expansion of its successful 'Intel Inside' campaign  with a new line of silicon breast implants.'We thought this would be a natural  market for us because of our unparalleled knowledge of silicon,'  Intel spokesperson Duwane Marino told the tightly-packed audience  at a press conference in the Teton Auditorium in Beaverton's Civic  Center Building. 'Besides, Intel has a wealth of experience forcing  new technology on the mass market.  We feel that we're the company that  makes cosmetic upgrades a part of the average person's life.Implant beta-test subject, actress  and model Eirika Anderssen, stated that her career is 133% faster since  receiving 'Pointium-II' implants at the beginning of the year.  'Intel  Inside stacks up against the best of the others,' she said.Industry experts agree that the  Intel move will turn plenty of heads, but believe the market for the new  Intel products will be soft through 3rd quarter as women wait for faster,  second generation models that feature  new 'plug and play' capabilities.Upon announcements of these results,  Intel Corporation (NYSE symbol `INTL') stock rose, but sagged mid-day on rumors of lumpy breasts in some subjects due to rounding errors  and possible memory leaks in the new implants. By the end of the day,  the stock perked up 2 points at closing when the rumors proved to be falsies.</p>

40127,"<p>If you want to pull a prank on someone without causing permanent damage, but looking as if you have... </p>
<p>Get a 250 liter (55 gallon or so) garbage can, or something pretty large. Put it in an appropriate place. Fill it up with water. Drop in a block of Dry Ice (about 25 Kilos or 50 pounds), or as much as you can muster up if you can't get a full block. In the US, a block of Dry Ice is pretty inexpensive. </p>
<p>It will start bubbling furiously. Now, if you are in the US, pour in a bottle of Dove dishwashing soap, if elsewhere, washing up liquid, the sudsiest possible! It amazing how many bubbles can be produced by a single bottle of dishwashing liquid!!! (If you are really in an obnoxious mood, use 4 or 5 bottles of that bubble blowing soap - they last longer!) </p>
<p>We did a great prank on a friend once. He was an Elvis Impersonator, and often did performances, and always drove a restored classic car, painted pink, which was his pride-and-joy Elvis-mobile. We set up a plank on step ladders over his car, placed a low, flat, wide water container on it, filled it up, poured on the soap, dry ice and *pink* food coloring on his lawn about 5AM. (we had to be very quiet about this!) </p>
<p>About 45 minutes later, a lady called him up anonymously, telling him that he car was being eaten by aliens (We told her to say a h-u-g-e Blanc Mange, but unfortunately, she couldn't without cracking up into laughter, so she used aliens.) Of course he thought it was a prank call, but when he looked out the window, all he saw was a H-U-G-E pink pile of bubbles swallowing up his car! He nearly had a heart attack! ;-) </p>
<p>For the *mean spirited*, this works very will in a house. It will fill up a room with bubbles! Caution as it will damage things that are prone to water damage. Its nearly as good a trick as filling a house with popcorn, which takes a lot of effort! Some fellows supposedly went out a dorm window onto a narrow ledge and into an adjacent room. There they hung the bed frame out the window by a rope, tied the other end to the door knob, removed the hinge pins, and exited as they had entered. </p>
<p>Even without the pins, the hinges held the door in place till the occupant of the room returned, inserted his key, turned the handle, and watched his door fly across his room and out the double window, taking the window frame with it. The perpetrators said the look on his face was worth the cost of the repairs.</p>

<p>And sinks the putt. </p>
<p>Two holes later he mumbles to himself: ""Boy, if I could only get an eagle on<br /> this hole."" </p>

40131,"<p>One summer, on a Friday afternoon, a young man was being trained by his supervisor on his first day as a salesperson at a large department store. His supervisor was trying to show him the amount of things he could sell to customers by making them feel they needed the items. ""Watch this,"" he said and approached a man who has just entered the store. ""May I help you, sir?"" The man replied, ""I just moved into my first house and I need some fertiliser for my lawn.""So the supervisor said, ""Well, we have five- and ten-pound bags of fertiliser. I recommend you go with the ten pound bag.""""Why is that?""""The ten-pound bag will get you through most of the summer, but the five-pound bag won't,"" the supervisor answered.""Fine,"" the man agreed, ""I'll take the ten-pounder."" ""Very good sir. And would you like the stiff rake or the spring-rake with that?""""Rake? What do I need that for?""""Well sir,"" said the supervisor authoritatively, ""if you don't rake up the old dead grass before you spread the fertiliser, it won't all reach the soil.""""All right then. I'll get the stiff rake.""""Very good sir. And would you like the fixed sprinkler or the oscillating sprinkler with that?""The man started to get a bit steamed and asked harshly, ""Sprinkler? Look, I just came in here for some fertiliser. What do I need a sprinkler for?"" Calmly, the supervisor responded, ""Well sir, if you water your lawn immediately after fertilising, the fertiliser will sink into the soil more quickly and in no time at all, you'll have the greenest lawn in your neighbourhood.""This sounded pretty good to the man so he picked up the fixed sprinkler. ""OK, then. I'll take all this.""""Very good sir. And would you like the electric or gas mower with that,"" asked the supervisor.Now the customer had about had it and he all but blew up at the supervisor. ""LAWNMOWER? Look, all I wanted when I came here was a bag of fertiliser. You've already managed to sell me a rake and a sprinkler besides. Give me one good reason why I should get a lawnmower, too!""Calm as ever, the supervisor said, ""Well sir, if you get a lawnmower now, then you'll be all ready to start trimming your beautiful green grass the minute it starts getting too long. Your lawn will look like a golf course and you'll be the envy of all your neighbours! Besides, they are on sale this week only, and you're going to need it either way.""Well, the man figured that sounded OK and he really wanted to get out of there before he bought anything else so at last he relented. ""Fine. I'll get the electric mower, but that's it!""""Very good sir. I'll ring that up for you.""After the man had left the store with all his new purchases, the supervisor turned to the trainee and said, ""So, do you think you could do that?"" The trainee said that he thought he could and the supervisor directed him towards another customer.The trainee approached the puzzled-looking man and asked, ""May I help you sir?""The man replied, ""Yes. I need some tampons for my wife."" Well, the trainee is totally thrown off by this request. He can't imagine what he could offer the man to go along with that. However, he wanted to impress his boss so he thought hard. Suddenly, he had it! ""Very good sir. And would you like the electric or gas mower with that?""""Mower? What the hell is wrong with you? I came in here looking for tampons. Why the hell should I get a lawnmower, too?""""Well sir,"" the trainee answered, ""I figure your weekend is shot, so you might as well cut the grass.""</p>

"
40146,"<p>It is truly astonishing what happens in Bible stories when they are retold by young scholars around the world...</p>
<p>In the first book of the Bible, Guinessis, God got tired of creating the world, so He took the Sabbath off. Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. Noah's wife was called Joan of Ark. Noah built an ark, which the animals came on to in pears. Lot's wife was a pillar of salt by day, but a ball of fire by night.</p>
<p>The Jews were a proud people and throughout history they had trouble with the unsympathetic Genitals. Samson was a strongman who let himself be led astray by a Jezebel like Delilah. Samson slayed the Philistines with the axe of the apostles.</p>
<p>Moses led the Hebrews to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is bread made without any ingredients. The Egyptians were all drowned in the dessert. Afterwards, Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the Ten Amendments. The First Commandment was when Eve told Adam to eat the apple. The Fifth Commandment is to humor thy father and mother. The seventh Commandment is thou shalt not admit adultery.</p>
<p>Moses died before he ever reached Canada. Then Joshua led the Hebrews in the battle of Geritol. The greatest miracle in the Bible is when Joshua told his son to stand still and he obeyed him.</p>
<p>David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar. He fought with the Finklesteins, a race of people who lived in Biblical times. Solomon, one of David's sons, had 300 wives and 700 porcupines.</p>
<p>When Mary heard that she was the mother of Jesus, she sang the Magna Carta. When the three wise guys from the east side arrived, they found Jesus in the manager. Jesus was born because Mary had an immaculate contraption. St. John, the Blacksmith, dumped water on his head.</p>
<p>Jesus enunciated the Golden Rule, which says to do one to others before they do one to you. He also explained, ""Man doth not live by sweat alone."" It was a miracle when Jesus rose from the dead and managed to get the tomb stone off the entrance.</p>
<p>The people who followed the Lord were called the 13 decibels. The epistles were the wives of the apostles. One of the opossums was St. Matthew who was by profession, a taximan. St. Paul cavorted to Christianity. He preached holy acrimony, which is another name for marriage. A Christian should have only one wife. This is called monotony.</p>
<p>This one happened on an exam: One of the students identified the rainbow as the arc of the covenant.</p>
<p>Also a true story: The teacher asked her class to draw a picture of the Holy Family and one child drew a rather large figure as part of his threesome, explaining that they were Round John Virgin, mother and child.</p>
<p>The Sunday school teacher was describing how Lot's wife looked back and suddenly turned into a pillar of salt. ""My mother looked back while she was driving,"" contributed little Johnny, ""and she turned into a telephone pole.""</p>

40148,"<p>A woman has a dog who snores in his sleep and keeps her and her husband awake at night. She goes to the vet to see if he can help. The vet tells the woman to tie a ribbon around the dog's testicles and he will stop snoring. Of course the woman is very sceptical in believing this and goes home. A few hours after going to bed the dog is snoring as usual. Finally getting very frustrated, she goes to closet and grabs a piece of ribbon, ties it around the dogs testicles, and sure enough the dog stops snoring. The woman is amazed.Later that night her husband returns from being out with his friends and he is very drunk. He climbs into bed, falls asleep, and begins snoring very loudly. The woman is desperate and thinks maybe the ribbon will work on him. She goes to the closet again, grabs a piece of ribbon, and ties it around her husbands testicles. Amazingly it also works on him. The woman falls asleep again and sleeps very soundly.The next morning the husband wakes up very hung over. He stumbles into the bathroom to urinate. As he is standing in front of the toilet, he looks in the mirror and sees a blue ribbon attached to his scrotum. He is very confused. He walks back into the bedroom and sees a red ribbon attached to his dogs scrotum. He looks at the dog and says ""Boy, I don't remember what the hell happened last night, but where ever you and I went, we got first and second place.""</p>

George opened it and Bambi walked in, swirling her hips provocatively.George asked, ""How much do you charge?""""$125 basic rate, $100 tips for special services.""Even George was taken aback. ""$125! I was thinking more in the range of $25.""Bambi laughed derisively. ""You must really be a hick if you think you can buy sex for that price.""""Well,"" said George, ""I guess we can't do business. Goodbye.""After she left, Harriet came out of the bathroom. She said, ""I just can't believe it!""George said, ""Let's forget it.

40155,"<p>A very large mathematical convention was held in Las Vegas.  The conventioneers filled two hotels, each with an infinite number of rooms.  The hotels were across the street from each other and were owned by brothers.  One evening, while everyone was out at a bar-b-que, one of the hotels burned to the ground.  The brothers got together and worked out a plan.  In the remaining hotel, they moved all guests to twice their room number -- room 101 moved to 202, room 1234 moved to room 2468, etc.  Then all the odd number rooms were empty, and there were an infinite number of odd rooms.  So the guests from the other hotel moved into them.</p>

Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard, ""Jesus is watching you.""Freaked out, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot.  ""Did you say that?"" he hissed at the parrot. ""Yep,"" the parrot confessed, then squawked, ""I'm just trying to warn you.""The burglar relaxed. ""Warn me, huh? Who the heck are you?""""Moses,"" replied the bird.""Moses?"" the burglar laughed.

<p>They also advise the carrying of pepper spray in case of an  encounter with<br /> an alligator.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to watch for fresh signs of alligator  activity.</p>
<p>People should recognize the difference between small young  alligator and<br /> large adult alligator droppings.</p>
<p>Young alligator droppings are smaller and contain fish bones  and possibly<br /> bird feathers.</p>
<p>Adult alligators droppings have little bells in them and  smell like pepper<br /> spray.</p>

40168,"<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) announced last week that they were going to start using lawyers instead of rats in their experiments. Naturally, the American Bar Association was outraged and filed suit. Yet, the NIH presented some very good reasons for the switch.1. The lab assistants were becoming very attached to their little rats. This emotional involvement was interfering with the research being conducted. No such attachment could form for a lawyer.2. Lawyers breed faster and are in much greater supply.3. Lawyers are much cheaper to care for and the humanitarian societies won't jump all over you no matter what you're studying.4. There are some things even a rat won't do.</p>

<p>She went to the playground, grabbed a kid, took him behind a<br /> tree, and told him, ""I've kidnapped you.""</p>
<p>She then wrote a note saying, ""I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow<br /> morning, put $10,000 in a paper bag and put it under the pecan<br /> tree next to the slide on the north side of the playground.<br /> Signed, a blonde.""</p>
<p>The blonde then pinned the note to the kid's shirt and sent him<br /> home to show it to his parents. The next morning the blonde<br /> checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting beneath the<br /> pecan tree. The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with<br /> a note that said, ""How could you do this to a fellow blonde?""</p>

Hoping they<br /> could do something to stop this, the neighbors got together and went over<br /> to talk to Ole.

40201,"<p>There was a retarded duck farmer who had 2 sons, but only enough money to send one to college.  So he came up with a fair way to choose who was to get the money.  He called both of his sons into a room and gave them each a retarded duck and instructed them to go into the city.  The one who made the most off the duck would win the money for college.</p>
<p>Well the first child, being the good child he was, scurried off to sell his duck. As he was walking, he saw a lady mowing her lawn.  She jumped up from the mower and screamed, ""IS THAT A RETARDED DUCK?!?"" It sure is he replyed, and its for sale too!  She said that she collected retarded ducks and would gladly pay him $10 for that duck, he agreed.</p>
<p>Well the other son being the ""bad"" kid went strait for the whore house. When he got there, a lady started hittin on him.  He said he'd love to fuck her but he doesnt have any money, just this retarded duck. She thought about it for awhile and said, well I always did want a pet. So they go in the back and have ""mad passionate animal sex."" When they were done, the lady said she didn't want the duck anymore. He said he would gladly take the duck back if he could fuck her again, so they went at it again. The guy was pretty happy by now so he runs on home, he ran so fast that the duck got away from him and ran out in front of a car and got hit.  The duck was clearly dead, so the lady being in the hurry that she was, gave the young man $25 compensation for the dead duck, then she sped off in her car.</p>
<p>When the two finally got home, the father once again called them into a room and said, ""How much did you make,"" looking at his ""good"" son. The ""good"" son said $10, with a modest look on his face.</p>

40214,"<p>An Act of Charity<br /> One Sunday a pastor asked his congregation to consider giving a little<br /> extra in the offering plate. He said that whoever gave the most would be<br /> able to pick out three hymns. After the offering plates were passed, the<br /> pastor glanced down and noticed that someone had contributed a $1,000<br /> bill. He was so excited that he immediately shared his joy with his<br /> congregation, and said he'd like to personally thank the person who had<br /> placed the money in the plate. A very quiet, elderly, saintly widow shyly<br /> raised her hand. The pastor asked her to come to the front. Slowly she<br /> made her way to the pastor. He told her how wonderful it was that she gave<br /> so much and asked her to pick out three hymns. Her eyes brightened as she<br /> looked over the congregation, pointed to the three handsomest men in the<br /> building and said, ""I'll take him and him and him.""""</p>

40221,"<p>One evening, after attending the theater, two gentlemen were<br /> walking down the avenue when they observed a rather well dressed<br /> and attractive young lady walking ahead of them.</p>
<p>One of them turned to the other and remarked, ""I'd give $250.00<br /> to spend the night with that woman."" Much to their surprise, the<br /> young lady overheard the remark, turned around, and replied,<br /> ""I'll take you up on that offer."" She had a neat appearance and<br /> a pleasant voice, so after bidding his companion good night, the<br /> man accompanied the young lady to her apartment.</p>
<p>The following morning, the man presented her with $125.00 as he<br /> prepared to leave. She demanded the rest of the money stating,<br /> ""If you don't give me the other $125.00, I'll sue you for it.""<br /> He laughed saying, ""I'd like to see you get it on these grounds.""</p>
<p>The next day, he was surprised when he received a summons<br /> ordering his presence in court as a defendant in a lawsuit. He<br /> hurried to his lawyer and explained the details of the case. His<br /> lawyer said, ""She can't possibly get a judgment against you on<br /> such grounds, but it will be interesting to see how her case<br /> will be presented.""</p>
<p>After the usual preliminaries, the lady's lawyer addressed the<br /> court as follows: ""Your honor, my client, this lady, is the<br /> owner of a piece of property--a garden spot--surrounded by a<br /> profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she agreed to rent<br /> to the defendant for a specified length of time for the sum of<br /> $250.00. The defendant took possession of the property, used it<br /> extensively for the purposes for which it was rented, but upon<br /> evacuating the premises, he paid only $125.00, one-half of the<br /> amount agreed upon. The rent was not excessive, since it is<br /> restricted property, and we ask judgment be granted against the<br /> defendant to assure payment of the balance.""</p>
<p>The defendant's lawyer was impressed and amused by the way his<br /> opponent had presented the case. His defense, therefore, was<br /> somewhat different from the way he originally planned to present<br /> it. ""Your honor,"" he said, ""My client agrees that the lady has a<br /> fine piece of property, that he did rent such property for a<br /> time, and a degree of pleasure was derived from the transaction.<br /> However, my client found a well on the property around which he<br /> placed his own stones, sunk a shaft, and erected a pump, all<br /> labor performed personally by him. We claim these improvements<br /> to the property were sufficient to offset the unpaid amount, and<br /> that the plaintiff was adequately compensated for the rental of<br /> said property. We, therefore, ask that judgment not be granted.""</p>
<p>The young lady's lawyer answered thus: ""Your honor, my client<br /> agrees that the defendant did find a well on her property.<br /> However, had defendant not known that the well existed, he would<br /> never have rented the property. Also, upon evacuating the<br /> premises, the defendant removed the stones, pulled out the<br /> shaft, and took the pump with him. In doing so, he not only<br /> dragged the equipment through the shrubbery, but left the hole<br /> much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, making the<br /> property much less desirable to others. We, therefore, ask that<br /> judgment be granted.""</p>
<p>In the Judge's decision, he provided for two options: ""Pay the<br /> 125.00 or have the equipment detached and provided to the<br /> plaintiff for damages."" The defendant wrote a check immediately.</p>

40223,"<p>Penny was a hard working, conscientious girl, who lived on her own. Her dream in life was to go on an ocean cruise around the world. So she scrimped, and she saved, and she saved, and she scrimped until finally, one day, she had enough money to go on her ocean cruise. She booked passage on a cruise liner - first class all the way... The cruise started off in a grandiose scale, dancing and parties every night. But Penny was a cautious girl, so she never drank, but just danced the night away.One night, after they had been at sea for a week, Penny was walking back to her cabin, when the heel on her left shoe broke throwing her off balance. If that wasn't enough, the ship chose that moment to tilt to the left. As a result, Penny was thrown overboard. A hue and a cry were immediately raised, and after about five minutes they found Penny. Hauling her aboard, the ship's crew realized that it was too late, poor Penny was dead.Normally, they would have done a burial at sea, but as I said before, Penny was a very conscientious girl, and had written a will. In it, she specified that she wished for her body to be cremated, and kept in a jar on her parent's fireplace mantel. Her wishes were fulfilled, which just goes to show you that a Penny saved is a Penny urned.</p>

""It's too high, and I'd like to have you lower it if you can.""""Lower it?!"" exclaimed the doctor, still unable to believe what the ninety-year old gentleman was saying. ""Just what do you consider 'high'?""""These days it seems like it's all in my head, Doc,"" said the old man, ""and I'd like to have you lower it a couple of feet if you can.""</p>

40238,"<p>These are true stories from someone who works on a cruise ship. 1. (For this one, you have to know that it's really easy to get lost in the maze of corridors and elevators on a ship.) A lady asked if this elevator went to the front of the ship.2. Two elderly women were staring at the numbers of the floors listed above the elevator door. When asked if they needed any assistance with something, one asked how they were going to be able to reach way up there to push the button for their floor.3. A newlywed couple, after bringing their luggage into their cabin, stormed down to the desk. The bride was in tears, and the groom was red faced. When asked what the problem was, the groom started swearing at the desk clerk. ""We booked a cabin with a view for our honeymoon, and all we get to see out the window is a parking lot!""4. There was some mix-up with a woman's room. The clerk (or whatever they are called on ships) was trying to remedy the situation. He asked, ""Would you like an inside cabin or an outside cabin?"" She replied, ""Well, it looks like it might rain today. I'd better get an inside cabin.""5. Two women were sitting by the pool, and one asked what kind of water they fill the pool with -- fresh water or sea water? The cruise director answered, ""Sea water."" ""Oh, that explains why it's so rough today.""6. Someone -- always a man -- always asks, ""Does the ship run on generators?"" The Cruise Director usually tells them, ""No, we just have a very long power line running to the mainland.""7. ""What do you do with the ice sculptures after they melt?""</p>

40294,"<p>According to a news report, a certain private school in Victoria,<br /> BC recently was faced with a unique problem.</p>
<p>A number of grade 12 girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom. That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints.</p>
<p>Every night, the maintenance man would remove them and the next day, the girls would put them back.</p>
<p>Finally the principal decided that something had to be done.<br /> She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance man. She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required.</p>
<p>He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the mirror with it.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirror.</p>

40313,"<p>Having detailed the concept of attitude control, there is another method,<br /> which you may prefer. For reasons that will become apparent, it is recommended<br /> for those pilots whose airplanes have large, easily cleaned cabins. Known as the<br /> ""Cat and Duck Method"" of instrument flight, it has received much publicity and<br /> is considered to have a great deal of merit by those who have not tried it. No<br /> reports have been received from those who did try it, and none are expected.<br /> Pilots are invited to assess its merits objectively.</p>
<p>Basic rules for the C&amp;D Method of instrument flight are fairly well known and<br /> are extremely simple. Here's how it's done:</p>
<p>1. Place a live cat on the cockpit floor; because a cat always remains<br /> upright. It can be used in lieu of a needle and ball. Merely watch to see which<br /> way the cat leans to determine if a wing is low and if so, which one.</p>
<p>2. The duck is used for instrument approach and landing. Because of the fact<br /> that any sensible duck will refuse to fly under instrument conditions, it is<br /> only necessary to hurl your duck out of the plane and follow it to the ground.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the Cat and Duck Method, but by rigidly adhering<br /> to the following checklist, a degree of success will be achieved which will<br /> surely startle you, your passengers, and even an occasional tower operator.</p>
<p>1. Get a wide-awake cat. Most cats do not want to stand up at all. It may be<br /> necessary to carry a large dog in the cockpit to keep the cat at attention.</p>
<p>2. Make sure your cat is clean. Dirty cats will spend all their time washing.<br /> Trying to follow a washing cat usually results in a tight snap roll followed by<br /> an inverted spin.</p>
<p>3. Use old cats only. Young cats have nine lives, but old, used-up cats with<br /> only one life left have just as much to lose as you do and will be more<br /> dependable.</p>
<p>4. Beware of cowardly ducks. If the duck discovers that you are<br /> using the cat to stay upright, it will refuse to leave without the cat. Ducks<br /> are no better in IFR conditions than you are.</p>
<p>5. Be sure the duck has good eyesight. Nearsighted ducks sometimes fail to<br /> realize that they are on the gauges and go flogging off in the nearest hill.<br /> Very nearsighted ducks will not realize that they have been thrown out and will<br /> descend to the ground in a sitting position. This maneuver is difficult to<br /> follow in an airplane.</p>
<p>6. Use land-loving ducks. It is very discouraging to break out and find<br /> yourself on final for a rice paddy, particularly if there are duck hunters<br /> around. Duck hunters suffer from temporary insanity while sitting in freezing<br /> weather in the blinds and will shoot at anything that flies.</p>
<p>7. Choose your duck carefully. It is easy to confuse ducks with geese because<br /> many water birds look alike. While they are very competent instrument flyers,<br /> geese seldom want to go in the same direction as you.</p>

40400,"<p>One day at the end of class, little Johnny's teacher asks the class to go home and think of a story that ends with a moral, so there's a lesson to be learned. The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story. Little Suzy raises her hand. My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road. When the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, ""Don't keep all your eggs in one basket."" Little Lucy went next. My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched. Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story. Lucy replied, ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch."" Next up was little Johnny. My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands. The teacher was completely shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story. Well, Johnny replied, ""Don't fight with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking!""</p>

So he gets his speed up to 100 miles per hour, and the chicken veers off to the right. The guy screeches to a halt, backs up, and then follows the chicken down a small country road. After quite some time, the guy comes across a small farm. He sees a farmer working in the fields. He gets out of his car and walks over to the farmer and says ""Is that your chicken?""""You bet that's my chicken,"" replies the farmer.""How does it go so fast?"" asks the guy.""Why, it's got three legs, that's why.""The guy looks at the farmer strangely. ""Why does it have three legs?""""Well, I like a chicken leg, my wife likes a chicken leg, and my son likes a chicken leg,"" replies the farmer very sensibly.""Err...Well, how do they taste?"" asks the guy.""Well, I dunno, I haven't caught one yet.""  --Editor's note:  Okay, it's way funnier after you've had a few pints...</p>

40409,"<p>One day a preist was out on the lake fishing, when he saw a man not to<br /> far away reeling in a fish.  He then started his boat and drove over to<br /> the man.  The man reels this fish out of the water and exclaimes ""now<br /> would you take a look at that sombitch"".</p>
<p> The preist, quite shocked says ""you can't say that around me, I am a<br /> man of the cloth.  The fisherman says ""no you don't understand, that is<br /> the name of the fish"".  So the preist appologizes for his mistake, and<br /> this man then tells him to take the fish home, no hard feelings.</p>
<p> This preist thinks this is a rather unusual fish, so he takes it to the<br /> bishop, and tells him, take a look at this fish.  The father is quite<br /> impressed with the size of the fish, but then the preist adds ""thats a<br /> big sombitch father"".  The bishop utterly in a panic tells the preist<br /> not to say that in the house of god, or he will surely be struck down.<br /> ""No, no, you don't understand, that is the name of the fish"".  He then<br /> appologizes likewise, and they both decide to take this to the pope.</p>
<p> So these two men take the fish to the pope, and the pope replies ""That<br /> is a very nice looking fish gentleman"".  The bishop pipes up and says,<br /> yes, a very nice looking sombitch isn't it"".  The priest then replies<br /> with a similar remark.  The pope in a raging fury tells the men that<br /> they have both just been excommunicated for their blatend sinning in the<br /> house of God.  The two men proceed to tell the pope that ""sombitch"" is<br /> the name of the fish.  After appologizing, the pope agrees to take the<br /> fish to the heavenly mother and have her cook it up for supper.</p>
<p> That evening at dinner, a new priest to the convent is sitting down to<br /> dinner with these three men.  First the elder preist says ""this is a<br /> good sombitch"", then the bishop says ""yes, I wish I could go out and<br /> catch me some more of these sombitches"" and finally the pope says ""would<br /> you please pass me some more of that sombitch"".  The new guy looks at<br /> the three and laughs.  He then extorts ""By God, you mother-f**kers are<br /> alright.""</p>

40427,"<p>About a century or two ago, the Pope decided that all the Jews had to leave<br /> Rome. Naturally there was a big uproar from the Jewish community. So the Pope<br /> made a deal. He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish<br /> community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would<br /> leave.<br /> The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked a middle aged man<br /> named Moishe to represent them. Moishe asked for one addition to the debate. To<br /> make it more interesting, neither side would be allowed to talk. The Pope<br /> agreed.<br /> The day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other<br /> for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.<br /> Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a<br /> circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope<br /> pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope<br /> stood up and said, �I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay.""<br /> An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what had<br /> happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the<br /> Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still<br /> one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show<br /> him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and<br /> showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to<br /> show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of<br /> original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?""<br /> Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. �What happened?""<br /> they asked. �Well,"" said Moishe, �First he said to me that the Jews had three<br /> days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told<br /> me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were<br /> staying right here.""<br /> �Yes, yes, and then???"" asked the crowd.<br /> �I don't know,"" said Moishe, "" He took out his lunch, and I took out mine.""</p>

40428,"<p>Erich Honnecker (the president of East Germany) was invited to Moscow by<br /> Gorbachev for a visit. After weeks of preparation by Gorby, Honnecker arrives in<br /> Moscow. As part of the celebration activities, there is a big parade through the<br /> streets of Moscow. While the two are watching the parade, Gorbachev takes a<br /> small boy aside and asks him, ""Who is your mother?"" The child replies, ""Mother<br /> Russia."" ""And who is your father?"", asks Gorbachev. The boy answers, ""Why, its<br /> you Uncle Gorbachev!"". Finally Gorbachev asks the boy, ""and what do you want to<br /> be when you grow up?"". The boy proudly replies, ""a good communist!"". </p>
<p>Erich Honnecker, meanwhile, has been watching this and is very impressed. So<br /> impressed, that he decides to invite Gorbachev to [East] Berlin for a visit.<br /> Again, after weeks of preparation, Gorbachev's plane lands in Berlin. And again,<br /> part of the celebration includes a parade. Remembering what Gorbachev did in<br /> Moscow, Honnecker repeats the scene: He asks a little boy in the crowd, ""Who is<br /> your mother?"" The child replies ""the GDR [German Democratic Republic - East<br /> Germany]."" ""And who is your father?"", asks Honnecker. ""Why, its you Uncle<br /> Honnecker!"", replies the child. ""And what do you want to be when you grow up?""<br /> queries Honnecker. Without hesitation, the boy replies ""an orphan.""</p>

40442,"<p>A businessman was in Japan to make a presentation to the Toyota motor people. Needless to say, this was an especially important deal, and it was imperative that he make the best possible impression. On the morning of the presentation he awoke to find himself passing gas, in large volumes, with the unpleasant characteristic of sounding like ""HONDA."" The man was besides himself. Every few minutes ""HONDA"", ""HONDA"".... Unable to stop this aberrant behavior, and in desperate need to terminate these odious and rather embarrassing emissions, he sought a physicians aid. After a full examination, the doctor told him that there was nothing inherently wrong with him and that he would just have to wait it out. Being unwilling to accept this state of affairs he visited a second and then a third doctor all of whom told him the same thing. Finally one medic suggested that he visit a dentist. Well although he could not see how a dentist was going to be of any help, he visited one anyway. Lo and behold, the dentist said, ""Ah, there's the problem"" ""What is it?"" the man asked.""Why you have an abscess,"" said the dentist.""An abscess. How could that be causing my problem?"" asked the man.""That's easy,"" replied the dentist.""Why everyone knows... Abscess makes the fart go Honda.""</p>

40444,"<p>Now that ski season is almost here, it's time to brush up on those important skiing definitions:  Alp: One of a number of ski mountains in Europe. Also a shouted request for assistance made by a European.Avalanche: One of the few actual perils skiers face that needlessly frighten timid individuals away from the sport.  See also: Blizzard, First Aid, Fracture, Frostbite, Hypothermia, Lift Collapse.Bindings: Automatic mechanisms that protect skiers from serious injury during a fall by releasing skis from boots, sending the skis skittering across the slope where they trip two other skiers.Bones: There are 206 in the human body.  No need for dismay, however; the two bones of the middle ear have never been broken while skiing.Cross-Country Skiing: Traditional Scandinavian all-terrain technique.  It's good exercise, doesn't require purchase of costly lift tickets.  It has no crowds or lines.  See also Cross-Country Something-Or-Other.Cross-Country Something-or-Other: Touring on skis along trails in scenic wilderness, gliding through snow-hushed woods far from the hubbub of the ski slopes, hearing nothing but the whispery hiss of the skis slipping through snow and the muffled screams of other skiers dropping into the puffy powder of a deep, wind-sculpted drift.Exercises: A few simple warm-ups to make sure you're prepared for the slopes: 1) Tie a cinder block to each foot and climb a flight of stairs.  2) Sit on the outside of a fourth-story window ledge with your skis on and your poles in your lap for at least 30 minutes.         3) Bind your legs together at the ankles, lie flat on the      floor;  then, holding a banana in each hand, get to your feet.Gloves: Designed to be tight around the wrist to restrict circulation, but not so closefitting as to allow any manual dexterity; they should also admit moisture from the outside without permitting any dampness within to escape.Gravity: One of four fundamental forces in nature that affect skiers. The other three are the strong force, which makes bindings jam; the weak force, which makes ankles give way on turns; and electromagnetism, which produces dead batteries in expensive ski-resort parking lots.  See Inertia.Inertia: Tendency of a skier's body to resist changes in direction or speed due to the action of Newton's First Law of Motion.  Goes along with these other physical laws: 1) Two objects of different mass falling side by side will have the same rate of descent, but the lighter one will have larger hospital and home care bills. 2) Matter can neither be created nor destroyed, but if it drops out of a parka pocket, don't expect to encounter it again in our universe. 3) When an irresistible force meets an immovable object (see 'Tree')Prejump: Maneuver in which an expert skier makes a controlled jump just ahead of a bump.  Beginners can execute a controlled pre-fall just before losing their balance and, if they wish, may precede it with either a pre-scream and a few pre-groans or simple profanity.Shin: The bruised area on the front of the leg that runs from the point where the ache from the wrenched knee ends to where the soreness from the strained ankle begins.Ski!: A shout to alert people ahead that a loose ski is coming down the hill.  Another warning skiers should be familiar with is 'Avalanche!' (which tells everyone that a hill is coming down the hill).Skier: One who pays an arm and a leg for the opportunity to break them. Stance: Your knees should be flexed, but shaking slightly; your arms straight and covered with a good layer of goose flesh; your hands forward, palms clammy, knuckles white and fingers icy, your eyes a little crossed and darting in all directions.  Your lips should be quivering, and you should be mumbling, 'Am I nuts or what?'Thor: The Scandinavian god of acheth and painth. Traverse: To ski across a slope at an angle; one of two quick and simple methods of reducing speed.Tree: The other method.</p>

So, here they were, naked as jay birds,<br /> when the guy suddenly says: ""I need a cigarette.""<br /> ""But honey,"" his lover says. ""The store closes in two minutes. You'll never<br /> have time to get to the store, and get dressed."" </p>
<p>""That's okay,"" He quipps. ""I'll just run down there naked, and if anyone sees<br /> me, I'll pretend I'm a statue."" </p>
<p>So the young man ran down to the store, got two packs of cigaretts (this store<br /> was obviously in a heavy nudist area or something), and starts to run back. The<br /> car is in sight, and he has a few more yards to go, when all of the sudden three<br /> nuns round the corner. He panics, and freezes like a statue, his beloved<br /> cigarettes in one hand. </p>
<p>The first nun walks over to the young man. ""Oh! What a beautiful cigarette<br /> dispenser!"" She exclaimed. She sticks a quarter up his ass, pulls on his dong,<br /> and he drops a pack of cigarettes in utter disbelief. </p>
<p>The second nun strolls over. ""What an interesting cigarette dispenser! I must<br /> try it, too."" She sticks a quarter up the young man's ass, chokes his chicken,<br /> and he drops the other pack of cigarettes. </p>
<p>The third nun was the unimpressed sort. She strode up, stuck a quarter up the<br /> young man's ass, and yanked his monkey. Nothing happened. She pulled on his<br /> Element of Adam again. Nothing happened. She tried a third time, and her eyes<br /> widened with sudden realization and suprise. ""Oh, I get it! A lotion dispenser!""</p>

<p>Incredibly drunk and walking home they need to pee. They were very<br /> near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business<br /> behind a headstone or something. </p>
<p>The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties,<br /> and used them and threw them away. Her friend however was wearing an<br /> expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky<br /> enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and<br /> proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made there<br /> way home. </p>
<p>The next day the first woman's husband phones the other husband and<br /> said, ""These damn girls night out have got to stop. My wife came home<br /> last night without her panties."" </p>
<p>""That's nothing,"" said the other. ""Mine came back with a card stuck<br /> between the cheeks of her butt that said, `From all of us at the Fire<br /> Station. We'll never forget you.'""</p>

What's causing all this delay?''

So I've taken up a collection to try to end the traffic jam.'' ''How much have you gotten so far.'' ''About ten gallons.''</p>

40487,"<p>A king with a 20 year old daughter lived in the biggest castle in his land. It was about time for her to marry. Every before she went to bed, she would put green glitter down on her vagina.     Every couple of weeks he would call in 3 men from town and told them    ""Go in and have sex with my daughter. If you come out with green glitter on your dick, you will get thrown to the lions. If you come out clean, you will marry her.""     Many had tried and many had failed.      This week, he called in 3 men. When each went in, gaurds would watch to make sure they really had sex.      The first one went in and was in there for 1/2 and hour. When he came out, he was thrown to the lions. The second one went in and was in there for about 2 1/2 hours. He comes out and he also gets thrown to the lions. The third goes in with a big grin on his face. The king sat on his throne and waited about 4 hours before the man finally comes out. Suprisingly, he has no glitter on his dick.      They get married later that afternoon. It was a big ceremony with everyone there.      That night was the honeymoon. As they were about to have sex, he said to his new bride, "" i need to go brush my teeth."" When he got to the bathroom, he opened the cabinet door to get his toothbrush.

40499,"<p>A small town prosecuting barrister called his first witness to the stand in a trial - a attractive middle aged lady. He approached her and asked, ""Ms. Jones, do you know me?""  She responded, ""I do know you Mr. Leigh. I've known you since you were a young boy. And frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a rising big shot when you haven't the brains to realise you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you."" The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do he pointed across the room and asked, ""Mrs. Williams, do you know the defence attorney?""  She again replied, ""Why, yes I do. I've known Mr. Knowles since he was a youngster, too. I used to baby-sit him for his parents. And he, too, has been a real disappointment to me. He's lazy, bigoted, he has a drinking problem. The man can't build a normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the shoddiest in the entire state. Yes, I know him."" At this point, the judge rapped the courtroom to silence and called both barristers to the bench. In a very quiet voice, he said with menace, ""If either of you asks her if she knows me, you'll be jailed for contempt!""</p>

40512,"<p>Recently, a group of mathmaticians came to find a disturbing way<br /> to prove that lawyers are evil (like we didn't already know<br /> that).  It goes something like....</p>

<p>                      MONEY x TIME = LAWYERS</p>
<p>We all know that TIME is MONEY, so we can use substitution to<br /> find that...</p>
<p>                      MONEY x MONEY = LAWYERS</p>
<p>Now another thing that is said a lot is that MONEY is the root<br /> of all EVIL.  So therefore...<br />                                 ______<br />                       MONEY = / EVIL</p>
<p>Again we can use substitution to find that...<br />                      ______      ______<br />                    / EVIL  x / EVIL  = LAWYERS</p>
<p>Or, more simply...</p>
<p>                      EVIL = LAWYERS</p>
<p>We were right all along.</p>

<p>Tras revisar su nombre en el gran libro de admisiones, le informa que no est� registrado para ingresar al purgatorio y que debe irse al infierno.</p>
<p>""�Yo, Pepe Sierra en el infierno? Si siempre fui un buen padre, un buen marido, un buen hijo, �c�mo puede ser posible?""</p>
<p>""Bueno, hijo, puede haber alg�n error, t� sabes, s�lo el jefe es perfecto. �Por qu� no vas y averiguas?""</p>
<p>La entrada al infierno result� ser un lugar bastante c�lido. La decoraci�n de color rojiza, con m�sica ambiental y toda la cosa.</p>
<p>El diablo, al presentarse, le pregunta el objeto de su visita:</p>
<p>""Soy Pepe Sierra, estaba descansando en mi casa y de pronto aparec� en el cielo. Ah� me dijeron que no estaba registrado y me mandaron al purgatorio, donde tampoco estaba registrado, y aqu� estoy"".</p>
<p>""Bien, hijo, �c�mo dijiste que te llamas? A ver, s�, efectivamente, aqu� estas registrado. bueno, pasa"".</p>
<p>""�Yo, Pepe Sierra en el infierno? Si siempre fui un buen padre, un buen marido, un buen hijo... ya pues, don diablo, una manita"".</p>
<p>""Mira, hijo, a veces hay errores, y como no tengo antecedentes en contra tuya, voy a darte una oportunidad m�s: te voy a reencarnar"".</p>
<p>Al revisar un pergamino, comunica a Pepe Sierra que �nicamente quedan dos opciones para su reencarnaci�n: sapo o gallina.</p>
<p>""Mmm, en sapo, todo el d�a mojado, en el barro, comiendo moscas. No, eso no es para m�. A ver, en gallina, todo en d�a echado, descansando, comiendo ma�z, un mont�n de �atas alrededor... s�, quiero ser gallina"".</p>
<p>Sin objetar, y antes de que Pepe Sierra terminare de pensar (buen tipo este don diablo), se encontr� en un gallinero.</p>
<p>No pasaron ni dos minutos, cuando un gran gallo se aproxim� a Pepe Sierra para darle la bienvenida y explicarle sus obligaciones:</p>
<p>""Mira, Pepe Sierra, este es tu corral, no tienes otra obligaci�n que poner 10 huevos cada 24 horas, si no los pones: huuuu, haaaa, toma, toma, huuu (con gestos y todo), y eso dueeeele"".</p>
<p>""�Yo, Pepe Sierra, huuuu, haaaa, toma, toma, huuu, contigo? �Est�s loco, si yo soy todo un machote, 10 huevos no son nada para Pepe Sierra!""</p>
<p>Al d�a siguiente, cuando hab�an transcurrido 10 horas, Pepe Sierra despierta temprano y se da cuenta que ya hab�a puesto un huevo, y sin realizar esfuerzo alguno, lo que le lleva a despreocuparse al extremo.</p>
<p>A las doce en punto, con dos huevos ya en su haber, ve que el gallo se le acerca, lo levanta con una sola ala y revisa su logro:</p>
<p>""Bueno, Pepe Sierra, te quedan 10 horas; has puesto 3 huevos, te faltan 7 m�s, no los pones: huuuu, haaaa, toma, toma, huuu (con gestos y todo), y eso dueeeele"".</p>
<p>""�Yo, Pepe Sierra, huuuu, haaaa, toma, toma, huuu, contigo? �Est�s loco, si yo soy todo un machote, 7 huevos no son nada para Pepe Sierra!""</p>
<p>Pasaron 7 horas m�s, y Pepe Sierra, despu�s de haber dormido una siesta, se da cuenta que tan s�lo hab�a puesto 3 huevos m�s. Le pone empe�o y mucho esfuerzo y despu�s de una hora m�s, logro poner otro huevo. Le faltaban 3 y estaba exhausto.</p>
<p>Cuando hab�an pasado 23 horas, el gallo se acerca a Pepe Sierra lo levanta y verifica que nada m�s hab�a puesto 8 huevos, y le advierte:</p>
<p>""Bueno, Pepe Sierra, te queda 1 hora; has puesto 8 huevos, te faltan 2 m�s, no los pones: huuuu, haaaa, toma, toma, huuu (con gestos y todo), y eso dueeeele"".</p>
<p>""�Yo, Pepe Sierra, huuuu, haaaa, toma, toma, huuu, contigo? �Est�s loco, si yo soy todo un machote, 2 huevos no son nada para Pepe Sierra!""</p>
<p>Faltando 5 minutos para que se cumplieran las 24 horas, nos encontramos con un Pepe Sierra hecho pelotas, sudando y pujando. En eso ve una enorme sombra aproxim�ndose por debajo de la puerta. Pepe Sierra comienza a pujar con toda su alma y, como el mayor placer de su vida, siente como algo brota de entre sus entra�as: �s�, puso el noveno huevo!</p>
<p>�Pam!, ve al gallo abrir la puerta vestido de cuero negro, con un l�tigo en el ala derecha. Sadomasoquista el gallo.</p>
<p>Mientras el gallo se acerca, Pepe Sierra, hace el mayor esfuerzo de su vida: puja, puja, puja. Repentinamente, siente que algo brota, algo est� saliendo, le pone m�s empe�o, s�, s�, est� saliendo, lo siente calientito, siente que est� brotando, m�s fuerza, m�s fuerza, s�, s����, �s����! Y en ese incre�ble instante, una voz retumba en su cabeza y un empuj�n lo saca de su �xtasis:</p>
<p>""�Pepe, Pepe, despierta, te est�s cagando!""</p>

Exasperated, he took them to his private office, and showed them a porno<br /> movie. This was also useless.

40538,"<p>Here�s a tale from the oval office<br /> told without rancour or malice<br /> about intern acts<br /> and oral sex<br /> on the presidential phallus. </p>
<p>bill�s dick was out of its stable<br /> with monica willing and able<br /> to meet and greet<br /> that piece of meat<br /> beneath a white house table. </p>
<p>matters of state were delayed<br /> as he wanted a little quick head<br /> but after one slick lick<br /> on the end of his dick<br /> he came on her blue dress instead. </p>
<p>said monica ""this is really a pain<br /> for you�ve gone and left a big stain<br /> but no way will i wash it<br /> i�ll keep it and stash it<br /> for someday i may need it again."" </p>
<p>said bill ""i hope that no-one has seen us<br /> with you going down on my penis<br /> for no one must know<br /> that you gave me a blow<br /> so we�ll keep this thing strictly between us."" </p>
<p>but after making so messy a slip<br /> between bill�s dick and her lip<br /> monica felt a need to confess<br /> about the stain on her dress<br /> to the loathsome linda tripp. </p>
<p>to her cost poor monica found<br /> that linda was wired up for sound<br /> she had her tape running<br /> for the tale of bill�s cuming<br /> and that�s how the word got around. </p>
<p>then tripp told that fellow ken starr<br /> who wanted bill�s balls in a jar<br /> and he created a dinsky<br /> that made miss lewinsky<br /> hand that dress into the bar. </p>
<p>this guy starr will not rest<br /> and the feds are doing their best<br /> to see if that spot<br /> is bill�s cum or not<br /> by running a dna test. </p>
<p>poor bill feels a bit of a twit<br /> about all that lewinsky bit<br /> for by being immoral<br /> and indulging in oral<br /> he�s landed himself in the s***. </p>
<p>you�ll remember bill�s pot-smoking tale<br /> and this time he�ll surely not fail<br /> to say ejaculations<br /> aren�t sexual relations<br /> because monica didn�t inhale.</p>

<p>Before long, Mrs. Jones again winked off. However, this time the minister did not notice. </p>
<p>As he picked up the tempo of his sermon, he made a few motions that Mr. Jones mistook as signals to bayonet his wife with the hatpin again. </p>

This applies to those times when you<br /> need to skip town for a month because that bad guy is trying to<br /> kill you. (Wouldn't that be nice???)</p>
<p>4. You are always the BEST at what you do and there is ALWAYS<br /> someone out there trying to beat you. (That brings a whole new<br /> meaning to arch nemesis for me.)</p>
<p>5. Someone is always trying to kill you or stalk you. (Only in<br /> Brooklyn!)</p>
<p>6. It is possible to become a rocket scientist by the age of 20<br /> as long as you are blonde and pretty. (I guess that explains why<br /> I don't have a job!)</p>
<p>7. You can break into anyone's house within two minutes.<br /> Experience with locks and security alarms/guards are never a<br /> problem to get rid of. Dogs will always be distracted by a bone.<br /> (Criminals, give all your compliments to the writers!)</p>
<p>8. For the men, a beautiful young girl will easily fall in love<br /> with you, even if you are a bum. (Everyone has their good<br /> points!)</p>
<p>9. No fat people exist. (I guess I should break out those<br /> weights!)</p>
<p>10. Bad guys are always bad for no reason and have no<br /> explanations for what they do, other than they are plain evil.<br /> (Well that explains my mother-in-law!)</p>
<p>11. Vampires do indeed exist, and you are usually in love with<br /> them. (Not someone I'd like to take home to Ma. But hey, that's<br /> just me!)</p>
<p>12. To be in love, it isn't necessary to know anything about the<br /> person. (A nice ""What's your name?"" isn't too much to ask for!)</p>
<p>13. ""I love you, always."" really means ""I love you for today.""<br /> Which comes to a similar point, forever means until I find out<br /> you're sleeping with my brother/sister. (My how time flies!)</p>
<p>14. Your mate is usually sleeping with someone very close to<br /> you. (What is this? Jerry Springer???)</p>
<p>15. If you were a nerd, that doesn't matter! Your best friend<br /> will style your hair differently and immediately make you a<br /> hottie. (Did I mention for under $5?)</p>
<p>16. Think nothing of death. If your life is being threatened,<br /> it's probably your time anyway. (Gee, that's nice to know!)</p>
<p>17. When someone holds your family hostage, do NOT call the<br /> police. Instead, strap a lot of bombs around you and threaten to<br /> blast the place to pieces! (Of course!!!!????)</p>
<p>18. You will always have an adventure with your crush. (Some<br /> people have all the luck!)</p>
<p>19. Chaperones can always be tied up and forgotten about for a<br /> couple days. (Why didn't I learn this before I turned 18???)</p>
<p>20. There is always a secret to hide. (A white lie never hurt<br /> anybody!)</p>
<p>21. It is very easy to blackmail someone. Digging into their<br /> past is simple with a few private investigators and remember,<br /> there is always something to hide. (Blackmailing 101 sounds like<br /> a waste of time after that comment!)</p>
<p>22. Mind control is simple and will work on anyone. (You are<br /> getting very sleepy...)</p>
<p>23. The good guys always win. (That's a refreshing thought!)</p>
<p>24. It isn't necessary to change clothes. One outfit will last<br /> you a week or so. (I'm not one to enjoy doing laundry, but isn't<br /> that unsanitary?)</p>
<p>25. It is possible to get ready and get to your destination in<br /> less than one scene with a new suit! (Approximately 5 minutes.)</p>

40574,"<p>A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and, being told that there was a fortune in horse racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the races. However, at the local auction, the going price for horses was so steep that the preacher ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races. </p>
<p>To his surprise, the donkey came in third. The next day the headlines read: ""PREACHERS ASS SHOWS"" The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the races again. </p>
<p>This time he won! The news read: ""PREACHERS ASS OUT IN FRONT"" </p>
<p>The bishop of the church saw the headline and was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. </p>
<p>The headlines read: ""BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHERS ASS"" </p>
<p>This was too much for the Bishop to take, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the animal. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. </p>
<p>The headlines read: ""NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN"" </p>
<p>The Bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to dispose of the donkey - so she found a farmer who was willing to buy the animal for $10.00. </p>
<p>The headlines read: ""NUN PEDDLES ASS FOR TEN BUCKS"" </p>
<p>They had to bury the Bishop the next day. The headlines read ... ""NUN'S ASS KILLS BISHOP""</p>

40578,"<p>Allegedly a letter to the Home Economist:SIR:Mr. Gates' arguments may also be applied to the electricity utility business. If I were the head of Gates Gas &amp; Electric, the first thing I would do is declare that we sell energy systems, not power, and that customers tell us that they want a familiar energy environment wherever they goThe first step would be to integrate a smart fridge into the overall energy system as it is the first appliance opened by most users and real-time monitoring of beer temperature increases satisfaction with the energy environment for 78% of all customersCustomers would be free to use other fridges, even making someone else's their default appliance. However, if they try to remove the Gas &amp; Electric fridge their television and air conditioner might not function properly. When a circuit fails in an older home we would repair it with a 'service pack' that also installs our fridge, eventually introducing all customers to our energy environmentWe would also encourage homebuilders to 'bundle' our innovative Laundry Suite into all new home sales. If builders made exaggerated claims that they could not refuse our Laundry Suite because they might lose their power connection, I would be required to enforce our industry standard non-disclosure agreementFor the first six months we would also give away the innovative Gas &amp; Electric Power Mailbox as part of the Laundry Suite. It not only receives letters but also records all return addresses, birthdays and visiting habits of in-laws, scheduling thank-you notes and utility payments. Of course, the current version of Power Mailbox takes up half the pavement and all of the attic, disables the fax, takes 12 minutes to disgorge letters and occasionally freezes everything in the fridge;  forcing one to turn off all the lights, throw away the frozen fruit and restart dinner. However, attic space will become much less expensive in the 21st century, we will soon introduce a new fruit-recovery utility and version 3.0 will open the mailbox in under two minutesOnce installed, homeowners are not authorized to remove it.  Yet, as it is free we will have saved our customers money compared with manual mailboxes, making it all but impossible for the authorities to complain</p>

<p>""Who said that?"" she demanded. Suzuki put his hand up. ""Lee Iacocca, 1982."" At that point, a student in the back said, ""I'm gonna puke.""</p>
<p>The teacher glares and asks ""All right! Now, who said that?"" Again, Suzuki says, ""George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.""</p>
<p>Now furious, another student yells, ""Oh yeah? Suck this!"" Suzuki jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher: ""Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!""</p>
<p>Now with almost a mob hysteria someone said, ""You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you."" Suzuki frantically yells at the  top of his voice, ""Gary Condit to Chandra Levy 2001.""</p>

40610,"<p>Father Delany was walking home after his sermon late one night when he came upon this intoxicated tramp on the sidewalk. Wanting to help, he asked the man, ""Do you live here?""<br /> ""Yesh,"" the man slowly replied. </p>
<p>""Would you like me to help you upstairs?"" the father asked. </p>
<p>""Yesh,"" the man slowly sputtered. </p>
<p>When they got up on the second floor he asked, ""Is this your floor?"" </p>
<p>""Yesh,"" again the man replied. </p>
<p>Then Father Delany got to thinking that maybe he didn't want to face the man's irate wife because she may think he was the one who got the man drunk. So, he opened the first door he came to and shoved him through it, then went back downstairs. </p>
<p>But lo and behold when he went back outside, there was another Tramp lying on the sidewalk. So he asked that man ""Do you live here?"" </p>
<p>""Yesh."" </p>
<p>""Would you like me to help you upstairs?"" </p>
<p>""Yesh."" </p>
<p>So he did and put him in the same door with the first Tramp. Then went back downstairs, where, to his surprise, there was another tramp. </p>
<p>So he started over to him. But before he got to him, the tramp staggered over to a policeman and cried, ""For God's sake, offisher, protect me from thish man. He'sh been doing nothing all night long but takin' me upstairsh and throwing me down the elevator shaft!""</p>

While I was out there looking for it, some fat broad hit her ball into the same place.""""So we're both out there searching, and she's swearing  like she just invented it and beating the hell out of  the forage with her club. I find a ball. She claims  it's hers, and we end up continuing to search for the other one while she bitches and I listen. Finally,  I know I've looked everywhere except where some real  cows are standing."" ""So I pick up the cows' feet one by one, but there's no ball under a cow. Now there's only one other chance. I lift up the biggest cow's tail, and sure as hell, there's a golf ball! When I turned to the fat broad,  the ball fell out. I pointed under the tail and said  'Does that look like yours?'""</p>

40620,"<p>This Poor Innocent Guy lives in Westchester, NY and goes to school at Ithaca College. For two years, he has wanted to ask a certain girl (who is also from Westchester and also goes to Ithaca) out on a date, but has never had the courage.Finally, one day over the summer, he sees her at home and musters up the courage to ask her out. She accepts, and they make dinner plans for Saturday night. Friday night, this guy goes out with all of his buddies, and drinks like prohibition is coming back. Saturday, he is in such bad shape that he can't make it through twenty minutes without either throwing up or using the bathroom. After several hours of this, he is able to stop throwing up, but he is still running to the toilet every 20 minutes. He doesn't want to cancel the date, because he's afraid he won't ever talk to her again. So they meet in Westchester, and take the train to New York City (about a 30-minute ride). They get to the restaurant, and he excuses himself during the appetizers to use the bathroom. They enjoy the rest of the appetizers without interruption, but he has to go back again during the entrees. They decide to get dessert. During dessert, our hero feels another rumbling, but doesn't want to look like a complete bathroom freak, so he holds it. After a few minutes, the rumbling subsides, but he still has a bit of gas stored up. He decides to let this little bit of gas fly right there at the table (discreetly, of course). Unfortunately, this little bit of gas came with another little surprise. ""Oh crap,"" he thinks (and feels). Instead of running to the bathroom right away, our hero immediately leans on the arms of his chair to keep from sitting on this surprise.He maintains this yoga position for the rest of dessert, trying to figure out what to do before his tan pants (a) start to smell, or (b) start to show stains on the outside. He quickly pays for dinner and they leave the restaurant. Oh, by the way, he is walking like a cowboy. On the way to the train station, they pass the Gap. ""Do you mind if I run in and buy a sweater that I was looking at last week?"" he asks. ""No problem, I'd like to look around too,"" she replies. They go into the Gap. Fortunately, at the Gap, men's fashions are on the right, women's fashions are on the left. They split up.Our hero grabs the first sweater within reach, and hurries back to the khakis. After selecting a pair that most closely resemble his current outfit, he brings both items to the register. His eyes are on his date (still on the other side of the store) to make sure that she doesn't see him buying the pants. He doesn't even want the sweater, so he says through clenched teeth (just in case his date can read lips from 40 feet away) ""Just the pants."" ""What?"" asks the Gap girl. ""Just the pants!"" (Eyes still trained on his date.) Gap girl: ""Oh, OK."" He pays for the pants and walks over to his date, then they leave the store. They board the train just before it leaves the station and find two seats in the middle of the car. Without sitting down, our hero excuses himself and walks to the bathroom in the back of the car. He gets to the bathroom as the train departs, and quickly rips off his pants and boxer shorts. He rolls them into a ball and throws them out the window. After cleaning himself off, he opens the Gap bag and pulls out...just the sweater.</p>

<p>The following is a list of constant problems:</p>

<p>- Overheats when the air/gray matter ratio exceeds rational equilibrium in regard to ones own responsibility to auto maintenance</p>
<p>- When mouth is placed in gear, makes loud noise whilst insulting the the auto professional. (see previous item)</p>
<p>- Software controlling the ""computer"" is defective..wild random responses to input stimuli (i.e. ""Have you checked the oil..?"") </p>
<p>- Motor controls are sluggish (i.e. response to traffic light stimuli and expected law abiding response)</p>
<p>- Mouth continues to run long after brain has shut off </p>
<p>- Touts superior performance, but functions do not perform as advertised</p>
<p>- Lifetime warranty is a misnomer. Cannot get problems fixed under any policy</p>
<p>- Model not eligible for trade in or replacement under Lemon Law</p>
<p>I have attempted to contact the manufacturer of this model regarding these issues, but I have received no response. I can only assume that this creator does not stand by the product in question.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am directing my attorney to file a Class Action suit on behalf of myself and my family. The basis for this suit is that the manufacturer did knowingly produce a defective product.</p>

40624,"<p>A blonde decides to try horseback riding, even though she has had no lessons or prior experience. She mounts the horse unassisted and the horse immediately springs into motion. It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the saddle. In terror, she grabs for the horse's mane, but cannot seem to get a firm grip. She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway.<br /> The horse gallops along, seemingly impervious to its slipping rider. Finally, giving up her frail grip, she leaps away from the horse to try and throw herself to safety.<br /> Unfortunately, her foot has become tangled in the stirrup and she is now at the mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground again and again. As her head is battered against the ground, she is mere moments away from unconsciousness when....................................the Wal-Mart manager runs out to shut the horse off.</p>

40648,"<p>A language instructor was explaining to her class that French nouns, unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically designated as masculine or feminine. Things like 'chalk' or 'pencil,' she described, would have a gender association although in English, these words were of neutral gender.</p>
<p>Puzzled, one student raised his hand and asked, ""What gender is a computer?""</p>
<p>The teacher wasn't certain which it was, and so divided the class into two groups and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. One group was composed of the women in the  class, and the other of men. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendation.</p>
<p>The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to in the masculine gender because:</p>
<p>1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br /> 2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.<br /> 3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.<br /> 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.</p>
<p>The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender because:</p>
<p>1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.<br /> 2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br /> 3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br /> 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.</p>

40665,"<p>Turmoil rocked Heaven this morning as allegations arose that God had had an affair with a former worshipper. The scandal was begun when a 21 year old woman, known only as Mary, claimed that she had given birth to God's ""only son"" last week in a barn in the hamlet of Bethlehem. Sources close to Mary claim that she ""had loved God for a long time"", that she was constantly talking about her relationship with God, and that she was ""thrilled to have had his child."" </p>
<p>In a press conference this morning, God issued a vehement denial, saying that ""No sexual relationship existed"", and that ""the facts of this story will come out in time, verily"". Independent counsel Kenneth Beelzebub immediately filed a brief with the Justice department to expand his investigation to cover questions of whether any commandments may have been broken, and whether God had illegally funneled laundered money to his illegitimate child through three foreign operatives know only as the ""Wise Men"". </p>
<p>Beelzebub has issued subpoenas to several angels who are rumored to have acted as go-betweens in the affair. Critics have pointed out that these allegations have little to do with the charges that Beelzebub was originally appointed to investigate, that God had created large-scale flooding in order to cover up evidence of a failed land deal. In recent months, Beelzebub's investigation has already been expanded to cover questions surrounding the large number of locusts that lagued God's political opponents in the last election, as well as to claims that the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah was to divert attention away from a scandal involving whether the giveaway of a parcel of public land in Promised County to a Jewish special interest group was quid pro quo for political contributions. </p>
<p>If these allegations prove to be true, then this could be a huge blow to God's career, much of which has been spent crusading for stricter moral standards and harsher punishments for wrongdoers. Indeed, God recently outlined a ""tough-on-crime"" plan consisting of a series of 10 ""Commandments"", which has been introduced in Congress in a bill by Rep. Moses. Critics of the bill have pointed out that it lacks any provisions for the rehabilitation of criminals, and lawyers for the ACLU are planning to fight the ""Name in Vain"" Commandment as being an unconstitutional restriction on free speech.</p>

40679,"<p>Two Irishmen are standing on the top of a cliff, looking out over a huge<br /> drop to the rocks below.</p>
<p>One turns to the other and says, ""OK, Paddy, a pact is a pact.  We're<br /> going to do it, right?""</p>
<p>Paddy says, ""If you tink we should, Murphy, I'm with you all the way.  As<br /> you say, a pact is a pact, but you go first.""</p>
<p>Murphy thinks about this for a moment, then says, ""But you'll be right<br /> behind me, yes?""</p>
<p>""Oh, yes, Murphy.  I'll do it, but I want to watch you first.""</p>
<p>""OK then Paddy.  I'm going.  Goodbye!""</p>
<p>With that, Murphy takes a budgerigar out of his coat pocket, ties some<br /> string around its legs, and straps it firmly onto his head.  He steps<br /> forward to the edge of the cliff, and throws himself off.</p>
<p>The budgie flaps its wings like mad, but to no avail.  It can't hold the<br /> weight of a thirteen stone Irishman in the air by itself.  Murphy falls<br /> splat, and breaks both legs on the rocks.</p>
<p>Paddy has seen all this, but thinks, ""A pact is a pact.  I have to do<br /> it.""</p>
<p>He takes a parrot out of his jacket pocket, straps it to his head,<br /> salutes, and jumps off the cliff.</p>
<p>Now the parrot is bigger than the budgie, and Paddy is quite a bit<br /> lighter than Murphy, so for a moment the parrot seems to be holding its<br /> own against gravity.  However gravity doesn't get tired, and gradually<br /> Paddy starts to descend.</p>
<p>It seems he is going to make a graceful landing, when about halfway down,<br /> he takes a gun out of his other pocket, and carefully points it at the<br /> parrot on his head, and shoots it dead.</p>
<p>Of course he now falls splat, and breaks his legs too.<br /> Lying there together, Murphy looks at Paddy and says, ""I don't tink much<br /> of dis budgie jumping, Paddy.""</p>
<p>Paddy replies, ""And Parrotshooting is not all it's cracked up to be<br /> neither!""</p>

<p>""Yeah"" the bartender says. </p>
<p>""Sure, and I can pee right on the spot from 75 feet away"" the guy says. </p>
<p>""Yeah right"" the bartender says. </p>
<p>""It's true, in fact, I'll bet you 100 dollars that I cam pee right into a beer bottle 75 feet away and not spill a drop"" the guy says. </p>

<p>So a beer bottle is placed on the floor 75 feet away. Then the guy whips out his dick and starts peeing. He pees on the wall, he pees on the floor, he pees on the ceiling and bar, he even pees on the bartender. He pees everywhere EXCEPT in the bottle. </p>
<p>The bartender starts smiling and tells the guy to pay up. The guy goes into another room, comes out a few minutes later with a big grin on his face and pays the bartender. The bartender then says to the guy, ""Why are you so happy, you just lost a hundred bucks?"" </p>
<p>Then the guy says """"Well, I just bet the guys in the other room a thousand bucks that I could pee all over your bar and not only would you not mind, but you'd be smiling.""</p>

40704,"<p>Dear Dr. Dover: </p>
<p>I wish to apply for an operation to make me sterile. My reasons are numerous. After being married for seven years and having had 7 children, I have come to the conclusion that contraceptives are useless. </p>
<p>After getting married I was advised to use the rhythm method. Despite trying the Tango and the Samba, my wife fell pregnant and I ruptured myself doing the Cha-Cha. Apart from that, where do you find a band when you get the urge at two o'clock in the morning? </p>
<p>A doctor suggested the safe period. At the time, we were living with the in-laws and we had to wait 3 weeks for the safe period, when the house was empty. Needless to say this didn't work, and the wife got pregnant. </p>
<p>A lady of several years' experience said if we made love while breast feeding we would be all right. Well, I finished up with clear skin, Silky Hair and was very healthy, but the wife got pregnant yet again. </p>
<p>Another tale we heard was if the wife jumped up and down after intercourse this would prevent pregnancy. She slipped a disk but still got pregnant again. </p>
<p>I asked the chemist about the condoms and he demonstrated them, so I bought a packet. My wife fell pregnant again, which did not surprise me as I never did believe how stretching one of those things over your thumb could prevent babies. </p>
<p>We tried the coil next but that didn't work. It had a left-hand screw and my wife is definitely a right-hand screw. </p>
<p>The Dutch cap was next and seemed to be our answer, but my wife got severe headaches when the only size available was too tight across the forehead. </p>
<p>Eventually we tried the Pill, but it kept dropping out, so she tried it between her knees and I couldn't get anywhere near her. </p>
<p>You must appreciate my problems. If I can't have the operation I will have to resort to oral sex, and I can't believe that talking about it is any substitute for the real thing. </p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

40707,"<p>Upon arriving home, a husband was met at the door by his sobbing wife.<br /> Tearfully she explained, ""It's the druggist - he insulted me terribly<br /> this morning on the phone."" </p>
<p>Immediately the husband drove downtown to confront the druggist and demand an apology.</p>
<p>Before he could say more than a word or two, the druggist told him,<br /> ""Now, just a minute - listen to my side of it. This morning the alarm<br /> failed to go off, so I was late getting up. I went without breakfast and hurried out to the car, just to realize that I locked the house with<br /> both house and car keys inside.""</p>
<p>""I had to break a window to get my keys. Then, driving a little too fast, I got a speeding ticket. Later, when I was about three blocks from the store, I had a flat tire. When I finally got to the store there was a bunch of people waiting for me to open up. I got the store opened and started waiting on these people, and all the time the darn phone was ringing off the hook.""</p>
<p>He continued, ""Then I had to break a roll of nickels against the cash<br /> register drawer to make change, and they spilled all over the floor. I<br /> got down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels - the phone was<br /> still ringing - when I came up I cracked my head on the open cash<br /> drawer, which made me stagger back against a showcase with a bunch of<br /> perfume bottles on it...half of them hit the floor and broke. Meanwhile,<br /> the phone is still ringing with no let up, and I finally got back to<br /> answer it. It was your wife - she wanted to know how to use a rectal<br /> thermometer. and believe me, Mister, I TOLD HER!</p>

40709,"<p>This past fall semester, at Duke University, there were two sophomores who<br /> were taking Organic Chemistry and who did pretty well on all of the quizzes,<br /> midterms, labs, etc. Going into the final exam, they had solid ""A's.""<br /> These two friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend<br /> before finals week (even though the Chem. final was on Monday), they decided to<br /> go up to University of Virginia to a party with some friends.<br /> So they did this and had a great time. However, they ended up staying longer<br /> than they planned, and they didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday<br /> morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found Professor Aldric after<br /> the final and explained to him why they missed it. They told him that they went<br /> up to Virginia for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study,<br /> but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and<br /> couldn't get help for a long time. So they were late getting back to campus.<br /> Aldric thought this over and agreed that they could make up the final on the<br /> following day. The two guys were elated and relieved. So, they studied that<br /> night and went in the next day at the time that Aldric had told them.<br /> He placed them in separate rooms, handed each of them a test booklet and told<br /> them to begin. They looked at the first problem, which was something simple<br /> about free radical formation and was worth 5 points. ""Cool"" they thought, ""this<br /> is going to be easy."" They did that problem and then turned the page.<br /> They were unprepared, however, for what they saw on the next page.<br /> It said: (95 points) ""Which tire?""</p>

40721,"<p>A wise old gentleman retired and purchased a modest home near a junior high school. He spent the first few weeks of his retirement in peace and contentment. Then a new school year began. The very next afternoon three young boys, full of youthful, after-school enthusiasm, came down his street, beating merrily on every trashcan they encountered. The crashing percussion continued day after day, until finally the wise old man decided it was time to take some action. The next afternoon, he walked out to meet the young percussionists as they banged their way down the street. Stopping them, he said, ""You kids are a lot of fun. I like to see you express your exuberance like that. In fact, I used to do the same thing when I was your age. Will you do me a favor? I'll give you each a dollar if you'll promise to come around every day and do your thing."" The kids were elated and continued to do a bang-up job on the trashcans. After a few days, the old-timer greeted the kids again, but this time he had a sad smile on his face. ""This recession's really putting a big dent in my income,"" he told them. ""From now on, I'll only be able to pay you 50 cents to beat on the cans."" The noisemakers were obviously displeased, but they accepted his offer and continued their afternoon ruckus. A few days later, the wily retiree approached them again as they drummed their way down the street. ""Look,"" he said, ""I haven't received my Social Security check yet, so I'm not going to be able to give you more than 25 cents. Will that be okay?"" ""Only a quarter?"" the drum leader exclaimed. ""If you think we're going to waste our time, beating these cans around for a quarter, you're nuts!"" ""No way, dude. We quit!""

Stand By Me.  Right wing advocates will Say  Anything, and should Never Cry Wolf.'  The First Lady And The Tramp also showed Courage Under Fire.

While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is, why would you bother to borrow $5,000?"" </p>

40767,"<p>Little Johnny was about 10 years old and curious as only a boy<br /> should be. He had been hearing a lot about courting from other<br /> boys so he asked his mother how it was done. She told him to<br /> hide behind the curtains some night and watch his sister and her<br /> boyfriend. So Johnny did and this is what happened (or at least<br /> his version).</p>
<p>""Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked awhile, then turned out<br /> all the lights except the blue one, then he started kissing her,<br /> and for some reason he put his hand inside her blouse. She<br /> started giggling and ooing, then he put his hand up her skirt,<br /> when he did this she began to moan and sigh.</p>
<p>Then she slowly moved to the other end of the couch till she was<br /> lying down. I think she had a backache, then he rolled over and<br /> unzipped his pants and pulled out a Texas Eel. I don't know what<br /> it was doing in there but it was 8"" long and 2"" wide. He held it<br /> in his hands so it wouldn't get away. Sis tried to help him, so<br /> she got a tight grip on it, she spread her legs far apart and<br /> stuck this eel between her legs and got a good scissors hold on<br /> it. He helped by lying on top of Sis to keep the eel from moving.</p>
<p>The eel put up a hell of a fight though. Sis squalled and her<br /> boyfriend nearly up set the couch. For a minute there I thought<br /> the damn thing was getting away but Sis grabbed it just as it<br /> was slipping out and stuck it back in.</p>
<p>Soon they both gave a large sigh and stopped moving. First they<br /> let the eel move but it didn't. It tried to get away but her<br /> boyfriend got up and the thing was dead. It just hung there<br /> limber as a hot water bottle and its end was dripping. Sis and<br /> her boyfriend were all tired out from the battle. They started<br /> kissing and loving again and by God if that damn thing didn't<br /> come back to life again, so the battle started again.</p>
<p>Well it sure was the best wrestling match I ever saw. This time<br /> they really killed the eel. I saw her boyfriend pull its skin<br /> off and flush it down the toilet.""</p>

""What do they say?"" the priest inquired.<br /> They say, ""Hi, we're prostitutes.  Do you want to have some fun?""<br /> That's obscene!"" the priest exclaimed, then he thought for a moment.<br /> ""You know,"" he said, ""I may have a solution to your problem.  I have two<br />  male talking parrots whom I have taught to pray and read the bible.<br /> Bring your two parrots over to my house, and we'll put them in the cage<br /> with Francis and Job.  My parrots can teach your parrots to praise and<br /> worship, and your parrots are sure to stop saying ......that phase<br /> ..... in no time.""<br /> ""Thank you,""  the woman responded, ""this may very well be the<br /> solution."" The next day , she brought  her female parrots to the<br /> priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw that his two male parrots<br /> were inside their  cage, holding rosary beads and praying.  Impressed, she<br /> walked over and placed her parrots in with them.   After a few minutes, the<br /> female<br /> parrots cried out in unison: ""Hi, we're prostitutes.  Do you want to<br /> have some fun?""<br /> There was stunned silence.  Finally one male parrot looked over at the<br /> other male parrot and exclaimed, ""Put the fucking beads away, Francis,<br /> our prayers have been answered!!""</p>

40780,"<p>According to a radio report, a middle school in Oregon was faced with a unique problem.  A number of girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom. </p>
<p>That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints. Finally the principal decided that there had to be something done about it.</p>
<p>She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the custodian.  She then explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every day.  </p>
<p>To demonstrate how difficult it was to clean the mirrors, she asked the custodian to clean one of the mirrors.</p>
<p>He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it into the toilet and then used it to clean the mirror.  Needless to say, there have been no lip prints on the mirror since!</p>

40781,"<p>A man complained to his friend ""My elbow hurts I better go to the doctor."" ""Don't do that,"" volunteered his friend ""there's a new computer at the drug store that can diagnose any problem quicker and cheaper than a doctor. All you have to do is put in a urine sample, deposit $10, then the computer will give you your diagnosis and plan of treatment.""<br /> The man figured he had nothing to lose so he took a sample of urine down to the drug store. Finding the machine, he poured in the urine and deposited the $10. The machine began to buzz and various lights flashed on and off. After a short pause, a slip of paper popped out on which was printed: </p>
<p>You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water twice a day. Avoid heavy labor. Your elbow will be better in two weeks </p>
<p>That evening as the man contemplated this breakthrough in medical science, he began to suspect fraud. To test his theory he mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and teenage daughter. To top it all off, he masturbated into the jar. </p>
<p>He took this concoction down to the drug store, poured it in the machine, and deposited $10. The machine went through the same buzzing and flashing routine as before then printed out the following message: </p>
<p>Your tap water has lead.<br /> Get a filter.<br /> Your dog has worms.<br /> Give him vitamins.<br /> Your daughter is on drugs.<br /> Get her in rehab.<br /> Your wife is pregnant.<br /> It's not your baby - get a lawyer.<br /> And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.</p>

40800,"<p>God created the mule, and told him, ""You will be Mule, working constantly from<br /> dusk to dawn, carrying heavy loads on your back.</p>
<p>You will eat grass and you lack intelligence. You will live for 50years."" </p>
<p>The mule answered: ""To live like this for 50 years is too much. Please, give<br /> me no more than 20."" </p>
<p>And it was so. </p>
<p>Then God created the dog, and told him, ""You will hold vigilance over the<br /> dwellings of Man, to whom you will be his greatest companion. You will eat his<br /> table scraps and live for 25 years. </p>
<p>And the dog responded, ""Lord, to live 25 years as a dog is too much. Please,<br /> no more than 10 years."" And it was so. </p>
<p>God then created the monkey and told him, ""You are Monkey. You shall swing<br /> from tree to tree, acting like an idiot. You will be funny, and you shall live<br /> for 20 years.� </p>
<p>And the monkey responded, ""Lord, to live 20 years as the clown of the world is<br /> too much. Please, Lord, give me no more than 10 years."" </p>
<p>And it was so. Finally, God created Man and told him, ""You are Man, the only<br /> rational being that walks the earth.</p>
<p>You will use your intelligence to have mastery over the creatures of the<br /> world. You will dominate the earth and live for 20 years.""</p>
<p>And the man responded, ""Lord, to be Man for only 20 years is too little.<br /> Please, Lord, give me the 30 years the mule refused, the 15 years the dog<br /> refused, and the ten years the monkey rejected.""</p>
<p>And it was so. So God made Man to live 20 years as a man, then marry and live<br /> 30 years like a mule working and carrying heavy loads on his back. Then, he is<br /> to have children and live 15 years as a dog, guarding his house and eating the<br /> leftovers after they empty the pantry; then, in his old age, to live 10 years as<br /> a monkey, acting like a clown to amuse his grandchildren.</p>

40823,"<p>Monsters, Inc. was a cute animated movie that is pretty funny, but definitely for kids.  You should go see it if you have kids, are a kid, or like to pretend you're a kid late at night by wearing diapers.  It's made by the Pixar people, who did Toy Story and A Bug's Life, and that pretty much tells you what to expect.  Same technology, but a couple years later, so it's a little better, a little more lifelike.  Movie gets a nice, solid 3 6/7 Babylons.  You'll have a good time, but try not to see it in a theater filled with too many kids- they can be annoying.  Especially when the one right behind you spends the last fifteen minutes kicking your chair telling its Mommy that it needs to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>OK, now let's talk about the Star Wars trailer.</p>
<p>By now, you have seen it, or heard it, or had it described to you by a cyber-dork named C3PO4EVR on a host of fan sites.  You know it's really short.  You know there is no dialogue.  You know that the only sound you get is Vader breathing through his iron lung.</p>
<p>So let's talk about what we see, and what it may mean, and what it tells us about Star Wars, Episode II: Attack of the Clones.</p>
<p>First shot is a close-up of Padme, followed by a close-up of Anakin.  Obviously, these two are the center of the story.  These are our leads.  Natalie Portman, who was damn cute when she was 13 in The Professional, is now officially hot as she becomes 20 before our eyes.  Newbie Hayden Christensen looks like he has just the right amount of hunkness in him to carry the whole tortured hero thing off.  Together, they are a tragic love story waiting to happen.</p>
<p>Next shot is some ship flying across a desert world, most likely Tatooine.  Now I don't know about you, but I am damn tired of that puny little sand dune of a world.  It was the most boring planet in the first Star Wars, it hasn't gotten better with age.  I'm not sure why Lucas is hell bent on getting the blazing ball of nothing into just about every pic he makes, but he's dangerously close to following in the sandy footprints of Ishtar if he doesn't get a move on.</p>
<p>Now the glamour shots.  Look!  There's C-3PO. Look!  There's Yoda.  Look!  There's Boba Fett (or at least a Boba Fett look-alike, could be anyone under that armor) and he's FLYING!  COOL!!!</p>
<p>Now we have a shot only the mother of a cgi-artist could love.  Fake ship zooming through a fake city.  Nothing in that shot that you wouldn't be surprised to find in Monsters, Inc.  Which also tells us something we've known for a while, this film series is becoming more and more a animated feature.  Oh sure, we've got live actors all over the place, but we're doing more and more to them in post.  I mean, unless you want to believe they really did slice Darth Maul in half to make Phantom.</p>
<p>Next shot is young Obi-Wan and young Anakin doing what young Jedis do best, run around with lightsabers.</p>
<p>Next we get a glamour shot of Mace Windu.  Still bald, still hanging around with Yoda.  Then we get a shot of some transport-looking ship flying over a cliff dwelling/meadow ecosystem.  Followed by Lucas' Waterworld, which looks a hell of a lot cooler than Costner's Waterworld.</p>
<p>Then Lucas drops a bit in my opinion because he gives us a shot of a Jedi mimicking the chick in Disney's recent Atlantis cartoon.  You know, where she gets lifted up in the pillar of light?  We'll call this shot ""Jedi gets lifted up in light.""  Not a good sign when you're copying Disney.</p>
<p>Now Lucas starts to really sag.  He brings back one of the more undesirable characters from Phantom, the annoying guy who owed Anakin, and then gives a shot of a spaceship flying through an asteroid field.  Uhm.. George?  You already did asteroids.  Pretty well.  Move on.  Comets are nice, use one of them.</p>
<p>Now we get a shot of two people hugging at Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru's house.  Which, I guess, means we'll meet a younger Uncle Owen and a younger Aunt Beru.  Like we care.</p>
<p>More glamour shots.  R2D2.  More ships flying around looking cool.  A bunch of people at a bunch of stations, like a galactic mission control or something.</p>
<p>Then we finally get what we wanted.  Clones.  Gagillion of them.  Boarding a ship.  From far away, so we can't really tell what they look like.  But they're clones.  And there are a lot of them.  Yummy.</p>
<p>Speaking of yummy, remember our two young, sexy leads?  Here we get a kiss.  Yowza!!!  A Star Wars kiss!!  Wooo!!!!</p>
<p>End it all with a final shot of a lightsaber battle and you've got yourself a trailer.</p>
<p>What does it tell us about the movie?  Absolutely nothing.  It's about 10 seconds long, and does nothing for you.  Nothing at all.  So don't go to Monsters, Inc. to see the trailer.  Go to Monsters, Inc. to see Monsters, Inc.  More than that, go to see the Pixar short about a bunch of birds that precedes the film.  As good a Monsters, Inc. is, this bird beauty is better.  A real hoot.</p>

<p>The man jumped up with his eyes about ready to emerge from their sockets. He asked, ""So is it for the poor? Or is it lika a charity?""</p>
<p>The bartender shook his head.""No no no! That money is for the first person to complete three tasks.""</p>
<p>A little curious, the man said, ""Is that so? Well, I'm sure I could get them done, so what are they?""</p>
<p>Grinning slightly, the bartender replied, ""First task: You must chug down a 5 gallon bucket of beer. Second task: You must pull a rotten tooth from a wolf with rabies. Then for your final task, you must have sex with a 100 year old grandmother located upstairs.""</p>
<p>The man gulped a little, but replied, ""Well, that still sounds like a deal!""</p>
<p>The man chugged down the 5 gallon bucket of beer. Woozy, he told the bartender to take him out to the wolf with rabies. ""Leave me here! This could get rough,"" the man said in a fluury of slurred words, as the bartender let him go and walked back in to tend to the custumers.</p>
<p>Minutes later he heard the wolf yelping and crying out. ""Man, he must really have a thing with animals. He's probably pulled that tooth right out.""</p>
<p>The bartender looked up in wonder as the man stumbled through the door and yelled in a drunken voice, ""Now where's that old lady with the rotten tooth?""</p>

<p>To his surprise, the donkey came in third.<br /> The next day the local paper carried this headline: </p>

<p>NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN.</p>
<p>The Bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the<br /> donkey, so she sold it to a farmer<br /> for ten dollars.<br /> The next day, the paper read:</p>

At his funeral, the coffin was placed in front of a huge mockup of a heart made up of red flowers.When the pastor finished with his sermon, and after everyone said their good-byes, the large heart opened. The coffin rolled inside and the  heart closed again.At that moment, one of the mourners burst into a very loud fit of laughter. Irritated by his insensitivity, the guy next to him asked.""This  is a funeral, Buddy, why in the hell are you laughing?""Trying to hold his laughter for a moment, the man replied, ""I was just thinking about my own funeral, I'm a gynecologist.""</p>

40880,"<p>A team of archeologists were excavating in Israel, when they came upon a cave. Written on the wall of the cave were the following symbols in order of appearance. </p>
<p>1. A dog<br /> 2. A donkey<br /> 3. A shovel<br /> 4. A fish<br /> 5. The Star of David </p>
<p>They decided that this was a unique finding and that the writings were more than 3,000 years old. They chopped out the piece of stone and brought it to the museum, where archeologists from all over the world came to study the ancient symbols. They held a huge meeting after months of conferences to discuss what they could agree was the meaning of the markings. </p>
<p>The president of their society stood up and pointed at the first drawing and said, ""This looks like a dog. We can judge that this was a highly intelligent race, as they knew how to have animals for companionship. To prove this statement, you can see that the next symbol resembles a donkey, so they were even smart enough to have animals help them till the soil. </p>
<p>""The next drawing looks like a shovel of some sort, which means they even had tools to help them. Further proof of their intelligence is the fish, which means that when they had a famine and could not grow food, they took to the sea for food. </p>
<p>""The last symbol appears to be the Star of David, which means they were evidently Hebrews."" </p>
<p>The audience applauded enthusiastically. </p>
<p>The president smiled and said, ""I'm glad to see that you are all in full agreement with our interpretations."" </p>
<p>Suddenly, a little old Jewish man stood up in the back of the room and said, ""I object to every word. The explanation of what the writings say is quite simple. Everyone knows that Hebrews don't read from left to right, but from right to left. Look again... It says, HOLY MACKEREL, DIG THE ASS ON THAT BITCH.""</p>

40883,"<p>*File Description: If a Computer Beeps and There is No One Around...* An *actual* bug report (from a friend at Microsoft).Bug #   Status          Title 5143    ACTIVE          ""Build done"" signal makes no sound============ ACTIVE - 01/30/95 - MIKEBLAS ====================Visual C++ makes an audible signal when a build completes.  When no developer is in the room, this signal doesn't make a sound.  To reproduce:1) Start a build. 2) Leave the room. 3) Note that the chime does not make a sound.We should find a way to make the build bell make a sound even if nobody is there to hear it.This philosophical issue may need program management's attention before being resolved.============ ASSIGNED to MATTHEWT - 01/30/95 - SCOTF =========Can we use the telepathy support in Win95 to contact whomever is logged into the machine doing the build?  Maybe we should just detect when the developer is leaving the room and prompt for a phone number where s/he can be reached.How about disabling leaving the room during a build?============ RESOLVED - BY DESIGN - 01/31/95 - MATTHEWT ====== ============ ACTIVE - 02/01/95 - MARKLAM =====================Actually, we can't do this either. The problem is that while you're out of the room your build is neither finished nor unfinished.  It stays in a state of flux until you return and collapse the quantum uncertainty by observing it.Perhaps we could link the build finished event to a cat in a box?============ ASSIGNED to HEISENBERG - 02/01/95 - MARKLAM ===== ============ RESOLVED - NOT REPRO - 02/03/95 - HEISENBERG ====I cannot repro this.  I tried standing just outside my door and it made the beep.  Do I have to go further from my office?  Would the mailroom do?============ ACTIVE - 02/03/95 - MIKEBLAS ====================The relative position of the mailroom and your office are relatively uncertain to me, Doctor.Please try again:1) start a build 2) leave your office 3) go down the hall 4) wait until you don't hear the beep 5) return to note that the build is doneI think this is how I first repro'ed the problem, but I can't remember what I was doing to make it happen.The idea of disabling leaving the room might be the best possible solution, I think.  When a build starts, the IDE should pop up a message that says ""There are no more Fritos"" or ""The kitchen has closed early"" or ""The bathroom is being cleaned"" so the developer will not be tempted to get up and wander around.With minimal rebuild in place, we should consider diversions that won't take as long to remedy: ""You're expecting a phone call"" or ""Someone will stop by to see you soon"".We need to think of messages that are easy to localize for VC++3.0J.============ ASSIGNED to MIKEBLAS - 02/13/95 - MARKLAM =======To do this we'll need to avoid messages about the bathrooms and vending machines for external releases.  Perhaps some customer research is needed to find out exactly *why* Visual C++ users leave their keyboards.Some suggestions (including MB_ types) Get a drink : (i) You're out of coffee (i) You're out of tea (i)(i) YYoouuvv''ee hhaadd eennoouugghhGet something to eat : (?) You have no food, remember /! You need to lose weight, fatso. Sit your ass downExercise etc : (?) Did You Know - sunlight causes skin cancer (i) With a Nordik Trak you can get a workout in front of your monitor.     Call for home delivery. /! I didn't mean that about your weightSee family : (i) They already know you love them /! They'll only want money for something /! Your in-laws have arrivedCall of nature :     This could be difficult. Consider supplying bed-pan or similar.============ ASSIGNED to MIKEBLAS - 02/13/95 - MARKLAM ======= ============ ASSIGNED to MIKEBLAS - 02/16/95 - HEISENBERG ====I attempted to repro this once more:I placed my machine in the forest at the edge of the campus. I started a 'rebuild all' and ran out of the forest towards my mailroom. My build normally takes 3 minutes. After 5 minutes I had not heard anything, so I returned to my machine. Unfortunately a tree had fallen on it. I had not heard that, either.</p>

<p>She said, ""No, I'm saving myself for marriage.""</p>
<p>They went back and forth. He said, ""Just one feel, I promise, that's all, just one feel.""</p>

40892,"<p>1. Save all manner of bacon grease. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone eating.</p>
<p>2. Just because one can drive on snow and ice does not mean we can't stay home the two days of the year it snows.</p>
<p>3. If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four-wheel-drive with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Note: Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way: This is what they live for.</p>
<p>4. Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and fishing bait in the same store.</p>
<p>5. Remember: ""Y'all"" is singular.</p>
<p>6. ""All y'all"" is plural. ""All y'all's"" is plural possessive.</p>
<p>7. There is nothing sillier than a northerner imitating a Southern accent, unless it is a Southerner imitating a Boston accent.</p>
<p>8. People walk slower here.</p>
<p>9. Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't understand you either.</p>
<p>10. The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective ""Big ol'"", as in ""big ol' truck"" or ""big ol' boy"". Eighty-five percent begin their new southern influenced dialect with this expression. One hundred percent are in denial about it.</p>
<p>11. The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer proper.</p>
<p>12. ""He needed killin'"" is a valid defense here.</p>
<p>13. If attending a funeral in the South: remember, we stay until the last shovel of dirt is thrown on and the tent is torn down.</p>
<p>14. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"" stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say.</p>
<p>15. Most Southerners do not use turn signals, and they ignore those who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the car was purchased.</p>
<p>16. Northerners can be identified by the spit on the inside of their car's windshield that comes from yelling at other drivers.</p>
<p>17. The winter wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until November.</p>
<p>18. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the tiniest accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store, it is just something you're supposed to do.</p>
<p>19. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase one it is to be positioned directly in front of your trailer. This is logical bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the trailer and should, therefore, be displayed.</p>
<p>20. Tornadoes and Southerners going through a divorce have a lot in common. In either case, you know someone is going to lose a trailer.</p>
<p>21. Florida is not considered a Southern state (except Gainesville). There are far more Yankees than Southerners living there.</p>
<p>22. As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph zone, directly in the middle of the road, remember, many folks learned to drive on a model of vehicle known as John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for the vehicle.</p>
<p>23. You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find it yourself.</p>

40893,"<p>There was once a Scotsman and an Englishman who lived next door to each other. The Scotsman owned a hen and each morning would look in his garden and pick up one of his hen's eggs for breakfast. One day he looked into his garden and saw that the hen had laid an egg in the Englishman's garden. He was about to go next door when he saw the Englishman pick up the egg. The Scotsman ran up to the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged to him because he owned the hen.The Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property.They argued for a while until finally the Scotsman said, ""In my family we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I kick you in the balls and time how long it takes you to get back up, then you kick me in the balls and time how long it takes for me to get up; whoever gets up quicker wins the egg.""The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman found his heaviest pair of boots and put them on. He took a few steps back, then ran toward the Englishman and kicked him as hard as he could in the balls. The Englishman fell to the floor clutching his nuts, howling in agony for 30 minutes.Eventually the Englishman stood up and said, ""Now it's my turn to kick you.""The Scotsman said, ""Keep the damn egg.""</p>

The older doctor suggested that the younger doctor accompany him as he<br /> made his house calls so that the people of the community could become accustomed<br /> to him.<br /> At the first house they visited, the younger doctor listened intently as the<br /> older doctor and an older lady discussed the weather, their grandchildren and<br /> the latest church bulletin.<br /> After some time, the older doctor asked his patient how she had been feeling.<br /> ""I've been a little sick to my stomach,"" she replied.<br /> ""Well,"" said the older physician, ""you've probably been over doing it a bit<br /> with the fresh fruit. Why don't you cut back on the amount of fresh fruit you<br /> eat and see if that helps.""<br /> As they left the house, the younger doctor asked how the older doctor had<br /> reached his diagnosis so quickly.<br /> ""You didn't even examine that woman,"" the younger doctor stated.<br /> ""I didn't have to,"" the elder physician explain. ""You noticed I dropped my<br /> stethoscope on the floor in there. Well when I bent over to pick it up, I looked<br /> around and noticed a half dozen banana peels in the trash can. That is probably<br /> what has been making her ill.""<br /> ""That's pretty sneaky,"" commented the younger doctor. ""Do you mind if I try it<br /> at the next house?""<br /> ""I don't suppose it could hurt anything,"" the elder physician replied.<br /> At the next house, the two doctors visited with an elderly widow. They spent<br /> several minutes discussing the weather and grandchildren and the latest church<br /> bulletin.

""I just don't have as<br /> much energy as I used to.""<br /> ""You've probably been doing too much work for the church,"" the younger doctor<br /> suggested without even examining his patient.<br /> ""Perhaps you should ease up a bit and see if that helps.""<br /> As they left, the elder physician said, ""Your diagnosis is probably right, but<br /> do you mind telling me how you came to that conclusion?""<br /> ""Sure,"" replied the younger doctor. ""Just like you, I dropped my stethoscope<br /> on the floor. When I bent down to pick it up, I looked around and there was the<br /> preacher hiding under the bed!""</p>

A smack on the bum would pretty much do it.- Birth control could come in ale or lager.- The funniest guy in the office would get to be the big boss.- 'Sorry I'm late, I got hammered last night,' would be an acceptable excuse for tardiness.- It'd be considered harmless fun to gather 30 friends, put on horned helmets, and go pillage a nearby town.- Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating the 'public ugliness' ordinance.- Tanks would be far easier to rent.- Instead of beer belly, you'd get 'beer biceps'.- Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could present your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said, 'You're No. 1.'- Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29.- Cops would be broadcast live and you could phone in advice to the pursuing cops. Or to the crooks.- The victors in any athletic competition would get to kill and eat the losers.- The only show opposite Friday Night Football would be Friday Night Football from a Different Camera Angle.- It would be perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as you returned it the following day with a full tank of petrol.- Every man would get four real 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards per year.- When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-alec answer you responded with would actually reduce your fine, as in: Cop: `You know how fast you were going?' You: 'All I know is that I was spilling my beer all over the place.' Cop: 'Nice one. That's $10 off.'</p>

<p>Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry kept President Bush on the defensive today, telling a Pittsburgh audience that Mr. Bush had allowed the long-dormant volcano Mount St. Helens to erupt on his watch, adding that he would ""fix Mount St. Helens once and for all"" if elected in November.</p>
<p>""When George Bush was elected president, Mount St. Helens was nothing but a trivia question,"" Mr. Kerry said.  ""Well, guess what, folks - it's spewing volcanic gases right now and it's only a matter of time before she blows.""</p>
<p>Mr. Kerry said that Mr. Bush had refused to keep an eye on the troubling increase in volcanic activity at Mount St. Helens because he was ""totally obsessed with Iraq.""</p>
<p>""I've got news for George Bush, "" Mr. Kerry said.  ""Saddam Hussein isn't erupting.  Mount St. Helens is erupting.""</p>
<p>After accusing Mr. Bush of being ""in denial"" about ""the molten magma stewing inside that scary sucker,"" Mr. Bush fired back, saying that it would be ""sending the wrong message"" to say that Mr. St. Helens was erupting.</p>

I'm going to bring you both<br /> to life for thirty minutes, in which you can do anything you want<br /> to."" And with a clap of his hand, the angel brought the statues to life.</p>
<p>The two approached each other a bit shyly but soon<br /> dashed for the bushes, from which shortly emerged<br /> a good deal of giggling, laughter, and shaking of<br /> branches. Fifteen minutes later the two statues<br /> emerged from the bushes, wide grins on their faces.</p>

<p>In his claim, the man stated that he had lost the cigars in ""a series of small fires."" The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in a normal fashion. The man sued... and won. </p>
<p>In delivering his ruling, the judge stated that since the man held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable, and also guaranteed that it would insure the cigars against fire, without defining what it considered to be unacceptable fire,"" it was obligated to compensate the insured for his loss. </p>
<p>Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the judge's ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in ""the fires."" After the man cashed his check, however, the insurance company had him arrested ... on 24 counts of arson. </p>
<p>With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used as evidence against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning the rare cigars and sentenced to 24 consecutive one year terms.</p>

<p>OXYACETELENE TORCH: Used almost entirely for lighting those stale garage cigarettes you keep hidden in the back of the Whitworth socket drawer (What wife would think to look in _there_?) because you can never remember to buy lighter fluid for the Zippo lighter you got from the PX at Fort Campbell. </p>
<p>ZIPPO LIGHTER: See oxyacetelene torch. </p>

Health benefits aside, its main purpose is to consume 40-watt light bulbs at about the same rate that 105-mm howitzer shells might be used during, say, the first few hours of the Battle of the Bulge. More often dark than light, its name is somewhat misleading. </p>
<p>PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER: Normally used to stab the lids of old-style paper-and-tin oil cans and splash oil on your shirt; can also be used, as the name implies, to round off Phillips screw heads. </p>
<p>AIR COMPRESSOR: A machine that takes energy produced in a coal-burning power plant 200 miles away and transforms it into compressed air that travels by hose to a Chicago Pneumatic impact wrench that grips rusty suspension bolts last tightened 40 years ago by someone in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and rounds them off.</p>

40955,"<p>The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by<br /> physicists. The element, tentatively named Administratium, has no<br /> protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0.<br /> However it does have:</p>
<p>           1 neutron.<br />          125 assistant neutrons<br />           75 vice-neutrons<br />          111 assistant vice-neutrons</p>
<p>This gives it an atomic mass of 312. The 312 particles are held<br /> together  by a force that involves the continuous exchange of<br /> meson-like particles called morons.</p>
<p>Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert. However, it<br /> can be detected chemically as it impedes every action with which<br /> it comes in contact. According to the discoverers, a minute amount<br /> of Administratium causes one reaction to take four days to complete when it would have normally occurred in less than one second.</p>
<p>Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years,<br /> at which time it does not actually decay but instead undergoes a<br /> reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons, and<br /> assistant vice-neutrons exchange places. Some studies have shown<br /> that atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization.<br /> Research at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs<br /> naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as government agencies, large corporations, and universities, and can usually be found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.</p>
<p>Scientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how. Administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.</p>

<p>Then the airplane starts accelerating rapidly and people begin panicking.<br /> Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer<br /> and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and<br /> more hysterical.  </p>
<p>Finally, when the airplane has less than 20 feet of runway left, there is a<br /> sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once, and<br /> at the very last moment the airplane lifts off and is airborne.</p>
<p>Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and turns to<br /> the pilot: ""You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to<br /> scream, and we're gonna get killed!</p>

40979,"<p>An American automobile company and a Japanese auto company decided to have a competitive boat race on the Detroit River.  Both teams practiced hard and long to reach their peak performance.  On the big day, they were as ready as they could be.The Japanese team won by a mile.Afterwards, the American team became discouraged by the loss and their morale sagged.  Corporate management decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found.  A Continuous Measurable Improvement Team of ""Executives"" was set up to investigate the problem and to recommend appropriate corrective action.Their conclusion: The problem was that the Japanese team had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, whereas the American team had 1 person rowing and 8 people steering.  The American Corporate Steering Committee immediately hired a consulting firm to do a study on the management structure.After some time and billions of dollars, the consulting firm concluded that ""too many people were steering and not enough rowing.""  To prevent losing to the Japanese again next year, the management structure was changed to ""4 Steering Managers, 3 Area Steering Managers, and 1 Staff Steering Manager"" and a new performance system for the person rowing the boat to give more incentive to work harder and become a six sigma performer.  ""We must give him empowerment and enrichment.""  That ought to do it.The next year the Japanese team won by two miles.The American Corporation laid off the rower for poor performance, sold all of the paddles, cancelled all capital investments for new equipment, halted development of a new canoe, awarded high performance awards to the consulting firm, and distributed the money saved as bonuses to the senior executives.</p>
