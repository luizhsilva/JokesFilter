33011,"<p>Two Arabs boarded a shuttle out of Washington for New York. One<br /> sat in the window seat, the other in the middle seat. Just<br /> before take-off a fat, little Jewish guy got on and took the<br /> aisle seat next to the Arabs. He kicked off his shoes, wiggled<br /> his toes and was settling in when the Arab in the window seat<br /> said, ""I think I'll go up and get a Coke."" (Shuttle flights do<br /> not have cabin attendants, but you probably knew that.) ""No<br /> problem,"" said the Jew. ""I'll get it for you."" While he was gone<br /> the Arab picked up the Jew's shoe and spit in it.</p>
<p>The Jew brought back the coke, when the other Arab said, ""That<br /> looks good. Think I'll have one too."" Again, the Jew obligingly<br /> goes to fetch it, and while he is gone the Arab picks up the<br /> other shoe and spits in it.</p>
<p>The Jew returns with the coke, and they all sit back and enjoy<br /> the short flight. When the plane was landing the Jew slipped his<br /> feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened. ""How<br /> long must this go on?"" he asked. ""This enmity between our<br /> peoples ...this hatred...your spitting in my shoes and me<br /> pissing in your Coke?""</p>

33026,"<p>Dear Dad &amp; Mom,Our scoutmaster told us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 Sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we we're all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened.Oh yea! Please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search &amp; rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning. Scoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him.Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did, also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back.We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car.He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us.Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks.This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood.Scoutmaster Webb isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about us not wearing the life jackets.He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble.Guess what? We have all passed our first aid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken, he said they got sick that way with the food they ate in prison. I'm so glad he got out and become our scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he was doing his time.I have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine.Love, Your son, Cole-- Submitted by Angela Tuttle</p>

<p>""Well, I came down here this morning to surprise you with a big<br /> breakfast, but I can't cook or clean.""</p>

<p>So off they went to the bedroom.</p>

<p>""Well, the same thing as this morning. I came in here to make<br /> you something for lunch and I just can't cook.""</p>

33032,"<p>The following information was gained through much arduous research involving men and women from all backgrounds and walks of life. It consists of the most frequently asked questions of women (i.e. relationships, sex and life in general). All women who read this are encouraged to use the wisdom contained therein to change their behavior in accordance with the truths established below.</p>
<p>Q: How do I know if I'm ready for sex?<br /> A: Ask your boyfriend. He'll know when the time is right. When it comes to love and sex, men are much more responsible, since they're not as emotionally confused as women. It's a proven fact.</p>
<p>Q: Should I have sex on the first date?<br /> A: YES. Before if possible.</p>
<p>Q: What exactly happens during the act of sex?<br /> A: Again, this is entirely up to the man. The important thing to remember is that you must do whatever he tells you without question. Sometimes, however, he may ask you to do certain things that may at first seem strange to you. Do them anyway.</p>
<p>Q: How long should the sex act last?<br /> A: This is a natural &amp; normal part of nature, so don't feel ashamed or embarrassed. After you've finished making love, he'll have a natural desire to leave you suddenly, &amp; go out with his friends to play golf. Or perhaps another activity, such as going out with his friends to the bar for the purpose of consuming large amounts of alcohol &amp; sharing a few personal thoughts with his buddies. Don't feel left out - while he's gone you can busy yourself by doing laundry, cleaning the apartment, or perhaps even going out to buy him an expensive gift. He'll come back when he's ready.</p>
<p>Q: What is ""after play""?<br /> A: After a man has finished making love, he needs to replenish his manly energy. ""After play"" is simply a list of important activities for you to do after lovemaking. This includes lighting his cigarette, making him a sandwich or pizza, bringing him a few beers, or leaving him alone to sleep while you go out and buy him an expensive gift.</p>
<p>Q: Does the size of the penis matter?<br /> A: Yes. Although many women believe that quality, not quantity, is important, studies show this is simply not true. The average erect male penis measures about three inches. Anything longer than that is extremely rare and if by some chance your lover's sexual organ is 4 inches or over, you should go down on your knees and thank your lucky stars and do everything possible to please him, such as doing his laundry, cleaning his apartment and/or buying him an expensive gift.</p>
<p>Q: What about the female orgasm?<br /> A: What about it? There's no such thing. It's a myth!</p>

33033,"<p>A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The first of the twosome teed-off and watched in horror as the ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole. Indeed, the ball hit one of the men and he immediately clasped his hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in agony.</p>
<p>The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize.</p>
<p>""Please allow me to help, I'm a physiotherapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you'd just allow me!"", she told him earnestly.</p>
<p>""Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I'll be alright. I'll be fine in a few minutes"", he replied as he remained in the fetal position still clasping his hands together at his crotch.</p>
<p>The woman takes it upon herself to begin to ""ease his pain"". She began<br /> to massage his groin.</p>
<p>After a few moments she asked, ""Does that feel better?""</p>
<p>The man looked up at her and replied, ""Yes, that feels pretty good... but my thumb still hurts like hell!""</p>

33034,"<p>There was an elderly man who wanted to make his younger wife pregnant. So, he went to the doctor to have a sperm count done. </p>
<p>The doctor told him to take a specimen cup home, fill it, and bring it back the next day. </p>
<p>The elderly man came back the next day and the specimen cup was empty and the lid was on it. </p>
<p>Doctor: What was the problem? </p>
<p>Elderly man: Well, I tried with my right hand...nothing. So, I tried with my left hand...nothing. </p>
<p>My wife tried with her right hand... nothing. Her left hand...nothing. Her mouth...nothing. </p>
<p>Then my wife's friend tried. Right hand, left hand, mouth.... still nothing. </p>
<p>Doctor: Wait a minute. You mean your wife's friend too?! </p>
<p>Elderly man: Yeah, and we still couldn't get the lid off of the specimen cup.</p>

33036,"<p>Assembler programs are written with short abbreviations called MNEMONICS, in other words instead of writing GOTO, the programmer writes JMP or even BRA (branch).These instructions are frequently abbreviated into total incomprehensibility. Of course, we all know that abbreviations are arbitrary.  Anyone who has spent any time programming in assembler knows that all computers can be programmed using an undocumented set of instructions.  Frequently when an error is made writing a program in assembler a user can actually see the program executing the undocumented instructions. These instructions vary from machine from machine, but all computers have a certain set of them in common.  As a service to humanity, I am here revealing these common instructions for the first time.

33038,"<p>There was this small church country preacher who was known to take a swig<br /> or two of alcohol. One Sunday, he preached about Jesus turning water into<br /> wine. One of the members of the audience was a policeman. Later that week,<br /> that very policeman saw the preacher swerving in and out of his lane on<br /> the highway. The officer pulls him over and asks him if he has been<br /> drinking lately. The preacher guy says, ""Nah. I ain't bin drinkin'."" The<br /> policeman then spots a bottle in the back seat of his car. The policeman<br /> asks the preacher, ""What do you got in that bottle?"" The preacher replies,<br /> ""Oh that's jest water."" The policeman then grabs the bottle, sips it and<br /> says, ""Jeez man that's some strong stuff!"" The preacher then says,<br /> ""Damnit, God you proved your point a long time ago!""</p>

33039,"<p>An old hillbilly and his wife had never been more than 7 miles from their home in the East Tennesse Smokies. One day the man said to his wife, ""Honey, you know we're not getting any younger and I sure would like to take a vacation and stay in one of those fancy hotels in the city before I die.""</p>
<p>That sounded good to her so they started scrimping and saving. Four years later they had enough for them and their never-married adult son to go and spend 5 nights in a very posh hotel in the big city. They all piled into the man's old pickup and headed out.</p>
<p>When they got to the hotel the man said to his wife, ""Mama, you just wait in the truck. Junior and I will go in and be sure this is the right place.""</p>
<p>When they stepped into the lobby they both thought they had died and gone to heaven. There were indoor streams and water fountains, polished marble and gleaming brass everywhere. But the most amazing thing of all was the elevators. They stood there and watched the lights flash, the doors open and close and people getting on and off.</p>
<p>A stooped over little lady who was 90 if she was a day approached the elevators and pushed the ""Up"" arrow. The door opened and she got on. The door closed. The lights above the door flashed. They flashed some more and the door opened. The most stunning 24-year-old, green-eyed blonde you've ever seen stepped off and went into the lounge. The son looked at his dad.</p>
<p>The dad looked at his son for just a second and then said, ""Son, go git yer Ma.""</p>

33060,"<p>A woman desperately looking for work goes to the Tickle Me Elmo Factory. The Personnel Manager goes over her resume and explains to her that he regrets that he has no jobs worthy of her skills. The woman answers that she really needs work and will take almost anything.</p>
<p>The Personnel Manager hems and haws and finally says he does have a low skill job on the ""Tickle Me Elmo"" assembly line. The woman happily accepts. He takes her down to the line and explains her duties and that she should be in at 8:00 AM the next day. The next day at 8:45 there's a knock at the Personnel Manager's door. The ""Tickle Me Elmo"" Assembly Line manager comes in and starts ranting about the woman just hired. After listening to his screaming for 15 minutes about how badly backed up the assembly line is, the Personnel Manager suggested he show him the problem. Together they head down to the line and sure enough Elmos are backed up from here to Kingdom Come. Right at the end of the line is the woman he had hired. She has a roll of the material used for the Elmos and has a big bag of marbles. They both watch as she cuts a little piece of fabric and takes 2 marbles and starts sewing them between Elmo's legs. </p>
<p>The Personnel Manager starts laughing hysterically and finally after several minutes of rolling laughter he pulls himself together and walks over to the new employee and says: ""I'm sorry I guess you misunderstood me yesterday. What I wanted you to do was give Elmo two test tickles.""</p>

<p>It has now been three months since I left for college.I have been remiss in<br /> writing this and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written<br /> before. I will bring you up to date now, but, before you read on,please sit<br /> down.<br /> YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN OKAY!<br /> Well then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the<br /> concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught<br /> fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I only get those sick<br /> headaches once a day.<br /> Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump were witnessed by an<br /> attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the<br /> fire department and the ambulance.<br /> He also visited me at the hospital and, since I had nowhere to live because of<br /> the burned out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment<br /> with him. It's really a basement room, but it's kind of cute. He is a very fine<br /> boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to be married.<br /> We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy<br /> begins to show.<br /> Yes, Mom and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward to<br /> being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the love,<br /> devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.<br /> The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor<br /> infection which prevents us from passing our pre-marital blood tests, and I<br /> carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin<br /> injections I am having daily. I know you will welcome him into our family with<br /> open arms. He is kind and, although not well educated, he is ambitious.<br /> Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know your<br /> often expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that<br /> his skin colour is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I<br /> do. His family background is good too, for I am told that his father is an<br /> important gun-bearer in the village in Africa from which he came.</p>
<p>Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no<br /> dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture. I was not in<br /> the hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged. I do not have syphilis and<br /> there is no man (of any colour) in my life. However, I am getting a 'D' in<br /> History and an 'F' in Science and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper<br /> perspective.</p>
<p>Yours,<br /> Your Loving Daughter.</p>

Soon, a wee baby boy was brought into the world.""Whoa there Scotty!"" said the doctor. ""Don't be in a rush to put the lantern down... I think there's yet another wee one to come."" Sure enough, within minutes he had delivered another little baby.""No, no, don't be in a great hurry to be putting down that lantern, young man... It seems there's yet another one besides!"" cried the doctor.The new father scratched his head in bewilderment, and asked the doctor: ""Do ya think it's the light that's attractin' them?""</p>

33065,"<p>Bar Joke</p>
<p>Two builders (Dave and Stuart) are seated either side of a table in a rough pub when a well-dressed man enters, orders a beer and sits on a stool at the bar The two builders start to speculate about the occupation of the suit</p>
<p>Dave: - I reckon he's an accountant.</p>
<p>Stuart: - No way - he's a stockbroker.</p>
<p>Dave: - He ain't no stockbroker! A stockbroker wouldn't come in<br /> here!</p>
<p>The argument repeats itself until they are all drunk. Dave goes to the toilet.</p>
<p>On entering the toilet he sees that the suit is standing at a urinal.<br /> Curiosity and the several beers get the better of the builder .<br /> &gt;&gt;<br /> Dave: - 'Scuse me.... no offence meant, but me and me mate were wondering what you do for a living?</p>
<p>Suit: - No offence taken! I'm a Logical Scientist by profession</p>
<p>Dave: - Oh! What's that then?</p>
<p>Suit: - I'll try to explain by example ... Do you have a goldfish at home?</p>
<p>Dave: - Er... mmm... well yeah, I do as it happens!</p>
<p>Suit: - Well, it's logical to follow that you keep it in a bowl or in a pond. Which is it?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Dave: - It's in a pond!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Suit: - Well it's reasonable to suppose that you have a large garden then?</p>
<p>Dave: - As it happens, yes I have got a big garden.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Suit: - Well then it's logical to assume that in this town if you have a large garden then you have a large house?</p>
<p>Dave: - As it happens I've got a five bedroom house ..... built it myself!</p>
<p>Suit: - Well given that you've built a five bedroom house it is logical to assume that you haven't built it just for yourself and that you are quite probably married?<br /> Dave: - Yes I am married, I live with my wife and four children.</p>
<p>Suit: - Well then it is logical to assume that you are sexually active with your wife on a regular basis?</p>
<p>Dave: - Yep! Five times a week!</p>
<p>Suit: - Well then it is logical to suggest that you do not masturbate (wank) very often?</p>
<p>Dave: - Do what? Not me mate!</p>
<p>Suit: - Well there you are! That's logical science at work!</p>
<p>Dave: - How's that then?</p>
<p>Suit: - Well from finding out that you had a goldfish, I've told you about your sex life!</p>
<p>Dave: - I see! That's pretty impressive ... thanks mate!</p>
<p>Both leave the toilet and Dave returns to his mate.</p>
<p>Stuart: - I see the suit was in there. Did you ask him what he does?</p>
<p>Dave: - Yep! He's a logical scientist!</p>
<p>Stuart: - What's that then?</p>
<p>Dave: - I'll try and explain. Do you have a goldfish?</p>
<p>Stuart: - Nope</p>
<p>Dave: - Well then, you're a wanker.</p>

33069,"<p>A blonde went to a flight school insisting she wanted to learn to fly that day. As all the planes were currently in use, the owner agreed to instruct her on how to pilot the helicopter solo by radio. He took her out, showed her how to start it and gave her the basics, and sent her on her way. After she climbed 1000 feet, she radioed in. </p>
<p>""I'm doing great! I love it! The view is so beautiful, and I'm starting to get the hang of this."" </p>
<p>After 2000 feet, she radioed again, saying how easy it was becoming to fly. The instructor watched her climb over 3000 feet, and was beginning to worry that she hadn't radioed in. A few minutes later, he watched in horror as she crashed about half a mile away. </p>
<p>He ran over and pulled her from the wreckage. </p>

33080,"<p>One guy's story... I was riding to work yesterday when I observed a female driver cut right in front of a pickup truck, causing him to have to drive on the shoulder. This evidently pissed the driver off enough that he hung out his window and flipped the woman off. ""Man, that guy is stupid"" I thought to myself. I ALWAYS smile nicely and wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything stupid to me or near me in traffic; and here's why... I drive 38 miles each way, every day, to work. That's 76 miles, of which 16 each way is bumper-to-bumper. Most of the bumper-to-bumper is on an 8 lane highway. So, if you just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass something like a new car every 40 feet per lane. That's 7 cars every 40 feet for just the 32 miles that traffic is bumper to bumper. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars, plus the rest of my 34 mile commute which is not bumper-to-bumper, where I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass every day. Statistically half of these are driven by females, that's 18,000. In any given group of females, 1 in 28 are having the worst day of their period. . . . That is 642. According to Cosmopolitan, 70% describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding, that's 449. According to the National Institute of Health, 22% of all females have seriously considered suicide or homicide, that's 98. And, 34% describe men as their biggest problem, that's 33. According to the National Rifle Association, 5% of all females carry weapons, and the number is increasing. That means, that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one female that has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, is having the worst day of her period, and is armed. No matter what she does in traffic, I wouldn't DREAM of flipping her off.</p>

33112,"<p>After having their 11th child, an Alabama couple decided that was enough. So the husband went to his doctor and told him that he and his wife/cousin did not want to have any more children.The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. The doctor instructed him to go home, get a cherry bomb (big firework), light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.The Alabamian said to the doctor, 'I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me.'So the couple drove across the state border into Georgia to get a second opinion. The Georgia physician was just about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed that they were from Alabama. The doctor instead told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it, place it in a beer can, hold it to his ear and count to 10.Figuring that both learned physicians couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count '1, 2, 3, 4, 5...' at which point he paused, placed the beer can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand.</p>

<p>""Well, I'll let you in on a little trick,"" said Tracy. ""What I do is, before I go out, I take a rubber band and stick it up my self. Then when I get a bloke back to my flat and he starts doing the business, it goes ping. I tell him he's just broken my virginity. I usually get an extra $20 for that!""</p>
<p>""I'll give that a try,"" says Sharon.</p>
<p>She does and it works just fine. Unfortunately, one day as she was getting ready, she found that the bag of rubber bands was empty. She searched around, but all she could find was a catapult. She carfully inserted the catapult and set off for work. Having returned with a fella, Sharon spread them and as the bloke got going there was the usual ping.</p>

33207,"<p>There was a man that owned a giant gorilla and, all its life, he'd never left it on its own. But eventually he had to go on a business trip and had to leave his gorilla in the care of his next-door neighbor. So he explained to his neighbor that all he had to do was feed his gorilla three bananas a day at three, six and nine o'clock.  But he was never ever, ever to touch its fur.  So the next day the man came and gave the gorilla a banana and looked at it for a while thinking, �Why can't I touch its fur?� as their didnt seem to be anything wrong with it.  Every day he came in and looked for a little while longer as he still couldnt understand until, about a week later, he'd worked himself into a frenzy and decided that he was going to touch the gorilla. He passed it the banana and very gently brushed the back of his hand against its fur.  Suddenly the gorilla went ape shit and started to jump around, then it turned and began to running towards the man who, in turn, ran through the front door, over the lawn, across the street, into some one else's sports car and drove off. In the rear-veiw mirror, he could see the gorilla in its own sports car, driving right behing him. He drove for two hours until the engine began to splutter and the car just stopped. He jumped out and began to run down the street, over a brick wall, into someone's front garden and up the apple tree.He turned around to find the gorilla right behind him beating its chest. The man jumped down and ran back in to the street screaming, until it became dark and he thought he'd lost the gorilla. The man ran into an alleyway then, suddenly, he saw a giant shaddow coming down the street ahead. The gorilla! It came to the end of the alley, stood and looked striaght into the bloodshoot eyes of the man and came towards him slowly. This time there was no escape. As the gorilla neared him, the man began to feel faint. The giant beast came face to face with him,  raised its mighty hand and said, �Tag! You're it!�</p>

33215,"<p>One evening a family brings their frail, elderly mother to a nursing home and leaves her, hoping she will be well cared for. The next morning, the nurses bathe her, feed her a tasty breakfast, and set her in a chair at a window overlooking a lovely flower garden. She seems OK, but after a while she slowly starts to fall over sideways in her chair. Two attentive nurses immediately rush up to catch her and straighten her up. Again she seems OK, but after a while she starts to tilt to the other side. The nurses rush back and once more bring her back upright. This goes on all morning. Later the family arrives to see how the old woman is adjusting to her new home. ''So Ma, how is it here? Are they treating you all right?'' They ask. ''It's pretty nice,'' she replies. ''Except they won't let you fart''</p>

"
33222,"<p>1.  Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play - normally one club and two balls.</p>
<p>2.  Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.</p>
<p>3.  Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out of the hole.</p>
<p>4.  For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.  Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.</p>
<p>5.  Course owners reserve the right to restrict the length of the club to avoid damage to the hole.</p>
<p>6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is satisfied that play is complete.  Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.</p>
<p>7.  It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course.  The experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course, with special attention to well formed bunkers.</p>
<p>8.  Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played or are currently playing to the owner of the course being played.  Upset course owners have been known to damage a players equipment for this reason.</p>
<p>9.  Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear.</p>
<p>10.  Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time.  Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else playing what they consider to be a private course.</p>
<p>11.  Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times.  Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair.  Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation.  More advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the case.</p>
<p>12.  Players are advised to obtain the course owners permission before attempting to play the back nine.</p>
<p>13.  Slow play is encouraged; however, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owners request.</p>
<p>14.  It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.</p>
<p>15.  The course owner will be the sole judge of who is the best player.</p>
<p>16.  Players are advised to think twice before considering membership at a given course.  Additional assessments may be levied by the course owner and the rules are subject to change.</p>

<p>They sat on the curb brainstorming the solution, when suddenly one of them jumped up and declared, ""I know! Lets get baptized!""</p>
<p>Well, both boys had seen enough to know that you can get wet at a baptism, so they trotted on down to the church on the corner and told the pastor they wanted to get baptized. </p>
<p>The irritated pastor finally relented after about 10 minutes of begging, and he finally dragged the boys to the men's room and dunked them both head first into the toilet, then sent them on their way.</p>

<p>""�Ninguna visi�n, cabr�n, del meritito cielo vengo, y con esta verga que tengo, te voy a dejar panz�n!""</p>
<p>Los dos se enfrentan en cruenta batalla, donde surgen cocolazos, fregadazos y guamazos. Al final, el diablo todo madreado, le dice al arc�ngel:</p>
<p>""�Venciste, Miguel, venciste! Guarda ya tu larga espada; ahora s� que me venciste y me voy a la chingada.""</p>
<p>Entre porras y rechiflas se cierra el tel�n. Si esta obra te gust�, r�ete no seas cabr�n. Y si despu�s de la o�da no te gust� la puntada... como dice San Miguel:</p>
<p>""�Vete mucho a la chingada!""</p>

33255,"<p>A Programmer and an Engineer were sitting next to each other on an air plane. </p>
<p>The Programmer leans over to the Engineer and asks if he wants to play a fun game. </p>
<p>The Engineer just wants to sleep so he politely declines, turns away and tries to sleep. </p>
<p>The Programmer persists and explains that it's a real easy game. He explains,""I ask a question and if you don't know the answer you pay me $5. Then you ask a question and if I don't know the answer I'll pay you $5."" </p>
<p>Again the Engineer politely declines and tries to sleep. </p>
<p>The Programmer, now somewhat agitated, says, ""O.K., if you don't know the answer you pay me $5 and if I don't know the answer I pay you $50! ""<br /> Now, that got the Engineer's attention, so he agrees to the game. </p>
<p>The Programmer asks the first question, ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" </p>
<p>Then Engineer doesn't say a word and just hands the Programmer $5. </p>
<p>Now, its the Engineer's turn. He asks the Programmer,""What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down on four?"" </p>
<p>The Programmer looks at him with a puzzled look, takes out his laptop computer, looks through all his references and after about an hour wakes the Engineer and hands the Engineer $50. </p>
<p>The Engineer politely takes the $50 turns away and tries to return to sleep. </p>
<p>The Programmer, a little miffed, asks, ""Well what's the answer to the question?"" </p>
<p>Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands $5 to the Programmer, turns away and returns to sleep</p>

<p>So the Army General took them to his base, went out to the Rifle Range and, finding a soldier, ordered him, ""Son, run out there in the middle of all that weapons fire and fetch me a white rock.""</p>
<p>The soldier complied.</p>
<p>The General turned to his friends and stated, ""Now, that's balls.""</p>
<p>The Marine General took them to just outside his base, found a young Fire Eater and told him, ""Marine, see that Biker Bar across the street? Go in there and tell them they're all a bunch of a-hole, un-American sissies who couldn't fight their way out of a whore house.""</p>
<p>The Marine complied, got his ass kicked, and came back out.</p>
<p>""That's balls,"" said the General.</p>
<p>The Admiral smirked a bit and took them to the Naval Base. Stopping at a pier, he got out, grabbed a bullhorn and shouted to a young Seaman who was painting the mast, 50 feet above the deck. ""Hey Sailor, I want you to swan dive your sorry ass off that mast down here to me....that's an order.""</p>

<p>Dear Tech Support:<br /> Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and<br /> noticed that the new program began making unexpected changes to<br /> the accounting modules, limiting access to flower and jewellery<br /> applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.<br /> In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable<br /> programs, such as Romance 9.9 but installed undesirable programs<br /> such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and<br /> HouseCleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system.<br /> I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no<br /> avail.<br /> --Desperate<br /> ***<br /> Dear Desperate,<br /> Keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while<br /> Husband 1.0is an operating system.<br /> Try to enter the command: C:/ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and install<br /> Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the<br /> applications: Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse<br /> can cause Husband 1.0 to default to GrumpySilence 2.5, Happyhour<br /> 7.0 or Beer 6.1.<br /> Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create ""Snoring Loudly""<br /> wave files. DO NOT install MotherInLaw 1.0 or reinstall another<br /> Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will<br /> crash Husband 1.0<br /> In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have<br /> limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly.<br /> Consider buying additional software to improve performance. I<br /> personally recommend HotFood 3.0 and Lingerie 5.3.<br /> Good Luck!<br /> Tech Support</p>

Now think about it and let me know tomorrow if that makes any sense."" That night the little boy wakes up to his baby brother crying.  He goes into his room and sees that his brother has taken the biggest crap ever in his diaper.  So he goes to his parents room where he finds his mom fast asleep.  He then goes to maids' room but it's locked.  He peeks through the keyhole and sees his dad having sex with the maid.  So the little boy changes the diaper himself and goes back to bed. The next morning the little boy tells his father, ""I think I figured out Politics.""  The father says, ""Great, let me hear it in your own words."" The boy says, ""Well, the President is screwing the working class while the Government is asleep.  The People have to do everything themselves and the future is in deep shit.""</p>

33279,"<p>DINING OUT</p>
<p>1. When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup, and pour slowly so as not to ""bruise"" the fruit of the vine. </p>
<p>2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your fingers covering the label. </p>
<p>ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME </p>
<p>1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist. </p>
<p>2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table...no matter how good his manners are.</p>
<p>PERSONAL HYGIENE</p>
<p>1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys. </p>
<p>2. Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days. However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of good money. </p>
<p>3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods. </p>
<p>DATING (Outside the Family) </p>
<p>1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date. </p>
<p>2. Be aggressive. Let her know you're interested: ""I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago."" </p>
<p>3. Establish with her parents what time she is expected back. Some will say 10:00 PM; Others might say ""Monday."" If the latter is the answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time. </p>
<p>THEATER ETIQUETTE </p>
<p>1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately after the movie has ended. </p>
<p>2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven they can't hear you. </p>
<p>WEDDINGS </p>
<p>1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift. </p>
<p>2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot. </p>
<p>3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance. </p>
<p>4. Though uncomfortable, say ""yes"" to socks and shoes for this special occasion. </p>
<p>DRIVING ETIQUETTE </p>
<p>1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles; Even if the gun is loaded, and the deer is in sight. </p>
<p>2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires always has the right of way. </p>
<p>3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape. </p>
<p>4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer. </p>

33300,"<p>The animals were bored. Finally, the lion had an idea. ""I know a really exciting game that the humans play called football. I've seen it on T.V.""</p>
<p>He proceeded to describe it to the rest of the animals and they all got excited about it so they decided to play. They went out to the field and chose up teams and were ready to begin.</p>
<p>The lion's team received. They were able to get two first downs and then had to punt. The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick. He caught the ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two rabbits. He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to daylight, scoring six.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0.</p>
<p>Late in the first half the lion's team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked the extra point. The lion's team led at halftime 7 - 6. In the locker room, the lion gave a peptalk.</p>
<p>""Look you guys. We can win this game. We've got the lead and they only have one real threat. We've got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he's a killer. Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino.""</p>
<p>The second half began. Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino's team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino. Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running. First, he stomped two gazelles. He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way. It looked like he was home free. Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead. There were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened. Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede.</p>
<p>""Did you do this?"" he asked the centipede.</p>
<p>""Yeah, I did."" the centipede replied.</p>
<p>The lion retorted, ""Where were you during the first half?""</p>
<p>""I was putting on my shoes.""</p>

<p>A few clowns short of a circus. A few fries short of a happy meal. The wheel's spinning, but the hamster's dead. All foam, no beer. The butter has slipped off his pancake. The cheese slid off his cracker. Body by Fisher, brains by Mattel. Warning: Objects in mirror are dumber than they appear. Couldn't pour water out of a boot with instructions on the heel. He fell out of the stupid tree and hit every branch on the way down. As smart as bait. Doesn't have all his dogs on one leash. Her sewing machine's out of thread. One fruit loop shy of a full bowl. Her antenna doesn't pick up all the channels. His belt doesn't go through all the loops. Proof that evolution CAN go in reverse. Receiver is off the hook. Not wired to code. Skylight leaks a little. Her slinky's kinked. Too much yardage between the goal posts. Got a full 6-pack, but lacks the plastic thingy to hold them together. A photographic memory, but the lens cover is on. During evolution his ancestors were in the control group. Gates are down, the lights are flashing, but the train isn't coming. Is so dense, light bends around her.

Girls are pretty, but yours is the Prettiest!<br /> 5. You don't have PMS; don't act like you know what it's like.<br /> 6. Saying something sweet might get you off the hook; doing<br />    something sweet will always get you off the hook.<br /> 7. If you talk about having a big Dick; we know you don't.<br /> 8. Size does matter, but only to hoes; not girls that want<br />    relationships.<br /> 9. We don't like it when you act like Mr. Big.<br /> 10. A system in your car only impresses your homeboys not us.<br /> 11. No matter what you say, your ex-girlfriend is a hoe.<br /> 12. It's good to be sensitive, sometimes.<br /> 13. If you did something wrong or even if you didn't, apologize.<br /> 14. Be spontaneous; dinner and a movie won't always cut it.<br /> 15. We are self-conscious by nature; we can't help it.<br /> 16. We are DrAmA queens.<br /> 17. Fashion police do exist.<br /> 18. Don't ask us to give head; if you are nice you just might<br />     get it.<br /> 19. We absolutely DO NOT care about monster trucks, car systems,<br />     paintball, or anything else you and your friends talk about.<br /> 20. Hugs and kisses must be given at all times.<br /> 21. We don't shave our legs everyday so get over it.<br /> 22. Don't make bets about us; we always find out.<br /> 23. Shave; no matter how cool you think your goatee or beard or<br />     mustache looks, we hate it.<br /> 24. Even if you think it is cool to burp, fart, or emitt other<br />     strange gases from your body, it is not.<br /> 25. Don't compare our breasts with Pamela Anderson's; hers are<br />     fake, just remember that. (You have a better shot at ours<br />     than you ever will with hers)<br /> 26. It is not cool to shoot snot rockets.<br /> 27. We are beautiful at all times.<br /> 28. We will always think we are fat, so humor us and tell us we<br />     aren't.<br /> 29. You can shoot hoops, score a goal, knock down big fat guys,<br />     and hit a little baseball with a stick, so why the hell can't<br />     you piss in the toilet and not on it.<br /> 30.

One night, Claire invites some of her friends over for dinner, but John is really horny and doesn't want to have to entertain their guests. </p>

None worked. Then, one day, he was reading the Washington Post when he noticed a small ad that read: Lose weight Only $1.00 a pound Call (202) 555-0238 The man decided to give it a try and called the number. </p>
<p>A voice on the other end asked, ""How much weight do you want to lose?"" </p>
<p>The man responded, ""Ten pounds."" </p>
<p>The voice replied, ""Very well, give me your credit card number and we'll have a representative over to your house in the morning."" </p>
<p>About 9:00 am the next morning the man gets a knock on the door. There stood a beautiful redhead, completely naked except for a sign around her neck stating, ""If you catch me, you can have me."" </p>
<p>Well, the hefty fellow chased her upstairs, downstairs, over sofas, through the kitchen, all around the house. Finally, panting and wheezing like a dog, he did catch her. When he was through enjoying himself, she said, ""Quick, go into the bathroom and weigh yourself."" </p>
<p>He did just that and was amazed to find that he had lost ten pounds, right to the ounce! That evening he called the number again. The voice on the other end asked, ""How much weight do you want to lose?""--to which the somewhat-less-overweight man replied, ""Twenty pounds."" </p>
<p>""Very well,"" the voice on the phone told him, ""Give me your credit card number and we'll have a representative over to your house in the morning."" </p>
<p>At about 8:00 am the next morning the man receives a knock on the door. When he opens the door he sees a beautiful blonde dressed only in track shoes and a sign around her neck stating, ""If you catch me, you can have me."" The chase took a good while longer this time and the man nearly passed out, but he finally did catch her. When he was through she told him, ""Quick, run into the bathroom and weigh yourself."" He ran to the bathroom and found he had lost another 20 pounds! ""This is fantastic!"" he thought to himself. </p>
<p>Later that evening he called the number again and the voice at the other end asked, ""How much weight do you want to lose?"" ""Fifty pounds!"" the man exclaimed. ""Fifty pounds?"" the voice asked, ""That's an awful lot of weight to lose at one time."" The man replied, ""Listen buddy, here's my credit card number, you just have your representative over here in the morning!"" and he hung up the phone. About 6:00 am the next morning the man gets out of bed, splashes on some cologne and gets all ready for the next representative. At about 7:00 am he gets a knock on the door. </p>

""I AM GOD"" I<br /> have heard your prayers and I will answer them BUT ... first you must<br /> have sex with me.

<p>I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theatre of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.</p>
<p>Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.</p>
<p>When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to: </p>
<p>M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc. Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3x5 card reading, ""Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.""</p>

<p>The bartendar just frowns and says, ""Look buddy, we can't have any dogs sitting up at the bar.""</p>
<p>The owner retorts, ""But this is no ordinary dog."" The bartendar doesn't budge from his stance and tells the guy to leave.</p>
<p>The owner protests, ""Look, this is no ordinary dog. This is a talking dog.""</p>
<p>The bartendar says, ""Yeah right buddy.<br /> Okay, why don't you and your talking dog leave the bar?""</p>
<p>The owner says, ""Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll go into the bathroom and take a leak. You can talk to my dog while I go. If you still want us to leave when I get back, we will.""</p>
<p>So the owner leaves. And the dog and the bartendar start talking it up like they are long lost friends. The bartendar starts to really like this dog. There talking about sports and beer and women. </p>
<p>So the bartendar comes up with an idea. He turns to the dog and says, ""Look, I have a friend who owns the bar across the street. If I give you $20 will you go into the bar and order a beer from him?""<br /> The dog says, ""No problem"", and gets up and leaves.</p>
<p>The owner comes back and ask where his dog is. The bartenday explains about the joke. So the owner leaves to get his dog. </p>
<p>Right out of the bar, the owner sees his dog humping another lady dog. And the owner says, ""Hey, get off of her. Why have I never seen you doing this before?""<br /> To which the dog replies, ""Because I have never had $20 before.""</p>

<p>She agreed to spend the night with him, but said he would have to pay her the same hundred dollars that the other customers did. He scratched his head, considered it, and then asked, ""Don't I even get my agent's ten percent as a deduction?"" </p>

The bartender pours the drink, but said, ""Now, before I give you this, why don't you let off a little steam and tell me WHY you're so upset?""So the man begins his tale: ""Well, I am a salesman for this fancy goose pillows. I got an order and took several samples to an apartment in this neighbourhood. I knock on the door and this woman opens the door. Now, the lady can't make up her mind, so she asks me to take the samples to the bedroom and check them there. As I get into the bedroom I hear some keys jingling, and SOMEONE starts fumbling with the door.""""Well, the woman says, 'Oh my god, it's my BOYFRIEND. He must have lost his WRESTLING match today, he's gonna be REAL MAD! He won't believe that you are just a salesman. Quick, HIDE!'""""So, I opened at the CLOSET, but I figured that was probably the FIRST place he would look, so I didn't hide there. Then I looked under the bed, but no, I figured he's bound to look there, too. By now I could hear the key in the lock. I noticed the window was open, so I climbed out and was hanging there by my FINGERS praying that the guy WOULDN'T see me.""The bartender says ""Well I can see how you might be a BIT FRUSTRATED at this point.""""Well, yeah, but I hear the guy finally get the door open and he yells out, 'Tell me, who you been seeing now?'""""The girl said, 'Nobody, honey, now have a glass of water and calm down.' Well the guy starts TEARING up the room. I hear him tear the door off the closet and throw it across the room. I'm thinking, 'Boy, I'm glad I didn't hide in there.' Then I hear him lift up the bed and throw it across the room. Good thing I didn't hide under there either.""""Then I heard him say, 'What's that over there by the WINDOW?' I think 'Oh boy, I'm dead meat now'. But the woman by now is trying real hard to distract him and convince him to stop looking.""""Well, I hear the guy go into the bathroom, and I hear water running for a long time, and I figure maybe he's gonna take a bath or something, when all of a sudden the guy pours a pitcher of scalding HOT WATER out of the window right on top of my head! I mean look at this, I got second degree burns all over my scalp and shoulders!""The bartender said, ""Oh man, that would have pissed me off for SURE."" ""No,"" the customer replied, ""that didn't really BOTHER me. Next the guy starts slamming the window shut over and over on my hands. I mean, look at my fingers. They're a bloody mess, I can hardly hold onto this glass.""The bartender looks at the guy's hands and agreed, ""Yeah, buddy, I can understand why you are so UPSET.""""No, that WASN'T what really pissed me off.""

33453,"<p>In college, I used to DJ at my fraternity's parties. I would sit<br /> in the corner with the sound system, a microphone and a stack of<br /> cold beers. Since I didn't trust anyone with my CD's and the<br /> fact that girls would dance on a platform directly over my head,<br /> I found it increasingly difficult to leave the DJ booth. I<br /> eventually became so attached to that spot that I didn't even<br /> leave to pee. I would just duck down and drain my main vein into<br /> a plastic cup. Sometimes girls would come to the booth to make<br /> requests, and I would poke my head up to talk to them while I<br /> was doing the deed below.</p>
<p>After one particularly long leak, I managed to fill up three<br /> cups with warm fluid. I set them on the windowsill and continued<br /> to party.

They promise him they wouldnt and he says that they can stay in the barn but if he caught them he would shoot them. Later that night the daughter crept out to the barn, and the farmer caught them fooling around. He said now im gunna shoot yas well the 3 guys pleaded with him because the daughter came out to the barn eventually the farmer gave in, he said to them go out to my orchirds and pick 100 of your favourite fruit. They did as they were told. The first guy, Bob, came back and he had picked 100 green seedless grapes. In another room the farmer made him shove them up his ass. Bob left the room feeling a little bit green himself, but did not tell the other guys what was in store for them.<br /> The second guy, John, walked in he had picked 100 red seeded grapes. The farmer made him shove them up his ass. At around 75 grapes, John laughed so hard he shitted about 30 out. The farmer told him to get on with it but again at 90 he shit about 20 out.

Robert says,<br /> ""Well I'm having a hard time taking a crap and I have tried<br /> everything and I don't know what else to do."" The nurse says,<br /> ""Well you're in the right place. We'll take care of you."" The<br /> doctor comes in and asks him as well, ""So, what's the problem?""<br /> Robert says, ""I can't take a crap. I need help."" ""Well we will<br /> take care of this!! Nurse, prepare for a enema."" Says the<br /> doctor. The doctor leaves and the nurse prepares to get things<br /> together. The nurse says to Robert, ""Now sir you need to lay on<br /> your side and relax while I insert this. It will be a little<br /> cold at first."" Robert prepares for the cold shock by holding on<br /> to the side rail.</p>
<p>Making faces and moaning he begins to tell the nurse, ""What the<br /> hell are you doing down there!!"" ""We're just about finished,""<br /> said the nurse, ""But now I have to tell you that you'll need to<br /> hold this in as much as you can. I have to run and get a bed pan<br /> for you. If you go before I come back I'll get in trouble<br /> because the doctor does not like it for us to leave. But someone<br /> forgot to leave a clean bedpan in here. I'll be right back."" The<br /> nurse said. While she was gone Robert kept his butt cheeks very<br /> tight trying to hold it in, wondering where the nurse is, he<br /> begun to squirm and roll around, and then all of a sudden he LET<br /> GO and crapped all over the bed and himself. It was a mess!!<br /> Remembering what the nurse said he rushed to clean it up and<br /> taking the soiled bedclothes and gown off and wondering where to<br /> hide it. </p>
<p>Hearing the nurse coming closer he threw them out the window!<br /> But while he was throwing them out the window a poor old man was<br /> taking a very nice walk, and all of a sudden the soiled<br /> bedclothes landed on him. He screamed and ran back home with<br /> crap all over him. He rushes into his home. His wife ran to him<br /> and asked him, ""What the hell happened to you?!"" The husband says<br /> to her, ""I don't know but I think I just beat the crap out of a<br /> ghost!!""</p>

After the burial, the wife went straight to the local bar and began to party as if there was no tomorrow. Her neighbors approached in a group to ask if she wasn't worried about this man who practiced black magic and swore he would dig his out of the grave to come back and haunt her for the rest of her life?</p>

33494,"<p>With Viagra such a hit, Pfizer is bringing forth a whole line of<br /> drugs oriented toward improving the performance of men in<br /> today's society. Here's a list of what's on the drawing board: </p>
<p>DIRECTRA: A dose of this drug given to men before leaving on car<br /> trips caused 72 percent of them to stop to ask directions when<br /> they got lost, compared to 0.2 percent of a control group. </p>
<p>PROJECTRA: Men given this experimental new drug were far more<br /> likely to actually finish a household repair project before<br /> starting a new one. </p>
<p>CHILDAGRA: Men taking this drug reported a sudden, overwhelming<br /> urge to perform more child care tasks - especially cleaning up<br /> spills and ""little accidents."" </p>
<p>COMPLIMENTRA: In clinical trials, 82 percent of middle-aged men<br /> who were given this drug noticed that their wives had a new<br /> hairstyle. It is currently being tested to see if its effects<br /> extend to noticing new clothing. </p>
<p>BUYAGRA: Married and otherwise attached men reported a sudden<br /> urge to buy their sweethearts expensive jewelry and gifts after<br /> taking this drug for only two days. Still to be seen: Whether<br /> the drug can be continued for a period longer than your favorite<br /> store's return period. </p>
<p>NEGA-VIAGRA: Has the opposite effect of Viagra. Currently<br /> undergoing clinical trials on sitting U.S. Presidents. </p>
<p>NEGA-SPORTAGRA: This drug had the strange effect of making men<br /> want to turn off televised sports and actually converse with<br /> other family members. </p>
<p>FLATULAGRA: This complex drug converts men's noxious intestinal<br /> gases back into food solids. Special bonus: Dosage can be<br /> doubled for long car rides. </p>
<p>FLYAGRA: This drug has been showing great promise in treating<br /> men with O.F.D. (Open Fly disorder). Especially useful for men<br /> on Viagra. </p>
<p>PRYAGRA: About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men in<br /> the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal<br /> affairs of other people. Note: Apparent overdose turned three<br /> test subjects into ""special prosecutors."" </p>
<p>LIAGRA: This drug causes men to be less than truthful when being<br /> asked about their sexual affairs. Will be available in Regular,<br /> Grand Jury, and Presidential Strength versions.</p>

"
33497,"<p>1 star hangover</p>
<p>No pain. no real feeling of illness. You slept in your own bed and when<br /> you  woke up there were no traffic cones in there with you.</p>
<p>You are still able to function relatively well on the energy stored up<br /> from all those vodka redbulls.</p>
<p>However, you can drink 10 bottles of water and still feel as parched as<br /> the Sahara.</p>
<p>Even vegetarians are craving a Cheeseburger and a bag of fries.</p>
<p>2 star hangover</p>
<p>No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you<br /> have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler.</p>
<p>The coffee you hug to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your<br /> rumbling gut, which is craving a full English breakfast.</p>
<p>Although you have a nice demeanour about the office, you are costing<br /> your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is some<br /> light filing, followed by aimlessly surfing the net and writing junk<br /> e-mails.</p>
<p>3 star hangover</p>
<p>Slight headache. stomach feels crap. You are definitely a space cadet<br /> and not so productive.</p>
<p>Anytime a girl or lad walks by you gag because the perfume/aftershave<br /> reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends<br /> after the bouncer kicked you out at 1:45 am.</p>
<p>Life would be better right now if you were in your bed with a dozen<br /> doughnuts and a litre of coke watching daytime TV.</p>
<p>You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 2 Sausage Rolls and a<br /> litre of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.</p>
<p>4 star hangover</p>
<p>You have lost the will to live. Your head is throbbing and you can't<br /> speak too quickly or else you might spew.</p>
<p>Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a<br /> lecture for reeking of booze.</p>
<p>You wore nice clothes, but you smell of socks, and you can't hide the<br /> fact that you either missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving or it looks<br /> like you put your make-up on while riding the dodgems (depending on your<br /> gender).</p>
<p>Your teeth have their own individual sweaters. Your eyes look like one<br /> big vein and your hairstyle makes you look like a reject from a<br /> second-grade class circa 1976.</p>
<p>You would give a weeks pay for one of the following - home time, a<br /> doughnut and somewhere to be alone, or a Time Machine so you could go<br /> back and NOT have gone out the night before.</p>
<p>You scare small children in the street just by walking past them.</p>
<p>5 star hangover</p>
<p>You have a second heartbeat in your head, which is actually annoying the<br /> employee who sits next to you.</p>
<p>Vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy.</p>
<p>You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from<br /> brushing your teeth.</p>
<p>Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is<br /> suffocating you.</p>
<p>You'd cry but that would take the last drop of moisture left in your<br /> body.</p>
<p>Death seems pretty good right now. Your boss doesn't even get mad at you<br /> and your co-workers think that your dog just died because you look so<br /> pathetic.</p>
<p>You should have called in sick because, let's face it, all you can<br /> manage to do is breathe ..... very gently.</p>
<p>6 star hangover</p>
<p>You arrive home and climb into bed.</p>
<p>Sleep comes instantly, as you were fighting it all the way home in the<br /> taxi.</p>
<p>You get about 2 hours sleep until the noises inside your head wake you<br /> up.</p>
<p>You notice that your bed has been cleared for take off and is flying<br /> relentlessly around the room.</p>
<p>No matter what you do you now, you're going to chuck.</p>
<p>You stumble out of bed and now find that your room is in a yacht under<br /> full sail.</p>
<p>After walking along the skirting boards on alternating walls knocking<br /> off all the pictures, you find the toilet.</p>
<p>If you are lucky you will remember to lift the lid before you<br /> spontaneously explode and wake the whole house up with your<br /> impersonation of walrus mating calls.</p>
<p>You sit there on the floor in your undies, cuddling the only friend in<br /> the world you have left (the toilet), randomly continuing to make the<br /> walrus noises, spitting, and farting. Help usually comes at this stage,<br /> even if it is short lived.</p>
<p>Tears stream down your face and your abdomen hurts. Help now turns into<br /> abuse and he/she usually goes back to bed leaving you there in the dark.</p>
<p>With your stomach totally empty, your spontaneous eruptions have died<br /> back to 15-minute intervals, but your body won't relent.</p>
<p>You are convinced that you are starting to turn yourself inside out and swear that you saw your tonsils shoot out of your mouth on the last<br /> occasion.</p>
<p>It is now dawn and you pass your disgusted partner getting up for the<br /> day as you try to climb into bed. She/he abuses you again for trying to<br /> get into bed with lumpy bits of dried vomit in your hair.</p>
<p>You reluctantly accept their advice and have a shower in exchange for<br /> them driving you to the hospital.</p>
<p>Work is not an option.</p>
<p>The whole day is spent trying to avoid anything that might make you sick again, like moving.</p>
<p>You vow never to touch a drop again and who knows for the next two or<br /> three hours at least you might even succeed!!!</p>

<p>We are going to live in this cave for quite a while, so we need a few ""good neighbor"" rules</p>
<p>- Everyone try and keep the cave clean. Do not leave crumbs on the floor.</p>
<p>- It is very rare that I give television interviews, and when I do so, I am trying to scare the most powerful country in the world. So please do not wave at the camera behind my back.</p>
<p>- We all also need to try and keep our beards clean, especially after we eat.</p>

The plumber<br /> arrived, unpacked his tools, did mysterious plumber-type things for a<br /> while, and handed the lawyer a bill for $600. The lawyer exclaimed, ""This<br /> is ridiculous! I don't even make that much as a lawyer!"" The plumber<br /> calmly replied, ""Neither did I when I was a lawyer.""</p>

33501,"<p>Once there was a little boy named Johnny who was three years old. When it<br /> was Palm Sunday, he couldn't wait to go to church to find out what Palm<br /> Sunday was. But sadly, Johnny came down with the chickenpox. His parents<br /> hired a baby-sitter to take care of Johnny while they went to church. When<br /> they came home holding palm leaves, Johnny asked, ""What are the palm tree<br /> leaves for mommie?"" She replied, ""When Jesus walked through the town,<br /> people waved palm leaves at him in respect."" Johnny looked upset and said,<br /> ""Wouldn't ya know? The first day I'm not in church, he shows up!""</p>

33514,"<p>THE FEMALE STRESS DIETThis is a specially formulated diet designed to help you cope with the stress that builds up during the day:Breakfast - I grapefruit, I slice whole-wheat toast, I cup of skim milk.Lunch - Small portion of lean, steamed chicken with a cup of spinach, 1 cup of herbal tea, I Tim Tam.Afternoon Tea - The rest of the packet of Tim Tams, I tub of Tip Top ice cream with chocolate topping, I jar of Nutella.Dinner - 4 bottles of red wine, 2 loaves of garlic bread, I family size supreme pizza, 3 Snickers bars.Late Night Snack - Whole frozen Sarah Lee cheesecake eaten directly from the freezer.Diet Rules1. If no one sees you eat something, it has no calories.2. When drinking a diet Coke with a chocolate bar, the fat in the chocolate is cancelled out by the diet Coke.3. When you eat with someone else, calories don't count if you do not eat more than they do.4. Food used for medicinal purposes does NOT count. (For example: hot chocolate, toast, cheesecake, vodka...)5. If you fatten up the people around you, you will look thinner.6. Cinema-related foods have a zero calorie count as they are part of the entertainment package and not counted as food intake. This includes popcorn, Minties, Maltesers, Jaffas and frozen Cokes.7. Biscuit pieces have no calories because breaking the biscuits up causes calorie leakage.8. Food licked from knives and spoons has no fat if you are in the process of cooking something.9. Foods that are the same color have the same amount of fat. Examples are: spinach and peppermint ice cream, apples and red jelly snakes.10. Chocolate is like a food-color wildcard and may be substituted for any other color.11. Anything eaten while standing has no calories due to gravity and the density of the calorie mass.12. Food consumed from someone else's plate has no fat as it rightfully belongs to the other person and will cling to his/her plate. (Oh, how fat likes to cling!)And remember: 'STRESSED' SPELT BACKWARDS IS 'DESSERTS'!</p>

33516,"<p>This was in the Washington Post ... the title of the article was ""Best Come<br /> Back Line Ever."" In summary, the police arrested Patrick Lawrence, 22-year-old<br /> white male resident of Dracula, GA, in a pumpkin patch 11:38 p.m. on Friday.<br /> Lawrence will be charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency,<br /> and public intoxication at the Gwinnett County courthouse on Monday. The suspect<br /> explained that as he was passing a pumpkin patch he decided to stop. ""You know,<br /> a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around here for<br /> miles. At least I thought there wasn't,"" he stated in a phone interview.<br /> Lawrence went on to say that he pulled over to the side of the road, picked out<br /> a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a hole in it, and<br /> proceeded to satisfy his alleged ""need"". ""Guess I was just really into it, you<br /> know?"" he commented with evident embarrassment. In the process, Lawrence<br /> apparently failed to notice a Gwinnett County police car approaching and was<br /> unaware of his audience until Officer Brenda Taylor approached him. ""It was an<br /> unusual situation that's for sure,"" said Officer Taylor. ""I walked up to<br /> (Lawrence) and he's... just working away at this bumpkin."" Taylor went on to<br /> describe what happened when she approached Lawrence. ""I just went up and said,<br /> 'Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you are screwing a pumpkin?' He froze<br /> and was clearly very surprised that I was there, and then looked me straight in<br /> the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn...is it midnight already?'</p>

33522,"<p>A couple had two little boys, ages 8 and 10, who were excessively mischievous.<br /> They were always getting into trouble and their parents knew that if any<br /> mischief occurred in their town, their sons were probably involved. </p>
<p>The boys' mother heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in<br /> disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys. The<br /> clergyman agreed, but asked to see them individually. </p>
<p>So the mother sent her 8-year-old first, in the morning, with the older boy to<br /> see the clergyman in the afternoon. </p>
<p>The clergyman, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy down and<br /> asked him sternly, ""Where is God?"" </p>
<p>They boy's mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there with his<br /> mouth hanging open, wide-eyed. </p>
<p>So the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner tone, ""Where is<br /> God?""<br /> Again the boy made no attempt to answer. </p>
<p>So the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's<br /> face and bellowed, ""WHERE IS GOD!?"" </p>
<p>The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his<br /> closet, slamming the door behind him. </p>
<p>When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, ""What happened?"" </p>
<p>The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, ""We are in BIG trouble this<br /> time, dude...<br /> God is missing--and they think WE did it!""</p>

HARDING, Director HOLLISTER BUILDING,  PO BOX 30473,  LANSING MI 48909-7973 http://www.deq.state.mi December 17, 1997   CERTIFIEDMr. Ryan DeVries 2088 Dagget Pierson, MI 49339Dear Mr. DeVries:SUBJECT: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023-1   T11N, R10W,  Sec.  20, Montcalm CountyIt has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of property.  You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor who did the following unauthorized activity: Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond.  A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  A review of the Department's files show that no permits have been issued.Therefore, the Department has determined that this activity is in violation of Part 301,.  Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated.  The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially, failed during a recent rain event, causing debris dams and flooding at downstream locations.  We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted.  The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist all unauthorized activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the strewn channel. All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 1998. Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff.Failure to comply with this request, or any further unauthorized activity on the site, may result in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter.Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.Sincerely,David L. Price District Representative Land and Water Management Division        ----Reply Letter----Dear Mr. Price:Re: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023;  T11N, R10W, Sec 20; Montcalm CountyYour certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to.  You sent out a great deal of carbon copies to a lot of people, but you neglected to include their addresses.  You will, therefore, have to send them a copy of my response.First of all, Mr. Ryan DeVries is not the legal landowner and/or contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson, Michigan - I am the legal owner and a couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of constructing and maintaining two wood 'debris' dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond.  While I did not pay for, nor authorize their dam project, I think they would be highly offended you call their skillful use of natural building materials 'debris.'  I would like to challenge you to attempt to emulate their dam project any dam time and/or any dam place you choose.  I believe I can safely state there is no dam way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.As to your dam request the beavers first must fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity, my first dam question to you is: are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers or do you require all dam beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam request?  If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, please send me completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam permits.  Perhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated.My first concern is - aren't the dam beavers entitled to dam legal representation?The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said dam representation - so the State will have to provide them with a dam lawyer.  The Department's dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing dam flooding is proof we should leave the dam Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling their dam names.  If you want the dam stream 'restored' to a dam free-flow condition - contact the dam beavers - but if you are going to arrest them (they obviously did not pay any dam attention to your dam letter-being unable to read English) - be sure you read them their dam Miranda rights first.  As for me, I am not going to cause more dam flooding or dam debris jams by interfering with these dam builders.  If you want to hurt these dam beavers - be aware I am sending a copy of your dam letter and this response to PETA. If your dam Department seriously finds all dams of this nature inherently hazardous and truly will not permit their existence in this dam State - I seriously hope you are not selectively enforcing this dam policy - or once again both I and the Spring Pond Beavers will scream prejudice!In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their dam unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water flows downstream.  They have more dam right than I to live and enjoy Spring Pond.  So, as far as I and the beavers are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more dam elevated enforcement action now.  Why wait until 1/31/98?  The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then, and there will be no dam way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then.In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention a real environmental quality (health) problem; bears are actually defecating in our woods.  I definitely believe you should be persecuting the defecating bears and leave the dam beavers alone.  If you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step!  (The bears are not careful where they dump!)Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office. Sincerely,Stephen L. Tvedtenxc: PETA--</p>

<p>9.  There's a slight difference in our ages. (You are one jurassic geezer.)</p>
<p>8.  I'm not attracted to you in 'that' way. (You are the ugliest dork I've ever laid eyes upon.)</p>
<p>7.  My life is too complicated right now. (I'm waiting for a rich Sugardaddy.)</p>
<p>6.  I've got a boyfriend. (I've got a vibrator.)</p>
<p>5.  I don't date men where I work. (Hey, bud, I wouldn't even date you if you were in the same      'solar system', much less the same building.)</p>
<p>4.  It's not you, it's me. (It's not me, it's you.)</p>
<p>3.  I'm concentrating on my career. (Even something as boring and unfulfilling as my job is         better than dating you.)</p>
<p>2.  I'm celibate. (One look at you and I'm ready to swear off men altogether.)</p>

<p>He said, ""Did you try hitting them with a broom.""<br /> She said, ""Yes, but that didn't work either.""</p>

33532,"<p>As most of you know, the new Tech Museum (www.thetech.org) just opened in San Jose and it's a pretty cool place, but if they REALLY wanted to capture life in Silicon Valley, they should have included some of the following: </p>
<p>1. The Unreasonable Expectation Work Week Simulator: Ever wonder what it's like to work 80 hours a week? You can now experience blurry vision, diminished reaction time, the health effects of eating nothing but Doritos, and the heart-racing excitement of Jolt Cola addiction with the Unreasonable Expectation Work Week Simulator! Hey, who are those strangers claiming to be your family? They're just part of the mysteries you'll experience at the Tech Museum! </p>
<p>2. The ""Find Help At Fry's"" Cyber-Challenge: Don your Virtual Reality goggles and take a tour in the Valley's favorite electronics chain! Your challenge: find someone who can help you. It's not as easy as it sounds, though. If you do find someone, you still have to somehow get them to make eye contact! And once you get help, the challenge isn't over! You still have to avoid the ""Let me get my manager"" monster, endure the perpetual ""Humans as Cattle"" cash register corral, and make it past the paranoid door Nazi without getting a body cavity search! Youch! </p>
<p>3. The Valley Fair Mall Parking Space Scavenger Hunt: Your mission: get in our car simulator and find parking at the Valley's most congested mall! Extra points for finding a space within a one-mile radius of the mall itself. Next year we hope to make this scavenger hunt even more challenging when we violate the laws of conservation of mass with the addition of the Town and Country Monument to Bad City Management! </p>
<p>4. ""Sell or Die""!: Kids will learn valuable lessons playing this interactive game designing and marketing superior, technically-advanced products that fill a niche and meet a need. But wait! The fun is just starting! It's time to play ""Sell or Die""! Kids get to choose whether they will let themselves be bought out by the ""innovative"" Microsoft, or whether they will resist the urge and have their products undersold by Microsoft's inferior competing products! The fun is in seeing how long you can last in the face of unfair marketing practices. The last player to go bankrupt paying their legal bills wins! Extra points for kids who survive long enough to testify in front of the Justice Department! </p>
<p>5. Mr. Jobs' Wild Ride: Get in your Apple Stock Rocket and experience the wildest roller coaster ride of your life! Just when you think the Rocket is about to hit a wall, swerve wildly and unexpectedly to one side and avoid certain death (for now)! And the best part is, your fate is completely in the hands of one all-powerful and unpredictable hippy-turned-power-player-turned-exile-turned-interim-CEO-for-life! And look out! The Larry Ellison Hot Wind Machine will try to blow you off course! You'll lose your lunch on abrupt policy changes, and scream your lungs out as you freefall on the final Mac Clone Maker Betrayal Drop of Death! Riders can then regain their composure looking at the: </p>
<p>6. San Jose Mercury News Wall of Premature Apple Obituaries: Get up close and personal with Valley history by reading over 15 years of stories lamenting the imminent death of everyone's favorite fruit company! With all that circling, don't buzzards ever get dizzy? </p>
<p>7. The Silicon Valley Virtual Commute Race Course: You have two hours to go 15 miles! Think you can do it? Well, buckle yourself into our simulator and give it a try! The Tech Museum offers several race courses to choose from: Try the ""880 Endurance Course""! Hey! You finally made it past the Winchester Mystery Puddle at The Alameda on-ramp, and you're finally up to 25 mph! You'll make Brokaw Road in no time. But look out! 101 merges into 880 AND the freeway goes down to two lanes AT THE SAME TIME! Who designed this nutty course? Or try the ""17 Face Off of Doom""! You're behind one truck in the right lane going 21 mph. The truck in the left lane is going 20.5 mph! Calculate how many hours it will be before you can pass both trucks! Or try the 680 ""Trail of Tears""! You've got to make it from Pleasanton to Fremont with only one full tank of gas! Sound easy? Don't forget the inept Caltrans contractors who block off lanes for no reason at all!</p>

33543,"<p>A farmer was worried that none of his pigs were getting pregnant. He called a vet and asked what he should do if he wanted more pigs. The vet told him he should try artificial insemination. The farmer, not wanting to appear stupid, answered okay and hung up the phone. Unclear on what the vet meant by artificial insemination, the farmer decided it must mean he had to impregnate the pigs himself, so he loaded all the pigs in his pickup and drove down to the woods and shagged them all. The next day he called the vet again, and asked how would he know if the pigs were pregnant. The vet told him they would be lying down rolling in the mud, but when he looked out the window not even one was lying down. So, he loaded them up in his pickup again and drove them to the woods and shagged them all again. To his dismay they were all standing the next morning. So, again he loads the pigs in his truck drives them to the woods and shags them for the third time. By the next morning the farmer is beat, so he asks his wife to hop out of bed and look out the window to see what the pigs are doing. She says ""hmmm - that's weird, they are all in the truck and one of them is blowing the horn"".</p>

33570,"<p>Ladies: Need help Gift Shopping for the man in your life? Buying gifts for men is not nearly as complicated as it is for women. Follow these rules and you should have no problems. </p>
<p> Rule #1: When in doubt - buy him a cordless drill. It does not matter if he already has one. I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain. As a man, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why. </p>
<p> Rule #2: If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word ratchet or socket in it. Men love saying those two words ""Hey George, can I borrow your ratchet?"" ""OK. By-the-way, are you through with my 3/8-inch socket yet?"" Again, no one knows why. </p>
<p> Rule #3: If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car, a 99 cent ice scraper, a small bottle of deicer or something to hang from his rear view mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why. </p>
<p> Rule #4: Never buy men bathrobes. Once I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, he wouldn't have invented Jockey shorts. </p>
<p> Rule #5: You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn out. If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the little picture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips, and flips. </p>
<p> Rule #6: Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after-shave or deodorant. I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy. </p>
<p> Rule #7: Buy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a couple of weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. ""Socks. Shorts. Cups. saucers. Door. Lock. Sink."" You get the idea. No one knows why. (ABSOLUTELY TRUE!!) </p>
<p> Rule #8: Never buy a man anything that says ""some assembly required"" on the box. It will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over. No one knows why. </p>
<p> Rule #9: Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, Parr Lumber, Home Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire. (NAPA Auto Parts and Sears Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores.) It doesn't matter if he doesn't know what it is. (""From NAPA Auto, eh? Must be something I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane? Wow! thanks."") </p>
<p> Rule #10: Men enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue. (No one knows why) Get him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him the gas line leaks. ""Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?"" </p>
<p> Rule #11: Tickets to a Cowboys game are a smart gift. However, he will not appreciate tickets to ""A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts."" Everyone knows why. </p>
<p> Rule #12: Men love chain saws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chain saw. If you don't know why - please refer to Rule #7 and what happens when he gets a label maker. </p>
<p> Rule #13: It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension ladder. Never buy a real man a stepladder. It must be an extension ladder. No one knows why. </p>
<p> Rule #14: Rope. Men love rope. It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least The Boy Scouts. Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8"" manila rope. No one knows why.</p>

However, he<br /> could save up the words so that if he did not speak for a whole<br /> year, then the following year he was allowed to speak two words<br /> (this was before the time of letter writing or sign language). </p>
<p>One day he met a beautiful princess (ruby lips, golden hair,<br /> sapphire eyes,) and fell madly in love. With the greatest<br /> difficulty he decided to refrain from speaking for two whole<br /> years so that he could look at her and say, ""my darling,"" But,<br /> at the end of the two years he wished to tell her that he loved<br /> her. Because of this he waited three more years without speaking<br /> (bringing the total number of silent years to 5). </p>
<p>But, at the end of these five years he realized that he had to<br /> ask her to marry him. So, he waited ANOTHER four years without<br /> speaking. </p>
<p>Finally as the ninth year of silence ended, his joy knew no<br /> bounds. Leading the lovely princess to the most secluded and<br /> romantic place in that beautiful royal garden the prince heaped<br /> a hundred red roses on her lap, knelt before her, and taking her<br /> hand in his, said huskily, ""My darling, I love you! Will you<br /> marry me?"" </p>
<p>And the princess tucked a strand of golden hair behind a dainty<br /> ear, opened her sapphire eyes in wonder, and parting her ruby<br /> lips, said, ""Pardon?""</p>

<p>He hits it 10 inches from the cup. He is shocked. He says<br /> to the frog, ""Wow that's amazing.</p>
<p>You must be a lucky frog, eh?</p>

<p>The man decides to take the frog with him to the next hole.</p>
<p>""What do you think frog?"" the man asks.</p>
<p>""Ribbit 3 wood.""</p>
<p>The guy takes out a 3 wood and, Boom! Hole in one. The<br /> man is befuddled and doesn't know what to say. By the end<br /> of the day, the man golfed the best game of golf in his life<br /> and asks the frog, ""OK where to next?""</p>

33620,"<p>One day this non flying fly was setting on the bank of a stream trying to figure a way across. In the stream was a trout watching the fly, the trout said to himself, if that fly comes down I'll jump up and eat him. Back in the edge of the woods was a bear watching the trout watching the fly, the bear says to himself, if that trout jumps up I'll jump down and eat him. A little further back in the woods is a hunter watching the bear, watching the trout, watching the fly, and the hunter says to himself, if that bear jumps down there I'll jump up and shoot him. A little further back in the woods is a mouse watching the hunter, watching the bear, watching the trout, watching the fly, and the mouse says to himself if that hunter jumps up to shoot that bear he'll drop that sandwich and I'll jump on the sandwich. A little further back in the woods is a cat watching the mouse, watching the hunter, watching the bear, watching the trout, watching the fly, and the cat says to himself, if that mouse jumps on that sandwich, i'll jump on that mouse. Well the fly goes down, the trout jumps up, the bear jumps down, the hunter jumps up and drops his sandwich, the mouse jumps on the sandwich, the cat jumps toward the mouse and misses and falls into the creek and gets wet. So the moral to the story is if the ""Fly goes down, the pussy gets wet"".</p>

33652,"<p>If you have raised kids (or been one), and gone through the pet syndrome including toilet-flush burials for dead goldfish It's a long story but one that will have you laughing out LOUD!!</p>
<p>Overview: I had to take my son's hamster to the vet. Here's what happened:</p>
<p>Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was something wrong with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room. ""He's just lying there looking sick,"" he told me, ""I'm serious, Dad. Can you help?""</p>
<p>I put my best hamster-healer look on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do. (Call my wife.)</p>
<p>""Honey,"" I called, ""come look at the hamster!"" ""Oh, my gosh,"" my wife diagnosed after a minute. ""She's having babies."" ""What?"" My son demanded.</p>
<p>""But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!""</p>
<p>I was equally outraged. ""Hey, how can that be?! I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce!"" I accused my wife. ""Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?!"" She inquired. (I actually think she had the gall to say this sarcastically.)</p>
<p>""No, but you were supposed to get two boys!"" I reminded her (in my most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth together). ""Yeah, Bert and Ernie!"" My son agreed. ""Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know,"" she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm, ya think?)</p>
<p>By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. ""Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience,"" I announced. ""We're about to witness the miracle of birth.""</p>
<p>""OH, Gross!"" They shrieked.</p>
<p>""Well, isn't THAT just great! What are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?"" My wife wanted to know. (I really do think she was being snotty here, too. Don't you?)</p>
<p>We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. ""We don't appear to be making much progress,"" I noted.</p>
<p>""It's breech,"" my wife whispered, horrified. ""Do something, Dad!"" My son urged. ""Okay, okay."" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gingerly tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results.</p>
<p>""Should I call 911?"" My eldest daughter wanted to know,"" Maybe they could talk us through the trauma."" (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?)</p>
<p>""Let's get Ernie to the vet,"" I said grimly.</p>
<p>We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in hislap. ""Breathe, Ernie, breathe,"" he urged.</p>
<p>""I don't think hamsters do Lamaze,"" his mother noted to him. (Women can be so cruel to their own young. I mean what she does to ME is one thing, but this boy is of her womb.)</p>
<p>The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass. ""What do you think, Doc, a c-section?"" I suggested scientifically. My son appeared impressed by my observation.</p>
<p>""Oh, very interesting,"" he murmured. ""Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?"" I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.</p>
<p>""Is Ernie going to be okay?"" My wife asked. ""Oh, perfectly,"" the vet assured us.</p>
<p>""This hamster is not in labor. In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen Ernie is a boy.""</p>
<p>""What?""</p>
<p>""You see, Ernie is a young male AND occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um .... er ... masturbate, just the way he did, lying on his back."" He blushed, glancing at my wife. ""Well, you know what I'm saying, Mr. Cameron.""</p>
<p>We were silent, absorbing this.</p>
<p>""So Ernie's just ... just ... excited?""! My wife offered.</p>
<p>""Exactly,"" the vet replied, relieved that we understood. More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle. And laugh. And then even laugh loudly!</p>
<p>""What's so funny?"" I demanded, knowing, but not believing that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless manliness. Tears were now running down her face.</p>
<p>""It's just ... that ... I'm picturing you pulling on its ... its teeny little ..."" she gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.</p>
<p>""That's enough,"" I warned.</p>
<p>We thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be okay.</p>
<p>""I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad,"" he told me.</p>
<p>""Oh, you have NO idea,"" my wife agreed, once again collapsing into laughter.</p>
<p>Enough said.</p>

But eventually his turn came. Little Johnnie walked up to the front of the class, and with a piece of chalk, made a small white dot on the blackboard, then sat back down. Well the teacher couldn't figure out what Johnnie had in mind for his report on something exciting, so she asked him just what that was.""It's a period,"" reported Johnnie.""Well I can see that,"" she said.""But what is so exciting about a period.""""Damned if I know,"" said Johnnie, ""but this morning my sister said she missed one.

33687,"<p>The May Day parade in Moscow is the largest, most important military parade of the year. For 1992's parade, Yeltsin and Gorbachev invited Bill Clinton to come watch it with them. The parade commenced with a battalion of tanks, followed by a division of infantry, followed by armored personnel carriers and mobile artillery. They had mobile ballistic missile launchers, electronic jamming vehicles, and throughout the entire time the formations were overflown by squadrons of the most advanced interceptors, fighters, and long-range tactical and strategic bombers.Clinton, who had never been this close to war in his life, was suitably impressed. Then he noticed that, way back at the end of the parade, there was a disorganized, messy bunch of men in rumpled suits tagging along behind the last artillery pieces. ""Who are they?"" he asked.""Ah,"" said Yeltsin, ""those are our economists!"" ""But I thought this parade was military..."" said Clinton, confused.""Mr. Clinton,"" said Gorbachev, ""have you SEEN the damage those men can do?""</p>

33698,"<p>A city slicker wanted to buy a farm. He found just what he was looking for. During an inspection of the property, however, he found a hive of bees.</p>
<p>He told the owner that he was deathly afraid of bees, and there was no way he could consider this piece of land.</p>
<p>The landowner assured him that the bees were completely harmless, but the buyer would have no part of it.</p>
<p>Finally, the landowner made an offer. The buyer would allow himself to be tied to a tree for an hour, nude, under the nest. So sure of the friendliness of his bees was the farmer that if ONE bee were to sting him, the farm would be his for free. The buyer thought it over and decided it was worth the risk.</p>
<p>An hour later, the farmer walked out to the tree and saw the poor guy slumped over in his bindings. Fearing the worst, he ran up to him and asked if he had been stung.</p>
<p>The city fella looked up and weakly said, ""No... the bees never touched me - but doesn't that calf have a mother!?!""</p>

33706,"<p>Back in the old west, there was a need to connect the east and the west with a telegraph line.  The Manager of the project advertised for workers to complete the job.  Three groups responded.  A team of Irishmen, a group of Italians, and a final team composed of Blondes.</p>
<p>Since none of the groups would work with anyone from the other two  groups, the project supervisor decided to assign each group to a  different part of the line, and then see which team set the most poles.</p>
<p>The first task was to set the poles.  The Supervisor sent each group out to a different location.  Before they left, he advised all three groups that the one to bury the most poles today, would receive a bonus.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the foreman of the Italians reported back to the Supervisor.  The Supervisor inquired of him how many poles had been set by his team.  He answered 48.  The Supervisor was delighted.  He advised the Italian to stay awhile until he heard how the Irishmen and the Blondes had done...</p>
<p>Next to report was the foreman of the Irishmen group.  When asked, he reported that they had set 53 poles that day.  Again the Superivsor was thrilled.  He dismissed the Italian foreman and asked the Irishman to remain until the Blondes checked in.</p>
<p>A little while later the Blonde forewoman reported to the Supervisor.<br /> ""How many poles did your group set?""  He asked.  ""Two.""  Replied the Blonde forewoman.  </p>
<p>""What! Just, two!""  exclaimed the Supervisor.  ""The Italians set 48 poles, and the Irishmen set 53.  How could you Blondes have only set two poles?"" </p>
<p>""It may be true the Italians and Irishmen buried more poles than us,"" replied the Blonde.  ""But you should see how much of the poles those bozos left sticking out of the ground!""</p>

My people are overjoyed to assist the totally neutral<br /> and gloriously impotent UN in serving their American Masters. I realize that<br /> many of you would much rather be touring the Third World for some magnificently<br /> ineffective do-nothing NGO, but alas you are here compromising your values on<br /> behalf of Western oil companies. </p>
<p>Before you wipe the blood from your hands and get down to the business of<br /> concocting reasons for the US to bomb us back to the stone ages of 1991, I<br /> thought I�d help reorient you to the ways of magical Baghdad with a few �Dos�<br /> and �Don�ts�. </p>
<p>DO:<br /> Slavishly patronize Baghdad locals with chocolate bars and worthless Western<br /> baubles. Nothing ingratiates us more to intrusive throngs of chubby, sweaty,<br /> lobster-red warmongers then when they pass out meaningless tchotkes to us Third<br /> World �savages�. We will remember these tokens as we dance on your bleached<br /> bones. I joke! </p>
<p>DO:<br /> Ignore my playful peoples penchant for recreational HAZMAT suit use. Moreover,<br /> ignore the glowing, three-tailed rats that are indigenous to Baghdad. While<br /> you�re at it, ignore the totally desolate warehouse full of rotting canisters at<br /> the corner of Saddam Is Great Avenue and Drown In Blood Yankee Dogs Boulevard. </p>
<p>DO:<br /> Feel free to enter any building, factory, or hospital you desire. And while<br /> you�re busy violating my paranoid and fragile egos sovereignty, feel free to<br /> double-check the bedpans of the dying, gut the teddy bears of orphans, and pour<br /> into the dirt any and all bottles of weapons grade baby formula you might<br /> uncover. </p>
<p>DON�T:<br /> Forget your high-tech Weapons of Mass Destruction Poking Sticks or Nintendo<br /> Gameboys at the hotel. We know that without these useless, aesthetic �tools� you<br /> cannot unearth the make-believe stores of plutonium I don�t have hidden<br /> underneath my opulent Presidential Palaces that my people willed me to build for<br /> my own noble pleasures. </p>
<p>DON�T:<br /> Ignore the cultural relativism we know you studied in your Liberal Arts<br /> Colleges. We humble Iraqis have a far different culture than the advanced West.<br /> Whereas you respect the differences between languages, cultures and value<br /> systems, I want to kill. Kill you, your family, friends, grammar school<br /> teachers, the Israelis, whole bunches of Saudis and just for good measure, my<br /> new yet treacherous-looking barber Adnan. </p>
<p>DON�T:<br /> Mock our cherished Iraqi way of life. While you might think it barbaric and<br /> backward, our seemingly brutal governmental system is based on sound fascistic<br /> principles that have helped keep the majority of Arabs in splendid desolate<br /> squalor for decades. </p>
<p>I truly hope your stay here is a positive experience. I pray that those of you<br /> I do not like do not accidentally get caught in the crossfire of the invasion<br /> you are busy inventing! </p>

Could he be mentally retarded?'Isaac Newton did poorly in grade school.Beethoven's music teacher once said of him, 'As a composer, he is hopeless.'A well-known magazine editor told Emily Dickinson her poems were unpublishable because they failed to rhyme.When Thomas Edison was a boy, his teachers told him he was too stupid to learn.F.W. Woolworth got a job in a dry goods store when he was 21 but his employers would not let him wait on customers because he 'didn't have enough sense.'A newspaper editor fired Walt Disney because he had 'no good ideas.'Caruso's music teacher told him, 'You can't sing, you have no voice at all.'The director of the Imperial Opera in Vienna told Madame Schumann Heink that she would never be a singer and advised her to buy a sewing machine.An infamous review of William Wordsworth's greatest poem began with the sentence, 'This simply will not do.'Leo Tolstoy flunked out of college.Werner Von Braun flunked ninth-grade algebra.Fred Waring was once rejected from his high school chorus.Socrates was called 'an immoral corrupter of youth.'Admiral Richard E.

He did not become Prime Minister of England until he was 62, and then only after a lifetime of defeats and setbacks.  His greatest contributions came when he was a 'senior citizen.'Henry Ford failed and went broke five times before he finally succeeded.Babe Ruth, considered by sport historians to be the greatest athlete of all time and famous for setting the home run record, also holds the record for the most strikeouts.Eighteen publishers turned down Richard Bach's 10,000 word story about a 'soaring' Seagull, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, before Macmillan finally published it in 1970.

In the mall shall you assemble, you whohave eaten all your chocolate and are hungry for more.  To you I shallbring GoodThings for your tongue.  And you shall have chocolate smears on yourcheeks, and you shall munch, nosh, snack, feast, and make yummy noisesall in my presence.For mine is the ecstacy of phenylalanine, and mine is also the joy onearth, yea, even into high orbit, for my law is 'melts in your mouth,not in your hand.'  Keep clean your fingers, carry Wet Ones always,let none stop you aside.  For mine is the secret that opens yourmouth, and mine is the taste that puts a smile on your lips and thecomfy padding pounds on your hips.  I am the gracious Goddess whogives the gift of joy onto the tummies of men and women.Upon earth, I give knowledge of all things delicious, and beyonddeath...well, I can't do much there.  Sorry about that.  I demand onlyyou have to pay for those truffles before you eat them.SWISS MISS: Hear now the words of the Goodie Goddess, she in the dustof whose feet are the cheap imitations, whose body graces candy racksand finer stores everywhere:I, who am the beauty of chocolate chips, and the satisfying softnessof big bars, the mystery of how they get the filling inside truffles,and fill the hearts of all but Philistines with desire, call unto thysoul to arise and come unto me.  For I am the soul of candy, from medo all confections spring, and unto me all of you shall return,again...and again...and again...and again.Before me smeared faces, beloved of women and men, thine innermostdivine self shall be enfolded in the rapture of overdose.  Let mytaste be within thy mouth that rejoices.  For behold, all acts ofyumminess and pleasure aremy rituals.Therefore let there be gooeyness and mess, crispness and crackling,big slabs and bite size pieces, peanut butter and chocolate-coveredcherries all within you.  And you who think to seek me, know that yourseeking and yearning shallavail you not unless you know the Mystery:  'We shall sell nochocolate until you pay for it.'  For behold: I have been with yousince you were just a baby, and I am that which is attained at nearlyany shop in the land.Messed be.SWISS MISS: Hear now the words of the Chocolate God, who was calledGhirardelli, Milton Snavely Hershey, Bosco, Fudgesicle, and by manyother names:HP: I am the strength of the candy rack, and the piece that fell onthe floor but looks like it may not have gotten too dirty, and thedeepest bitterness of dark chocolate.  No matter how you try to resistthe call for chocolate, I will hunt you out, and I will become yoursacred prey.  I am warmth of hot cocoa in the dead of winter, and thecall of the road that leads you to that really expensive Godiva storedowntown.I give you my creatures, the fire of love of chocolate, the power ofjaw strength to bite off a piece of that frozen Milky Way bar and theshelter of Haagen Dazs when that big date didn't work out.  You aredear to me, and I instill in you my power of a piece of chocolate thatyou had forgotten you had hidden, and the power of vision and magicalsight with which you can spot a candy counter a mile away.  By thepowers of the half-melted bar in the glorious sun, I charge you, bythe darkest depths of the bottom of the cocoa pot and lingering smellof bittersweet chocolate, I charge you, and by thebeauty of a perfectly swirled vanilla butter cream, I charge you.Follow your heart and your instinct, wherever they lead you. Thewealth in your pocket can buy you treats that a Mayan kin would envy.Take joy in that first bite of lecithin emulsified cocoa, and in thelast satisfying slurp of Yoo-Hoo.Yet you must be wary of deceit.

33772,"<p>After having been commissioned by God to take a survey of how man was doing on Earth, St. Peter now stood before his boss ready to present his findings. </p>
<p>""Tell me, St. Peter, what have you found out?"" God asked.</p>
<p>""I'm very sorry to have to tell you this, but the people are behaving in a sinful manner. There's drugs, alcohol, murders, you name it-a regular Sodom and Gomorra. </p>
<p>But the worst is this new obsession with oral sex. According to my survey, 88% of the population is doing it. I'm afraid it has reached epidemic proportions.</p>
<p>""Hmmm,"" God said thoughtfully, ""do you have any recommendations as to what should be done to put an end to this sexual perversion?""</p>
<p>""I think we should send a message to everyone on Earth who engages in oral sex. The contents of that message should tell them exactly what will happen to them on Judgment Day if they do not stop this type of activity."" Replied St. Peter.</p>
<p>""That is an effective solution,"" God stated, ""but I think that instead of punishing those who practice oral sex, we should reward those who refrain from it. </p>

33775,"<p>You've all heard of the Air Force's ultra-high-security, super-secret base in Nevada, known simply as ""Area 51?"" </p>
<p>Well, late one afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their ""secret"" base. They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. </p>
<p>The pilot's story was that he took off from Las Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. </p>
<p>By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Las Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way. </p>
<p>The next day, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane ... only this time there were two people in the plane. </p>
<p>The same pilot jumped out and said, ""Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!""</p>

<p>The next morning they went to the beach, dressed in their ""tourist"" garb and<br /> were sitting on beach chairs, enjoying a drink, the sunshine and the scenery<br /> when a ""drop dead gorgeous"" blonde in a tiny bikini came walking straight<br /> towards them. They couldn't help but stare and when she passed them, she smiled<br /> and said, ""Good morning, Father"" - ""Good morning, Father,"" nodding and<br /> addressing each of them individually, then passed on by.</p>
<p>They were both stunned. How in the world did she recognize them as priests?</p>
<p>The next day they went back to the store, bought even more outrageous<br /> outfits-these were so loud, you could hear them before you even saw them-and<br /> again settled on the beach in their chairs to enjoy the sunshine, etc.</p>
<p>After a while, the same gorgeous blonde, wearing a string bikini this time,<br /> came walking toward them again. (They were glad they had sunglasses, because<br /> their eyes were about to pop out of their heads.)</p>
<p>Again, she approached them and greeted them individually: ""Good morning,<br /> Father,"" ""Good morning Father,"" and started to walk away.</p>
<p>One of the priests couldn't stand it and said. ""Just a minute, young lady.<br /> Yes, we are priests, and proud of it, but I have to know, how in the world did<br /> YOU know?"" </p>

33788,"<p>(I REALLY WONDER HOW THE PEOPLE IN TOURISM REMAINS SANE??????)<br /> Here are some of the classic questions being asked of the Sydney<br /> Olympic Committee via their Web site, and some answers that may<br /> be appropriate. </p>
<p>* Which direction is North in Australia? (USA)<br /> (Face North and you should be about right)</p>
<p>* Is it safe to run around in the bushes in Australia? (Sweden)<br /> (And accomplish what?)</p>
<p>* Do tents exist in Australia? (Germany)<br /> (Yes, but only in sporting goods stores, peoples' garages, and<br /> most national parks...)</p>
<p>* Do you celebrate Christmas in Australia? (France)<br /> (Yes. At Christmas.)</p>
<p>* Are there places in Australia where you can make love<br /> outdoors? (Italy)<br /> (Yes. Outdoors.)</p>
<p>* Will I be able to speak English most places I go? (USA)<br /> (Yes, except in America.)</p>
<p>* I hear that all Australian women are beautiful. Is that true<br /> and if so, can you send me pictures of the available ones?<br /> (Italy)<br /> (Sure, there's only 8 million of them)</p>
<p>* I want to go swimming at Bondi Beach on October 20th. Will I<br /> turn blue? (Germany)<br /> (More likely brown, considering the effluent...)</p>
<p>* Does it ever get windy in Australia? I have never seen it rain<br /> on TV, so how do the plants grow? (UK)<br /> (Upwards, out of the ground, like the person who asked this<br /> question, who themselves will need watering if their IQ drops any<br /> lower...)</p>
<p>* Will I be able to see kangaroos in the street? (USA)<br /> (Depends on how much beer you've consumed...)</p>
<p>* I plan to take some day trips during the Olympics. Which<br /> direction should I drive - Perth to Darwin or Darwin to Perth -<br /> to avoid driving with the sun in my eyes? (Germany)<br /> (Excellent question, considering that the Olympics are being<br /> held in Sydney.)</p>
<p>* I want to walk from Perth to Sydney for the Olympics - can I<br /> follow the railroad tracks? (Sweden)<br /> (Sure, it's only seven thousand miles, so you'll need to have<br /> started about a year and a half ago to get there in time for the<br /> Games...)</p>
<p>* It is imperative that I find the names and addresses of places<br /> to contact for a stuffed porpoise. (Italy)<br /> (I'm not touching this one...)</p>
<p>* My client wants to take a steel pooper-scooper into Australia.<br /> Will you let her in? (South Africa)<br /> (Why? We do have toilet paper here...)</p>
<p>* Are there any ATMs in Australia? Can you send me a list of<br /> them in Brisbane, Cairns, Townsville and Hervey Bay? (UK)<br /> (No, and we use shells for money too)</p>
<p>* Where can I learn underwater welding in Australia? (Portugal)<br /> (???)</p>
<p>* Do the camels in Australia have one hump or two? (UK)<br /> (Depends if you get an ugly one or not...)</p>
<p>* Can I bring cutlery into Australia? (UK)<br /> (Why bother? Use your fingers like the rest of us...)</p>
<p>* Do you have perfume in Australia? (France)<br /> (No. Everybody stinks.)</p>
<p>* Can I drive to the Great Barrier Reef? (Germany)<br /> (Sure, if your vehicle is amphibious.)</p>
<p>* Are there killer bees in Australia? (Germany)<br /> (Not yet, but we'll see what we can do when you get here.)</p>
<p>* Can you give me some information about hippo racing in<br /> Australia? (USA)<br /> (What's this guy smoking, and where do I get some?)</p>
<p>* Are there supermarkets in Sydney and is milk available all<br /> year round? (Germany)<br /> (A blonde?)</p>
<p>* Please send a list of all doctors in Australia who can<br /> dispense rattlesnake serum. (USA)<br /> (Rattlesnakes? There is only serum for the Funnel Web and<br /> Red-Back Spiders. You will need to contend with White-Tail<br /> Spiders, Brown, Tiger and Red-Belly Black snakes, sharks, Red<br /> Kangaroos, Blue-ringed Octopuses and the 3am pub closing<br /> time/taxi change-over)</p>
<p>* Can you send me the Vienna Boys' Choir schedule? (USA)<br /> (Americans have long had considerable trouble distinguishing<br /> between Austria and Australia.)</p>
<p>* I have a question about a famous animal in Australia, but I<br /> forget its name. It's a kind of bear and lives in trees. (USA)<br /> (Another blonde?)</p>
<p>* I have developed a new product that is the fountain of youth.<br /> Can you tell me where I can sell it in Australia? (USA)<br /> (From Liz Taylor, perhaps?)</p>
<p>* I was in Australia in 1969 on R+R, and I want to contact the<br /> girl I dated while I was staying in Kings Cross. Can you help?<br /> (USA)</p>

33794,"<p>There was this couple in bed one night. The wife had curled up ready for sleep and the husband put his bed lamp on to read a book.

I thought it was foreplay for something a bit heavier''.   The husband said, ''No, not at all.''    The wife then asked,'' Well, what were you doing then?''    ''I couldn't turn the pages of my book.''</p>
"
33795,"<p>We start to bud in our blouses at 9 or 10 years old only to find anything that comes in contact with those tender, blooming buds hurts so bad it brings us to tears.</p>
<p>Enter the almighty, uncomfortable training bra contraption that boys in school will snap until we have calluses on our backs.</p>
<p>Next, we get our periods in our early to mid-teens or sooner. Along with those budding boobs, we now bloat, we cramp, we get the hormone crankies, have to wear little mattresses between our legs or insert tubular, packed cotton rods in places we didn't even know we had.</p>
<p>Our next little rite of passage, premarital or not, is having sex for the first time which is about as much fun as having a ramrod pushed into your uterus through your nostrils. (IF he did it right and didn't end up with his little cart before his horse, leaving us to wonder what all the fuss was about.)</p>
<p>Then it's off to Motherhood where we learn to live on dry crackers and water for a few months so we don't spend the entire day leaning over Brother John.</p>
<p>Of course, amazing creatures that we are, and we are, we learn to live with the growing little angels inside us steadily kicking our innards night and day making us wonder if we're having Rosemary's Baby. Our once flat bellies now look like we swallowed a watermelon whole and we pee our pants every time we sneeze.</p>
<p>When the big moment arrives, the dam in our blessed Nether Regions will invariably burst right in the middle of the mall and we'll waddle with our big cartoon feet moaning in pain all the way to the ER. Then it's huff and puff and beg to die while the OB says, ""Please stop screaming, Mrs. In-Labor. Calm down and push.<br /> Just one more (or 10 more) good push,"" warranting a strong, well-deserved impulse to punch the asshole (and husband) square in the nose for making us cram a wiggling, mushroom-headed 10 lb. bowling ball through a keyhole.</p>
<p>After that, it's time to raise those angels only to find that when all that cute wears off, the beautiful little darlings morph into walking, jabbering, wet, gooey, snot-blowing, life-sucking little poop machines.</p>
<p>The teen years... Need I say more?</p>
<p>The kids are almost grown now and we women hit our voracious sexual prime in our mid 30's to early 40's while husband had his somewhere around his 18th birthday (which just happens to be the reason all that early hot man sex got you pregnant in the first place).</p>
<p>Now we hit the grand finale: ""The Menopause,"" the Grandmother of all womanhood. It's either take the HRT and chance cancer in those now seasoned ""buds"" or the aforementioned Nether Regions, or, sweat like a hog in July, wash your sheets and pillowcases daily and bite the head off anything that moves.</p>
<p>Now, you ask WHY women seem to be more spiteful than men when men get off so easy INCLUDING the icing on life's cake: Being able to pee in the woods without soaking their socks?</p>
<p>I love being a woman (call me crazy) but ""Womanhood"" would even make the Great Gandhi more spiteful!!!</p>
<p>And they say women are the ""weaker sex"". HA!</p>

After several minutes, the older worker had had enough. ""Why don't you put your money where your mouth is,"" he said. </p>
<p>""I will bet a week's wages that I can haul something in a wheelbarrow over to that outbuilding that you won't be able to wheel back."" </p>
<p>""You're on, old man,"" the braggart replied. </p>
<p>""Let's see what you got."" </p>
<p>The old man reached out and grabbed the wheelbarrow by the handles. Then, nodding to the young man, he said, ""All right. Get in.""</p>

33808,"<p>One day, a woman died and went to heaven. An angel met her at<br /> the gateway to heaven and said ""Welcome to heaven. Everything<br /> here is perfect. You may do whatever you want. The only<br /> exception is, there are ducks walking around everywhere. You may<br /> not step on any of them, or you will be punished. After a year,<br /> if you have not stepped on any ducks, you will be rewarded."" The<br /> woman agreed so the angel took her into heaven. She discovered a<br /> chain linked to her wrist, though she had no idea why, but then<br /> she realized that everyone else did, too. After awhile, the<br /> woman began to watch other people and see what happened. She saw<br /> a really pretty woman step on a duck because it had gotten<br /> in her way. She saw the angel go up to the woman, talk to her,<br /> and then chain her to an ugly man. The man said, ""Wow, you are<br /> the most beautiful woman I've ever seen."" The woman said, ""And<br /> you are so ugly I can't believe I stepped on that damn duck.""<br /> After that she saw a handsome man step on a duck and swear. The<br /> angel went over to him and talked to him. Then he walked over to<br /> the woman and said, ""You have been good, so you are going to be<br /> rewarded."" The woman was excited to see what her reward was. The<br /> angel then took the man by his chain and hooked it to the<br /> woman's. The woman said, ""Wow, you are the hottest man I've ever<br /> seen.""</p>

33809,"<p>Seems God was just about done creating the universe, had a couple of left-over things left in his bag of creations, so he stopped by to visit Adam and Eve in the Garden.<br /> He told the couple that one of the things he had to give away was the ability to stand up and pee. ""It's a very handy thing,"" God told the couple who he found hanging around under an apple tree. ""I was wondering if either one of you wanted that ability."" </p>
<p>Adam popped a cork. Jumped up and begged, ""Oh, give that to me! I'd love to be able to do that! It seems the sort of thing a Man should do. Oh please, oh please, oh please, let me have that ability. I'd be so great! When I'm working in the garden or naming the animals, I could just let it rip, I'd be so cool. Oh please God let it be me who you give that gift to, let me stand and pee, oh please...."" On and on he went like an excited little boy (who had to pee). </p>
<p>Eve just smiled and shook her head at the display. She told God if Adam really wanted it so badly, and it sure seemed to be the sort of thing that would make him happy, she really wouldn't mind if Adam were the one given the ability to stand up and pee. And so it was. And it was... well, good. </p>
<p>""Fine,"" God said, looking back into his bag of left-over gifts. ""What's left here? Oh yes, multiple orgasms...""</p>

Of course, then we would have a lot of people voting for a candidate born on July 3 or December 26, just for the long weekends.Democracy is a beautiful thing, except for that part about letting just any old yokel vote.Home is where the house is.Often, when I am reading a good book, I stop and thank my teacher.

At the end of the year, you'll have a couple of days saved up.It would be terrible if the Red Cross Bloodmobile got into an accident. No, wait. That would be good because if anyone needed it, the blood would be right there.Give me the strength to change the things I can, the grace to accept the things I cannot, and a great big bag of money.The people who think Tiny Tim is strange are the same ones who think it odd that I drive without pants.For centuries, people thought the moon was made of green cheese. Then the astronauts found that the moon is really a big hard rock. That's what happens to cheese when you leave it out.Think of the biggest number you can. Now add five. Then, imagine if you had that many Twinkies. Wow, that's five more than the biggest number you could come up with!I bet living in a nudist colony takes all the fun out of Halloween.The only stupid question is the one that is never asked, except maybe ""Don't you think it is about time you audited my return?"" or ""Isn't is morally wrong to give me a warning when, in fact, I was speeding?""Once, I wept for I had no shoes.

It said ""Vrrrrmmmmm."" Unless it was just a lawn mower.FIRST RUNNER UPI gaze at the brilliant full moon. The same one, I think to myself, at which Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato gazed.

I tell Plato that I live in the country that has come the closest to Utopia, and I show him a copy of the Constitution. I tell Aristotle that we have found many more than four basic elements and I show him a periodic table. I get a box of kitchen matches and strike one. They gasp with wonder.

33836,"<p>Cracking an international market is a goal of most growing corporations. It shouldn't be that hard, yet even the big multi-nationals run into trouble because of language and cultural differences. For example...</p>
<p>The name Coca-Cola in China was first rendered as Ke-kou-ke-la.<br /> Unfortunately, the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of signs had been printed that the phrase means ""bite the wax tadpole"" or ""female horse stuffed with wax"" depending on the dialect. Coke then<br /> researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close phonetic equivalent, ""ko-kou-ko-le,"" which can be loosely translated as ""happiness in the mouth.""</p>
<p>In Taiwan, the translation of the Pepsi slogan ""Come alive with the Pepsi Generation"" came out as ""Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead.""</p>
<p>Also in Chinese, the Kentucky Fried Chicken slogan ""finger-lickin' good"" came out as ""eat your fingers off.""</p>
<p>The American slogan for Salem cigarettes, ""Salem - Feeling Free,"" got translated in the Japanese market into ""When smoking Salem, you feel so refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty.""</p>
<p>When General Motors introduced the Chevy Nova in South America, it was apparently unaware that ""no va"" means ""it won't go."" After the company figured out why it wasn't selling any cars, it renamed the car in its Spanish markets to the Caribe.</p>
<p>Ford had a similar problem in Brazil when the Pinto flopped. The company found out that Pinto was Brazilian slang for ""tiny male genitals"". Ford pried all the nameplates off and substituted Corcel, which means horse.</p>
<p>When Parker Pen marketed a ballpoint pen in Mexico, its ads were supposed to say ""It won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you."" However, the company's mistakenly thought the spanish word ""embarazar"" meant embarrass. Instead the ads said that ""It wont leak in your pocket and make you pregnant.""</p>
<p>An American t-shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the spanish market which promoted the Pope's visit. Instead of the desired ""I Saw the Pope"" in Spanish, the shirts proclaimed ""I Saw the Potato.""</p>
<p>Chicken-man Frank Perdue's slogan, ""It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken,"" got terribly mangled in another Spanish translation. A photo of Perdue with one of his birds appeared on billboards all over Mexico with a caption that explained ""It takes a hard man to make a chicken aroused.""</p>
<p>Hunt-Wesson introduced its Big John products in French Canada as Gros Jos before finding out that the phrase, in slang, means ""big breasts."" In this case, however, the name problem did not have a noticeable effect on sales.</p>
<p>Colgate introduced a toothpaste in France called Cue, the name of a notorious porno mag.</p>
<p>In Italy, a campaign for Schweppes Tonic Water translated the name into Schweppes Toilet Water.</p>
<p>Japan's second-largest tourist agency was mystified when it entered English-speaking markets and began receiving requests for unusual sex tours. Upon finding out why, the owners of Kinki Nippon Tourist Company changed its name.</p>
<p>and finally...</p>
<p>In an effort to boost orange juice sales in predominantly continental breakfast eating England, a campaign was devised to extoll the drink's eye-opening, pick-me-up qualities. Hence, the slogan, ""Orange juice. It gets your pecker up.""</p>

<p>""But we're privates,"" protests Jasper. </p>
<p>""We're sergeants now,"" says Leroy, pulling him inside. </p>
<p>""Now, Jasper, I'm gonna sit down and have me a drink."" </p>
<p>""But we's privates,"" says Jasper. </p>
<p>""You blind?"" asks Leroy, pointing at his stripes. ""We're sergeants now."" </p>
<p>So they have their drink, and pretty soon a hooker comes up to Leroy. </p>
<p>""Your cute,"" she says, ""and I'd like to screw you, but I've got a bad case of gonorrhea."" </p>
<p>Leroy pulls his friend to the side and whispers, ""Jasper, go look in the dictionary and see what 'gonorrhea' means. If it's okay, give me the okay sign."" </p>
<p>So Jasper goes to look it up, comes back, and gives Leroy the big okay sign. Three weeks later Leroy is laid up in the infirmary with a terrible case of gonorrhea. </p>
<p>""Jasper,"" he says, ""why'd you give me the okay?"" </p>
<p>""Well, Leroy, in the dictionary, it say gonorrhea affects only the privates. "" He points to his stripes. . . . ""But we're sergeants now.""</p>

33850,"<p>John Kallam graduated with a BA in criminology and entered the U.S.<br /> Army.  He served for 20 years beginning in the late 1930's.  He was<br /> an investigator during the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals,<br /> and stayed in Germany for many years organizing civilian police forces<br /> in the post-war era.  He also wrote numerous books on criminal<br /> justice.  He retired from military service in the late 1950's at the<br /> rank of full colonel.</p>
<p>Returning to Fresno, California, he began teaching criminology at what<br /> was then Fresno State College.  (Later to become the California State<br /> University, Fresno.)  His work was well respected, but after about ten<br /> years of service, he was called to see the president of the college.</p>
<p>He was informed that he could no longer teach with just a bachelor's<br /> degree.  Times were changing, he was told, and the school demanded<br /> that faculty members hold a graduate degree.  Merely having 20 years<br /> of distinguished experience was no longer considered sufficient<br /> qualification to teach.  All new faculty were being required to hold<br /> a doctorate, it was explained, and the school was actually doing him a<br /> favor by letting him keep his job by getting ""only"" a master's degree.</p>
<p>So John enrolled in a summer program at an out of state college.<br /> Three months of intensive seminars and then nine months of home study<br /> would get him his MA.</p>
<p>On the first day of class, the instructor was taking roll.  He stopped<br /> when he read John's name.  ""Are you related to the John Kallam who<br /> wrote the textbook we'll be using?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""I am the John Kallam who wrote the textbook you're using,"" came the<br /> dry response.</p>

"
33856,"<p>Q. My shift keys have little arrows on them. Does that mean the *real* shift keys are located above them, and these keys are just little signs to point them out?</p>
<p>A. Nope, they're the Real McCoy. The little arrows mean ""up"", as in ""look up at the screen"". Your keyboard is telling you to learn to touch type and quit staring at your fingers.</p>
<p>Q. What happens if I press both shift keys?</p>
<p>A. Even bigger letters may show up on your screen. You should not use this feature, however, because these letters are also brighter, and may cause Screen Burn-In, which would be particularly embarrassing if you were typing something naughty at the time. You might consider obtaining the author's Shift Key Burn-In Protector program for only $139.95. Or you might not, it's your computer, but don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
<p>Q. my religion prohibits the use of shift keys. how can i type capital letters and punctuation</p>
<p>A. Discuss alternatives to the shift key with your spiritual advisor. Perhaps your deity would not be angered by repeated use of the Caps Lock key, or maybe you can retain a consultant to depress the shift for you. You might also consider replacing punctuation marks that require the use of shift keys with lower case expressions; replace ? with ""huh"" and ! with ""zowie"".</p>
<p>Q. I PRESSED SHIFT AND IT""S STUCK DOWN NOW</p>
<p>A. Do small children with a fondness for peanut butter use your keyboard frequently? If so, you may want to clean it off for more reliable operation. First, disconnect your keyboard by gripping each of its ends firmly and pulling as hard as you can. Next, immerse the keyboard in warm water and scrub thoroughly with your favorite lemon-scented detergent and lots of steel wool. Finally, you need to dry the keyboard. Either dry it to touch with a hand held blow dryer, or place it it the dryer for not less than 60 minutes. Be sure to clean the lint screen when you are finished.</p>
<p>Q. Why are there are no ""shift"" keys on my keyboard, but there are two keys labelled ""hif""?</p>
<p>A. Again, you may want to consider cleaning your keyboard, and washing your hands more frequently for that matter.</p>
<p>Q. Are there shift keys on my Macintosh?</p>
<p>A. Yes, although instead of the notation ""shift"", the key may be labelled with an excited Mac face, something like :O . Press this key to use shift, and be thankful you're using a friendly Mac instead of a mean old PC with all them confusin' words 'n stuff on it.</p>
<p>Q. I'm sick of pushing the shift key every single time I want big letters.  Is there any other way to do this?</p>
<p>A. This is the Modern Age of Convenience, and you may be able to activate the shift key merely with the power of your voice! Check to see whether your computer is equipped with speech-recognition equipment by saying the word ""shift"" very clearly and slowly into its speaker. Then watch the keyboard closely to see if the Shift key moves down. Note that you may have to repeat this action several times to ""train"" the computer to recognize your voice before the feature works reliably.</p>
<p>Q. There are two shift keys, which should I use?</p>
<p>A. Avoid unnecessary wear on either shift key by alternating between the two. Keep track of your usage of each key so that you press them in equal amounts. Your keyboard may be equipped with a small notepad; you should use this to make little tally marks in two columns for each time you shift. Remember, it's better to go to a little trouble than wind up with a broken shift key.</p>
<p>Q. Why are the shift keys bigger than the other keys?</p>
<p>A. They aren't. This is simply an optical illusion. Just as the moon appears much larger when it is close to the horizon, your shift keys look larger because of their proximity to other keys. To verify this, go out in a large field at night with your keyboard, place it in an upright position, and view it from a distance of 200 yards. Sure enough, the keys all look the same size!</p>
<p>Q. If I press the shift key at the wrong time, or too many times, will my computer explode?</p>
<p>A. No. Well, generally no. Not unless you are using a NEC laptop. Or vt100 terminal emulation. But even then, hardly ever. Really, don't worry about it. Forget I mentioned it. Just type softly. Move along, next question.</p>
<p>Q. No matter what I do, the shift key just doesn't seem to work. What's wrong?</p>
<p>A. Have you ever considered that the problem may not be your keyboard, the problem may be YOU? Perhaps God Himself has suspended the operation of these keys to send you a Message that you have strayed from the path of righteousness. Use this as an opportunity to reflect on your life.  Before rushing blindly ahead with a lot of shifting, consult the spiritual advisor of your choice for help in dealing with any unresolved issues in your relationship with the Almighty.</p>

33883,"<p>Henry Ford muere y llega al Cielo. En la puerta, San Pedro lo recibe y le dice:</p>
<p>""Bien, t� fuiste una persona buena y ni que decir que tu invenci�n, la l�nea de montaje para autom�viles, cambi� el mundo. Como recompensa, puedes pasear a voluntad en el Cielo. Puedes ir para cualquier lugar"".</p>
<p>Ford piensa por un momento y solicita:</p>
<p>""Yo quiero estar junto a Dios un rato"".</p>
<p>Entonces, San Pedro le pide a un �ngel que acompa�e a Ford a la sala privada del Todopoderoso. Ford entra en la sala y le pregunta a Dios con reverencia:</p>
<p>""Se�or Todopoderoso, cuando inventaste a la mujer, �en qu� pensabas?""</p>
<p>""�Qu� quieres decir con eso?""</p>
<p>�Bueno, Se�or, hay grandes problemas en el proyecto de tu invenci�n:</p>
<p>1. No existe ning�n modelo econ�mico.<br /> 2. Hace mucho ruido cuando se calienta.<br /> 3. El mantenimiento es extremadamente caro.<br /> 4. Necesita constantemente de pintura.<br /> 5. Tiene que parar 5 d�as de cada 28.<br /> 6. El sistema se tapa y es necesario anularle algunos tramos.<br /> 7. Antes del primer tercio de su vida �til se le caen las defensas delanteras y traseras.<br /> 8. Las vestiduras se cuartean a los pocos kil�metros.<br /> 9. El consumo de combustible es asombroso.<br /> 10. Es muy lento comparado con el otro modelo que hiciste.</p>
<p>Y �stos son s�lo algunos de los problemas�.</p>
<p>""Hmmm..., aguarda un minuto"".</p>
<p>Dios va para la Supercomputadora Celestial, hace clic en un icono de la pantalla y, casi instant�neamente, aparece un listado. Dios lee el informe, se vuelve hacia Ford y le dice:</p>

No matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't get her brand new 22 ft Bayliner to perform. It wouldn't get on a plane at all, and it was very sluggish in almost every maneuver, no matter how much power she applied.<br /> After about an hour of trying to make it go, she putted over to a nearby marina. Maybe they could tell her what was wrong. </p>
<p>A thorough topside check revealed everything was in perfect working order. The engine ran fine, the outdrive went up and down, and the prop was the correct size and pitch. So, one of the marina guys jumped in the water to check underneath the boat. He came up choking on water, he was laughing so hard. Under the boat, still strapped securely in place, was the trailer.</p>

The parrot said, ''Pop it up, pop it up!''        They kept on walking to a carnival.  A guy at a gamestand yelled, ''Hit a big one, win a prize!''

<p>The angel thanks Dolly, and asks Her Majesty the same question. The Queen drops her skirt and panties, takes a bottle of Perrier out of her purse, shakes it up, and douches with it. The angel says, ""OK, Your Majesty, you may go in"". </p>
<p>Dolly is outraged. ""What was that all about? I show you two of God's own perfect creations and you turn me down. She performs a rude act of hygiene and she gets in. Can you explain that to me?"" </p>

33939,"<p>The day finally arrived: Forrest Gump dies and goes to Heaven.</p>
<p>He is met at the Pearly Gates by Saint Peter himself. The gates are closed, however, and Forrest approaches the gatekeeper.</p>
<p>Saint Peter says, ""Well, Forrest, it's certainly good to see you. We have heard a lot about you. </p>
<p>I must inform you that the place is filling up fast, and we've been administering an entrance exam for everyone. The tests are fairly short, but you need to pass before you can get into Heaven.""</p>
<p>Forrest responds, ""It shore is good to be here, Saint Peter. I was looking forward to this. Nobody ever told me about any entrance exams Shore hope the test ain't too hard; life was a big enough test as it was.""</p>
<p>Saint Peter goes on, ""Yes, I know Forrest. But, the test I have has only three questions. Here is the first: What days of the week begin with the letter 'T'? Second, how many seconds are there in a year? Third, what is God's first name?""</p>
<p>Forrest goes away to think the questions over. Forrest returns the next day and goes up to Saint Peter to try to answer the exam questions.</p>
<p>Saint Peter waves him up and asks, ""Now that you have had a chance to think the questions over, tell me your answers.""<br /> Forrest says, ""Well, the first one, how many days of the week begin with the letter 'T? Shucks, that one's easy; that'd be Today and Tomorrow.""</p>
<p>The saint's eyes opened wide and he exclaims, ""Forrest! That's not what I was thinking, but...you do have a point though, and I guess I didn't specify, so I give you credit for that answer. How about the next one?"" says Saint Peter. ""How many seconds in a year?""</p>
<p>""Now that one's harder,"" says Forrest. ""But, I thunk and thunk about that, and I guess the only answer can be twelve.""</p>
<p>Astounded, Saint Peter says, ""Twelve! Twelve! Forrest, how could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?""</p>
<p>Forrest says, ""Shucks, there gotta be twelve: January second, February second, March second.......""</p>
<p>""Hold it,"" interrupts Saint Peter. ""I see where you're going with it. And I guess I see your point, though that wasn't quite what I had in mind. I'll give you credit for that one too.""</p>
<p>""Let's go on with the next and final question,"" says Saint Peter. ""Can you tell me God's first name?""</p>
<p>Forrest says, ""Well, shore, I know God's first name. Everybody knows it. It's Howard.""</p>
<p>""Howard?!"" asks Saint Peter. ""What makes you think it's Howard?!""</p>
<p>Forrest answers, ""It's in the prayer.""</p>
<p>""The prayer?"" asks Saint Peter, ""Which prayer?""</p>
<p>""You know, The Lord's Prayer,"" responds Forrest.......</p>

33948,"<p>1. No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen. </p>
<p>2. There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one good child in each. </p>
<p>3. Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course,we know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept),we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc. This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour. </p>
<p>4. The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that ""flying reindeer"" (see point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal anoint, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth. </p>
<p>5. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecrafts re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short,they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force. </p>
<p>In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now.</p>

33988,"<p>Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there were two evil friars living outside this small village. The friars had tried unsuccessfully to overtake and capture the town, but finally this time, they believed they had hit upon a foolproof scheme that would allow them to rule the village. They had, through mad scientist experiments in their floral shop, come up with a plant that would devour the townspeople one by one until none were left. They set forth to put their plan into action by planting the man-eating plants so they encircled the village. As the plants rapidly grew, they began devouring everything living in their path. The townspeople grew frightened; who or what would save them from their eminent doom? Finally, the town's elder remember Hugh, a woodcutter who lived on the outskirts of town. Frantically, the townspeople penned a desperate plea for help, tied it to the leg of a pigeon, and directed the bird toward Hugh's cabin. Meanwhile, outside of town, Hugh had received the note from the townspeople, and realizing they were in grave danger, set forth to do what he needed to do. He honed his mightiest axe to razor-sharpness, grabbed his hat, and off he went. Chopping his way through the dense vines, he single-handedly destroyed the carnivorous plants one by one, until all were destroyed. Then he set out to rid the village of the evil friars, chasing them out of town. The town was saved!!! The people rejoiced and knighted Hugh for his brave and timely efforts to save the village!!! And the moral of the story is: Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.</p>

<p>Out of desperation the man has gone to every doctor and expert in the area. Despite numerous tests and suggested remedies, no reason for his impotence can be found and no cure has worked.</p>
<p>The man decides to share his problem with his best friend. His best friend gets all excited and says, ""I know who can help you! There is mystic and he was able to help someone else I know with the same problem! You must go see him!""</p>
<p>So the man takes his friend's advice and goes to visit this curious mystic. The man explains his problem, the mystic looks him over and says, ""Ah, yes, indeed I can offer a temporary cure.""</p>
<p>The man is just elated, he tells the mystic, ""Whatever it is, please do it! I want to be able to have sex with my wife, please!""</p>
<p>So the mystic nods his head, does a strange dance around the man while murmuring odd sounds, claps his hands and says, ""All done. Now, sir, you will be able to bring on an erection immediately upon counting to three: one, two, three.  Do not count to three until you want your erection. Your erection will continue to last until the count of four is heard: one, two, three, four. After that, you will not be able to obtain an erection again no matter what.""</p>
<p>The man is just so excited, he leaves the mystic and heads home. All he can think about is that tonight he will be having sex again and giving his wife the love session of her life. He cannot wait to surprise her with his eager hard-on that will last and last and last.</p>
<p>That evening, the man is lying in bed waiting for his beautiful wife to walk out of the bathroom and crawl into bed beside him.  </p>
