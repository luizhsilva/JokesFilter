9002,"<p>A retiree was given a set of golf clubs by his co-workers. Thinking he'd try<br /> the game, he asked the local pro for lessons, explaining that he knew nothing<br /> whatever of the game. The pro showed him the stance and swing, then said, ""Just<br /> hit the ball toward the flag on the first green."" </p>
<p>The novice teed up and smacked the ball straight down the fairway and onto the<br /> green, where it stopped inches from the hole. </p>
<p>""Now what?"" the fellow asked the speechless pro. </p>
<p>After he was able to speak again the pro finally said, ""Uh . . . you're<br /> supposed to hit the ball into the cup."" </p>
<p>""Oh great! NOW you tell me,"" said the beginner in a disgusted tone.</p>

9010,"<p>People are always on the lookout for a new diet. The trouble with most diets<br /> is that you don't get enough to eat (the starvation diet), you don't get enough<br /> variation (the liquid diet) or you go broke (the all-meat diet). Consequently,<br /> people tend to cheat on their diets, or quit after 3 days. Well, now there's the<br /> new Toddler Miracle Diet.<br /> Over the years you may have noticed that most two year olds are trim. Now the<br /> formula to their success is available to all in this new diet. You may want to<br /> consult your doctor before embarking on this diet; otherwise, you may be seeing<br /> him afterwards. Good Luck!!! </p>

9020,"<p>There once were two best friends named Bob and Earl. They were two of the<br /> biggest baseball fans in America. Their entire adult lives revolved around<br /> baseball. Bob and Earl discussed baseball history in the winter, and they<br /> examined every box score during the season. They went to over 60 games a year.<br /> They even agreed that whoever died first would try to come back and tell the<br /> other if there was baseball in heaven. </p>
<p>One summer night, Bob passed away in his sleep after watching a Yankee victory<br /> earlier in the evening.  He died a happy man. </p>

9022,"<p>For years and years they told me, </p>
<p>be careful of your breasts. </p>
<p>Don't ever squeeze or bruise them. </p>
<p>And give them monthly tests. </p>
<p>So I heeded all their warnings, </p>
<p>and protected them by law. </p>
<p>Guarded them very carefully, </p>
<p>and I always wore my bra. </p>
<p>After 30 years of astute care, </p>

9025,"<p>A number of years ago, the Seattle Symphony was doing<br /> Beethoven's Ninth under the baton of Milton Katims...</p>
<p>At this point, you must understand two things:</p>
<p>(1)There's a long segment in this symphony where the bass<br /> violins don't have a thing to do. Not a single note for page<br /> after page.</p>
<p>(2)There used to be a tavern called Dez's 400 right across the<br /> street from the Seattle Opera house, rather favored by the local<br /> musicians.</p>
<p>It had been decieded that during this performance, after the<br /> bass players had played their parts in the opening of the Ninth,<br /> they were to quietly lay down their instruments and leave the<br /> stage rather than sitting on their stools looking and feeling<br /> dumb for twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Well, once they got backstage, someone suggested they trot<br /> across the street and quaff a few beers. After they downed the<br /> first couple of rounds, one said, ""Shouldn't we be getting back?<br /> It would be awfully embarrassing if we were late.""</p>
<p>Another, presumably the one who suggested this excersion in the<br /> first place, replied, ""Oh I anticipated that we would need a<br /> little more time, so I tied the last few pages of the<br /> conductor's score together. When he gets down to there, Milton's<br /> going to have to slow the tempo way down while he waves the<br /> baton in one hand and fumble with the string with the other.""</p>
<p>So they had another round and finally returned to the Opera<br /> House, a little tipsy by now. However, as they came back on<br /> stage, one look at their conductor's face told them they were in<br /> serious trouble.</p>
<p>Katims was furious! And why not? After all...</p>
<p>It was the bottom of the Ninth, the score was tied, and the<br /> basses were loaded!</p>

9030,"<p>Dear kindhearted friends... </p>
<p>Now that the holiday season has passed, please look into your heart to help<br /> those in need. </p>
<p>Enron executives in our very own country are living at or just below the<br /> seven-figure salary level. And, as if that weren't bad enough, they will be<br /> deprived of it as a result of the bankruptcy and current SEC investigation. </p>
<p>But now, you can help! For only $20,835 a month, about $694.50 a day (that's<br /> less than the cost of a large screen projection TV) you can help an Enron<br /> executive remain economically viable during his time of need. This contribution<br /> by no means solves the problem, as it barely covers their per diem, ...but it's<br /> a start! </p>
<p>Almost $700 may not seem like a lot of money to you, but to an Enron exec it<br /> could mean the difference between a vacation spent sucking ass in DC, golfing in<br /> Florida or a Mediterranean cruise. For you, seven hundred dollars is nothing<br /> more than rent, a car note or mortgage payments. But to an Enron exec $700 will<br /> almost replace his per diem. </p>
<p>Your commitment of less than $700 a day will enable an Enron exec to buy that<br /> home entertainment center, trade in the year-old Lexus for a new Ferrari, or<br /> enjoy a weekend in Rio.</p>

9035,"<p>I thought I would share a transcript of a particularly productive moment in my 9th grade ""English"" (sic) class: </p>
<p>We watched the end of Zeferelli's ""Romeo &amp; Juliet"" today in class. During the scene in which Romeo discovers Juliet, who appears to be dead, lying in the Capulet family crypt, the following discussion occurred: </p>
<p>Julio Baez: Yo, he's gonna jump on her!<br /> Ms. Young: Julio, nowhere on this planet would that be an appropriate thing to say.<br /> Julio: No, Ms. Young! I think he's a hermaphrodite!<br /> Ms. Young: Julio, he's not a hermaphrodite.<br /> Julio: No, Ms. Young! For real! There's really people who like to have sex with dead people!<br /> Ms. Young: Yes, but they're not called ""hermaphrodites,"" they're called ""necrophiliacs.""<br /> Julio: (Aside to Felix) She's so stupid. (To me) No Ms. Young, necrophiliac is when you have that disease where you can't stop bleeding. </p>
<p>At least they're learning something.</p>

9039,"<p>In 1993, sometime in December, a customer walks in with a dead PowerBook 165. </p>
<p>Fault description: hangs on startup. An additional symptom provided was: whilst being carried from the customer's site to our service center, a 'sloshing' noise was heard within the machine. </p>
<p>""Has anything been split on this computer?"" I inquired, but no, nothing of the sort had happened, protested the client vehemently. Taking this with a grain of salt (no-one's going to admit doing something that totally invalidates their warranty and effectively wrecks their computer) I went about filling in the repair order. Back on the bench, I started the PowerBook up. </p>
<p>Sure enough, an address error on startup, just after 'Welcome to Macintosh'. I lowered my ear to the keyboard, at which point I heard a crackling noise (couldn't hear any sloshing noise though) and became aware of a rather 'sharp' odor which seemed to emanate from the inside of the machine.</p>
<p>Flicking the computer off and unplugging the adapter, I removed the battery from its compartment, only to observe that the entire battery casing was soaked in a fluid which appear to have a rainbow-like sheen (kind of like what a puddle of soapy water would look like -- oily and colorful). I also noticed that the same fluid was leaking out of the battery compartment onto the static mat, but appeared clear rather than multi-colored. My first thoughts were that the battery had somehow leaked acid out into the guts of the PowerBook, which would account for the sharp smell (which reminded me of ammonia), yet the battery terminals were about the one part of the battery that was dry. </p>
<p>No, upon closer examination, I ruled the acid theory out. The battery was wet, but not leaking. Tipping the machine on its side, I watched more fluid run out and coagulate on the bench in a puddle about the size of a compact disc. It was definitely clear, and I observed that the 'rainbow' effect had been caused by the reaction of the plastic battery casing to this 'mystery liquid'. I then unscrewed the computer and separated the two parts of the PowerBook. The smell suddenly became a LOT stronger. T</p>
<p>he hard disk looked like a solid lump of rust, and the daughterboard appeared to have about three barbecued chips. Although I was quickly forming my own opinions on what had happened, I invited several of my workmates in to take a sniff and offer an opinion. We were unanimous in our decision. </p>
<p>I rang the customer, who seemed surprised when I asked the question: ""Do you have a cat?"" As it turned out, he didn't have a cat, but he did have a lovely fluffy bunny rabbit who was seen in the vicinity of the PowerBook only the day before. </p>
<p>Yes, there was no doubt about it, little fluffy had hopped up onto the keyboard and downloaded some incompatible data. I checked the warranty form, but there was no provision for failure due to rabbit urine anywhere. I advised the customer to get in touch with his insurance company. </p>
<p>In the end, the PowerBook was biffed and the customer upgraded to a 180c. I cleaned up the static mat and sprayed the service department with a healthy dosage of ""Fresh Field of Flowers."" </p>
<p>I checked in with the customer about a week later, asked how was he enjoying the 180c, asked if he'd managed to restore his data, and, of course, asked how was his rabbit? </p>
<p>""Delicious,"" he said.</p>

<p>Doctor: That's correct.</p>

<p>Doctor: No, I performed the autopsy.</p>
<p>Attorney: Okay, were you aware of his vital signs while he was at the<br /> hospital?</p>
<p>Doctor: Yes, he came in to the emergency room in shock and died in the<br /> emergency room a short time after arriving.</p>
<p>Attorney: Did you pronounce him dead at that time?</p>
<p>Doctor: No, I am the pathologist who performed the autopsy. I was not<br /> involved with the patient initially.</p>
<p>Attorney: Well, are you even sure, then, that he died in the emergency<br /> room?</p>
<p>Doctor: That is what the records indicate.</p>
<p>Attorney: But if you weren't there, how could you have pronounced him<br /> dead, having not seen or physically examined the patient at that time?</p>
<p>Doctor: The autopsy showed massive hemorrhage into the chest, and that was<br /> the cause of death.</p>
<p>Attorney: I understand that, but you were not actually present to examine<br /> the patient and pronounce him dead, isn't that right?</p>
<p>Doctor: No, sir, I did not see the patient or actually pronounce him dead,<br /> but I did perform an autopsy and right now his brain is in a jar over at<br /> the county morgue. As for the rest of the patient, for all I know, he<br /> could be out practicing law somewhere.</p>

9048,"<p>Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the ""in-flight safety lecture"" and their other announcements a bit more entertaining.</p>
<p>Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:</p>
<p>1. From a Southwest Airlines employee.... ""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane...""</p>
<p>2. Pilot-""Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land...it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern.""</p>
<p>3. After landing: ""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.</p>
<p>4. As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella. WHOA!""</p>
<p>5. After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: ""Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted.""</p>
<p>6. From a Southwest Airlines employee.... ""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love more.</p>
<p>7. Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you or your money, more than Southwest Airlines.""</p>
<p>8. ""Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments.""</p>
<p>9. ""As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.""</p>
<p>10. ""Last one off the plane must clean it.""</p>
<p>11. From the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry... Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...!</p>
<p>12. Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach, the Captain was really having to fight it After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA and announced, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate!""</p>
<p>13. Another flight Attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.""</p>
<p>14. An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile, and give them a ""Thanks for flying XYZ airline."" He said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally, everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane. She said, ""Sonny, mind if I as you a question?"" ""Why no, Ma'am,"" said the pilot, ""what is it?"" The little old lady said, ""Did we land or were we shot down?""</p>
<p>15. After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant came on with, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.</p>
<p>16. Part of a Flight Attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of us here at US Airways.""</p>

9051,"<p>Two guys were traveling through the upper mid-west one February when it started to snow. Being guys, of course they pressed on even when road conditions were totally white-out, and they ended up in a ditch.  Try as they might, they couldn't get the car un-stuck.   One of the travelers spotted a light on the hill next to the road and said, 'That looks like a farm up there, lets go up and see if we can get out of this blizzard.' The other guy agrees and up the hill they go. When they got to the farm they found the occupant was  a real nice lady and they asked if they can stay in  the barn until the storm blows over, and they can  dig their car out.   The lady invites them in and makes them some hot coffee, as clearly they're very chilled.. During the conversation over the warm brew, they learn that she is a widow, living alone.After several cups of coffee, she announces that she sees no reason for such nice guys to sleep in the barn when she has this big empty comfortable 4 bedroom house and it won't be necessary for them to stay in the barn as there is plenty of room in the house.After some more pleasant conversation everyone turns in. The next morning the roads are clear and after a nice big breakfast the two guys thank the widow for her hospitality and depart.   About nine months later one of the guys receives a registered letter from a law firm in the state where they met the widow. He calls his buddy and asks, 'Do you remember the night we stayed with that lady during the big blizzard?'   'Sure,' his buddy replied. 'Why?'   'Did you sneak into her room, make love and give her my name as yours?'   'Well yes,' his friend said, 'but you are single and sleeping around and I'm married, so I thought that you'd understand and not mind.'Naw, thats fine,' his buddy replied.  'Just wanted you to know she died and left me her farm.'</p>

9063,"<p>This Irish guy goes into a bar in the Greek Islands. Sinead, an<br /> Irish student who is currently working behind the bar, takes his<br /> order and notices his Irish accent. Over the course of the<br /> night, they talk quite a bit. At the end of the night, he asks<br /> her to sleep with him. Although she fancies him, she says no. He<br /> then offers to pay her 100 quid for the deed. Sinead is<br /> travelling the world, and because she is strapped for cash, she<br /> agrees.</p>
<p>The next night, the same guy turns up, and after showing her<br /> plenty of attention throughout the night, he asks her to sleep<br /> with him again for 100 quid. She figures ""in for a penny - in<br /> for a pound,"" and as it was fantastic the night before, she goes<br /> home with him again.</p>
<p>This goes on for 5 nights. On the sixth night the guy comes into<br /> the bar, but this night he just orders a beer and sits in the<br /> corner. Sinead is disappointed, and figures that maybe she<br /> should pay him more attention.</p>
<p>She goes over and sits beside him. She asks him where he's from,<br /> and he says, ""Cork."" ""Wow,"" she says, ""Me too! - what part?""<br /> ""Montenotte,"" he says. ""Jesus, that's amazing,"" she says, ""Which<br /> street?"" To which he names the street. She is truly gobsmacked.<br /> ""This is uncanny,"" she says, ""what number?"" ""Number 20.""

9109,"<p>WASHINGTON, DC - President Bush expressed frustration and anger Monday over a<br /> U.N. report stating that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein is now fully complying<br /> with weapons inspections. ""Enough is enough,"" a determined Bush told reporters.<br /> ""We are not fooled by Saddam's devious attempts to sway world opinion by doing<br /> everything the U.N. asked him to do. We will not be intimidated into backing<br /> down and, if we have any say in the matter, neither will Saddam."" Bush added<br /> that any further Iraqi attempt to meet the demands of the U.N. or U.S. will be<br /> regarded as ""an act of war.""</p>

9127,"<p>An Irishman named Murphy went to his doctor after a long illness. The doctor, after a lengthy examination, sighed and looked Murphy in the eye and said, ''I've some bad news for you... you have the cancer and it can't be cured. I'd give you two weeks to a month.''  Murphy, shocked and saddened by the news, but of solid character, managed to compose himself and walk from the doctor's office into the waiting room.  There he saw his son who had been waiting. Murphy said, ''Son, we Irish celebrate when things are good and celebrate when things don't go so well.  In this case, things aren't so well. I have cancer and I've been given a very short time to live.  Let's head for the pub and have a few pints.'' After three or four pints the two were feeling a little less somber.  There were some laughs and more beers. They were eventually approached by some of Murphy's old friends who asked what the two were celebrating. Murphy told them that the Irish celebrate the good and the bad... He went on to tell them that they were drinking to his impending end. He told his friends, ''I've only got a few weeks to live as I have been diagnosed with AIDS.''  The friends gave Murphy their condolences and they had a couple more beers.  After his friends left, Murphy's son leaned over and whispered his confusion... ''Dad I thought you said that you were dying from cancer.  You just told your friends that you were dying from AIDS?'' Murphy said, ''I am dying from cancer son - I just don't want any of them sleeping with your mother after I'm gone.''</p>

9128,"<p>A police chief, a fire chief, and a city manager were traveling together by car to a municipal management conference in a distant city. Their car broke down in a rural area, and they were forced to seek shelter for the night at a nearby farmhouse. The farmer welcomed them in, but cautioned them that there were only two spare beds, and that one of them would have to sleep in the barn with the farm animals. After a short conference, the police chief agreed to take the barn. Shortly after retiring, a knock was heard on the door of the farmhouse. The party inside answered to find the police chief standing there, complaining that he could not sleep. There were pigs in the barn, he said, and he was reminded of the days when everyone called him a pig. The fire chief then volunteered to exchange with the police chief. A short time later, another knock was heard at the door. The fire chief complained that the cows in the barn reminded him of Mrs. O'Leary's cow that started the Chicago fire, and that every time he started to go to sleep, he started to have a fireman's worst nightmare, that of burning to death. The city attorney, in desperation for sleep, then agreed to sleep in the barn. This seemed like a good idea until a few minutes later, when another knock was heard at the door. When the occupants answered the door, there stood the very indignant cows and pigs.</p>

9172,"<p>Jim and Ethel had started their retirement years and decided to raise some extra cash by advertising for a lodger in their two-up two-down terrace house.</p>
<p>After a few days an attractive young woman applies for the room and explains that she is a model working in a nearby studio downtown for a few weeks and that she would like the room for Mondays thru Thursdays, but would pay for the whole week. Ethel shows her the house and they agree to start straight away.</p>
<p>""There's just one problem,"" explains the model. ""Because of my job I have to have a bath every night, and I notice you don't have a bath.""</p>
<p>""That's not a problem,"" replies Ethel, ""we have a tin bath out in the yard and we bring it in to the living room, in front of the fire, and fill it with hot water.""</p>
<p>""What about your husband?"" asks the model.</p>
<p>""Oh, he plays darts most weekdays, so he'll be out in the evenings,"" replies Ethel.</p>
<p>""Good,"" says the model, ""that's settled. I'll go to the studio and see you tonight.""</p>
<p>That evening Jim dutifully goes to his darts match whilst Ethel prepares the bath for the model. After stripping off the model steps into the bath and Ethel is amazed to see that she has no pubic hair. The model notices Ethel's staring eyes, smiles and explains that it is part of her job to shave herself especially when modelling swim wear or underclothes.</p>
<p>Later when Jim returns, Ethel relates this oddity and he does not believe her. ""It's true, I tell you,"" says Ethel. ""Look, if you don't believe me, tomorrow night I'll leave the curtains slightly open and you can peek in and see for yourself.""</p>
<p>The next night Jim leaves as usual and Ethel prepares the bath for the model. As the model steps naked into the bath, Ethel, standing behind her, looks towards the curtains, and points towards the model's hairless crotch. Then she lifts up her skirt and wearing no panties, points to her own hairy mass.</p>
<p>Later Jim returns and they retire to bed. ""Well do you believe me now?"" she asks Jim.</p>
<p>""Yes,"" he replies. ""I've never seen anything like it in my life. But, why did you lift up your skirt and show yours too?</p>
<p>""Just to show you the difference,"" answers Ethel, ""but anyway you've seen me with no knickers on thousands of times.""</p>
<p>""Yes,"" says Jim, ""I have...but the rest of the fucking darts team haven't.""</p>

9196,"<p>An open letter to the rest of America:</p>
<p>America has engaged in some finger wagging lately because<br /> California doesn't have enough electricity to meet its needs.<br /> The rest of the country (including George W. Bush's energy<br /> secretary Spencer Abraham, who wants Californians to suffer<br /> through blackouts as justification for drilling for oil in<br /> Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) seems to be just fine<br /> with letting Californians dangle in the breeze without enough<br /> power to meet their needs. They laugh at Californians'<br /> frivolity. Well, everybody. Here's how it really is:</p>
<p>California ranks 48th in the nation in power consumed per<br /> person. California grows more than half the nation's fruit, nuts<br /> and vegetables. We're keeping them. We need something to eat<br /> when the power goes out. We grow 99 percent or more of the<br /> nation's almonds, artichokes, dates, figs, kiwifruit, olives,<br /> persimmons, pistachios, prunes, raisins and walnuts. Hope you<br /> won't miss them. California is the nation's number one dairy<br /> state. We're keeping our dairy products. We'll need plenty of<br /> fresh ones since our refrigerators can't be relied upon. Got<br /> milk?</p>
<p>We Californians are gonna keep all our high-tech software in<br /> state. Silicon Valley is ours, after all. Without enough<br /> electricity, which you're apparently keeping for yourselves, we<br /> just plain don't have enough software to spare. We're keeping<br /> all our airplanes. California builds a good percentage of the<br /> commercial airliners available to fly you people to where you<br /> want to go. When yours wear out, you'd better hope Boeing's<br /> Washington plant can keep you supplied. There isn't enough<br /> electricity here to allow us to export any more planes than we<br /> need ourselves. And while we're at it, we're keeping all our<br /> high tech aerospace stuff, too, like the sophisticated weapons<br /> systems that let you sleep at night, not worried you might wake<br /> up under the rule of some foreign kook. Oh, yeah, and if you<br /> want to make a long-distance call, remember where the satellite<br /> components and tracking systems come from. Maybe you could get<br /> back in the habit of writing letters. Want to see a blockbuster<br /> movie this weekend? Come to California. We make them here. Since<br /> we'll now have to make them with our own electricity, we're<br /> keeping them. Even if we shot them somewhere else, the labs,<br /> printing facilities, editing facilities, and sound facilities<br /> are all here.</p>
<p>Want some nice domestic wine? We produce over 17 million gallons<br /> per year. We'll need all of it to drown our sorrows when we<br /> think about the fact that no matter how many California products<br /> we export to make the rest of America's lives better, America<br /> can't see its way clear to help us out with a little<br /> electricity. You can no longer have any of our wine. You all<br /> complain that we don't build enough power plants. Well, you<br /> don't grow enough food, write enough software, make enough<br /> movies, build enough airplanes and defense systems or make<br /> enough wine. This is your last warning, America. Lighten (us) up<br /> before it's too late.</p>

He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency operation, was told by the doctor that he'd been given a glass eye. The man looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his original eye colour was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged. ''I can't walk around like this!!""""Sir,"" the doctor said, ""there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.'' A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the road before finally hitting a tree. The man screeched to a halt, and ran down the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye! As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, no one was about. So the man proceeded to get a screwdriver and removed one of the deceased man's blue eyes, replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to have the replacement blue eye fitted. A few days later, the man was driving along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads. ''Excuse me, sir,"" said the policeman.""Do you know anything about this at all?''''No, constable'', said the man.''Well, we can't figure this out. Somehow, this bloke managed to drive 40 miles with two glass eyes!''</p>

9259,"<p>This is supposedly a true story from a recent Defence Science Lectures<br /> Series, as related by the head of the Australian DSTO's Land<br /> Operations/Simulation division.</p>
<p>They've been working on some really nifty virtual reality simulators, the<br /> case in point being to incorporate Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters into<br /> exercises (from the data fusion point of view). Most of the people they<br /> employ on this sort of thing are ex- (or future) computer game programmers.<br /> Anyway, as part of the reality parameters, they include things like trees<br /> and animals. For the Australian simulation they included kangaroos.  In<br /> particular, they had to model kangaroo movements and reactions to<br /> helicopters (since hordes of disturbed kangaroos might well give away a<br /> helicopter's position).</p>
<p>Being good programmers, they just stole some code (which was originally used<br /> to model infantry detachments reactions under the same stimuli), and changed<br /> the mapped icon, the speed parameters, etc. The first time they've gone to<br /> demonstrate this to some visiting Americans, the hotshot pilots have decided<br /> to get ""down and dirty"" with the virtual kangaroos. So, they buzz them, and<br /> watch them scatter. The visiting Americans nod appreciatively... then gape<br /> as the kangaroos duck around a hill, and launch about two dozen Stinger<br /> missiles at the hapless helicopter.  Programmers look rather embarrassed at<br /> forgetting to remove that part of the infantry coding... and Americans<br /> leave muttering comments about not wanting to mess with the Aussie<br /> wildlife...</p>
<p>As an addendum, simulator pilots from that point onwards avoided kangaroos<br /> like the plague, just like they were meant to do in the first place...</p>

9278,"<p>'Twas the night before Christmas, and God it was neatThe kids were both gone, and my wife was in heatThe doors were all bolted, and the phone off the hookIt was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook.Momma in her teddy, and I in the nudeHad just hit the bedroom and reached for the lubeWhen out on the lawn there arose such a cry,That I lost my boner and poor momma went dry.Up to the window I sprang like an elf,Tore back the shade while she played with herself.The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built,Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.When what to my wondering eyes should appear,But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangy reindeer.With a fat little driver, half out of his sled,A sock in his ear, and a bra on his head.Sure as I'm speaking, he was as high as a kite.And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right.Whoa Shithead, whoa Asshole, whoa Stupid, whoa Putz,Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your nuts.Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree,Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee.They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub,Just as Santa leaned out and threw up on my shrub.And then from the roof we heard such a clatter,As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder.I was donning my jacket to cover my ass,When down the chimney Santa came with a crash.His suit was all smelly with perfume galore,He looked like a bum and he smelled like a whore.""That was some brothel,"" he said with a smile,""The reindeer are pooped, and I'll just stay here awhile.He walked to the kitchen, himself poured a drink,Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink.I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee,The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee.Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack,But his toys were all gone, and some new things werepacked.The first thing he found was a pair of false tits,The next was a handgun with a penis that spits.A box filled with condoms was Santa's next find,And a six pair of panties, the edible kind.A bra without nipples, a penis extension,And several other things that I shouldn't even mention.A cock ring, a G-string, and all types of oil,A dildo so long, it lay in a coil.""This stuff ain't for kids, Mrs. Santa will shit,So I'll leave 'em here, and then I'll just split.""He filled every stocking and then took his leave,With one tiny butt plug tucked under his sleeve.He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead,Thus he fell on his ass and broke wind instead.In time he was seated, took the reins of his hitch,Saying, ""Take me home Rudolph, this night's been a bitch!""The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout,""The best thing about sex is that it never wears out!""</p>

9281,"<p>One day at a busy airport, the passengers on a commercial airliner are seated waiting for the pilot to show up so they can get under way.</p>
<p>The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle. </p>
<p>Both appear to be blind; the pilot is using a white cane, bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle. </p>
<p>The copilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered with sunglasses.</p>
<p>At first, the passengers do not react thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke. After a few minutes though, the engines start revving, and the airplane begins moving down the runway.</p>
<p>The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness. They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance.</p>
<p>Yet, the plane starts accelerating rapidly, and people begin panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical.</p>
<p>When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once. At the very last moment, the plane lifts off and is airborne.</p>
<p>Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: ""You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream, and we aren't going to know when to take off!""</p>

After one year and $180,000.00, theyconcluded that the reason the head was larger than the shaft was to givethe Man more pleasure during sex.After Duke published the study, Stanford decided to do their own study.After three years of research and $250,000.00, they concluded that thereason was to give the Woman more pleasure during sex.The University of Wisconsin, unsatisfied with these findings, spent$13.27 (for a Playboy, Penthouse, and a case of Old Milwaukee) andconcluded that it was to keep a man's hand from flying off and hittinghim in the forehead.</p>
"
9288,"<p>Occasionally, airline flight attendants make an effort to make<br /> the ""in-flight safety lecture"" a bit more entertaining. Here are<br /> some real examples that have been heard or reported:</p>
<p>""As we prepare for takeoff, please make sure your tray tables<br /> and seat backs are fully upright in their most uncomfortable<br /> position.""</p>
<p>""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 6<br /> ways out of this airplane...""</p>
<p>""Your seat cushions can be used for floatation, and in the event<br /> of an emergency water landing, please take them with our<br /> compliments.""</p>
<p>""We do feature a smoking section on this flight; if you must<br /> smoke, contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort<br /> you to the wing of the airplane.""</p>
<p>""Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught<br /> smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane<br /> immediately.""</p>
<p>Pilot - ""Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I<br /> am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move<br /> about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we<br /> land... it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it<br /> affects the flight pattern.""</p>
<p>And, after landing: ""Thank you for flying Delta Business<br /> Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as<br /> we enjoyed taking you for a ride.""</p>
<p>As we waited just off the runway for another airliner to cross<br /> in front of us, some of the passengers were beginning to<br /> retrieve luggage from the overhead bins. The head attendant<br /> announced on the intercom, ""This aircraft is equipped with a<br /> video surveillance system that monitors the cabin during<br /> taxiing. Any passengers not remaining in their seats until the<br /> aircraft comes to a full and complete stop at the gate will be<br /> strip-searched as they leave the aircraft.""</p>
<p>Once on a Southwest flight, the pilot said, ""We've reached our<br /> cruising altitude now, and I'm turning off the seat belt sign.<br /> I'm switching to autopilot, too, so I can come back there and<br /> visit with all of you for the rest of the flight.""</p>
<p>As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington<br /> National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big<br /> fella...WHOA..!""</p>
<p>""Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the<br /> overhead area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose<br /> before assisting children or adults acting like children.""</p>
<p>""As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your<br /> belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly<br /> among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or<br /> spouses.""</p>
<p>""Last one off the plane must clean it.""</p>
<p>And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased<br /> to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry...<br /> Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...!""</p>
<p>Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in<br /> Salt Lake City: The flight attendant came on the intercom and<br /> said, ""That was quite a bump and I know what ya'll are thinking.<br /> I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airline's fault, it wasn't<br /> the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendant's fault.....it<br /> was the asphalt!""</p>
<p>An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had<br /> hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a<br /> policy which required the first officer to stand at the door<br /> while the passengers exited, give a smile, and a ""Thanks for<br /> flying XYZ airline."" He said that in light of his bad landing,<br /> he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking<br /> that someone would have a smart comment. Finally everyone had<br /> gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane.<br /> She said, ""Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?"" ""Why no Ma'am,""<br /> said the pilot, ""What is it?"" The little old lady said, ""Did we<br /> land or were we shot down?""</p>
<p>Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas,<br /> on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach<br /> the Captain was really having to fight it. After an extremely<br /> hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA and announced,<br /> ""Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in<br /> your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis<br /> what's left of our airplane to the gate!""</p>
<p>Another flight Attendant's comment on a less than perfect<br /> landing: ""We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo<br /> bounces us to the terminal.""</p>
<p>After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in<br /> Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced:<br /> ""Please take care when opening the overhead compartments<br /> because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has<br /> shifted.""</p>
<p>From a Southwest Airlines employee.... ""Welcome aboard Southwest<br /> Flight XXX, to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal<br /> tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every<br /> other seatbelt, and if you don't know how to operate one, you<br /> probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event<br /> of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend<br /> from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it<br /> over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you,<br /> secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are<br /> traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love<br /> more.""</p>
<p>Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken<br /> clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive.<br /> Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more<br /> than Southwest Airlines.""</p>

9310,"<p>A guy was sitting around his house watching TV when he realized he was pretty freakin horny. So he hoppped into his car and drove to his local bordello(whorehouse). When he arrived, he walked up to the madam and realized he only had a five dollar bill. He looked up pittifully at the madam and asked what he could get for five dollars. After a few moments of thought she replied that she would allow him to have his way with a chicken for five dollars. The man was infuriated and began to walk back to his car when the feeling hit him again. He turned promtly around and went back into the bordello(whorehouse). He agreed sheepishly to scronck the chicken. She directed him down the hall and into the third door on the left wherein stood the ususpecting chicken. The chicken bolted!--The man gave chase! After some time the man caught her by the neck.(it was a HER, this guy wasn't a pervert or anything)He began to ""do his thing"" to the chicken. He did it hard!--He did it fast!--Feathers were flying!--Eyeballs were nearly popping out! The next morning the man woke up in his bed and went to work. All day, the chicken commanded his thoughts.

9313,"<p>An elderly woman walked into the main office of Chase Manhattan<br /> Bank building, holding a large paper bag in her hand. She told<br /> the young man at the teller's window that she wished to deposit<br /> the $3 million in the bag and open an account at the bank. She<br /> said that first, though, she wished to meet the president of the<br /> bank due to the amount of money involved. The teller thought<br /> that to be a reasonable request, and, after opening the bag and<br /> seeing bundles of $1000 bills, which amounted to approximately<br /> $3,000,000, telephoned the bank president's secretary for an<br /> appointment for the lady.</p>
<p>The woman was escorted upstairs and ushered into the president's<br /> office. Introductions were made, and she stated that she liked<br /> to get to know people she did business with on a more personal<br /> basis. The president then asked her how she came into such a<br /> large sum of cash. ""Was it inherited?"" he asked. ""No,"" she<br /> replied. He was quiet for several seconds, trying to think of<br /> where this elderly lady could possibly have come into $3 million.</p>
<p>""I bet,"" she offered. ""As in horses?"". ""No,"" she replied, ""as in<br /> people"". Seeing his confusion, she explained that she just bet<br /> on different things with people. Suddenly, she said, ""I'll bet<br /> you 25,000 that by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning your balls will<br /> be square.""</p>
<p>The bank president figured she must be off her rocker and<br /> decided to take her up on the bet. He didn't know how he could<br /> lose. For the rest of the day, he was extremely cautious--he<br /> decided to stay home that evening and take no chances. $25,000<br /> was at stake.</p>
<p>When he got up in the morning and took his shower, he checked to<br /> make certain that everything was O.K. There was no change in his<br /> scrotal appearance. He looked the same as always. He went to his<br /> office and waited for the woman to come in at 10AM, humming as<br /> he went. He knew this was his lucky day. How often did he get<br /> handed $25,000 for doing nothing?</p>
<p>At 10 o'clock sharp, the woman was shown into his office. With<br /> her was a man. When the bank president asked her what the other<br /> man was with her for, she informed the president that he was her<br /> lawyer and she always took him along when there was this much<br /> money involved in her betting.</p>
<p>""Well,"" she asked, ""what about our bet?"" ""I don't know how to<br /> tell you this,"" he said, ""but I'm the same as I've always been,<br /> only $25,000 richer."" The old lady asked him to drop his pants<br /> so they could all see. The president complied. The old lady<br /> peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel<br /> them. ""Well, okay,"" said the president, ""$25,000 is a lot of<br /> money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure."" Just then, he<br /> noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the<br /> wall. The president asked the old lady, ""What's wrong with him?""<br /> She replied, ""Nothing, except that I bet him $100,000 that by<br /> 10am today I'd have the Chase Manhattan Bank's president's balls<br /> in my hand.""</p>

<p>The third day, the hunter was really irate and decided he would torture and kill that bear! </p>

<p>I'm very good at opening child-proof caps with a hammer. </p>
<p>I'm usually interested in going home before I get to where I'm going. </p>
<p>I'm good on a trip for at least an hour without my aspirin, beano, &amp; antacid. </p>
<p>I'm awake many hours before my body allows me to get up. </p>
<p>I'm smiling all the time because I can't hear a word you are saying. </p>
<p>I'm aware that other people's grandchildren are not as bright as mine. </p>
<p>I'm so cared for: Long term care, Eye care, Private care, Dental care... </p>
<p>I'm not grouchy, I just don't like traffic, waiting, crowds, children, politicians. </p>
<p>I'm sure everything I can't find is in a secure place. </p>
<p>I'm wrinkled, saggy and bumpy and that's just my left leg. </p>
<p>I'm realizing that aging is not for sissies. </p>
<p>I'm anti-everything now: Anti-fat, Anti-smoke, Anti-noise, Anti-inflammatory </p>
<p>I'm going to reveal what goes on behind closed doors... Absolutely nothing! </p>
<p>I'm sure they are making adults much younger these days. </p>
<p>I'm in the initial stage of my golden years: SS, CD's, IRA's, AARP. . . </p>
<p>I'm wondering... If you're only as old as you feel, how could I be alive at 150? </p>
<p>I'm supporting all movements now... by eating bran, prunes and raisins. </p>
<p>I'm a walking storeroom of facts... I've just lost the storeroom. </p>

9363,"<p>A highly timid little man, Casper Milquetoast, ventured into a biker bar in the Bronx and clearing his throat asked, 'Um, err, which of you gentlemen owns the Doberman tied outside to the parking meter?' A giant of a man, wearing biker leathers, his body hair growing out through the seams, turned slowly on his stool, looked down at the quivering little man and said, 'It's my dog. Why?' 'Well,' squeaked the little man, obviously very nervous, 'I believe my dog just killed it, sir.' 'What?' roared the big man in disbelief. 'What in the hell kind of dog do you have?' 'Sir,' answered the little man, 'It's a four week old puppy.' 'Bull!' roared the biker, 'How could your puppy kill my Doberman?' 'It appears that he choked on it, sir.'</p>

9365,"<p>November 22, 1996 - Any More Complaints? The controller working a busy pattern told the 727 on downwind to make a 360 (do a complete circle, usually done to provide spacing between aircraft). The pilot of the 727 complained, ""Do you know it costs us two thousand dollars to make a 360 in this airplane?"" </p>
<p>Without missing a beat the controller replied, ""Roger, give me four thousand dollars worth.""<br /> *************************<br /> November 15, 1996 - What the...?! PSA was following United, taxiing out for departure. PSA called the tower and said ""Tower, this is United 586. We've got a little problem, so go ahead and let PSA go first."" </p>
<p>The tower promptly cleared PSA fortakeoff before United had a chance to object to the impersonation.<br /> *************************<br /> November 8, 1996 - Which Exit Did You Say That Was? A DC-10 had an exceedingly long landing rollout after landing with his approach speed just a little too high...San Jose</p>
<p>Tower: ""American 751 Heavy, turn right at the end if able. If not able, take the Guadalupe exit off of Highway 101 back to the airport.""<br /> *************************<br /> November 1, 1996 - Ouch! Western Airlines had a term for its second officers. The term was ""GIB,"" and stood for ""Guy In Back."" The term was strictly unofficial and was actually frowned upon by the management at Western. It seems that some wise-guy pilot had been browsing through a dictionary and had made the discovery that a ""gib"" is a castrated tomcat.<br /> *************************<br /> October 11, 1996 - What Is That Thang? It was a really nice day, right about dusk, and a Piper Malibu was being vectored into a long line of airliners in order to land at Kansas City... </p>
<p>KC Approach: ""Malibu three-two-Charlie, you're following a 727, one o'clock and three miles. </p>
<p>""Three-two-Charlie: ""We've got him. We'll follow him."" </p>
<p>KC Approach: ""Delta 105, your traffic to follow is a Malibu, eleven o'clock and three miles. Do you have that traffic? </p>
<p>""Delta 105: (long pause and then in a thick southern drawl) ""Well... I've got something down there. Can't quite tell if it's a Malibu or a Chevelle, though.""<br /> *************************<br /> September 6, 1996 - Mmmm-mmm, Good! Tower: ""Eastern 702, cleared for takeoff, contact Departure on 124.7."" </p>
<p>Eastern 702: ""Tower, Eastern 702 switching to Departure... by the way, as we lifted off, we saw some kind of dead animal on the far end of the runway."" </p>
<p>Tower: ""Continental 635, cleared for takeoff, contact Departure on 124.7... did you copy the report from Eastern?"" </p>
<p>Continental 635: ""Continental 635, cleared for takeoff... and yes, we copied Eastern and we've already notified our caterers.""<br /> *************************<br /> June 28, 1996 - No, That's not what I Said! O'Hare Approach Control: ""United 329, traffic is a Fokker, one o'clock, 3 miles, eastbound."" </p>
<p>United 329: ""Approach, I've always wanted to say this... I've got that Fokker in sight.""</p>

9366,"<p>'Twas the week after Christmas, and all through the house<br /> Nothing would fit me, not even a blouse.<br /> The cookies I'd nibbled, the eggnog I'd taste<br /> At the holiday parties had gone to my waist. </p>
<p>When I got on the scales there arose such a number!<br /> When I walked to the store (less a walk than a lumber). </p>
<p>I'd remember the marvelous meals I'd prepared;<br /> The gravies and sauces and beef nicely rared, </p>
<p>The wine and the rum balls, the bread and the cheese<br /> And the way I'd never said, ""No thank you, please."" </p>
<p>As I dressed myself in my husband's old shirt<br /> And prepared once again to do battle with dirt--- </p>
<p>I said to myself, as I only can<br /> ""You can't spend a winter disguised as a man!"" </p>
<p>So--away with the last of the sour cream dip,<br /> Get rid of the fruit cake, every cracker and chip </p>
<p>Every last bit of food that I like must be banished<br /> ""Till all the additional ounces have vanished. </p>
<p>I won't have a cookie--not even a lick.<br /> I'll want only to chew on a long celery stick. </p>
<p>I won't have hot biscuits, or corn bread, or pie,<br /> I'll munch on a carrot and quietly cry. </p>
<p>I'm hungry, I'm lonesome, and life is a bore---<br /> But isn't that what January is for? </p>
<p>Unable to giggle, no longer a riot.<br /> Happy New Year to all and to all a good diet!</p>

9369,"<p>A guy walked into a pet store looking for a Christmas gift for his wife. The storekeeper said he knew exactly what would please her and took a little bird out of its cage.</p>
<p>""This is Chet,"" he said, ""and Chet can sing Christmas carols and songs."" Seeing the look of disbelief on the customer's face, he proceeded to demonstrate.</p>
<p>""He needs warming up,"" he said. ""Lend me your cigarette lighter.""<br /> The storekeeper lifted Chet's left wing and waved the flame lightly under it. Immediately, Chet sang: Oh Come, All Ye Faithful.</p>
<p>""That's fantastic,"" said the customer.</p>
<p>""And listen to this,"" said the storekeeper, warming Chet's other wing.<br /> Chet sang: O Little Town of Bethlehem.</p>
<p>""Wrap him up,"" said the customer, ""I'll take him!""</p>
<p>When he got home he greeted his wife: ""Honey, I can't wait until Christmas to show you what I got you. This is fantastic.""</p>
<p>He unwrapped Chet's cage and showed the bird to his wife. ""Now, watch and listen.""</p>
<p>He raised Chet's left wing and held him over a Christmas candle that was burning on the mantlepiece. Chet immediately began to sing Silent Night. The wife was delighted. As Chet's right wing was warmed over the flame, he sang Joy To The World.</p>
<p>""Let me try it,"" said the wife, seizing he bird. In her eagerness, she held Chet a little too close to the candle flame. Chet began to sing passionately:</p>
<p>""Chet's nuts roasting on an open fire!""</p>

<p>Soon, a wee baby boy was brought into the world. ""Whoa there Scotty!"" said the doctor. ""Don't be in a rush to put the lantern down...I think there's yet another wee one to come."" </p>
<p>Sure enough, within minutes he had delivered another little baby. ""No, no, don't be in a great hurry to be putting down that lantern, young man...It seems there's yet another one besides!"" cried the doctor.</p>

9397,"<p>The rules at a particular university were such that if the<br /> professor was not present in the classroom by 15 minutes past<br /> the hour, the class was considered a ""walk"" and the students<br /> were free to leave -- with no penalties for missing a class. </p>
<p>The rooms were equipped with the type of wall clocks which<br /> ""jumped"" ahead each minute, in a very noticeable fashion. As it<br /> were, these clocks were not of the most sophisticated<br /> construction. Some enterprising student discovered that if one<br /> were to hit the clock with chalkboard erasers, it would cause<br /> the clock to ""jump"" ahead 1 minute. </p>
<p>So, it became almost daily practice for these students to take<br /> target practice at the clock (this particular professor was not<br /> the most punctual, and the students considered him severely<br /> ""absent-minded""). A few well-aimed erasers, and lo, 15 minutes<br /> were passed, and class dismissed itself. </p>
<p>Well, when the day for the next exam rolled around, the<br /> professor strolled into the room, passed out the exams, and told<br /> the class, ""You have one hour to complete the examination"". </p>
<p>The professor then proceeded to collect the erasers from around<br /> the room, gleefully took aim at the clock. When he had<br /> successfully ""jumped"" the clock forward one hour, he ended the<br /> class and collected the exam papers.</p>

9403,"<p>It was getting a little crowded in heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have a real bummer of a day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day.The next day at 12:01, the first person comes to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly says to the man, 'Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died.''No problem,' the man says. 'I came home to my 25th floor apartment in my lunch hour and caught my wife half-naked and appearing to be having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. I immediately began searching for him. My wife was yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. Just as I was about to giveup, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of that guy!'Well, I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But wouldn't you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn't die. This ticked me off even more. In a rage, I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him. Oddly enough, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony, and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 storeys and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.'The angel sits back and thinks for a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day. It was a crime of passion. So, the angel announces, 'OK sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,' and lets him in. A few seconds later the next guy comes up. 'Before I can let you in, I need to hear about what your day was like when you died.'The man says, 'No problem. But you're not going to believe this. I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. I had been under a lot of pressure so I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side!'Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, starts cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom that broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I'm laying there face up on the ground, unable to move, and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator of all things off the balcony. It falls the 25 floors and lands on top of me, killing me instantly.'The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. 'I could get used to this new policy,' he thinks to himself. 'Very well,' the angel announces, 'welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,' and he lets the man enter.A few seconds later, a third man comes up to the gate. The angel is warming up to his task. 'OK, please tell me what it was like the day you died.'The man says, 'OK, picture this. I'm naked inside this refrigerator. . .'</p>

9413,"<p>Late one Friday night the policeman spotted a man driving very erratically through the streets of Dublin.

And then there was something called ""Happy Hour"" and they served these mar-gar-itos which are quite good. I had four or five o' those.

And the man fumbled around in his coat until he located his bottle of whiskey, which he held up for inspection.The officer sighed, and said, ""Sir, I'm afraid I'll need you to step out of the car and take a breathalyser test.""Indignantly, the man said, ""Why?

"
9414,"<p>A cargo plane is in mid-flight over the ocean when suddenly the cockpit door burst open to reveal an armed, masked hijacker to a startled pilot, copilot, navigator, and stewardess. He held a gun to the pilot's head and said, ""Take this plane to Iraq or I'm gonna spill your brains all over the place. </p>
<p>The pilot calmly reached up, pushed the gun aside and says, ""Look buddy, if you shoot me this plane will crash right into the sea and you'll die along with the rest of us."" </p>
<p>The hijacker thought about it, then held the gun to the copilot's head and said, ""Take this plane to Iraq or I'm gonna spill HIS brains all over the place."" </p>
<p>But the copilot also calmly reached up, pushed the gun aside and said, ""Listen to me. The pilot's got a bad heart and he could keel over at the shock of my being killed. So if you shoot me, this plane will still crash right into the sea and you'll die along with the rest of us."" </p>
<p>The hijacker thought about it for a moment and then held the gun to the navigator's head and repeated, ""Take this plane to Iraq or I'm gonna spill HIS brains all over the place."" </p>
<p>But the navigator calmly reached up, pushed the gun aside and said, ""I wouldn't do that if I were you. Those other two guys have no sense of direction. Without me they couldn't find their way out of a paper bag much less get this plane to Iraq. So if you shoot me, this plane will still crash right into the sea and you'll die along with the rest of us."" </p>
<p>The hijacker thought some more, shrugged and this time held the gun to the stewardess's head and demanded, ""Take this plane to Iraq or I'm gonna spill HER brains all over the place."" </p>
<p>No one says a word, but the stewardess leaned over and whispered something into the hijacker's ear. He turned beet red, dropped his gun, and ran out of the cockpit in a panic. </p>
<p>The crew tracked down the hijacker, who was found cowering behind some crates in the hold, and tied him up. The pilot then asked the stewardess what she said that terrified the man so. </p>
<p>""I told him, sir,"" she replied, ""that if he killed me, HE'd be the one who'd have to give you guys your blowjobs.""</p>

9429,"<p>In the beginning God created Dates. And the date was Monday,<br /> July 4, 4004 B.C. And God said, let there be light; and there<br /> was light. And when there was Light, God saw the Date, that it<br /> was Monday, and he got down to work; for verily, he had a Big<br /> Job to do.</p>
<p>And God made pottery shards and Silurian mollusks and<br /> pre-Cambrian limestone strata; and flints and Jurassic Mastodon<br /> tusks and Picanthopus erectus skulls and Cretaceous placentals<br /> made he; and those cave paintings at Lasceaux. And that was<br /> that, for the first Work Day.</p>
<p>And God saw that he had made many wondrous things, but that he<br /> had not wherein to put it all. And God said, Let the heavens be<br /> divided from earth; and let us bury all of these Things which we<br /> have made in the earth; but not too deep. And God buried all the<br /> Things which he had made, and that was that. And the morning and<br /> the evening and the overtime were Tuesday.</p>
<p>And God said, Let there be water; and let the dry land appear;<br /> and that was that. And God called the dry land Real Estate; and<br /> the water called he the Sea. And in the land and beneath it put<br /> he crude oil, grades one through six; and natural gas put he<br /> thereunder, and prehistoric carboniferous forests yielding<br /> anthracite and other ligneous matter; and all these called he<br /> Resources; and he made them Abundant. And likewise all that was<br /> in the sea, even unto two hundred miles from the dry land,<br /> called he resources; all that was therein, like manganese<br /> nodules, for instance. And the morning unto the evening had been<br /> a long day; which he called Wednesday.</p>
<p>And God said, Let the earth bring forth abundantly every moving<br /> creature I can think of, with or without backbones, with or<br /> without wings or feet, or fins or claws, vestigial limbs and<br /> all, right now; and let each one be of a separate species. For<br /> lo, I can make whatsoever I like, whensoever I like. And the<br /> earth brought forth abundantly all creatures, great and small,<br /> with and without backbones, with and without wings and feet and<br /> fins and claws, vestigial limbs and all, from bugs to<br /> brontosauruses. But God blessed them all, saying, Be fruitful<br /> and multiply and Evolve Not.</p>
<p>And God looked upon the species he hath made, and saw that the<br /> earth was exceedingly crowded, and he said unto them, Let each<br /> species compete for what it needed; for Healthy Competition is<br /> My Law. And the species competeth amongst themselves, the cattle<br /> and the creeping things; and some madeth it and some didn't; and<br /> the dogs ate the dinosaurs and God was pleased. And God took the<br /> bones from the dinosaurs, and caused them to appear mighty old;<br /> and cast he them about the land and the sea. And he took every<br /> tiny creature that had not madeth it, and caused them to become<br /> fossils; and cast he them about likewise. And just to put<br /> matters beyond the valley of the shadow of a doubt God created<br /> carbon dating. And this is the origin of species. And in the<br /> Evening of the day which was Thursday, God saw that he had put<br /> in another good day's work.</p>
<p>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,<br /> which is tall and well-formed and pale of hue: and let us also<br /> make monkeys, which resembleth us not in any wise, but are short<br /> and ill-formed and hairy. And God added, Let man have dominion<br /> over the monkeys and the fowl of the air and every species,<br /> endangered or otherwise. So God created Man in His own image;<br /> tall and well-formed and pale of hue created He him, and nothing<br /> at all like the monkey.</p>
<p>And God said, Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed,<br /> which is upon the face of the earth. But ye shalt not smoketh<br /> it, lest it giveth you ideas. And to every beast of the earth<br /> and every fowl of the air I have given also every green herb,<br /> and to them it shall be for meat. But they shall be for you. And<br /> the Lord God your Host suggesteth that the flesh of cattle goeth<br /> well with that of the fin and the claw; thus shall Surf be<br /> wedded unto Turf.</p>
<p>And God saw everything he had made, and he saw that it was very<br /> good; and God said, It just goes to show Me what the private<br /> sector can accomplish. With a lot of fool regulations this could<br /> have taken billions of years. And the evening of the fifth day,<br /> which had been the roughest yet, God said, Thank Me, it's<br /> Friday. And God made the weekend.</p>

9443,"<p>A butcher in his shop, and he's real busy, and he notices a dog in the shop.<br /> He shoos him away. But later, he notices the dog is back again. So he goes over<br /> to the dog, and notices he has a note in his mouth. He takes the note, and it<br /> reads, ""Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please. The dog has money in<br /> his mouth, as well."" The butcher looks inside and, lo and behold, there is a ten<br /> dollar bill there. </p>
<p>So he takes the money, and puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, placing it in<br /> the dog's mouth. The butcher is well impressed, and since it's close to closing<br /> time, he decides to shut up shop and follow the dog. So off he goes. The dog is<br /> walking down the street, when he comes to a level crossing. The dog puts down<br /> the bag, jumps up and presses the button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth,<br /> for the lights to turn. They do, and he walks across the road, with the butcher<br /> following him all the way. </p>
<p>The dog then comes to a bus stop, and starts looking at the timetable. The<br /> butcher is in awe at this stage. The dog checks out the times, and then sits on<br /> one of the seats provided. Along comes a bus. The dog walks around to the front,<br /> looks at the number, and goes back to his seat. Another bus comes. Again the dog<br /> goes and looks at the number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on. The<br /> butcher, by now open-mouthed, follows him onto the bus. The bus travels through<br /> the town and out into the suburbs, the dog looking at the scenery. Eventually he<br /> gets up, and moves to the front of the bus. He stands on 2 back paws and pushes<br /> the button to stop the bus. </p>
<p>Then he gets off, his groceries still in his mouth. Well, dog and butcher are<br /> walking along the road, and then the dog turns into a house. He walks up the<br /> path, and drops the groceries on the step. Then he walks back down the path,<br /> takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He goes back down<br /> the path, runs up to the door and -Whap!- throws himself against it again.<br /> There's no answer at the house, so the dog goes back down the path, jumps up on<br /> a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter of the garden. </p>
<p>He gets to the window, and beats his head against it several times, walks<br /> back, jumps off, and waits at the door. The butcher watches as a big guy opens<br /> the door, and starts laying into the dog. Kicking him, punching him, and<br /> swearing at him. The butcher runs up, and stops the guy. ""What the hell are you<br /> doing? The dog is a genius. He could be on TV, for Roc's sake!"", to which the<br /> guy responds ""Clever, my eye. This is the second time this week that he's<br /> forgotten his key.""</p>

9446,"<p>Seems God was just about done creating the universe, but he had two<br /> extra things left in his bag of creations, so he decided to split them<br /> between Adam and Eve. He told the couple that one of the things he<br /> had to give away was the ability to stand up while urinating. ""It's a<br /> very handy thing,"" God told the couple, who he found under an apple<br /> tree. ""I was wondering if either one of you wanted that ability.</p>
<p>Adam jumped up and blurted, ""Oh, give that to me! I'd love to be able<br /> to do that! It seems a sort of thing a man should do. Oh please, oh<br /> please, oh please, let me have that ability. It'd be so great! When<br /> I'm working in the garden or naming the animals, I could just stand<br /> there and let it fly. It'd be so cool. I could write my name in the<br /> sand. Oh please God, let it be me who you give that gift to, let me<br /> stand and pee, oh please......"" On and on he went like an excited<br /> little boy who had to pee. Eve just smiled and told God that if Adam<br /> really wanted that so badly, that he should have it. It seemed to be<br /> the sort of thing that would make him happy, and she really wouldn't<br /> mind if Adam were the one given this ability. And so Adam was given<br /> the ability to control the direction of his misdirection while in a<br /> vertical position. And so, he was happy and did celebrate by wetting<br /> down the bark on the tree nearest him, laughing with delight all the<br /> while. And it was good.</p>
<p>Fine,"" God said, looking back into his bag of leftover gifts. What's<br /> left here? Oh yes, multiple orgasms.....""</p>

9451,"<p>There was a little boy named Johnny who used to hang out at the local corner<br /> market.

<p>One day after John grabbed the nickel, the store owner took him aside and said<br /> ""Johnny, those boys are making fun of you. They think you don't know the dime is<br /> worth more than the nickel. Are you grabbing the nickel because it's bigger, or<br /> what?"" </p>
<p>Slowly, Johnny turned toward the store owner and a big grin appeared on his<br /> face and Johnny said, ""Well, if I took the dime, they'd stop doing it, and so<br /> far I have saved $20!""</p>

In the defense's closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick: ""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all,"" the lawyer said as he looked at his watch. ""Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom."" </p>
<p>He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened. Finally the lawyer said, ""Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I therefore put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty."" </p>
<p>The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty. ""But how?"" inquired the lawyer. ""You must have had some doubt, I saw all of you stare at the door."" </p>

9460,"<p>As everyone knows, farmers NEVER go to hell since they are the caretakers<br /> of the Earth. Unfortunately though, an error occurred and Satan found<br /> himself with a new dilemma: what to do with the farmer?</p>
<p>Satan decided that he would treat the farmer as he treats the rest of his<br /> workers, and make him work in the fields. The temperature in hell was 85<br /> degrees with a humidity of 75%. All the workers were complaining about the<br /> heat and the humidity, but not the farmer. The farmer was sitting there<br /> with a happy expression on his face and whistling a favorite hymn. This<br /> made Satan irate, and Satan went to the farmer and asked, ""why are you not<br /> complaining like the rest of the workers?"" The farmer responded in<br /> delight, ""these conditions remind me of when I was a lad and I was working<br /> in the fields in June with my daddy back in Iowa.""</p>
<p>In a rage, Satan decided to turn the temperature up to 100 degrees, and<br /> have the humidity at 90%! The rest of the workers were swearing up a storm<br /> and the farmer continued to whistle his favorite hymn. Satan, more furious<br /> than ever now went up and demanded the farmer to tell him why he was still<br /> joyful. The farmer replied, ""Well, this reminds me of a late day in August<br /> bailing hay with my boys back on our farm in Iowa."" Satan was stumped. He<br /> was so mad, but he did not know what to do. </p>
<p>Then the thought came to Satan. Satan decided to turn the temperature down<br /> to five degrees. The temperature made the workers shiver in anger. Not the<br /> farmer though. The farmer was screaming and dancing; he even did a cart<br /> wheel. Satan, in anger screamed at the old man and said, ""how can you<br /> still be so happy even when it is so miserable here?"" The farmer<br /> responded, ""Well, hell just froze over, you know what that means?"" </p>

<p>July 10, 1776</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Jefferson<br /> c/o The Continental Congress<br /> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Jefferson:</p>
<p>We have read your ""Declaration of Independence"" with great interest. Certainly, it represents a considerable undertaking, and many of your statements do merit serious consideration. Unfortunately, the Declaration as a whole fails to meet recently adopted specifications for proposals to the Crown, so we must return the document to you for further refinement. The questions which follow might assist you in your process of revision:</p>
<p>1.In your opening paragraph you use the phrase ""the Laws of Nature and Nature's God."" What are these laws? In what way are they the criteria on which you base your central arguments? Please document with citations from the recent literature.</p>
<p>2.In the same paragraph you refer to the ""opinions of mankind."" Whose polling data are you using? Without specific evidence, it seems to us the ""opinions of mankind"" are a matter of opinion.</p>
<p>3.You hold certain truths to be ""self-evident."" Could you please elaborate. If they are as evident as you claim then it should not be difficult for you to locate the appropriate supporting statistics.</p>
<p>4.""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" seem to be the goals of your proposal. These are not measurable goals. If you were to say that ""among these is the ability to sustain an average life expectancy in six of the 13 colonies of at last 55 years, and to enable newspapers in the colonies to print news without outside interference, and to raise the average income of the colonists by 10 percent in the next 10 years,"" these could be measurable goals. Please clarify.</p>
<p>5.You state that ""Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Government...."" Have you weighed this assertion against all the alternatives? What are the trade-off considerations?</p>
<p>6.Your description of the existing situation is quite extensive. Such a long list of grievances should precede the statement of goals, not follow it. Your problem statement needs improvement.</p>
<p>7.Your strategy for achieving your goal is not developed at all. You state that the colonies ""ought to be Free and Independent States,"" and that they are ""Absolved from All Allegiance to the British Crown."" Who or what must change to achieve this objective? In what way must they change? What specific steps will you take to overcome the resistance? How long will it take? We have found that a little foresight in these areas helps to prevent careless errors later on. How cost-effective are your strategies?</p>
<p>8.Who among the list of signatories will be responsible for implementing your strategy? Who conceived it? Who provided the theoretical research? Who will constitute the advisory committee? Please submit an organization chart and vitas of the principal investigators.</p>
<p>9.You must include an evaluation design. We have been requiring this since Queen Anne's War. </p>
<p>10.What impact will your problem have? Your failure to include any assessment of this inspires little confidence in the long-range prospects of your undertaking.</p>
<p>11.Please submit a PERT diagram, an activity chart, itemized budget, and manpower utilization matrix.</p>
<p>We hope that these comments prove useful in revising your ""Declaration of Independence."" We welcome the submission of your revised proposal. Our due date for unsolicited proposals is July 31, 1776. Ten copies with original signatures will be required</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Management Analyst to the British Crown</p>

9472,"<p>A guy wakes up in the morning. He has a massive hangover and can't remember anything he did last night. He picks up his dressing gown from the floor and puts it on. He notices there's something in one of the pockets and it turns out to be a bra. </p>
<p>He thinks to himself, ""Uh oh. What happened last night?"" He walks towards the bathroom and finds a panty in the other pocket of his gown. </p>
<p>Again he thinks, ""What happened last night. What have I done? It must have been a wild party,"" making his best attempt to conclude and accept the evidence. </p>
<p>He opens the bathroom door, walks in and has a look in the mirror. He notices a little string hanging out of his mouth and his only thought is ""If there's a God, please let this be a tea bag.""</p>

9473,"<p>Two friends, Fred and Harry were golfing one fine day.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the golf course, Fred had hit his ball into the woods.</p>
<p>Harry, laughed and poked fun, but then somehow managed to hit his ball into the woods, just a few yards beyond where Fred has hit his.</p>
<p>Fred looked for a long time, getting angrier every minute.<br /> Finally, in a patch of pretty yellow buttercups, he found his ball.</p>
<p>Instead of just continuing the game, he took his club and thrashed every single buttercup in that patch smashing the weeds to pieces.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, in a flash and puff of smoke, a little old woman appeared.<br /> She said, ""I'm Mother Nature! Do you know how long it took me to make those buttercups?!</p>
<p>Just for that, you won't have any butter for your popcorn the rest of your life... better still; you won't have any butter for your toast for the rest of your life..... as a matter of fact, you won't have any butter for anything the rest of your life!""<br /> Then POOF!...she was gone.</p>
<p>After Fred got a hold of himself, he hollered for his friend,<br /> ""Harry!....Harry!...where are you?""</p>
<p>Harry yells, ""I hit my ball in these damn pussywillows!""</p>
<p>Fred screams back.....""DON'T SWING! FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T SWING!</p>

9474,"<p>A guy enters a bar and orders two shots of vodka. He drinks the first and dumps the second on his right hand.</p>
<p>He then orders a second round of shots, drinks the first and again dumps the second on his right hand.</p>
<p>The bartender sees this and becomes curious as the guy orders a third round and does the exact same thing.</p>
<p>So the bartender asks the guy, ""Hey man, I hope you don't mind me asking but why the waste of good drinks?""</p>
<p>So the man says, ""I have to get my date drunk."" </p>

9477,"<p>The rules at a particular university were such that if the professor were not<br /> present in the classroom by 15 minutes past the hour, the class was considered a<br /> ""walk"" and the students were free to leave, with no penalties for missing a<br /> class. The rooms were equipped with the type wall clocks which ""jumped"" ahead<br /> each minute, in a very noticeable fashion. As it were, these clocks were also<br /> not of the most sophisticated construction. Some enterprising student discovered<br /> that if one were to hit the clock with chalkboard erasers, it would cause the<br /> clock to ""jump"" ahead 1 minute.<br /> So, it became almost daily practice for these students to take target practice<br /> at the clock (as it would have it, this particular professor was not the most<br /> punctual, and the students considered him severely ""absent-minded""). A few well<br /> aimed erasers, and lo, 15 minutes were passed, and class dismissed itself.<br /> Well, when the day for the next exam rolled around, the professor strolled<br /> into the room, passed out the exams, and told them, ""You have 1 hour to complete<br /> the exam.""<br /> The professor then proceeded to collect the erasers from around the room,<br /> gleefully took aim at the clock. When he had successfully ""jumped"" the clock<br /> forward 1 hour, he closed the class and collected the exam papers.<br /> Life does teach some lessons the hard way!</p>

9478,"<p>One day, a man went into the shower and started to wash himself.<br /> Looking down, he noticed that his crotch was bright orange.<br /> He was a bit worried but he got dried and went to work.<br /> On his lunch break, he went to the loo and the man standing at<br /> the urinal next to him screamed<br /> ""Holy s***! He has a bright orange dick!""<br /> The man was a bit embarrased and decided to go to the doctor.<br /> ""I've run some tests and it seems OK. Have you done anything -<br /> um - unusual at the weekend?"" said the doctor.<br /> The man scratched his head for a moment and said<br /> ""I only watched a porno film with my Pepsi and a bag of Cheetos!""</p>

9484,"<p>A husband and wife are on a nudist beach when suddenly a  wasp buzzes into the wife's business end. Naturally enough,  she panics. The husband is also quite shaken but manages to put a coat  on her, pull up his shorts and carries her to the car. Then he makes a mad dash to the doctor. The doctor, after examining  her, says that the wasp is too far in to remove with forceps so  he says to the husband that he will have to try and entice it out  by putting honey on his penis and withdrawing as soon as he  feels the wasp. And so the honey is smeared, but because of his wife's  screaming and his frantic dash to the doctor and the general  panic, he just can't rise to the occasion. So the doctor says  he'll perform the deed if the husband and wife don't object. Naturally both agree for fear the wasp will do any damage, so  the doctor quickly undresses, smears the honey on and  instantly gets an erection, at which time he begins to plug the  wife. Only he doesn't stop and withdraw but continues with  vigor. The husband shouts, 'What the hell's happening?' To which  the doctor replies, 'Change of plan. I'm going to drown the  bastard!!!</p>

<p>The bartender nodded and the Libertarian told him to give Jesus a whiskey also. </p>
<p>The next patron was an ailing Republican with a hunched back who moved slowly. </p>
<p>He shuffled up to the barstool and asked for a glass of wine. He also looked down the bar and asked if that was Jesus. </p>
<p>The bartender nodded and the Republican said to give Him a glass of wine also. </p>
<p>The third patron, a Democrat, swaggered in and said ""Barkeep, give me a cold beer. </p>
<p>Hey, is that Jesus down there?"" </p>
<p>The barkeep nodded, and the Democrat told him to give Jesus a cold one too. </p>
<p>As Jesus got up to leave, he walked over and touched the Libertarian and said, ""For your kindness, you are healed!"" </p>
<p>The Libertarian felt the strength come back to his leg, and he got up and danced a jig all the way to the door. </p>
<p>Jesus touched the republican and said, ""For your kindness you are healed!"" </p>
<p>The Republican felt his back straighten. He danced with joy and did a flip. </p>

9508,"<p>THE DANGER OF EATING BREADA recent newspaper headline read, ''Smell of baked bread may  be health hazard.'' The article went on to describe the dangers  of the smell of baking bread. The main danger, apparently, is  that the organic components of this aroma may break down ozone.I was horrified. When are we going to do something about  bread-induced global warming? Sure, we attack tobacco companies,  but when is the government going to go after Big Bread? Well,  I've done a little research, and what I've discovered should make  anyone think twice....THE FINDINGS1. More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread eaters.2. Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread-consuming  households score below average on standardized tests.3. In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in  the home, the average life expectancy was less than 50 years;  infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died  in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever and  influenza ravaged whole nations.4. More than 90 percent of violent crimes are committed  within 24 hours of eating bread.5. Bread is made from a substance called ''dough.'' It has been  proven that as little as one pound of dough can be used to  suffocate a mouse. The average person eats more bread than that  in one month!7. Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of  bread and given only water to eat begged for bread after only  two days.PROPOSED RESTRICTIONSMost bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish between significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical  babbling. In light of these frightening statistics, we  propose the following bread restrictions1. No sale of bread to minors.2. No advertising of bread within 1000 feet of a school.3. A 300 percent federal tax on all bread to pay for all  the societal ills we might associate with bread.4. No animal or human images, nor any primary colors (which may  appeal to children) may be used to promote bread usage.5. A $40.2 billion fine on the three biggest bread manufacturers.</p>

9520,"<p>Dear Mom and Dad, </p>
<p>It has been three months since I left for college. I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay? </p>
<p>Well, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and I now can see almost normally and I only get those sick headaches once a week. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm and he was the one who called the fire department and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dorm, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but it's kind of cute. </p>
<p>He is a very fine boy and we have falled deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't exactly set the date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show. Yes, Mom and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me as a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boy friend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am taking daily.</p>
<p>I know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind, and although not well educated, has ambitions. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know oft-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat darker than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good, too, for I hear that his father is an important gun-bearer in the village in Africa from which he comes.</p>
<p>Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no dormitory fire. I do not have a concussion or a skull fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged, I do not have syphilis and there is no colored man in my life. </p>
<p>However, I am getting a 'D' in history and an 'F' in science class and I wanted you to see these marks in their proper perspective. </p>
<p>Your loving daughter, </p>
<p>Trish</p>

I grabbed that snake with my bare hands, bit its head off, and sucked the poison down in one gulp. And I'm still here today."" </p>

Wouldn't you like to give back to the community in some way?"" </p>

<p>Embarrassed, the United Way representative mumbled, ""Um... No."" </p>
<p>""Or,"" the lawyer continued, ""that my brother, a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a wheelchair?"" </p>
<p>The stricken United Way representative began to stammer out an apology but was interrupted when the lawyer added, ""Or that my sister's husband died in a traffic accident,"" the lawyer's voice rising in indignation, ""Leaving her pennyless with three children?"" </p>
<p>The humiliated United Way representative, completely beaten, said simply, ""I had no idea..."" </p>

9537,"<p>For a couple years I've been blaming it on lack of sleep, too much pressure from my job, earwax buildup, poor blood, but now I found out the real reason:</p>
<p>I'm tired because I'm overworked.</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<p>The population of the USA is about 273 million.</p>
<p>140 million are retired.</p>
<p>That leaves 133 million to do the work.</p>
<p>There are 85 million in school.</p>
<p>Which leaves 48 million to do the work.</p>
<p>Of this there are 29 million employed by the federal government.</p>
<p>Leaving 19 million to do the work.</p>
<p>2.8 million are in the armed forces.</p>
<p>Which leaves 16.2 million to do the work.</p>
<p>Take from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for state and city governments.</p>
<p>And that leaves 1.4 million to do the work.</p>
<p>At any given time there are 188,000 people in hospitals,</p>
<p>Leaving 1,212,000 to do the work.</p>
<p>Now, there are 1,211,998 people in prisons.</p>
<p>That leaves just two people to do all the work.</p>

9554,"<p>There are two theories to arguing' with a woman; neither one works.</p>
<p>Don't worry about biting' off more than you can chew, your mouth is probably a<br /> whole lot binger�s you think.<br /> If you get to thinking' you're a person of some influence, try ordering'<br /> somebody else's dog around.<br /> After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he started roaring.<br /> He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him.<br /> The moral: When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging'.<br /> Never smack a man who's chewing' tobacco.<br /> It don't take a genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.<br /> Never ask a barber if he thinks you need a haircut.<br /> Never follow good whiskey with water, unless you're out of good whiskey.<br /> Good judgment comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgment.<br /> Always drink upstream from the herd.<br /> Never drop your gun to hug a grizzly.<br /> If you're riding' ahead of the herd, take a look back every now and then to<br /> make sure it's still there.<br /> When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't be<br /> surprised if they learn their lesson.<br /> When you're throwing' your weight around, be ready to have it thrown around by<br /> somebody else.<br /> Letting' the cat outtalk the bag is a whole lot easier 'n putting' it back<br /> in.<br /> Always take a good look at what you're about to eat. It's not so important<br /> to know what it is, but it's critical to know what it was.<br /> The quickest way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in<br /> your pocket.<br /> Never miss a good chance to shut up.</p>

9555,"<p>There was a farmer. He had alot of chickens but had no roosters. </p>
<p>So in order to get eggs he went and got a rooster. The man he got the rooster form told him that the rooster would screw everything in sight. But the farmer wanted the rooster anyway. </p>
<p>So he took it home and it screwed all the chickens. After a while it started screwing all the other farm animals. </p>
<p>So one day the farmer walked up to the rooster and said,""Ya better stop screwing everything or you will screw yourself to death!"" But the rooster just kept on screwing. </p>
<p>One day the farmer was walking through the field, and he found the rooster laying on the ground with buzzards flying all around. </p>
<p>So he walked up to the rooster and said,""I told you you'd screw yourself to death!"" then the rooster opened his eyes and said, - ""SHUT-UP! I'm trying to get them to land!""</p>

<p>So the man buys a banana and a cookie on the way home, and goes<br /> to the doctor the next day. The doctor says to him, ""Okay, give<br /> me the banana and the cookie, and pull down your pants."" ""Are<br /> you sure?"" ""Positive."" Grudgingly, he pulls down his pants. The<br /> doctor shoves the banana right up his ass. He waits a few<br /> minutes, and up goes the cookie.</p>
<p>The doctor says, ""Okay, now tomorrow, I want you to do the same<br /> thing."" So he does. And this goes on for about a week.</p>
<p>On the second to last day, after treatment, the doctor says,<br /> ""For tomorrow, I want you to bring a banana and a hammer.""<br /> Fearing the worst, but wanting to get rid of the tapeworm, the<br /> man does so.</p>
<p>The next day, up goes the banana. The doctor waits a few<br /> minutes, and then out pops a sign that says, ""Hey! where's my<br /> cookie?!"" And well, I think you can figure out what the doctor<br /> did with the hammer.</p>

"
9562,"<p>Unfortunately there are some things that children should be learning in school, but don't. Not all of them have to do with academics. As a modest- back-to-school offering, here are some basic rules that may not have found their way into the standard curriculum. </p>
<p><strong>Rule #1.</strong> </p>
<p>Life is not fair. Get used to it. The average teen-ager uses the phrase ""it's not fair"" 8.6 times a day. You got it from your parents. Who said it so often you decided they must be the most idealistic generation ever. When they started hearing it from their own kids, They realized Rule #1. </p>
<p><strong>Rule #2.</strong> </p>
<p>The real world won't care as much about your self-esteem as your school does. It'll expect you to accomplish something before you feel good about yourself. This may come as a shock. Usually, when inflated self- esteem meets reality, kids complain that it's not fair. (See Rule No. 1) </p>
<p><strong>Rule #3.</strong> </p>
<p>Sorry, you won't make $40,000 a year right out of high school. And you won't be a vice president or have a car phone either. You may even have to wear a uniform that doesn't have a Gap label.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #4.</strong> </p>
<p>If you think your teacher is tough, wait 'till you get a boss. He doesn't have tenure, so he tends to be a bit edgier. When you screw up, he is not going ask you how feel about it. </p>
<p><strong>Rule #5.</strong> </p>
<p>Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping. They called it opportunity. They weren't embarrassed making minimum wage either. They would have been embarrassed to sit around talking about Kurt Cobain all weekend. </p>
<p><strong>Rule #6. </strong></p>
<p>It's not your parents fault. If you screw up, you are responsible. This is the flip side of ""It's my life,"" and ""You're not the boss of me,"" and other eloquent proclamations of your generation. When you turn 18, it's on your dime. Don't whine about it or you'll sound like a baby boomer. </p>
<p><strong>Rule #7.</strong> </p>
<p>Before you were born your parents weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way paying your bills, cleaning up your room and listening to you tell them how idealistic you are. And by the way, before you save the rain forest from the blood-sucking parasites of your parents' generation try delousing the closet in your bedroom. </p>
<p><strong>Rule #8.</strong> </p>
<p>Life is not divided into semesters, and you don't get summers off. Nor even Easter break. They expect you to show up every day. For eight hours. And you don't get a new life every 10 weeks. It just goes on and on. </p>
<p><strong>Rule #9.</strong> </p>
<p>Television is not real life. Your life is not a sitcom. Your problems will not all be solved in 30 minutes, minus time for commercials. In real life, people actually have to leave the coffee shop to go to jobs. Your friends will not be perky or as polite as Jennifer Aniston. </p>
<p><strong>Rule #10. </strong></p>
<p>Be nice to nerds. You may end up working for them We all could . </p>
<p><strong>Rule #11.</strong> </p>
<p>Enjoy this while you can. Sure, parents are a pain, school's a bother, and life is depressing. But someday you'll realize how wonderful it was to be kid. Maybe you should start now. You're welcome.</p>

9566,"<p>Life is just a phase you're going through...you'll get over it.Before you criticize someone, walk a mile in his shoes. That way, if he gets angry, he'll be a mile away - and barefoot.A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never triedMy idea of housework is to sweep the room with a glance.Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious.It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.I have found at my age going bra-less pulls all the wrinkles out of my face.For every action, there is an equal and opposite government program.Age is a very high price to pay for maturity.A closed mouth gathers no feet.If you look like your passport picture, you probably need the trip.Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.Bills travel through the mail at twice the speed of checks.A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.Eat well, stay fit, die anyway.Men are from earth. Women are from earth. Deal with it.No husband has ever been shot while doing the dishes.A balanced diet is a cookie in each hand.Middle age is when broadness of the mind and narrowness of the waist change places.Opportunities always look bigger going than coming.Junk is something you throw away three weeks before you need it.There is always one more imbecile than you counted on.Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you a mechanic.Experience is a wonderful thing. It enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.By the time you can make ends meet, they move the ends.Thou shalt not weigh more than thy refrigerator.Someone who thinks logically provides a nice contrast to the real world.I believe the only time the world beats a path to my door is when I'm in the bathroom.Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves for they shall never cease to be amused.</p>

<p>Then he decided to write GOD a letter requesting the $100.<br /> When the postal authorities received the letter addressed to GOD USA, they decided to send it to President Bush.</p>
<p>The President was so impressed, touched, and amused that he instructed his secretary to send the little boy a $5.00 bill.<br /> President Bush thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy.</p>
<p>The little boy was delighted with the $5.00 and sat down to write a thank you note to GOD, which read:</p>
<p>Dear GOD,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for sending the money, however, I noticed that for some reason you had to send it through Washington D.C. and, as usual, those idiots deducted $95.00!</p>

9594,"<p>GOT A LIGHT?In a west Texas town, employees in a medium-sized warehouse noticed the smell of gas. Sensibly, management evacuated the building, extinguishing all potential sources of ignition -- lights, power, etc. After the building had been evacuated, two technicians from the gas company were dispatched. Upon entering the building, they found they had difficulty navigating in the dark. To their frustration, none of the lights worked. Witnesses later described the scene of one of the technicians reaching into his pocket and retrieving an object that resembled a lighter. Upon operation of the lighter-like object, the gas in the warehouse exploded, sending pieces of it up to three miles away. Nothing was found of the technicians, but the lighter was virtually untouched by the explosion. The technician that was suspected of causing the explosion had never been thought of as ""bright"" by his peers.</p>

He immediately pulls over to see the done<br /> damage. So distressed that he has killed the hare, he begins to<br /> cry... </p>
<p>Before he could even realize what had happened, a car had pulled<br /> up behind his, and out gets a gorgeous, 5'10"", slender blonde.<br /> She quickly gets out and asks ""What is the matter?"" and he told<br /> her the story. She, without a single word, reached into her<br /> purse, pulls out a can, opens it, and sprays the bunny all over<br /> with it. </p>
<p>The man watches in awe, as the bunny jumps up on its feet, hops<br /> ten times, looks back, and waves, hops ten times, looks back,<br /> and waves, hops ten times, looks back, and waves...

"
9600,"<p>1. WHY ARE MEN SUCH JERKS? </p>
<p>It's a testosterone thing. Much similar to your PMS thing, we men suffer from testosterone poisoning. Why do you think the average life span of a male is typically 10 years shorter (and it's not just from all the bitching and nagging we have to endure)? Hormone modifies behavior. We're just misunderstood. </p>
<p>2. WHY DO MEN ALWAYS HAVE TO OGLE AT OTHER WOMEN? </p>
<p>Again, this is a testosterone thing. Do you honestly think that all the testosterone just fell out of our bodies the moment we met you? Besides, women do it as well. Women are just much better at not getting caught. I'm fairly certain it's some sort of photographic memory deal. Women take one quick look and memorize it for later reference. Since men lack this ability, we try to burn it into our memory by staring as much as we can. </p>
<p>3. WHY DO MEN ALWAYS TOUCH THEMSELVES, ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC? </p>
<p>We occasionally need to adjust our little friend and make him happy. It's much like adjusting your bra. Being in public is just an added bonus. </p>
<p>4. WHY DO MEN ALWAYS SAY SUCH STUPID THINGS? </p>
<p>We like to. It's actually a whole lot of fun to see our partner frustrated by a few simple (and well chosen) words. </p>
<p>5. WHY ARE MEN SO UNCOMMUNICATIVE? </p>
<p>You'd learn to keep your big mouth shut too if every time you open it you get into trouble with your partner. </p>
<p>6. WHY DO MEN HAVE TO ACT LIKE SUCH RETARDS? </p>
<p>Well, we don't actually have to; we do it because we enjoy it. It's the old fashioned pride in a job well done that's missing in so much of the world nowadays. </p>
<p>7. WHY CAN'T MEN JUST SHARE THEIR FEELINGS? </p>
<p>Do we look like women to you? Why is it so hard to understand that men and women are different? How are we supposed to share how we feel when we have no idea how we feel? Unless we're experiencing some extreme emotion like rage, hatred, disgust, or a brick on our foot, we have no idea how we feel. Personally, I get a headache whenever I try to figure out how I feel. </p>
<p>8. WHY CAN'T MEN CUDDLE MORE (I.E. LIE DOWN AND HUG)? </p>
<p>Please... How many hours do you think there is in a day? We oblige you as much as we can, but who the hell (besides women) can stand lying around for hours on end? We men... Men hunters... Need go roam... Starve in cave... Must go find wildebeest... Now sitting on our asses for hours on end on the other hand is a whole other story. </p>
<p>9. HOW CAN MEN SIT ON THEIR ASSES ALL DAY WITHOUT MOVING? </p>
<p>Men have very powerful sets of sitting muscles developed by evolution that enable us to sit for extended periods of time without getting tired. In prehistoric times, it was often necessary to sit in one spot for extended periods of time while hunting for prey. The more successful hunters were able to sit very still for very extended periods of time thereby passing on this ability to their progeny. The fidgety types were all gobbled up by saber toothed tigers etc. The end result is that almost all modern men are born with this innate ability. </p>
<p>10. WHY CAN'T MEN JUST SAY ""I LOVE YOU?"" </p>
<p>Men are taught from a tender young age to be self-sufficient. To say that we love you is equivalent to saying that we need you. Most men consider that a character fault. It's not easy to admit to one's own character faults. </p>
<p>11. WHY DO MEN SAY ""I LOVE YOU"" WHEN THEY HARDLY KNOW ME? </p>
<p>Ho, Ho, Ho... Aren't you special? Well, some men think it's a sure fire way to get into your pants. Surprisingly, it actually still works quite well. </p>
<p>12. WHY DOESN'T MY PARTNER EVER ANSWER ME? </p>
<p>We just simply don't have the energy to answer every single one of your questions. If we think we do not have the answer, or that you will not like the answer, we simply remain quiet and save the energy for other things. </p>
<p>13. WHY WON'T MEN EVER PICK UP AFTER THEMSELVES? </p>
<p>Why should we? It doesn't really bother us that much. Besides, we know darn well you'll pick it up. </p>
<p>14. WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BELCHING AND FARTING? </p>
<p>This usually only occurs after months of courting. It's our way to let you know that we're comfortable with you. Believe it or not, it's actually a sign of affection. Besides, holding it for extended periods of time gives us stomach cramps. </p>
<p>15. WHY DO MEN HATE SHOPPING? </p>
<p>It's an evolutionary thing. Men hunt. Women gather. We just want to go out, kill it, and bring it back. Who wants to spend hours and hours to look at things we have no intention of killing? Err... buying?</p>

9603,"<p>DARWIN AWARD RUNNERS-UP:</p>
<p>#1 - LOS ANGELES, CA. Ani Saduki, 33, and his brother decided to remove a bees' nest from a shed on their property with the aid of a pineapple. </p>
<p>A pineapple is an illegal firecracker which is the explosive equivalent of one-half stick of dynamite. They ignited the fuse and retreated to watch from inside their home, behind a window some 10 feet away from the hive/shed. The concussion of the explosion shattered the window inwards, seriously lacerating Ani. Deciding Mr. Saduki needed stitches, the brothers headed out to go to a nearby hospital. </p>
<p>While walking towards their car, Ani was stung three times by the surviving bees. Unbeknownst to either brother, Ani was allergic to bee venom, and died of suffocation en-route to the hospital.</p>
<p>#2 - Derrick L. Richards, 28, was charged in April in Minneapolis with third-degree murder in the death of his beloved cousin, Kenneth E. Richards. According to police, Derrick suggested a game of Russian roulette and put a semiautomatic pistol (instead of the more traditional revolver) to Ken's head and fired.</p>
<p>#3 - PHILLIPSBURG, NJ. An unidentified 29 year old male choked to death on a sequinned pastie he had orally removed from an exotic dancer at a local establishment. </p>
<p>""I didn't think he was going to eat it,"" the dancer identified only as ""Ginger"" said, adding ""He was really drunk.""</p>
<p>#4 - MOSCOW, Russia - A drunk security man asked a colleague at the Moscow bank they were guarding to stab his bullet-proof vest to see if it would protect him against a knife attack. It didn't, and the 25-year-old guard died of a heart wound. </p>
<p>#5- In FRANCE, Jacques LeFevrier left nothing to chance when he decided to commit suicide. He stood at the top of a tall cliff and tied a noose around his neck. He tied the other end of the rope to a large rock. He drank some poison and set fire to his clothes. He even tried to shoot himself at the last moment. He jumped and fired the pistol. The bullet missed him completely and cut through the rope above him. Free of the threat of hanging, he plunged into the sea. The sudden dunking extinguished the flames and made him vomit the poison. He was dragged out of the water by a kind fisherman and was taken to a hospital, where he died of hypothermia.</p>
<p>   #7 - RENTON, WASHINGTON, USA. A Renton, Washington man tried to comit a robbery. This was probably his first attempt, as suggested by the fact that he had no previous record of violent crime, and by his terminally stupid choices as listed below:<br />    1. The target was H&amp;J Leather &amp; Firearms...a gun shop.<br />    2. The shop was full of customers, in a state where a substantial portion of the adult population is licensed to carry concealed handguns in public places.<br />    3. To enter the shop, he had to step around a marked Police patrol car parked at the front door.<br />    4. An officer in uniform was standing next to the counter, having coffee before reporting to duty. Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a hold-up and fired a few wild shots. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, removing him from the gene pool. Several other customers also drew their guns, but didn't fire. No one else was hurt.</p>
<p>   AND THE 1999 DARWIN AWARD WINNER IS..... THOMPSON, MANITOBA, CANADA.<br />    Telephone relay company night watchman Edward Baker, 31, was killed early Christmas morning by excessive microwave radiation exposure. He was apparently attempting to keep warm next to a telecommunications feed-horn. </p>
<p>Baker had been suspended on a safety violation once last year, according to Northern Manitoba Signal Relay spokesperson Tanya Cooke. She noted that Baker's earlier infraction was for defeating a safety shut-off switch and entering a restricted maintenance catwalk in order to stand in front of the microwave dish. He had told co-workers that it was the only way he could stay warm during his twelve-hour shift at the station, where winter temperatures often dip to forty below zero. </p>
<p>Microwaves can heat water molecules within human tissue in the same way that they heat food in microwave ovens. For his Christmas shift, Baker reportedly brought a twelve pack of beer and a plastic lawn chair, which he positioned directly in line with the strongest microwave beam. Baker had not been told about a tenfold boost in microwave power planned that night to handle the anticipated increase in holiday long-distance calling traffic. </p>
<p>Baker's body was discovered by the daytime watchman, John Burns, who was greeted by an odour he mistook for a Christmas roast he thought Baker must have prepared as a surprise. Burns also reported to NMSR company officials that Baker's unfinished beers had exploded.</p>

<p>The Guy says, ""No, wait you don't understand. This is no ordinary octopus. This octopus can play any musical instrument you can think of.</p>
<p>The bartender says, ""Bullshit, no octopus can do that.""</p>
<p>The Guy says, ""No, really I'll bet you one hundred dollars that you can't find a musical instrument he can't play.""</p>
<p>The bartender says, ""OK you're on. Try the piano in the corner.""</p>

9630,"<p>There's this man with a bald head and a wooden leg who gets invited to a fancy costume party. He doesn't know what costume to wear to hide his head and his leg..so he writes to a fancy dress company to explain the problem. A few days later he receives a parcel with a note. ""Dear Sir, please find enclosed a pirates outfit. The spotted handkerchief will cover your bald head and with your wooden leg you will be just right as a pirate"". </p>
<p>The man thinks this is terrible because they have just emphasized his wooden leg and so he writes a really rude letter of complaint. A week passes and he receives another parcel and a note, which says ""Dear Sir, sorry about before, please find enclosed a monks habit. The long robe will cover your wooden leg and with your bald head you will really look the part"". </p>
<p>Now the man is really annoyed since they have gone from emphasizing his wooden leg to emphasizing his bald head and he writes the company a REALLY rude letter of complaint. The next day he receives a small parcel and a note which reads ""Dear Sir,since we have not been able to make you happy, this is our last suggestion please find enclosed a bottle of molasses. Pour the molasses over your bald head, stick your wooden leg up your ass and go as a Carmel apple.</p>

<p>The author of this memo was quite genuine. </p>
<p>Re: Replacement of Mouse Balls.<br /> If a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Mouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Units). </p>
<p>Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel. </p>
<p>Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls. </p>
<p>Ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop off method. Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist off method. Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. </p>
<p>However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge. </p>
<p>Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used immediately. It is recommended that each person have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction. </p>
<p>Any customer missing his balls should contact the local personnel in charge of removing and replacing these necessary items. Please keep in mind that a customer without properly working balls is an unhappy customer. </p>

<p>    300 cows and all it wants to do is eat.</p>
<p>Vet:  Give it one of these little pills in its feed and stand back.</p>
<p>    So 2 weeks later the farmer comes back to the vet:</p>
<p>Farmer:   WOW, what a pill!  I gave the pill to the bull like you said  and</p>
<p>    POW!  It jumped  over the gate, ran down the lane and fucked 70 cows in</p>
<p>    30 minutes.</p>

<p>    could you give me one of those tablets?  I'm not as young as I was.</p>
<p>Vet:   Oh,  no!  Sorry, it's too strong but I will give you a quarter of  a</p>

9640,"<p>Sitting on the side of the highway waiting to catch speeding drivers, a State Police Officer sees a car puttering along at 22 MPH. He thinks to himself, this driver is just as dangerous as a speeder!"" So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over. </p>
<p>Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies - two in the front seat and three in the back - eyes wide and white as ghosts. </p>
<p>The driver, obviously confused, says to him, ""Officer, I don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems to be the problem?"" </p>
<p>""Ma'am,"" the officer replies, ""You weren't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers."" </p>
<p>""Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly... Twenty-Two miles an hour!"" the old woman says a bit proudly. </p>
<p>The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that ""22"" was the route number, not the speed limit. </p>
<p>A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. </p>
<p>""But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car okay? These women seem awfully shaken and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time,"" the officer asks. </p>
<p>""Oh, they'll be fine in a minute or two, officer. We just got off Route 119!""</p>

9652,"<p>A police officer pulled over a driver and informed him that, because he was wearing his seat belt, he had just won $5,000 in a safety competition. ''What are you going to do with the prize money?'' the officer asked. The man responded, ''I guess I'll go to driving school and get my license.'' At that moment, his wife, who was seated next to him, chimed in, ''Officer, don't listen to him. He's a smart aleck when he's drunk.'' This woke up the guy in the back seat, who, when he saw the cop, blurted out, ''I knew we wouldn't get far in this stolen car.'' At that moment, there was a knock from the trunk and a voice asked ''Are we over the border yet?''</p>

Some people think they know how to move around in it, but they really can't interface.In the long-distant past, its only purpose was to receive information considered vital to the survival of the species.  Some people still think that's the only thing it should be used for, but most folks today use it for fun most of the time.The more people use it the bigger it gets.It has no conscience and no memory.  Left to its own devices, it will just do the same damn dumb things it did before.It provides a way to interact with other people.  Some people take this interaction very seriously, others treat it as a lark.  Sometimes it's hard to tell what kind of person you're dealing with until it's too late.If you don't apply the appropriate protective measures, it can spread viruses.It has no brain of its own.  Instead, it uses yours.  If you use it too much, you'll find it becomes more and more difficult to think coherently.You think you're just playing around, but you can get involved in something that takes 9 months to finish.The part you see is actually just the front end of a very complicated system.If you're not careful what you do with it, it can get you in big trouble.It has its own agenda.  Somehow, no matter how good your intentions, it will warp your behavior.  Later you may ask yourself 'why on earth did I do that?'Some folks have it, some don't.Those who have it think that those who don't have it are somehow inferior.  Those who don't have it may agree that it's a nifty toy, but think it's not worth the fuss that those who do have it make about it.  Still, many of those who don't have it spend all their time trying to access it.Some people believe in security and avoiding penetration  but others believe it should be open to all comers.Once you've started playing with it, it's hard to stop.  Some people would just play with it all day if they didn't have work to do.</p>

9669,"<p>Introducing the new Bio-Optic Organized Knowledge device, trade-named -- BOOK. </p>
<p>BOOK is a revolutionary breakthrough in technology: no wires, no electric circuits, no batteries, nothing to be connected or switched on. It's so easy to use, even a child can operate it. Compact and portable, it can be used anywhere -- even sitting in an armchair by the fire -- yet it is powerful enough to hold as much information as a CD-ROM disc. </p>
<p>Here's how it works: BOOK is constructed of sequentially numbered sheets of paper (recyclable), each capable of holding thousands of bits of information. The pages are locked together with a custom-fit device called a binder which keeps the sheets in their correct sequence. Opaque Paper Technology (OPT) allows manufacturers to use both sides of the sheet, doubling the information density and cutting costs. Experts are divided on the prospects for further increases in information density; for now, BOOKS with more information simply use more pages. Each sheet is scanned optically, registering information directly into your brain. A flick of the finger takes you to the next sheet. </p>
<p>BOOK may be taken up at any time and used merely by opening it. BOOK never crashes or requires rebooting, though, like other devices, it can become damaged if coffee is spilled on it and it becomes unusable if dropped too many times on a hard surface. The ""browse"" feature allows you to move instantly to any sheet, and move forward or backward as you wish. Many come with an ""index"" feature, which pin-points the exact location of any selected information for instant retrieval. </p>
<p>An optional ""BOOKmark"" accessory allows you to open BOOK to the exact place you left it in a previous session -- even if the BOOK has been closed. BOOKmarks fit universal design standards; thus, a single BOOKmark can be used in BOOKs by various manufacturers. Conversely, numerous BOOK markers can be used in a single BOOK if the user wants to store numerous views at once. The number is limited only by the number of pages in the BOOK. </p>
<p>You can also make personal notes next to BOOK text entries with optional programming tools, Portable Erasable Nib Cryptic Intercommunication Language Styli (PENCILS). Portable, durable, and affordable, BOOK is being hailed as a precursor of a new entertainment wave. BOOK's appeal seems so certain that thousands of content creators have committed to the platform and investors are reportedly flocking to invest. </p>

<p>Dear Maid,<br /> Please do not leave any more of those little bars of soap in my bathroom<br /> since I have brought my own bath-sized Dial.  Please remove the six<br /> unopened little bars from the shelf under the medicine chest and another<br /> three in the shower soap dish.  They are in my way.<br />   Thank you,<br />   S. Berman</p>
<p>Dear Room 635,<br /> I am not your regular maid.  She will be back tomorrow, Thursday, from her<br /> day off.  I took the 3 hotel soaps out of the shower soap dish as you<br /> requested.  The 6 bars on your shelf I took out of your way and put on top<br /> of your Kleenex dispenser in case you should change your mind.  This<br /> leaves only the 3 bars I left today which my instructions from the<br /> management is to leave 3 soaps daily. I hope this is satisfactory.<br />   Kathy, Relief Maid</p>
<p>Dear Maid -- I hope you are my regular maid.<br /> Apparently Kathy did not tell you about my note to her concerning the<br /> little bars of soap.  When I got back to my room this evening I found you<br /> had added 3 little Camays to the shelf under my medicine cabinet. I am<br /> going to be here in the hotel for two weeks and have brought my own<br /> bath-size Dial so I won't need those 6 little Camays which are on the<br /> shelf.  They are in my way when shaving, brushing teeth, etc. Please<br /> remove them.<br />   S. Berman</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Berman,<br /> My day off was last Wed. so the relief maid left 3 hotel soaps which we are<br /> instructed by the management.  I took the 6 soaps which were in your way<br /> on the shelf and put them in the soap dish where your Dial was.  I put the<br /> Dial in the medicine cabinet for your convenience. I didn't remove the 3<br /> complimentary soaps which are always placed inside the medicine cabinet<br /> for all new check-ins and which you did not object to when you checked in<br /> last Monday. Please, let me know if I can of further assistance.<br />   Your regular maid,<br />   Dotty</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Berman,<br /> The assistant manager, Mr. Kensedder, informed me this A.M. that you<br /> called him last evening and said you were unhappy with your maid service.<br /> I have assigned a new girl to your room.  I hope you will accept my<br /> apologies for any past inconvenience.  If you have any future complaints<br /> please contact me so I can give it my personal attention. Call extension<br /> 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.  Thank you.<br />   Elaine Carmen<br />   Housekeeper</p>
<p>Dear Miss Carmen,<br /> It is impossible to contact you by phone since I leave the hotel for<br /> business at 745 AM and don't get back before 530 or 6PM.  That's the<br /> reason I called Mr. Kensedder last night.  You were already off duty. I<br /> only asked Mr. Kensedder if he could do anything about those little<br /> bars of soap.  The new maid you assigned me must have thought I was<br /> a new check-in today, since she left another 3 bars of hotel soap in<br /> my medicine cabinet along with her regular delivery of 3 bars on the<br /> bath-room shelf.  In just 5 days here I have accumulated 24 little bars<br /> of soap.  Why are you doing this to me?<br />   S. Berman</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Berman,<br /> Your maid, Kathy, has been instructed to stop delivering soap to your room<br /> and remove the extra soaps.  If I can be of further assistance, please call<br /> extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.  Thank you,<br />   Elaine Carmen,<br />   Housekeeper</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Kensedder,<br /> My bath-size Dial is missing.  Every bar of soap was taken from my room<br /> including my own bath-size Dial.  I came in late last night and had to call<br /> the bellhop to bring me 4 little Cashmere Bouquets.<br />   S. Berman</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Berman,<br /> I have informed our housekeeper, Elaine Carmen, of your soap problem. I<br /> cannot understand why there was no soap in your room since our maids<br /> are instructed to leave 3 bars of soap each time they service a room. The<br /> situation will be rectified immediately.  Please accept my apologies for<br /> the inconvenience.<br />   Martin L. Kensedder<br />   Assistant Manager</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Carmen,<br /> Who the hell left 54 little bars of Camay in my room?  I came in last night<br /> and found 54 little bars of soap.  I don't want 54 little bars of Camay.<br /> I want my one damn bar of bath-size Dial.  Do you realize I have 54 bars<br /> of soap in here.  All I want is my bath-size Dial. Please give me back my<br /> bath-size Dial.<br />   S. Berman</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Berman,<br /> You complained of too much soap in your room so I had them removed.<br /> Then you complained to Mr. Kensedder that all your soap was missing so I<br /> personally returned them.  The 24 Camays which had been taken and the<br /> 3 Camays you are supposed to receive daily (sic).  I don't know anything<br /> about the 4 Cashmere Bouquets.  Obviously your maid, Kathy, did not<br /> know I had returned your soaps so she also brought 24 Camays plus the 3<br /> daily Camays.  I don't know where you got the idea this hotel issues<br /> bath-size Dial.  I was able to locate some bath-size Ivory which I left in<br /> your room.<br />   Elaine Carmen<br />   Housekeeper</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Carmen,<br /> Just a short note to bring you up-to-date on my latest soap inventory.<br /> As of today I possess:<br />    - On shelf under medicine cabinet - 18 Camay in 4 stacks of 4 and 1<br /> stack of 2.<br />    - On Kleenex dispenser - 11 Camay in 2 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 3.<br />    - On bedroom dresser - 1 stack of 3 Cashmere Bouquet, 1 stack of 4<br /> hotel-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks of 4.<br />    - Inside medicine cabinet - 14 Camay in 3 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2.<br />    - In shower soap dish - 6 Camay, very moist.<br />    - On northeast corner of tub - 1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used.<br />    - On northwest corner of tub - 6 Camays in 2 stacks of 3.<br /> Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks are<br /> neatly piled and dusted.  Also, please advise her that stacks of more than<br /> 4 have a tendency to tip.  May I suggest that my bedroom window sill is not<br /> in use and will make an excellent spot for future soap deliveries. One more<br /> item, I have purchased another bar of bath-sized Dial which I am keeping<br /> in the hotel vault in order to avoid further misunderstandings.<br />   S. Berman</p>

9737,"<p>The curator of a Western art museum commissioned a local artist to paint a mural-sized painting of Custer's Last Thought. The artist was told to make it highly symbolic of Custer's mindset during the debacle at the Little Big Horn.Deep in thought, the artist went to his studio. After many false starts, he proceeded to paint an enormous oil painting. Finally, after many months of work, the painting was unveiled for the curator. In the foreground there was a beautiful blue lake with a single fish leaping out of the water. Around the fish's head was a halo. In the background, the hills and meadows were covered with naked Native American couples having sex.The curator, both disgusted and baffled by what he saw, turned in rage and asked the artist, 'What the hell has this got to do with Custer's Last Thought?'    The artist replied, 'Custer's last thought: Holy Mackerel! Where did all these fucking Indians come from?'</p>

<p>'Twas the night after Christmas and all through the trailer, </p>
<p>the beer had gone flat and the pizza was staler. </p>
<p>The tube socks hung empty, no candies or toys, </p>
<p>and I was camped out on my old Lay-Z-Boy. </p>
<p>The kids they weren't talking to me or my wife, </p>
<p>the worst Christmas they said they had had in their lives. </p>
<p>My wife couldn't argue and neither could I, </p>
<p>so I watched TV and my wife, she just cried. </p>
<p>When out in the yard the dog started barkin', </p>
<p>I stood up and looked and I saw Sheriff Larkin. </p>
<p>He yelled, ""Roy I am sworn to uphold the laws </p>
<p>and I got a complaint here from a feller named Claus."" </p>
<p>I said, ""Claus, I don't know nobody named Claus, </p>
<p>and you ain't taking me in without probable cause."" </p>
<p>Then the Sheriff he said, ""The man was shot at last night."" </p>
<p>I said, ""That might have been me, just what's he look like?"" </p>
<p>The Sheriff replied, ""He's a jolly old feller, with a big beer gut belly, </p>
<p>that shakes when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly. </p>
<p>He sports a long beard, and a nose like a cherry."" </p>
<p>I said, ""Sheriff that sounds like my wife's sister Sherri."" </p>
<p>""It's no time for jokes Roy"" the Sheriff he said. </p>
<p>""The man I'm describing is dressed all in red. </p>
<p>I'm here for the truth now, it's time to come clean. </p>
<p>Tell me what you've done, tell me what you've seen."" </p>
<p>Well I started to lie then I thought what the hell, </p>
<p>it wouldn't have been the first time that I've spent New Years in jail. </p>
<p>I said, ""Sheriff it happened last night about ten, </p>
<p>and I thought that my wife had been drinking again."" </p>
<p>When she walked in from work she was as white as a ghost. </p>
<p>I thought maybe she had seen one of them UFO's. </p>
<p>But she said that a bunch of deer had just flown over her head, </p>
<p>and stopped on the roof of our good neighbour Red. </p>
<p>Well I ran outside to look and the sight made me shudder, </p>
<p>a freezer full of venison standing right on Red's gutter. </p>
<p>Well my hands were a shakin' as I grabbed my gun, </p>
<p>when outta Red's chimney this feller did run. </p>
<p>And slung on his back was this bag over flowin'. </p>
<p>I thought he'd stolen Red's stuff while old Red was out bowling'. </p>
<p>So I yelled, ""Drop fat boy, hands in the air!"" </p>
<p>But he went about his business like he hadn't a care. </p>
<p>So I popped a warning shot over his head. </p>

9743,"<p>Three nuns passed every day through a street that led them from Church to a Reformatory. They noticed a parrot that stood at the entrance of a big residential house. Every time they passed in front of that house, the bird would pronounce three sequential colours.One day, they heard ""yellow, blue, black."" One of the nuns noticed that those colours perfectly matched the colours of their underwear. She mentioned her discovery to the other two nuns, but both were reluctant to believe that could be possible.The next day, they all wore black underwear and passed in front of the house, and very precisely the parrot spoke, ""black, black, black."" Hearing that, the three nuns were astonished!!. One of the nuns spoke up: ""Girls, tomorrow we are going to trick that bird.""Saying that, she recommended that the next day, none of them should wear any underwear under their vestments. Respecting their agreement, next day they wore no underwear and proceeded to pass in front of the parrot's house.They peeked at the bird. At the beginning, the parrot looked a bit puzzled, he swung back and forth on the cane he was perched on. Then, after a while, the Parrot spoke: ""Straight, Straight, Curly!""</p>

9782,"<p>Picasso's mistress was losing her eyesight so he took her to an opthomologist in Paris. Upon examination, the doctor reported that nothing could be done and she would soon become blind. Picasso then sought out the best eye doctor in all of France, but got the same prognosis. He even took her to the best doctor in all of Europe, to no avail.</p>
<p>He then decided to take her for a trip around the world so that she could see the sights before totally losing eyesight. They were in San Francisco when they saw a sign reading ""Sam Smith-Eye Doctor, Free Consultation"". Picasso figured that it couldn't do any harm to try this doctor as she was going to be blind anyway.</p>
<p>After a thorough examination, Dr. Smith reported that when he did an operation in cases like hers that it would cure her. Picasso agreed to have the operation performed.</p>
<p>After the operation and a few weeks of recovery, the doctor removed the bandages, and what do you know, she could see 20/20. Picasso was overjoyed and said ,""Doctor, tell me your fee. I am a very rich man and will pay whatever you ask"".</p>
<p>Mr. Picasso"", the doctor replied ""I only ask my usual fee of $100.""</p>
<p>""Well then"", continued Picasso, ""To reward you handsomely, I will paint a mural on your waiting room wall. When I am finished, we will invite the art critics to see it.""</p>
<p>The doctor agreed to this offer because the room needed a paint job anyway. So Picasso labors behind a curtain for three weeks and when he is finished, invitations are sent to the press for a showing.</p>
<p>On the chosen date the critics crowd into the waiting room and when all are ready, Picasso pulls down the curtain and there on the wall is a great big eye. Thats all, just a giant size eye.</p>
<p>""Great"", the critics all exclaim. ""This is one of Picasso's greatest masterpieces"".</p>
<p>Picasso nudges the doctor and says ""Well, Sam, what did I tell you?""</p>
<p>The doctor replies ""Its a good thing I'm not a gynecologist!""</p>

9795,"<p>Charlie was a regular visitor at the racetrack. One afternoon he noticed an<br /> unusual sight. Right before the first race, a Catholic priest visited one of the<br /> horses in the stable area and gave it a blessing. Charlie watched the horse race<br /> very carefully, and sure enough the blessed horse came in first!<br /> Charlie followed the priest before the next race, and again the priest went to<br /> the stables and performed a similar procedure.<br /> Charlie played a hunch and put a couple of dollars on the blessed horse. Sure<br /> enough, the blessed horse came in by two lengths and Charlie won close to fifty<br /> bucks! The priest continued the same procedure through the next few races and<br /> Charlie won each time. He was now ahead $1000 so between races Charlie left the<br /> track and went to the bank and withdraws his life's savings, $20,000.<br /> The biggest race of the day was the last one. Charlie followed the priest and<br /> watched carefully which horse he blessed. He then went to the betting window and<br /> put his whole $21000 bundle of cash on that horse to win. Then Charlie went out<br /> to watch the horses' race. Down the stretch they came and as they crossed the<br /> finish line, the horse Charlie's fortune was bet on fell over and died on the<br /> race track.<br /> Charlie was crushed. He located the priest and told him that he had been<br /> watching him bless the horses all day and they all became winners except the<br /> last horse on which he had bet his life savings.<br /> Charlie then asked, ""What happened to the last horse which you blessed? Why<br /> didn't it win like the others?""<br /> ""That's the trouble with you Protestants,"" sighed the priest, ""you never can<br /> tell the difference between a blessing and the Last Rites.""</p>

<p>I told her I'd take a look and proceeded over to her machine, where I found shredded up clear plastic Baggie-like stuff hanging out of her 3.5"" floppy drive. While I spent the next 20 minutes getting out her disk and digging out the plastic, I noticed two guys, John and Dave, in the hall trying awfully hard to keep straight faces. Suspecting some mischief, I asked her how the plastic got into the drive. </p>
<p>""Oh, you mean the condom!"", she said. </p>
<p>""Condom???"", I asked. </p>
<p>""Yes, John &amp; Dave over there told me to always put a condom on my disk before inserting it, to prevent catching viruses."" </p>
<p>By this point, John &amp; Dave were roaring, and it was all I could do to keep from joining them. The ""condom"" turned out to be a standard 3.5"" plastic sleeve. I delicately explained to her that a practical joke had been played, and she shouldn't do that anymore, when she asked (as serious as one could be): </p>
<p>""Does that mean I don't have to stroke it ten times or blow on it either???""</p>

They must be saved! I will give $50,000 to the engine company that brings them out safely!""</p>
<p>As soon as the chief heard this, he ordered the firemen to strengthen their attack on the blaze. After two more hours of attacking the fire, president of the company offered $100,000 to the engine company that could bring out the company's secret files.</p>
<p>From the distance a long siren was heard and another fire truck came into sight. It was a local volunteer fire company composed entirely of men over 65. To everyone's amazement the little fire engine raced through the chemical plant gates and drove straight into the middle of the inferno. In the distance the other firemen watched as the old timers hopped off of their rig and began to fight the fire with an effort that they had never seen before.</p>
<p>After an hour of intense fighting the volunteer company had extinguished the fire and saved the secret formulas. Joyous the chemical company president announced that he would double the reward to $200,000 and walked over to personally thank each of the volunteers.</p>

9858,"<p>This guy lives in Westchester, NY and goes to school at Ithaca College. For two years, he has wanted to ask a certain girl (who is also from Westchester and also goes to Ithaca) out on a date, but has never had the courage. Finally, one day over the summer, he sees her at home and musters up the courage to ask her out. She accepts, and they make dinner plans for Saturday night. </p>
<p>Friday night, this guy goes out with all of his buddies, and drinks like Prohibition is coming back. Saturday, he is in such bad shape that he can't make it through 20 minutes without either throwing up or using the bathroom. After several hours of this, he is able to stop throwing up, but he is still running to the toilet every 20 minutes. He doesn't want to cancel the date, because he's afraid he won't ever talk to her again. </p>
<p>So they meet in Westchester, and take the train to New York City (about a 30 minute ride). They get to the restaurant, and he excuses himself during the appetizers to use the bathroom. They enjoy the rest of the appetizers without interruption, but he has to go back again during the entrees. They decide to get dessert. During dessert, our hero feels another rumbling, but doesn't want to look like complete bathroom freak, so he holds it. After a few minutes, the rumbling subsides, but he still has a bit of gas stored up. He decides to let this little bit of gas fly right there at the table (discreetly, of course).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this little bit of gas came with another little surprise. ""Oh crap,"" he thinks (and feels). Instead of running to the bathroom right away, our hero immediately leans on the arms of his chair to keep from sitting on this surprise. He maintains this yoga position for the rest of dessert, trying to figure out what to do before his tan pants (a) start to smell, or (b) start to show stains on the outside. He quickly pays for dinner and they leave the restaurant. Oh, by the way,he is walking like a cowboy. On the way to the train station, they pass the Gap. ""Do you mind if I run in and buy a sweater that I was looking at last week?"" he asks. </p>
<p>""No problem, I'd like to look around too,"" she replies. </p>
<p>They go into the Gap. Fortunately, at the Gap, men's fashions are on the right, women's fashions are on the left. They split up. Our hero grabs the first sweater within reach, and hurries back to the khakis. After selecting a pair that most closely resemble his current outfit, he brings both items to the register. His eyes are on his date (still on the other side of the store) to make sure that she doesn't see him buying the pants. He doesn't even want the sweater, so he says through clenched teeth (just in case his date can read lips from 40 feet away) </p>
<p>""Just the pants."" </p>
<p>""What?"" asks the Gap girl. </p>
<p>""Just the pants!"" (Eyes still trained on his date.) </p>
<p>Gap girl: ""Oh, OK."" </p>
<p>He pays for the pants and walks over to his date, then they leave the store. They board the train just before it leaves the station and find two seats in the middle of the car. Without sitting down, our hero excuses himself and walks to the bathroom in the back of the car. He gets to the bathroom as the train departs, and quickly rips off his pants and boxer shorts. He rolls them into a ball and throws them out the window. </p>
<p>After cleaning himself off, he opens the Gap bag and pulls out... just the sweater.</p>

<p>The man admitted he had a similar fear about his wife. ""Since we are in the same situation,"" the man suggested with an eager gleam in his eye, ""perhaps we could extract revenge together."" </p>
<p>With out another word, the two made there way to his sleeping compartment, where their partners' adultery was passionately avenged. The two lay still for several minutes afterward. Then as her lover turned over to sleep, the woman whispered, ""How about one more act of revenge?"" </p>

You sell 'Sex Dolls' for men - I'm here because I'm interested in buying, well, a Sex Doll. You know ... one with a Dick - for me.""The shop assistant was taken aback.  In front of him was a lady - about 25 years old - with a 36 DD bust ... And a figure he would have crawled over a kilometre of broken glass to buy a coffee for.""Well Miss - or Madam.""  He took another breath. ""Frankly, we don't get much call for that sort of thing.  However, we do have three models in the back room.""Hand on her chin, Sue looked him directly in the eye and smiled. ""Don't just stand there - tell me about them.""""Well,"" the man replied, ""I'm sure you won't like our first model.  It's called ""The Soccer Player"".  Don't get me wrong; It's very nice.  Powerful legs ... cute bum - But it does tend to 'dribble' a lot.""Sue wasn't exactly delighted about this.  ""Well ....No.  Not interested in that!"" Sue whispered,  ""What else have you got?""""Well, ""  came the reply, ""We also have the 'Aussie Cricketer' Listen, I must me fair with you.  This is a great model, big... well huge, in the right places, but ... """"Yes !?!"" gulped Sue, with eyes like dinner plates.""Once it's in - It's almost impossible to get it out.  Frankly, we've only sold two of these in the last four years""""Don't want that,"" said Sue.  ""You said you have three models.

9919,"<p>The following statement has been translated into Ebonics. Good evening. (Yo Yo<br /> Yo, s'up?). This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the<br /> Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury. (Today at my crib these<br /> suckers and playa-haters started grillin' a brotha). I answered their questions<br /> truthfully, including question about my private life, questions no American<br /> citizen would ever want to answer. (Dey started frontin' about my game and<br /> asking all kinds of fowl sh-t). Still, I must take complete responsibility for<br /> all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you<br /> tonight. (I'm tired of these haters throwing salt in my game. I'm going to let<br /> yall know my Mackin style tonight). As you know, in a deposition in January, I<br /> was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers<br /> were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. (Awhile back, you nosey<br /> motherfu-ers wanted to know if I was hittin' hoe-ass Monica's skins. You ain't<br /> got any video, so if you want to believe a $10 hoe then oh well).<br /> Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Levwinsky that was not appropriate.<br /> In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a<br /> personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.<br /> (Yeah, I was hittin' that dime dropping Bit-h! She was only sucking my jammie<br /> though. I was stupid for messing with a young big mouthed skank. My bad, but<br /> don't hate me because I'm a playa). But I told the grand jury today and I say to<br /> you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence.<br /> (Outside of that hit I told punk-ass AG (Al Gore) to put on gay-ass Star, Monica<br /> and her snitching friend, I was chill the whole time).<br /> I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to<br /> protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. (Check dis, I heard she<br /> was down with what ever, you know a freak ass beiach. She wasn't all that but I<br /> planned to pimp her around to my boyz in the Senate). The independent counsel<br /> investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life. And<br /> now the investigation itself is under investigation. (Those haters started<br /> sweatin' my homeys and my peeps. Dey pissed a nugga off when they tried to make<br /> me look like I'm not real or somefin. Matter of fact dey shady asses is on the<br /> take anyway).<br /> This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people.<br /> (Tryin' to hit me they wasted a lot of Cheddar and pissed off my Crew). Nothing<br /> is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim<br /> my family life for my family. It's nobody's business but ours. (I'm a pimp and<br /> playa and I'm going to be one, dey can�t change a nugga! Get some businesses.<br /> Hillary is chill because I got more than enough White Water dirt on her ass that<br /> will get her sent up before I'm outtied).<br /> It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into<br /> private life and get on with our national life. (Get off my jock because I'm<br /> going to flex regardless. Just in case yall forgot until you chumps ax me I'm<br /> still the sh-t!) Now it is time - in fact, it is past time - to move on. (F-k<br /> all yall, I don't give an f-k! Peace out!!!)</p>

9944,"<p>About a century or two ago, the Pope challenged the Jewish community of Rome<br /> to a debate. </p>
<p>The Jews looked around for a champion who could defend their faith, but no one<br /> wanted to volunteer. It was too risky. So they finally picked an old man named<br /> Moishe who spent his life sweeping up after people to represent them. Being old<br /> and poor, he had less to lose, so he agreed. He asked only for one addition to<br /> the rules of debate. Not being used to saying very much, he asked that neither<br /> side be allowed to talk. The Pope agreed. </p>
<p>The day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other<br /> for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.<br /> Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a<br /> circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope<br /> pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope<br /> stood up and said, ""I give up. This man is too good. The Jews win."" </p>
<p>An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what<br /> happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the<br /> Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger, to remind me that there was<br /> still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to<br /> show him, that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground,<br /> showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the<br /> wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to<br /> remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?"" </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe, amazed that this<br /> old, almost feeble-minded man had done what all their scholars had insisted was<br /> impossible. ""What happened?"" they asked. </p>
<p>""Well,"" said Moishe, ""first he said to me that the Jews had three days to get<br /> out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that<br /> this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying<br /> right here."" </p>
<p>""And then?"" asked a woman. </p>
<p>""I don't know,"" said Moishe. ""He took out his lunch and I took out mine.""</p>

9976,"<p>During late spring one year, a blonde was trying out her new boat. She was unable to have her boat perform, travel through water, or do any maneuvers whatsoever no matter how hard she tried.After trying for over three days to make it work properly, she decided to seek help. She putted the boat over to the local marina in hopes that someone there could identify her problem.Workers determined that everything from the engine to the outdrive was working perfectly on the topside of the boat. So, a puzzled marina employee jumped into the water to check underneath the boat for problems. Because he was laughing so hard, he came up choking on water and gasping for air. Under the boat, still strapped in place securely, was the trailer.</p>
