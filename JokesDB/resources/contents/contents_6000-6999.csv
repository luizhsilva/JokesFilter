6000,"<p>Q.  WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WIFE AND A JOB?</p>
<p>A.  AFTER TEN YEARS A JOB STILL SUCKS!</p>
"
6001,"<p>Tragically, three friends die in a car crash, and they find themselves at the gates of heaven. Before entering, they are each asked a question by St. Peter.<br /> ""When you are in your casket and friends and family are mourning upon you, what would you like to hear them say about you?"", asks St. Peter. </p>
<p>The first guy says, ""I would like to hear them say that I was a great doctor of my time, and a great family man."" </p>
<p>The second guy says, ""I would like to hear that I was a wonderful husband and school teacher who made a huge difference in our children of tomorrow."" </p>
<p>The last guy replies, ""I would like to hear them say.... LOOK!!! HE'S MOVING!!!!""</p>

6002,"<p>You've tried to argue that poverty could be abolished if people were just allowed to keep more of their minimum wage.</p>
"
6003,"<p>I can only please one person per day. today is not your day. tomorrow is not<br /> looking good either.</p>
<p>i love deadlines. i especially like the whooshing sound they make as they go<br /> flying by.</p>
<p>tell me what you need, and i'll tell you how to get along without it.</p>
<p>accept that some days you are the pigeon and most days the statue.</p>
<p>needing someone is like needing a parachute. if he isn't there the first time,<br /> chances are you won't be needing him again.</p>
<p>i don't have an attitude problem, you have a perception problem.</p>
<p>last night i lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky and i thought to<br /> myself, where the f*** is the ceiling?</p>
<p>my reality check bounced.</p>
<p>on the keyboard of life, always keep one finger on the escape key.</p>
<p>i don't suffer from stress. i am a carrier.</p>
<p>you are slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut butter.</p>
<p>do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, because you are crunchy and taste<br /> good with ketchup.</p>
<p>everyone is someone else's weirdo.</p>
<p>never argue with an idiot. they drag you down to their level then beat you<br /> with experience.</p>
<p>a pat on the back is only a few centimeters from a kick in the butt.</p>
<p>don't be irreplaceable - if you can't be replaced, you won't be promoted.</p>
<p>after any salary raise, you will have less money at the end of the month than<br /> you did before.</p>
<p>the more crap you put up with, the more crap you are going to get.</p>
<p>you can go anywhere you want if you look serious and carry a clipboard.</p>

<p>""When I got there, they had me park my old truck in the corral,"" Joe began.</p>

<p>""Inside the door, I was met by this dude,"" Joe went on.</p>
<p>""That would be the usher,"" Charlie explained.</p>
<p>""Well, the usher led me down the chute,"" Joe said.</p>
<p>""You mean the aisle,"" Charlie said.</p>
<p>""Then, he led me to a stall and told me to sit there,"" Joe continued.</p>
<p>""Pew,"" Charlie retorted.</p>
<p>""Yeah,"" recalled Joe. ""That's what that pretty lady said when I sat down beside her.""  </p>

6006,"<p>Ed was a successful computer programmer and a happy family man.  His life was blessed with a loving wife, 2 kids, three cats and a dog. Ed loved taking Rusty the dog for his evening walk and was proud when his son, little Johnny, began asking to go along on Rusty's evening walks. Little Johnny was an observant and curious child and one evening asked  his father: 'Daddy, why does Rusty always sniff that phone pole when we  take him for his walk?'Well, Ed wasn't sure how he should answer his son.  How DOES one explain the way animals mark their territory to a 6-year-old?  Stalling for time Ed asked:  'What do you think he's doing Johnny?' Johnny frowned in concentration, then brightened and said:   'I know!  I Know!  He's checking his P-Mail!'</p>

6007,"<p>Col. Saunders was lying on his death bed and asked to have the Pope visit<br /> him.<br /> It was explained that the pope is a very busy man and that he did not make<br /> such visits.<br /> Col Saunders said if he could have the pope visit him he would give a large<br /> donation to the church.</p>
<p>The pope was on the next flight and went to visit Col Saunders in his<br /> hospital bed.</p>
<p>The Col. felt he would like to leave his legacy on this earth, so he asked<br /> the pope ""you know that part in the bible where it says 'give us this day our<br /> daily bread'"" Yes, said the pope,  ""do you think you could change that to<br /> 'give us this day our daily chicken'</p>
<p>Startled at this the pope said that this was not possible.  Col. Sanders then<br /> told the pope if he could make the change he would give the church<br /> $50,000,000.00 and 5,000,000 every year that it remained.  The Col. then<br /> expired.</p>
<p>The pope left the Col. and went back to the Vatican and called all of the<br /> Bishops and the Theologians and spoke to them all.     ""On my trip to the<br /> United States, I have some good news and some bad news, first the good news,<br /> I made us $50,000,000.00 with an additional $5,000,000.00 dollars coming in<br /> every year thereafter, the bad news is we lost the Wonder-Bread account."".</p>

6018,"<p>Two local men were seriously injured when their pick-up truck left the road and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday morning. Woodruff County Deputy Davey Snyder reported the accident shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. </p>
<p>The accident occurred as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned. The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the .22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column. </p>
<p>Upon inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on east-bound toward the White River Bridge. After traveling approximately 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement and striking the tree. </p>
<p>Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released. </p>
<p>""Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his nuts off or we might have been dead"", stated Wallis. </p>
<p>""I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how the accident happened,"" said Snyder. </p>
<p>Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogs the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.</p>

Slowly, quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with HER BOSS!!!Ever so gently, she closed the door and crept out of her house. The next day, during their coffee break, the brunette and redhead mentioned leaving early again, and asked the blonde if she was with them. ""NO WAY,"" she exclaimed.

6046,"<p>Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe: </p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<p>1.) 532.35 cm3 gluten </p>
<p>2.) 4.9 cm3 NaHCO3 </p>
<p>3.) 4.9 cm3 refined halite </p>
<p>4.) 236.6 cm3 partially hydrogenated tallow triglyceride </p>
<p>5.) 177.45 cm3 crystalline C12H22O11 </p>
<p>6.) 177.45 cm3 unrefined C12H22O11 </p>
<p>7.) 4.9 cm3 methyl ether of protocatechuic aldehyde </p>
<p>8.) Two calcium carbonate-encapsulated avian albumen-coated protein </p>
<p>9.) 473.2 cm3 theobroma cacao 10.) 236.6 cm3 de-encapsulated legume meats (sieve size #10)</p>
<p>Directions: </p>
<p>To a 2-L jacketed round reactor vessel (reactor #1) with an overall heat transfer coefficient of about 100 Btu/F-ft2-hr, add ingredients one, two and three with constant agitation. </p>
<p>In a second 2-L reactor vessel with a radial flow impeller operating at 100 rpm, add ingredients four, five, six, and seven until the mixture is homogenous. </p>
<p>To reactor #2, add ingredient eight, followed by three equal volumes of the homogenous mixture in reactor #1. Additionally, add ingredient nine and ten slowly, with constant agitation. Care must be taken at this point in the reaction to control any temperature rise that may be the result of an exothermic reaction. </p>
<p>Using a screw extrude attached to a #4 nodulizer, place the mixture piece-meal on a 316SS sheet (300 x 600 mm). </p>
<p>Heat in a 460K oven for a period of time that is in agreement with Frank &amp; Johnston's first order rate expression (see JACOS, 21, 55), or until golden brown. </p>
<p>Once the reaction is complete, place the sheet on a 25C heat-transfer table, allowing the product to come to equilibrium.</p>

6052,"<p>'Twas the week after Christmas, and all through the house </p>
<p>Nothing would fit me, not even a blouse. </p>
<p>The cookies I'd nibbled, the eggnog I'd taste </p>
<p>At the holiday parties had gone to my waist. </p>
<p>When I got on the scales there arose such a number! </p>
<p>When I walked to the store (less a walk than a lumber). </p>
<p>I'd remember the marvelous meals I'd prepared; </p>
<p>The gravies and sauces and beef nicely rared, </p>
<p>The wine and the rum balls, the bread and the cheese </p>
<p>And the way I'd never said, ""No thank you, please."" </p>
<p>As I dressed myself in my husband's old shirt </p>
<p>And prepared once again to do battle with dirt--- </p>
<p>I said to myself, as I only can </p>
<p>""You can't spend a winter disguised as a man!"" </p>
<p>So--away with the last of the sour cream dip, </p>
<p>Get rid of the fruit cake, every cracker and chip </p>
<p>Every last bit of food that I like must be banished </p>
<p>""Till all the additional ounces have vanished. </p>
<p>I won't have a cookie--not even a lick. </p>
<p>I'll want only to chew on a long celery stick. </p>
<p>I won't have hot biscuits, or corn bread, or pie, </p>
<p>I'll munch on a carrot and quietly cry. </p>
<p>I'm hungry, I'm lonesome, and life is a bore--- </p>
<p>But isn't that what January is for? </p>
<p>Unable to giggle, no longer a riot. </p>
<p>Happy New Year to all and to all a good diet!</p>

6055,"<p>Earlier this year, the dazed crew of a Japanese Trawler was plucked out<br /> of the Sea of Japan clinging to the wreckage of their sunken ship.</p>
<p>Their rescue, however, was followed by immediate imprisonment once<br /> authorities questioned the sailors on their ship's loss. To a man they<br /> claimed that a cow, falling out of a clear blue sky, had struck the<br /> trawler amidships, shattering it's hull and sinking the vessel within<br /> minutes.</p>
<p>They remained in prison for several weeks, until the Russian Air Force<br /> reluctantly informed Japanese authorities that the crew of one of its<br /> cargo planes had apparently stolen a cow wandering at the edge of a<br /> Siberian airfield, forced the cow into the plane's hold and hastily taken<br /> off for home.</p>
<p>Unprepared for live cargo, the Russian crew was ill-equipped to manage a<br /> now rampaging cow within its hold.  To save the aircraft and themselves,<br /> they shoved the animal out of the cargo hold as they crossed the Sea of<br /> Japan at an altitude of 30,000 feet.</p>

6068,"<p>A guy looking for a job finds that a certain mill is hiring<br /> lumberjacks. So he goes out to the mill and talks to the foreman<br /> who tells him all about the job, pay, and housing for all of the<br /> lumberjacks. Everything looks perfect and the guy is ready to go<br /> to work at once.</p>
<p>But when he was walking around he noticed that there weren't any<br /> women around. So he pulls the foreman aside and asks him what<br /> everyone does for sex. The foreman laughs and brings him over to<br /> this big tree that has a hole in it. ""This is the fucking tree.<br /> Whenever you get horny, come over and put your dick in the hole<br /> and fuck away. Trust me, it does the trick every time."" The man<br /> thinks it's kind of odd, but takes the job anyway.</p>
<p>The days go by and soon the man gets horny. He thinks about<br /> taking it out on the tree, but it still seems weird to him, so<br /> he goes to his room and jacks off. A week passes and the guy<br /> gets hornier and hornier and jacking off isn't enough for him.<br /> So finally he figures, ""What the hell,"" and sneaks over to the<br /> fucking tree in the middle of the night, whips out his dick and<br /> puts it in the hole. To his surprise, it feels great! Soon<br /> enough he starts to fuck the shit out of it. After a great<br /> session he goes back to bed with a big smile.</p>
<p>The next day after a hard day of work, he makes another visit to<br /> the tree and it's even better this time. Again he pounds away at<br /> the tree. He can't believe how amazing the tree is and wonders<br /> what kind of magic tree they have. Things just couldn't get<br /> better for him.</p>
<p>The following day, he runs to the tree after work, hurriedly<br /> takes out his dick and puts it into the sweet warm fucking tree.<br /> The tree just gets better and better everyday. He goes at it<br /> again, and afterwards can hardly walk.</p>
<p>The next day all he can think about is going back to the fucking<br /> tree. Every tree that he cuts down is one less tree in his way<br /> of the fucking tree. Finally the day is done, and he takes off<br /> for the tree. Pulls out his dick, grabs hold of the tree, and<br /> shoves it in. Nothing. The man is shocked. He tries again, but<br /> still nothing. Feeling very frustrated, the man storms off to<br /> the foreman. ""What's wrong with the fucking tree? I've been<br /> there three times already and it's been better each time, but<br /> today, I ran up to it, stuck my dick in and nothing happened.<br /> What the hell happened?"" The foreman thinks for a second and<br /> then says, ""Oh yeah, I know, didn't they tell you? Today's your<br /> day in the tree.""</p>

I'm supposed to buy my mother-in-law a<br /> present for her birthday, from the two of us. And I am fresh out of ideas. I<br /> mean it's HER mother, why can't she buy it?""<br /> ""What did you buy her last year?"" the other one asked.<br /> ""Last year I bought her a VERY EXPENSIVE cemetery plot.""<br /> ""Hmmmm, hard to top that one,"" said the other.<br /> The two guys couldn't come up with anything. So the son-in-law didn't buy his<br /> mother-in-law anything for her birthday.<br /> When the big day arrived the next weekend, she was a bit upset. At the family<br /> gathering for her birthday, she announced out loud to everyone, ""Thank you all<br /> for the wonderful gifts. Too bad my daughter and son-in-law weren't so<br /> thoughtful!""<br /> Thinking quickly, the son-in-law responded, ""Well, you haven't<br /> used the gift I gave you last year!""</p>

<p>The day turns to night and the two men meet at the campsite and<br /> one says to the other, ""So,how was your day?""</p>
<p>""Oh, it was fabulous. I hiked towards the south, down into the<br /> valley and swam in this crystal blue stream and laid out in the<br /> sun until I was dry. When I woke up I saw a deer drinking from<br /> the stream and it was the most serene vision I have ever had.<br /> How was your day?""</p>
<p>The other camper says, ""Well, I hiked north and came upon these<br /> railroad tracks. I followed them until I found this woman tied<br /> to the tracks so I untied her and we had sex all day long, in<br /> every position imaginable. It was the best sex I ever had and<br /> when we just couldn't do it anymore, I hiked back here.""</p>
<p>The other camper responds, ""Wow! your day was much better than<br /> mine! Did you get a blowjob too?""</p>
<p>""Nah, I couldn't find her head.""</p>

Geological Society of America?"" 3. You refuse to let nightfall stop your field excursions and continue looking at the outcrops using the headlights of your field vehicle. 4. You like rock music only because it's called ""rock"" music. 5. You will try to claw through the water flowing in a stream to get a better look at the bedrock at the base of the channel. 6.

6143,"<p>According to today's regulators and bureaucrats, those of us who were kids in the 60's, 70's and early 80's probably shouldn't have survived, because our baby cots were covered with brightly coloured lead-based paint which was promptly chewed and licked.</p>
<p>We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, or latches on doors or cabinets and it was fine to play with pans.</p>
<p>When we rode our bikes, we wore no helmets, just flip flops and fluorescent 'spokey dokey's on our wheels.�</p>
<p>As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or airbags, riding in the passenger seat was a treat.</p>
<p>We drank water from the garden hose and not from bottles and it tasted the same.</p>
<p>We ate chips, bread and butter pudding and drank fizzy pop with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing.</p>
<p>We shared one drink with four friends, from one bottle or can and no-one actually died from this.</p>
<p>We would spend hours building go-carts out of scraps and then went top speed down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes.</p>
<p>After running into stinging nettles a few times, we learned to solve the problem.</p>
<p>We would leave home in the morning and could play all day, as long as we were back before it got dark. No one was able to reach us and no one minded.</p>
<p>We did not have Play stations or X-Boxes, no video games at all. No 99 channels on TV, no videotape movies, no surround sound, no mobile phones, no personal computers, and no Internet chat rooms. We had friends we went outside and found them.</p>
<p>We played elastics and street rounders, and sometimes that ball really hurt.</p>
<p>We fell out of trees, got cut and broke bones but there were no law suits.</p>
<p>We had full on fist fights but no prosecution followed from other parents.</p>
<p>We played knock-and-run and were actually afraid of the owners catching us.</p>
<p>We walked to friend's homes.</p>
<p>We also, believe it or not, WALKED to school; we didn't rely on mummy or daddy to drive us to school, which was just round the corner.</p>
<p>We made up games with sticks and tennis balls.</p>
<p>We rode bikes in packs of 7 and wore our coats by only the hood.</p>
<p>The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law unheard of. They actually sided with the law.</p>
<p>This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever.</p>
<p>The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas.</p>
<p>We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all.</p>
<p>And you're one of them. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Pass this on to others who have had the luck to grow as real kids, before lawyers and government regulated our lives, for our own good.</p>
<p>For those of you who aren't old enough thought you might like to read about us.</p>
<p>This my friends, is surprisingly frightening......and it might put a smile on your face: The majority of students in universities today were born in 1983........They are called youth.</p>
<p>They have never heard of ""We are the World, We are the children"", and the ""Uptown Girl"", they know is by Westlife not Billy Joel.</p>
<p>They have never heard of Rick Astley, Bananarama, Nena or Belinda� Carlisle.</p>
<p>For them, there has always been only one Germany and one Vietnam.</p>
<p>AIDS has existed since they were born.</p>
<p>CD's have existed since they were born.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson has always been white.</p>
<p>To them John Travolta has always been round in shape and they can't imagine how this fat guy could be a god of dance.</p>
<p>They believe that Charlie's Angels and Mission Impossible are Films from last year.</p>
<p>They can never imagine life before computers.</p>
<p>They'll never have pretended to be the A Team, Red Hand Gang or the Famous Five.</p>
<p>They can't believe a black and white television ever existed and don't even know how to switch on a TV without a remote control.</p>
<p>And they will never understand how we could leave he house without a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Now let's check if we're getting old...</p>
<p>1. You understand what was written above and you smile.</p>
<p>2. You need to sleep more, usually until the afternoon, after a night out.</p>
<p>3. Your friends are getting married/already married.</p>
<p>4. You are always surprised to see small children playing comfortably with computers.</p>
<p>5. When you see teenagers with mobile phones, you shake your head.</p>
<p>6. You meet your friends from time to time, talking about the good old days, repeating again all the funny you have experienced together.</p>
<p>7. Having read this mail, you are thinking of forwarding it to some other friends because you think they will like it too...</p>
<p>Yes, you're getting older!!!!</p>

<p>She had one eccentric characteristic (which was unknown when she was hired)<br /> she wore short skirts and no underwear.  Needless to say she was a real beauty and<br /> had a figure to die for.  </p>
<p>The bakery has a small storefront so it was necessary to<br /> have the various products on shelves and then use a ladder to reach the uppermost<br /> items.  The item that had previously been least popular but was fast becoming the most<br /> popular with gentlemen in particular was rasin bread, which was kept on the<br /> uppermost shelf.</p>
<p>One day an elderly gentleman came in and ordered a loaf of bread.  The young lady without<br /> thinking scurried up the ladder and then realized she had not asked the<br /> gentleman what kind of bread he had wanted so she nodded and<br /> asked, ""Raisin?"" </p>

<p>""We're taking TWA,"" the man replies. ""TWA?!"" yells Joe. ""They're<br /> a terrible airline. Their planes are old, the food is terrible<br /> and they're always late! So where you staying in Rome?""</p>

<p>""Well,"" Joe mumbles, ""I know you didn't get to see the Pope!""</p>

6169,"<p>Q:  How many congressmen does it take to change a light bulb?A:  Five hundred and thirty-five, but only if the following conditions are met: The light bulb will not be changed in an election year. A committee will study the light-bulb situation for at least a year. Taxes will have to be raised. A fair and proportionate number of the light-bulb changers will be from minority groups. No Social Security funds will be used to change the bulb. Each state and congressional district will share in the benefits of changing the light bulb. The blame for the failure of the present bulb will be assigned to the other party. The new bulb will be twice as bright as the old bulb. Because the new bulb is twice as bright as the old bulb, it will cost 130 times as much. A Blue Ribbon Panel will investigate the light-bulb failures and issue a mega-page report to the congress. A fact-finding trip to all countries known to produce light bulbs will be made by most congressmen and their wives. The CIA will investigate the Russian light-bulb-changing system. Details of the Russian light-bulb-changing system will be sold to the Chinese by an American naval officer. The surgeon general will issue a report about the perils of over-bright light bulbs. A program to supply light bulbs to those who cannot afford them will be introduced by Tip O'Neill. President Reagan will give a speech extolling the virtues of kerosene lanterns. Tip O'Neall will initiate a program of free kerosene for the needy. And finally, each and every congressman will send every one of his constituents a newsletter describing how he managed to get the light bulb changed almost single-handedly.</p>
"
6170,"<p>In response to the woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom:</p>
<p>Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the time. It's rare for us guys to ever hit what were aiming for. Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around; just so I'll make sure I hit something.</p>
<p>You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't be trusted.</p>
<p>After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I'm no longer allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.</p>
<p>Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm a classy guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem, and you ladies need to be understanding. It's the dreaded ""morning wood"".</p>
<p>Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it don't bend you can't aim, well hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet.</p>
<p>And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control ourselves for that perfect aim.</p>
<p>Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie.</p>
<p>So us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe. I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her . . . look, it won't bend. She said, ""sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time."" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with ""morning wood"".</p>
<p>Well it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet.</p>
<p>I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying superman position lying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee.</p>
<p>So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.</p>
<p>It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature.</p>
<p>Now, if it was Father Nature,... there wouldn't have been a problem!!!</p>

""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""If you said you paid, you did."" The man then goes outside and tells the first person he sees that the bartender can't keep track of whether his customers have paid. The second man then rushes in, orders a beer and later pulls the same stunt.The barkeep replies, ""If you say you paid, I'll take your word for it."" Soon the customer goes into the street, sees an old friend, and tells him how to get free drinks.

<p>Soon she was fondling my Peter Pan and ZagNut and I knew it wouldn't be long<br /> before I blew my Milk Duds clear to Mars that gave her a taste of the old Milky<br /> Way. </p>
<p>She asked me if I was into M&amp;M, but I said, �Hey Chick let, no kinky stuff.� I<br /> said, �Look you little Reese's Pieces, don't be a Zero, be a Lifesaver. Why<br /> don't you take my Whatchamacallit and slip it up your Bit 'O' Honey?� </p>

<p>As the story goes on, Never the less to say, The wind came along, And blew the leaves away.</p>
<p>At the sight, Adam did stare, There was Eve's treasure, All covered with hair.</p>
<p>And wonder came, Under Eve's eyes, As Adam's thing, Started to rise.</p>
<p>They found a spot, That suited them best, A nice big tree, Where they began to rest.</p>
<p>Her legs spread wider, And wider apart, While thrill after thrill, Came into her heart.</p>
<p>The head of Adam's thing, Peeked into the hole, And filled her with passion, Beyond her control.</p>
<p>Backward and forward, His thing did slide, And Eve's treasure, Was all wet inside.</p>
<p>The joy was good, She wouldn't let loose, Until Adam's thing, Was all out of juice.</p>

<p>An unidentified man, using a shotgun like a club to break a former girlfriend's windshield, accidentally shot himself to death when the gun discharged, blowing a hole in his gut.</p>
<p>Ken Charles Barger, 47, accidentally shot himself to death in December in Newton, N. C., when, awakening to the sound of a ringing telephone beside his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed instead a Smith &amp; Wesson . 38 Special, which discharged when he drew it to his ear.</p>
<p>A terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no mark on his body but autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system.</p>
<p>His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the right combination of foods. It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing from the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed. Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it wouldn't have been fatal. But the man was shut up in his near airtight bedroom. He was a big man with a huge capacity for creating [this deadly gas]. ""Three of the rescuers got sick and one was hospitalized.</p>
<p>]Man slips, falls 23 stories to his death. A man cleaning a bird feeder on his balcony of his condominium apartment in a Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23 stories to his death, police said Monday. Stefan Macko, 55, was standing on a wheeled chair Sunday when the accident occurred, said Inspector D'Arcy Honer of the Peel regional police.  ""It appears the chair moved and he went over the balcony,"" Honer said. ""It's one of those freak accidents. No foul play is suspected.""</p>
<p>Police said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a downtown Toronto skyscraper crashed through a pane with his shoulder and plunged 24 floors to his death. A police spokesman said Garry Hoy, 39, fell into the courtyard of the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower early Friday evening as he was explaining the strength of the building's windows to visiting law students.  Hoy previously had conducted demonstrations of window strength according to police reports. Peter Lauwers, managing partner of the firm Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper that Hoy was ""one of the best and brightest"" members of the 200-man association.</p>
<p>Six people drowned Monday while trying to rescue a chicken that had fallen into a well in southern Egypt. An 18-year-old farmer was the first to descend into the 60-foot well. He drowned, apparently after an undercurrent in the water pulled him down, police said. His sister and two brothers, none of whom could swim well, went in one by one to help him, but also drowned.<br /> Two elderly farmers then came to help, but they apparently were pulled by the same undercurrent.  The bodies of the six were later pulled out of the well in the village of Nazlat Imara, 240 miles south of Cairo. The chicken was also pulled out. It survived.</p>
<p>[Times of London] A thief who sneaked into a hospital was scarred for life when he tried to get a suntan. After evading security staff at Odstock Hospital in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and helping himself to doctor's paging devices, the thief spotted a vertical sun bed. He walked into the unit and removed his clothes for a 45-minute tan.  However, the high-voltage UV machine at the hospital, which is renowned for its treatment of burns victims, has a maximum dosage of 10 seconds. After lying on the bed for almost 300 times the recommended maximum time, the man was covered in blisters. Hours later, when the pain of the burns became unbearable, he went to Southampton General Hospital, 20 miles away, in Hampshire.  Staff became suspicious because he was wearing a doctor's coat. After tending his wounds they called the police. Southampton police said:  ""This man broke into Odstock and decided he fancied a quick suntan. Doctors say he is going to be scarred for life.  </p>

Burns' clothes caught on something, however, and the other man found Burns ""wrapped in the drive shaft. "" [Kalamazoo Gazette, 4-1-95]</p>
<p>* Same thing up here in MI. Seems some poor fella thought it would be a good idea to ""move"" a downed wire from his car. Newspaper reports it took a FULL MINUTE of neighbors whacking away at him with a 2x4 to free their freshly fried former friend from the fatal flashing.</p>
<p>* Bowling Green, Ohio, student Robert Ricketts, 19, had his head bloodied when he was struck by a Conrail train. He told police he was trying to see how close to the moving train he could place his head without getting hit.</p>
<p>* In Wesley Chapel, Florida, Joseph Aaron, 20, was hit in the leg with pieces of the bullet he fired at the exhaust pipe of his car. When repairing the car, he needed to bore a hole in the pipe. When he couldn't find a drill, he tried to shoot a hole in it.</p>

6229,"<p>There's this fellow with a parrot.  And the parrot swears like a sailor.  I mean he's a pistol.  He can swear for five minutes straight without repeating himself. Trouble is, the guy who owns him is a quiet, polite, conservative type, and this bird's foul mouth is driving him crazy.    One day, it gets to be too much, so the guy grabs the parrot by the throat,shakes him really hard, and yells, 'QUIT IT!'.  This just makes the bird mad and he swears more than ever.  Then the guy gets mad and says 'OK for you' and locks the bird in a kitchen cabinet.  This really   aggravates the bird and he claws and scratches.   When the guy finally lets him out, the bird cuts loose with a stream of vulgarities that would make a veteran sailor blush.  At that point, the guy is so mad that he throws the bird into the freezer.  For the first few   seconds there is a terrible din.  The bird kicks and claws and thrashes and uses words Lenny Bruce   and George Carlin NEVER thought about trying to use in their acts.    Then suddenly, it gets VERY quiet.    At first the guy just waits, but then he starts to think that the bird may be hurt or deeply   chilled.  After a couple of minutes of silence, he's so worried that he opens the freezer door.    The bird calmly climbs onto the man's outstretched arm and says,'Awfully sorry about the trouble I gave you.  I'll do my best to improve my vocabulary from now on.'    The man is astonished.  He can't understand the   transformation that has taken place.    Then the parrot says, 'By the way, what did the chicken do?'</p>

6240,"<p>1. Save all manner of bacon grease. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone eating.2. Just because one can drive on snow and ice does not mean we can't stay home the two days of the year it snows.3. If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four-wheel-drive with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Note: Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way: This is what they live for.4. Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and fishing bait in the same store.5. Remember: ""Y'all"" is singular.6. ""All y'all"" is plural. ""All y'all's"" is plural possessive.7. There is nothing sillier than a northerner imitating a Southern accent, unless it is a Southerner imitating a Boston accent.8. People walk slower here.9. Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't understand you either.10. The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective ""Big ol'"", as in ""big ol' truck"" or ""big ol' boy"". Eighty-five percent begin their new southern influenced dialect with this expression. One hundred percent are in denial about it.11. The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer proper.12. ""He needed killin'"" is a valid defense here.13. If attending a funeral in the South: remember, we stay until the last shovel of dirt is thrown on and the tent is torn down.14. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"" stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say.15. Most Southerners do not use turn signals, and they ignore those who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the car was purchased.16. Northerners can be identified by the spit on the inside of their car's windshield that comes from yelling at other drivers.17. The winter wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until November.18. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the tiniest accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store, it is just something you're supposed to do.19. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase one it is to be positioned directly in front of your trailer. This is logical bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the trailer and should, therefore, be displayed.20. Tornadoes and Southerners going through a divorce have a lot in common. In either case, you know someone is going to lose a trailer.21. Florida is not considered a Southern state (except Gainesville). There are far more Yankees than Southerners living there.22. As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph zone, directly in the middle of the road, remember, many folks learned to drive on a model of vehicle known as John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for the vehicle.23. You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find it yourself.</p>

<p>It's like before my wife and I moved. Our house was full of boxes and there<br /> was a U-Haul truck in our driveway. My friend comes over and says ""Hey, you<br /> moving?"" ""Nope. We just pack our stuff up once or twice a week to see how many<br /> boxes it takes. Here's your sign.""</p>

<p>I was watching one of those animal shows on the Discovery Channel. There was a<br /> guy inventing a shark bite suit. And there's only one way to test it.

I<br /> was driving around and those other three just swelled right up on me. Here's<br /> your sign.""</p>
<p>We were trying to sell our car about a year ago. A guy came over to the house<br /> and drove the car around for about 45 minutes. We get back to the house; he gets<br /> out of the car, reaches down and grabs the exhaust pipe, then says, ""Darn that's<br /> hot!"" See? If he'd been wearing his sign, I could have stopped him.</p>
<p>I learned to drive an 18-wheeler in my days of adventure. Wouldn't ya know I<br /> misjudged the height of a bridge? The truck got stuck and I couldn't get it out<br /> no matter how I tried. I radioed in for help and eventually a local cop shows up<br /> to take the report. He went through his basic questioning.ok.no problem. I<br /> thought sure he was clear of needing a sign...until he asked ""So. Is your truck<br /> stuck?"" I couldn't help myself! I looked at him, looked back at the rig and then<br /> back to him and said ""No, I'm delivering a bridge... here's your sign.""</p>

When the manager gave him the gift she accidentally gave him a pair of panties instead. When the girlfriend got the gift there was a note attached to it. The note read:</p>
<p>Dear Honey,</p>
<p>Hope you like the gift. The lady at the store said they were perfect. I had her try them on for me. She looked more like a lady. Oh, when you take them off be sure to wash them because they will be damp at times. I hope you will wear them for me Friday night. </p>
<p>Love,<br /> Bobby</p>
<p>PS:I can't wait to take them off of you. The latest style is to wear them folded in with a little fur showing.</p>

The guy likes the house and tells him that he always wanted a house like this on his farm. </p>
<p>Then the farmer shows him the barn. The city fellow likes the barn and tells him that he's always wanted a barn like this on his farm. Then the farmer shows him the land and the guy is very pleased with it and was just about to write the farmer a check when he noticed some bees flying around a tree. </p>
<p>The farmer told him they were honey bees and that they were very nice. The man still refused and told him he didn't trust bees and he didn't want any on his farm. </p>
<p>The farmer was very eager to sell his farm so he told the man that he'll tie him naked to a tree and cover him with honey and if one of the bees stings him he could have this farm for half of what he was asking. The buyer agrees and lets the farmer ties him up. </p>
<p>About 6 hours later the farmer remembers about the buyer and went to see him. When he got to him he asked him if any bees stung him and he said, ""No but doesn't this cow have a mother?""</p>

<p>She's wearing a cute, loose-fitting, pink spring dress, sleeveless with straps. As they walk through the ape exhibit and pass in front of a very large gorilla, the gorilla goes ape.</p>
<p>He jumps up on the bars, holding on with one hand (and 2 feet), grunting and pounding his chest with the free hand. </p>

<p>""Oh I'll be all right,"" Little Red answered as she pulled out a<br /> rather large shotgun from the basket she was carrying. Assured<br /> that her daughter would be safe, she allowed Little Red to leave<br /> the house and begin the journey to Grandmother's house.</p>

"
6315,"<p>DOS Beer:<br /> Requires you to use your own can opener, and requires you to read the<br /> directions carefully before opening the can. Originally only came in an 8-oz.<br /> can, but now comes in a 16-oz. can. However, the can is divided into 8<br /> compartments of 2 oz. each, which have to be accessed separately. Soon to be<br /> discontinued, although a lot of people are going to keep drinking it after it's<br /> no longer available. </p>
<p>Mac Beer:<br /> At first, came only a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz. can. Considered by<br /> many to be a ""light"" beer. All the cans look identical. When you take one from<br /> the fridge, it opens itself. The ingredients list is not on the can. If you call<br /> to ask about the ingredients, you are told that ""you don't need to know."" A<br /> notice on the side reminds you to drag your empties to the trashcan. </p>
<p>Windows 3.1 Beer:<br /> The world's most popular. Comes in a 16-oz. can that looks a lot like Mac<br /> Beer's. Requires that you already own a DOS Beer. Claims that it allows you to<br /> drink several DOS Beers simultaneously, but in reality you can only drink a few<br /> of them, very slowly, especially slowly if you are drinking the Windows Beer at<br /> the same time. Sometimes, for apparently no reason, a can of Windows Beer will<br /> explode when you open it. </p>
<p>OS/2 Beer:<br /> Comes in a 32-oz can. Does allow you to drink several DOS beers<br /> simultaneously. Allows you to drink Windows 3.1 Beer simultaneously too, but<br /> somewhat slower. Advertises that its cans won't explode when you open them, even<br /> if you shake them up. You never really see anyone drinking OS/2 Beer, but the<br /> manufacturer (International Beer Manufacturing) claims that 9 million six-packs<br /> have been sold. </p>
<p>Windows 95 Beer:<br /> The can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but tastes more like Windows 3.1<br /> Beer. It comes in 32-oz. cans, but when you look inside, the cans only have 16<br /> oz. of beer in them. Most people will probably keep drinking Windows 3.1 Beer<br /> until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and say they like it. The ingredients<br /> list, when you look at the small print, has some of the same ingredients that<br /> come in DOS beer, even though the manufacturer claims that this is an entirely<br /> new brew. </p>
<p>Windows 98 Beer<br /> Looks just like Windows 95 beer, but has more fat. Actually has 32 oz. per can<br /> this time even though they claim it has more than Windows 95 beer. Hardly<br /> anybody is drinking it because they just figured out how to open the cans in<br /> Windows 95 beer. Manufacturer claims this is a mnew and improved beer, what they<br /> mean is the caught the brew master pissing in the Windows 95 beer and the<br /> Windows 98 beer is minus these problems. </p>
<p>Windows NT Beer:<br /> Comes in 32-oz. cans, but you can only buy it by the truckload. This causes<br /> most people to have to go out and buy bigger refrigerators. The can looks just<br /> like Windows 3.1 Beer's, but the company promises to change the can to look just<br /> like Windows 95 Beer's - after Windows 95 beer starts shipping. Touted as an<br /> ""industrial strength"" beer, and suggested only for use in bars. </p>
<p>Unix Beer:<br /> Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz. to 64 oz.<br /> Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even though they claim that<br /> all the different brands taste almost identical. Sometimes the pop-tops break<br /> off when you try to open them, so you have to have your own can opener around<br /> for those occasions, in which case you either need a complete set of<br /> instructions, or a friend who has been drinking Unix Beer for several years. </p>
<p>AmigaDOS Beer:<br /> The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked up by<br /> some weird German company, so now this beer will be an import. This beer never<br /> really sold very well because the original manufacturer didn't understand<br /> marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extremely loyal and loud<br /> group. It originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans too.<br /> When this can was originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but<br /> the design hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now. Critics<br /> of this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway. </p>
<p>VMS Beer:<br /> Requires minimal user interaction, except for popping the top and sipping.<br /> However cans have been known on occasion to explode, or contain extremely<br /> un-beer-like contents. Best drunk in high pressure development environments.<br /> When you call the manufacturer for the list of ingredients, you're told that<br /> it's proprietary and referred to an unknown listing in the manuals published by<br /> the FDA. Rumors are that this was once listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference<br /> as a tranquilizer, but no one can claim to have actually seen it.</p>

The only problem was every time they went to put the mule back in his stall, his ears would brush the top of the entrance and then the old mule would go nuts and kick everything. One day, the farmers decided to cut a opening in the top to prevent this from happening. While they were working, a neighbor stopped by and asked what they were doing, so they explained the problem. The neighbor suggested that they could save a lot of work and time if they simply took a shovel and dug the entrance down a little bit. The farmers thanked their neighbor and he drove off. Then the one farmer said to the other, 'Some stupid neighbor we have, it's not his feet that's too long, it's his ears!'</p>

<p>He asked, ""Do you know how they make these gloves?"" The woman<br /> shook her head. The doctor explained, ""In a big rubber factory<br /> they have a whole lot of men and women with different hand sizes<br /> and they have to put their hands into a big huge tank of melted<br /> rubber and wait until it dries and then take it off and do it<br /> again."" The woman didn't even blink she seemed to be too busy<br /> trying not the panic.</p>
<p>So he tried telling her a joke or two but once again she didn't<br /> even smirk. So he gave up about five to ten minute later.</p>
<p>In the middle of getting the tooth removed she burst out<br /> laughing and he had to stop in case she'd choke. He asked,<br /> ""What's wrong?"" She just laughed and said, ""If that's how they<br /> make gloves I wonder how they make condoms.""</p>

<p>The French space program took a significant step backward today as the European  Space Agency announced that a much-heralded French Mars probe surrendered just  moments after landing on the red planet.</p>
<p>The probe, which had been expected to travel extensively across the surface of  Mars to collect and analyze rock samples, stunned the French nation by  surrendering only eight seconds into its mission.</p>
<p>As millions of astonished Frenchmen watched on national TV, the probe extended  a robotic arm -- designed to scoop up rocks from the surface of Mars - and  raised a white flag aloft, waving it back and forth.</p>
<p>The probe then used a robotic shovel to dig a hole in the Martian surface  before disappearing into the hole, apparently hiding.</p>
<p>At a press conference in Paris, French President Jacques Chirac denied that the  probe had surrendered, arguing, ""This mission was always intended to be eight  seconds long.  The probe has performed courageously and superbly.""</p>
<p>Despite earlier announced plans for the French Mars probe to exchange  information about the surface of Mars with the American Mars probes, Mr. Chirac  said, ""The Americans will have to go it alone.""</p>

So he turned the thermastat to 150 degrees F. So the next day, the farmer replies, "" It was just like workin on the feilds."" So the devil turned it up to 250 F. The next day, the devil asked him how he was and again he said he was fine. So, the devil thought to himself,""I'm smart.....This guy just doesn't mind the heat,"" So he turned it down to -100 F.

6418,"<p>A lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY. The lawyer leans over to her and asks if she would like to play a fun game. The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.<br /> The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and visa-versa."" Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep.<br /> The lawyer, now somewhat agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $50!"" figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match.<br /> This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game.<br /> The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a five-dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer.<br /> Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer ""What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?"" The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends E-mails to all his coworkers and friends he knows. All to no avail.<br /> After over an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $50. The blonde politely takes the $50 and turns away to get back to sleep.<br /> The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, ""Well, so what IS the answer!?""<br /> Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.</p>

Then, their pastor retired and a new one was hired. Not only could he see right through the brothers' deception, but he also spoke well and true, and the church started to swell in numbers. A fund-raising campaign was started to build a new assembly. All of a sudden, one of the brothers died. The remaining brother sought out the new pastor the day before the funeral and handed him a check for the amount needed to finish paying for the new building. 'I have only one condition,' he said. 'At his funeral, you must say my brother was a saint.'The pastor gave his word and deposited the check. The next day at the funeral, the pastor did not hold back. 'He was an evil man,' he said. 'He cheated on his wife and abused his family.' After going on in this vein for a small time, he concluded with: 'But, compared to his brother, he was a saint.'</p>

<p>Not wanting his wife to know, he gave the nurse a sum of money and asked her to go to Italy and have the baby there.</p>
<p>""But how will I let you know the baby is born?""she asked. He replied, ""Just send me a postcard and write ""spaghetti"" on the back. I'll take care of expenses.""</p>
<p>Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money and flew to Italy.</p>
<p>Six months went by and then one day the doctor's wife called him at the office and said, ""Dear, you received a very strange postcard in the mail today from Europe, and I don't understand what it means.""</p>
<p>The doctor said, ""Just wait until I get home and I will explain it to you"". Later that evening the doctor came home, read the postcard, fell to the floor with a heart attack.</p>
<p>Paramedics rushed him to the ER. The lead medic stayed back to comfort the wife. He asked what trauma had precipitated the cardiac arrest.</p>

6474,"<p>With Viagra such a hit, Pfizer Pharmacuticals is bringing forth a whole line of drugs oriented towards improving the performance of men in today's society. According to company spokesman, Peter Riser, the following drugs are under testing now:</p>
<p>DIRECTRA - a dose of this drug given to men before leaving on car trips caused 72 percent of them to stop and ask directions when they got lost, compared to a control group of 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>PROJECTRA - Men given this experimental new drug were far more likely to actually finish a household repair project before starting a new one.</p>
<p>CHILDAGRA - Men taking this drug reported a sudden, over-whelming urge to perform more child-care tasks - especially cleaning up spills and ""little"" accidents.</p>
<p>COMPLIMENTRA - In clinical trials, 82 percent of middle-aged men administered this drug noticed that their wives had a new hairstyle. Currently being tested to see if its effects extend to noticing new clothing.</p>
<p>BUYAGRA - Married and otherwise attached men reported a sudden urge to buy their sweeties expensive jewelry and gifts after taking this drug for only two days. Still to be seen: whether the drug can be continued for a period longer than your favorite store's return limit.</p>
<p>NEGA-VIAGRA - Has the exact opposite effect of Viagra. Currently undergoing clinical trials on sitting U.S. presidents.</p>
<p>NEGA-SPORTAGRA - This drug had the strange effect of making men want to turn off televised sports and actually converse with other family members.</p>
<p>FLATULAGRA - This complex drug converts men's noxious intestinal gases back into food solids. Special bonus: Dosage can be doubled for long car rides.</p>
<p>FLYAGRA - This drug has been showing great promise in treating men with O.F.D. (Open Fly Disorder). Especially useful for men on Viagra.</p>
<p>PRYAGRA - About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men in the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal affairs of other people. Note: Apparent overdose turned three test subjects into ""special prosecutors.""</p>
<p>LIAGRA - This drug causes men to be less than truthful when being asked about their sexual affairs. Will be available in Regular, Grand Jury and Presidential Strength versions.<br /> ----------------------------------------</p>
<p>The National Organzation For Women is lobbying congress and the FDA to make these new drugs available for sale over the counter, as well as available in men's rooms everywhere.</p>
<p>In order to appeal to a boader customer base, Pfizer is also developing the following drugs intended primarily for women:</p>
<p>NagAgra -  Causes Women not to nag their spouse.</p>
<p>HonydewAgra - Causes women to actually do house hold maintenance instead of just writing things down.</p>
<p>InformAgra - Causes women to tell their spouses about plans they have made that involve said spouse.</p>
<p>Butt-outAgra - Causes women not to pry into the personal lives of others and mind their own business.</p>
<p>PersonalAgra - Causes women not to discuss their sex lives with aquaintances of their spouse</p>
<p>SportAgra - Makes women understand the male need for consuming large quantities of fermented beverages while watching contact sports.</p>
<p>Cindi CrawfordAgra - Need I say more?</p>

6481,"<p>A rogue guide dog has been destroyed after leading four of its blind owners<br /> to their deaths.</p>
<p>Charity workers were last night facing an investigation into how<br /> four-year-old Labrador Gamer was allowed to continue his murderous spree.<br /> Officials have admitted how: </p>
<ul>
<li>Victim Nunmber 1 was dragged under the wheels of a bus. </li>
<li>Victim Nunmber 2 drowned when she was led off the end of a pier. </li>
<li>Victim Nunmber 3 was shoved into the path of a speeding train. </li>
<li>Victim Nunmber 4 was left stranded as a truck mowed him down. </li>
</ul>
<p>Trainer Rudi Jones, 48, told newsmen in South Africa:<br /> ""He was basically a good dog who needed brushing up on his skills.It's so<br /> sad that he had to be put down.""</p>
<p>Gamer's terror trail began with the death of 43-year-old Selmer Draznower<br /> from Johannesburg. Witnesses told how Gamer dragged his master under the<br /> wheels of an approaching bus before scampering off.</p>
<p>Amazingly, Gamer was then given to 68-year-old Wilma Hassamore who survived<br /> just three months after his arrival.  Gamer decided to cut short her<br /> seaside holiday by leading her off the end of a pier. The dog pulled back<br /> at the last second but Wilma plunged into the sea and drowned.</p>
<p>Next was Marvin Wurtenheim, 28, who thought his prayers had been answered<br /> when Gamer arrived. But the misguided mutt butted Marvin off a railway<br /> platform.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, the dog was then given to retired Clarence MacDuff, 67, also<br /> from Johannesburg. As Gamer was guiding the unlucky Clarence to his doctor,<br /> the hapless hound dragged him under the wheels of a delivery truck.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Guide Dogs For The Blind Association, in Durban, South<br /> Africa, said: ""We had no choice but to have him put down.""</p>
<p>Last night, the chief trainer for Britain's Guide Dogs For The Blind<br /> Association, Bob Steele, said: ""This could never happen here. If there are<br /> any doubts about the animal, it is dropped from our training programme at<br /> once.""</p>

6483,"<p>Last year I upgraded Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure. </p>
<p>In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization where it monitors all other system activity. </p>
<p>Applications such as Pokernight 10.3 and Beerbash 2.5 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected. I cannot seem to purge Wife 1.0 from my system. </p>
<p>I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 1.0 but un-install does not work on this program. Can you help me? </p>
<p>- Mr I N Distress </p>
<p>Dear I N Distress, </p>
<p>This is a very common problem men complain about but is mostly due to a primary misconception. </p>
<p>Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a ""UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT"" program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by its creator to run everything. </p>
<p>WARNING DO NOT TRY TO un-install, delete, or purge the program from the system once installed. Trying to un-install Wife 1.0 can be disastrous. </p>
<p>You can not go back to Girlfriend 1.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this. Some have tried to install Girlfriend 2.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than the original system. </p>
<p>Look in your manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support. Others have tried to run Girlfriend 2.0 in the background, while Wife 1.0 is running. Eventually Wife 1.0 detects the presence of Girlfriend 2.0 and a system conflict occurs, this can lead to a non-recoverable system crash. </p>
<p>Some users have tried to download similar products such as Fling and 1NiteStand. Often their systems have become infected with a virus. </p>
<p>I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and just deal with the situation. Having Wife 1.0 installed myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding General Protection Faults (GPFs). </p>
<p>You must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur. The best course of action will be to push the apologize button then reset button as soon as lock-up occurs. </p>
<p>The system will run smooth as long as you take the blame for all GPFs. Wife 1.0 is a great program but is very high maintenance. </p>
<p>Suggestions for improved operation of Wife 1.0 </p>
<p>-Monthly use utilities such as TLC and FTD<br /> -Frequently use Communicator 5.0 </p>
<p>With best wishes,<br /> Tech Support. </p>

<p>While they were walking through the barn, the farmer's mule suddenly reared up and kicked the mother-in-law in the head, killing her instantly.</p>
<p>At the funeral service a few days later, the farmer stood near the casket and greeted folks as they walked by.</p>
<p>The pastor noticed that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he would nod his head yes, and say something.</p>
<p>Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, he would shake his head, no and mumble a reply.</p>
<p>Curious, the pastor later asked the farmer what that was all about.</p>
<p>The farmer replied, ''The women would say, 'What a terrible tragedy' and I would nod my head and say, yes, it was. </p>
<p>The men would ask, 'You wanna sell that mule?' and I would shake my head and say, can't. It's all booked up for a year.""</p>

6497,"<p>A Woman's Random ThoughtsSkinny people tick me off!  Especially when they say things like, 'You know, sometimes I forget to eat.' You have to be a special kind of stupid to forget to eat.A friend of mine confused her valium with her birth control pills.  She had 14 kids, but she doesn't care.They keep telling us to get in touch with our bodies.  Mine isn't all that communicative, but I heard from it the other day after I said, 'Body, how'd you like to go to the six o'clock class in vigorous toning?'  Clear as a bell my body said, 'listen wench...do it and die.'The trouble with some women is that they get all excited about nothing (and then they marry him).I read this article that said the typical symptoms of stress are eating too much, smoking too much, impulse buying and driving too fast.  Are they kidding?  That's my idea of a perfect day.I know what Victoria's Secret is.  The secret is that nobody older than 20 can fit into their stuff.'If men can run the world, why can't they stop wearing neckties?  How intelligent is it to start the day by tying a noose around your neck?'</p>

The husband, although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out into town and party, so he says to his new bride, ""Honey, I'll be right back..."" ""Where are you going coochi cooh...?"" asks his wife. ""I'm going to the bar, pretty face. I'm going to have a beer."" replies the husband. The wife puts her hands on her hips and says to him, ""You want a beer my love...?"" Then she opens the door to the refrigerator and shows him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12 different countries.The husband doesn't know what to do, and the only thing that he can think of saying is: ""Yes, loolie loolie ... but the bar ... you know ... the frozen glass."" He didn't get to finish saying the sentence, when the wife interrupts him by saying, ""You want a frozen glass puppy face...?"" She takes out of the freezer a huge beer mug so frozen that the wife was getting the chills from holding it. The husband looking a bit pale says, ""Yes, tootsie roll. But at the bar they have those hoer's de devours that are really delicious... I won't be long. I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"" ""You want hoer's de devours poochi pooh..?""

There was a bear in the woods beside the lake that said to himself, if the fly drops 3 inches, the fish will jump out the water and i can eat it.

There was a mouse that was below the hunter that said to himself, if the fly drops 3 inches then the fish will jump out the water, the bear will eat the fish, the hunter will shoot the bear, and I can run off with the cheese sandwich.

6526,"<p>Dear [insert screen name here] (if that is your real name),</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that, under a plan for the periodic removal of<br /> unpleasantness from my life, I must terminate our online affair. This<br /> termination takes effect immediately, but only because I could not make it<br /> retroactive. Below, you will find the reasons for this action:</p>
<p>_____ While our cybersex sessions were, for the most part,competent, your<br />       constant use of ""brb gotta pee"" took some of the romance out of it.</p>
<p>_____ Your use of the term ""the ol' cyber ball and chain"" to refer to me<br />        has hurt my feelings.</p>
<p>_____ I've found another lover, one who knows the importance of<br />        punctuation.</p>
<p>_____ Certain errors during cyber sessions indicate that you were less<br />        than honest:</p>
<p>_____ You typed: ""I remove my bra"" when you claimed to be a man.</p>
<p>_____ You typed: ""I enter you"" when you claimed to be a woman.</p>
<p>_____ You typed your own name at the end.</p>
<p>_____ Your supposedly original scenario, it turns out, is simply page 56<br />        of a Jackie Collins novel.</p>
<p>_____ Your repeated references to animals suggest that you are hiding<br />       something from me.</p>
<p>_____ Your refusal to cyber until I submitted a recent AIDS test suggests<br />       a degree of paranoia that is, simply put, unhealthy.</p>
<p>_____ I finally opened the file with your __ gif __ jpg __ police record.</p>
<p>_____ I have no choice but to comply with the court orders unless I wish<br />       to face stalking charges.</p>
<p>_____ Mommie says I need to spend less time on the computer.</p>
<p>_____ Your mommie called me and yelled at me because of all the time<br />       you're spending on the computer.</p>
<p>_____ I have established a more personal relationship with the Lord, and I<br />       would like to talk to you in great detail about what you can do to<br />       ensure a place in Heaven when the endtimes come. They are closer than<br />       you think.</p>
<p>_____ The fact that you BCC all your love letters to me leaves me feeling<br />       less than special. As in cyber cheating.</p>
<p>_____ I finally read your profile, and the fact that you are only 14<br />       violates the terms of my parole.</p>
<p>_____ I am entering the witness protection program.</p>
<p>Please understand, __ [screen name] and/or __ you misbegotten son of a<br /> bitch__ sir/madam __ mom/dad [for use in West Virginia], that there is<br /> nothing personal in this. We've simply grown apart.</p>
<p>Any additional correspondence you may direct to my attorney,</p>
<p>__ Sincerely,</p>
<p>__ Gleefully,</p>
<p>__ I have to go before the warden calls ""lights out,""</p>
<p>__ Uh oh, my Real Life mate is coming up the stairs,</p>

<p>Once inside his house I gasped, it was HUGE! Then he said he had<br /> to change. Finally, I had a chance to go crap. I looked and<br /> looked for a bathroom but I couldn't find it. Then I turned<br /> around and saw that there was a bathroom about 10 feet away! </p>
<p>I felt so week but I walked and walked to bathroom. When I was 3<br /> feet away from it I saw a dog. It was a big dalmatian showing<br /> off it's fangs. I could't reach the bathroom, so I had to thing<br /> of another idea. </p>

6556,"<p>It seems a man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of America,<br /> walked into the branch and wrote, ""This iz a stikkup. Put all<br /> your muny in this bag."" While standing in line, waiting to give<br /> his note to the teller, he began to worry that someone had seen<br /> him write the note and might call the police before he reached<br /> the teller window. So he left the Bank of America and crossed<br /> the street to Wells Fargo. After waiting a few minutes in line,<br /> he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller. She read it and,<br /> surmising from his spelling errors that he was not the brightest<br /> light in the harbour, told him that she could not accept his<br /> stick up note because it was written on a Bank of America<br /> deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells<br /> Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America. Looking<br /> somewhat defeated, the man said ""OK"" and left. The Wells Fargo<br /> teller then called the police who arrested the man a few minutes<br /> later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of America.</p>

<p>Drug possession defendant Christopher Jansen, on trial in March<br /> in Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a<br /> warrant. The prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant<br /> because a ""bulge"" in Christopher's jacket could have been a gun.<br /> Nonsense, said Christopher, who happened to be wearing the same<br /> jacket that day in court. He handed it over so the judge could<br /> see it. The judge discovered a packet of cocaine in the pocket<br /> and laughed so hard he required a five- minute recess to compose<br /> himself.</p>

<p>She was not familiar with the lake so she rowed out, anchored the boat, and started reading her book. Along comes the sheriff in his boat, pulls up alongside and says, ""Good morning, Ma'am.  What are you doing?""</p>
<p>""Reading my book,"" she replies as she thinks to herself, ""Is this guy blind or what?"" </p>

6581,"<p>A truck driver had a 2 day lay-over during the St. Patrick's Day holiday. He<br /> was getting bored with just sitting at the truck stop cafe, so he decided to go<br /> for a few beers. After about the 4th one, he had to use the bathroom badly. He<br /> went into the bathroom, and he was peeing, lhe ooked into the next stall and<br /> noticed a leprechaun whose penis was HUGE!<br /> ""Let me ask you something...how come short guys have bigger peckers than tall<br /> guys?"" </p>
<p>In his heavy Irish accent, the leprechaun looked up and said, ""I don't know<br /> laddy, i'm a leprechaun"". </p>
<p>With that, the trucker reached out and grabbed him and said, ""Well guess what?<br /> I caught ya!"" </p>
<p>""Aye lad, that ya did, but your wishes won't come true until tomorrow<br /> morning"". </p>
<p>The trucker was confused by this, ""Why not? You're a leprechaun, I caught ya,<br /> so you are supposed to grant me 3 wishes."" </p>
<p>""Well"", began the leprechaun, ""you don't know anything about us leprechauns.<br /> We get a day of the year off and it happens to be St. Patrick's Day."" Well, the<br /> trucker understanding this made his 3 wishes. He wanted to own his trucking<br /> company, he wanted every woman he saw to desire his body and he wanted 10<br /> million dollars in the bank, tax free. The leprechaun said it would be done in<br /> the morning. On his way out of the restroom, the leprechaun says, ""Lad, would<br /> you like to have your wishes come true tonight?"" </p>
<p>""Well yeah, but what's the catch?"", came the reply. ""Well, you gotta let a<br /> leprechaun corn-hole ya."" The trucker, at first protested, but then the<br /> leprechaun reminded him of all that he would be gaining in few precious moments.<br /> Thinking about the money, the company becoming his and ALL those women, he<br /> agreed but told the leprechaun not to tell anyone. When it was all over, the<br /> leprechaun was getting ready to leave, turned to the trucker and said, ""Laddy,<br /> can I ask ya a question?"" </p>
<p>""Sure"", says the trucker. </p>

6585,"<p>Here are some highlights of ER admissions to Chicago General over the past year:<br /> - A 28-year old male was brought into the ER after an attempted suicide. The man had swallowed several nitroglycerin pills and a fifth of vodka. When asked about the bruises about his head and chest he said that they were from him ramming himself into the wall in an attempt to make the nitroglycerin explode. </p>
<p>- A woman with shortness on breath and who weighted approximately 500 lbs was dragged into the ER on a tarp by six firemen. While trying to undress the lady, an asthma inhaler fell out of one of the folds under her arm. After an X-ray showed a round mass on the left side of her chest her massive left breast was lifted to find a shiny new dime. And last, but not least-- during a pelvic exam a TV remote control was discovered in one of the folds of her crotch. She became known as ""The Human Couch"". </p>
<p>- The most nonemergent ER visit: A male adolescent came in at 2 a.m. with a complaint of belly button lint. </p>
<p>- A 92-year old woman had a full cardiac arrest at home and was rushed to the hospital. After 30 minutes of unsuccessful resuscitation attempts the old lady was pronounced dead. The doctor went to tell the lady's 78-year old daughter that her mother didn't make it. ""Didn't make it? Where could they be? She left in the ambulance forty-five minutes ago!"" </p>
<p>- A 15-year old boy was laying on a stretcher with his mother sitting next to him. The boy was coming down from ""crank"" (methamphetamine) that he had injected into his veins with needles he had been sharing with his friends. Concerned about this the doctor asked the boy if there was anything he might have been doing that put him at risk for AIDS. The boy thought for a while then said questioningly ""You mean like having sex with our dog?"" </p>
<p>- A 19-year old female was asked why she was in the ER. She said that she and her boyfriend were having sex and the condom came off and she wasn't able to retrieve it with her fingers. She went to the bathroom and ""gagged myself to vomit but couldn't vomit it up either.""</p>

The climber climbed to the top and dropped a tape measure which the guide promptly read and noted the measurement. The crane operator then lowered the pole to the ground and repsitioned to pick up another pole. This went on several times when the foreman came over and asked why they couldn't measure the poles while they were laying on the ground? The Aggies replied, ""we need to know how tall the poles are, not how long"".</p>

If it was a small<br /> mistake he just ignored it and went on with life. The attorney<br /> turned to the preacher and asked, ""How do you do it, pastor?"" </p>

The attorney interrupted him and<br /> asked, ""But what about small mistakes, how do you handle them?""<br /> The preacher replied, ""Well, just last Sunday in my sermon I was<br /> quoting Jesus from the gospel of John chapter 8 where he said,<br /> ""You are your father the devil, he was a liar from the<br /> beginning."" Instead I said, ""You are of your father the devil,<br /> he was lawyer from the beginning."" Upon hearing this the lawyer<br /> became indignant and retorted, ""Well how did you handle it?""

6630,"<p>After just a few years of marriage filled with constant arguments, a young man and his wife decided the only way to save their marriage was to try counseling. They had been at each other's throats for some time and felt that this was their last straw. When they arrived at the counselor's office, the counselor jumped right in and opened the floor for discussion. ''What seems to be the problem?'' Immediately, the husband held his long face down without anything to say. In contrast, the wife began talking 90 miles an hour, describing all the wrongs within their marriage. After 15 minutes of listening to the wife, the counselor went over to her, picked her up by her shoulders, kissed her passionately and sat her back down. Afterwards, the wife sat speechless. The marriage counselor looked over at the husband, who stared in disbelief. The counselor said to the husband, ''Your wife NEEDS that at least twice a week!'' The husband scratched his head and replied, ''I can have her here on Tuesdays and Thursdays.''</p>

6646,"<p>The general was confined to the military hospital for treatment of a minor malady.</p>
<p>For almost a week he made a complete nuisance of himself, irritating both staff and the other patients, demanding attention and expecting his every order to be followed immediately. He was in a six-man ward rather than a private room, his meals were too cold or not served to suit his taste, the light needed to be adjusted to his demands, the nighttime activities interfered with his rest... and on, and on.</p>
<p>One afternoon an orderly entered the room. ""Time to take your temperature, General.""</p>
<p>After growling at the orderly, the general opened his mouth to accept the thermometer.</p>
<p>""Sorry, General, but for this test we need your temperature from the other end.""</p>
<p>A whole new barrage of verbal abuse followed, but the orderly was insistent that a rectal temperature was what the test called for.</p>
<p>The general at last rolled over, bared his rear, and allowed the orderly to proceed. The orderly then told the general, ""Stay exactly like that and don't move. I'll be back in five minutes to check up on you"" and withdrew.</p>

We must have been waiting for 15 minutes!""The doctor chimed in, ""I don't know, but I've never seen such ineptitude!""The pastor said, ""Hey, here comes the greenskeeper. Let's have a word with him.""         [dramatic pause] ""Hi George. Say, what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't they?""The greenskeeper replied, ""Oh, yes, that's a group of blind firefighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we always let them play for free anytime.""The group was silent for a moment. The pastor said, ""That's so sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight.""The doctor said, ""Good idea. And I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them.""The engineer said, ""Why can't these guys play at night?""</p>

6682,"<p>The five toughest questions women ask - and their answers:<br /> 1. `What are you thinking?'<br /> 2. `Do you love me?'<br /> 3. `Do I look fat?'<br /> 4. `Do you think she's prettier than me?'<br /> 5. `What would you do if I died?'</p>
<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example:</p>
<p>1. `What are you thinking?'<br /> The proper answer to this question, of course, is: 'I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you.' Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things:<br /> a - football.<br /> b - baseball.<br /> c - How fat you are.<br /> d - How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>The best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married with Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. His answer: 'If I wanted you to know I'd be talking instead of thinking'</p>
<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers:</p>
<p>2. 'Do you love me?'<br /> The correct answer to this question is, 'Yes.'<br /> For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer. 'Yes dear.' </p>
<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I suppose so.<br /> b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> c - That depends on what you mean by 'love'.<br /> d - Does it matter?<br /> e - Who, me?</p>
<p>3. 'Do I look fat?'<br /> The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state,<br /> 'No, of course not' and then quickly leave the room. </p>
<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I wouldn't call you fat, but I wouldn't call you thin either.<br /> b - Compared to what?<br /> c - A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d - I've seen fatter.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>
<p>4. 'Do you think she's prettier than me?'<br /> The 'she' in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passerby you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw.<br /> In any case, the correct response is: 'No, you are much prettier.' </p>
<p>Wrong answers include:<br /> a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.<br /> b - I don't know how one goes about rating such things.<br /> c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.<br /> d - Only in the sense that she's younger and thinner.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.</p>
<p>5. 'What would you do if I died?' </p>
<p>Correct answer: 'Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first truck that came my way.'</p>
<p>This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke:</p>
<p>'Dear,' said the wife, `what would you do if I died?' </p>
<p>'why, dear, I would be extremely upset,' said the husband. 'Why do you ask such a question?' </p>
<p>'Would you remarry?' persevered the wife. </p>
<p>'No, of course not, dear,' said the husband. </p>
<p>'Don't you like being married?' said the wife. </p>
<p>'Of course I do, dear,' he said. </p>
<p>'Then why wouldn't you remarry?' </p>
<p>'All right,' said the husband, 'I'd remarry.' </p>
<p>'You would?' said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>
<p>'Yes,' said the husband. </p>
<p>`Would you sleep with her in our bed?' said the wife after a long pause. </p>
<p>'Well yes, I suppose I would,' replied the husband. </p>
<p>'I see,' said the wife indignantly. 'And would you let her wear my old clothes?' </p>
<p>'I suppose, if she wanted to,' said the husband. </p>
<p>'Really,' said the wife icily. `And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?' </p>
<p>'Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do.' </p>
<p>'Is that so?' said the wife, leaping to her feet. 'And I suppose you'd let her play with my golf clubs, too.' </p>
<p>'Of course not, dear,' said the husband. 'She's left-handed.'</p>

6685,"<p>A farmer purchases an old, run-down, abandoned farm with plans<br /> to turn it into a thriving enterprise.  The fields are grown over with<br /> weeds, the farmhouse is falling apart, and the fences are collapsing<br /> all around.</p>
<p>        During his first day of work, the town preacher stops by to<br /> bless the man's work, saying, ""May you and God work together to make<br /> this the farm of your dreams!""</p>
<p>        A few months later, the preacher stops by again to call on the<br /> farmer.  Lo and behold, it's like a completely different place -- the<br /> farm house is completely rebuilt and in excellent condition, there is<br /> plenty of cattle and other livestock happily munching on feed in<br /> well-fenced pens, and the fields are filled with crops planted in neat<br /> rows.  ""Amazing!"" the preacher says.  ""Look what God and you have<br /> accomplished together!""</p>
<p>        ""Yes, reverend,"" says the farmer, ""but remember what the farm<br /> was like when God was working it alone!""</p>

6686,"<p>THE COWBOY CODE</p>
<p>1.  A cowboy removes his hat when entering the presence of a lady, although he may leave it on if she works in a saloon.</p>
<p>2. A cowboy says EXCUSE ME, MA'AM, when leaving a lady's presence.</p>
<p>3.  A cowboy says PARDON ME, MA'AM, when bumping into a lady, or treading on her feet.</p>
<p>4.  A cowboy never sits, while a lady is standing, unless he feels particularly tired, or his feet hurt.</p>
<p>5.  A cowboy allows a lady to go through a doorway, first, especially if he thinks one of his enemies may try to shoot him in a cowardly ambush. She would provide good cover.</p>
<p>6 . A cowboy does not spit on the floor, but if he does, he will point it out to the ladies so they will not drag their skirts through it.</p>
<p>7.  A cowboy never tracks horse poop into a lady's house. He should leave his boots outside the door, unless his feet stink as bad as the horse poop, in which case, he should just go someplace else. Maybe the saloon, where the stench of horse poop is no worse than the stench of cow poop.</p>
<p>8.  A cowboy does not pick his nose at the table, unless it will help him breath better or eliminate a whistle that otherwise might become annoying to the ladies.</p>
<p>9.  A cowboy does not scratch his groin, his armpits, or suck on the ends of his mustache, when a lady is near.</p>
<p>10. A cowboy does not swear or make reference to bodily functions, in the presence of a lady.</p>
<p>11. A cowboy must not sneeze at the table. If a strong need arises that cannot be resisted, he will turn his head away from the lady, so she won't be sprayed and perhaps be struck by a stray booger.</p>
<p>12. A cowboy does not noisily slurp his coffee in the presence of a  lady. Instead, he should hold the saucer steady with both hands, tip it toward his mouth, and slurp silently.</p>
<p>13. A cowboy does not fart in the presence of a lady...not even silently. If he does, it might stink, and she may smell it and possibly think that he is not actually a gentleman.</p>
<p>14. A cowboy will grasp a lady's elbow to help her onto a horse or into a carriage. He should never, ever push on her derriere to give her a boost, because she might kick his teeth out, unless she works in the saloon.</p>

6754,"<p>A man was blissfully driving along the highway, when he saw the Easter Bunny hopping across the middle of the road. He swerved to avoid hitting the Bunny, but unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of his car and was hit. The basket of eggs went flying all over the place. Candy, too.<br /> The driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to the side of the road, and got out to see what had become of the Bunny carrying the basket. Much to his dismay, the colorful Bunny was dead. The driver felt guilty and began to cry. </p>
<p>A woman driving down the same highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. She stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong. </p>
<p>""I feel terrible,"" he explained, ""I accidentally hit the Easter Bunny and killed it. There may not be an Easter because of me. What should I do?"" </p>
<p>The woman told the man not to worry. She knew exactly what to do. She went to her car trunk, and pulled out a spray can. She walked over to the limp, dead Bunny, and sprayed the entire contents of the can onto the little furry animal. </p>
<p>Miraculously the Easter Bunny came to back life, jumped up, picked up the spilled eggs and candy, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped on down the road. 50 yards away the Easter Bunny stopped, turned around and waved again. Then he hopped on down the road another 50 yards, turned, waved, hopped another 50 yards and waved again! </p>
<p>The man was astonished. He said to the woman, ""What in Heaven's name is in your spray can? What was it that you sprayed on the Easter Bunny?"" </p>
<p>The woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label. It said, ""Hair spray. Restores life to dead hair. Adds permanent wave.""</p>

6758,"<p>One Sunday morning George burst into the living room and said,<br /> ""Dad! Mom! I have some great news for you! I am getting married<br /> to the most beautiful girl in town. She lives a block away and<br /> her name is Susan.</p>
<p>After dinner, George's dad took him aside, ""Son, I have to talk<br /> with you."" ""Look at your mother, George. She and I have been<br /> married 30 years, she's a wonderful wife and mother, but, she<br /> has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to<br /> fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half<br /> sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her.""</p>
<p>George was broken-hearted. After eight months he eventually<br /> started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very<br /> proudly announced, ""Dianne said yes! We're getting married in<br /> June.""</p>
<p>Again his father insisted on another private conversation and<br /> broke the sad news. ""Dianne is your half sister too, George. I'm<br /> awfully sorry about this.""</p>

<p>She hugs him, crys and agrees. So late that night they sneak on to his ship and he hides her in a big life boat with a canvas cover. He tells her he'll  bring her food and water and she'll just have to stay hidden because she'll be in big trouble if she's caught.</p>

6768,"<p>A woman starts dating a doctor. Before too long, she becomes pregnant and they don't know what to do. About nine months later, just about the time she is going to give birth, a priest goes into the hospital for a prostate gland infection.</p>
<p>The doctor says to the woman, ""I know what we'll do. After I've operated on the priest, I'll give the baby to him and tell him it was a miracle.""</p>
<p>""Do you think it will work?"" she asks the doctor.<br /> ""It's worth a try,"" he says.  </p>
<p>So the doctor delivers the baby and then operates on the priest.  After the operation he goes in to the priest and says, ""Father, you're not going to believe this.""</p>
<p>""What?"" says the priest. ""What happened?""<br /> ""You gave birth to a child.""<br /> ""But that's impossible!""<br /> ""I just did the operation,"" insists the doctor. ""It's a miracle! Here's your baby.""</p>
<p>About fifteen years go by, and the priest realizes that he must tell his son the truth. One day he sits the boy down and says, ""Son, I have something to tell you. I'm not your father.""</p>
<p>The son says, ""What do you mean, you're not my father?""<br /> The priest replies, ""I'm your mother. The archbishop is your father.""</p>
"
6769,"<p>It is recounted that at King's College in the Strand around the time of the war, the Chief of Services would inevitably begin the year's rounds by teaching ""a singularly important principle of medicine.""</p>
<p>He asked a nurse to fetch him a sample of urine.  He then talked at length about diabetes mellitus. ""Diabetes,"" he said, ""is a greek name; but the Romans noticed that the bees like the urine of diabetics, so they added the word mellitus which means sweet as honey. Well, as you know, you may find sugar in the urine of a diabetic...""</p>
<p>By now, the nurse had returned with a sample of urine which the registrar promptly held up like a trophy. We stared at that straw colored fluid as if we had never seen such a thing before. The registrar then startled us.  He dipped a finger boldly into the urine, then licked his finger with the tip of his tongue. As if tasting wine, he opened and closed his lips rapidly. Could he perhaps detect a faint taste of sugar? The sample was passed on to us for an opinion. We all dipped a finger into the fluid, all of us foolishly licked that finger.</p>
<p>""Now,"" said the Registrar grinning, ""you have learned the first principle of diagnosis. I mean the power of observation.""</p>
<p>We were baffled. We stood near the sluice room outside the ward, and in the distance, some anonymous patient was explosively coughing.</p>
<p>""You see,"" the registrar said continuing triumphantly, ""I dipped my MIDDLE finger into the urine, but licked my INDEX finger, not like all you chaps!""</p>

The next morning the Manager called the clerk into his office and told him there had been many complaints about his being so rude to the hotel guests....instead of kicking them out, he should have just asked them to be less noisy. The clerk responded, ""I'm sorry, but if there's one thing I can't stand, it's chess nuts boasting in an open foyer.""</p>

The doctor, addressing all three of them, said, ""If any of you indulge in your vices one more time, you will surely die.""The men left the doctor's office, each convinced that he would never again indulge himself in his vice. While walking toward the subway for their return trip to the suburbs, they passed a bar. The alcoholic, hearing the loud music and seeing the lights, could not stop himself. His buddies accompanied him into the bar, where he had a shot of whiskey. No sooner had he replaced the shot glass on the bar, he fell off his stool, stone cold dead. His companions, somewhat shaken, left the bar, realising how seriously they must take the doctor's words. As they walked along, they came upon a cigarette butt lying on the ground, still burning. The homosexual looked at the chain smoker and said, ""If you bend over to pick that up, we're both dead.""</p>

<p>Pregunta:</p>
<p>�D�nde est� el padre?</p>
<p>Esta tarea se puede solucionar, no es tan dif�cil como parece. �No mires la soluci�n! Hay que hacer cuentas primero.</p>
<p>NOTA: Hay que poner mucha atenci�n a la pregunta: �D�nde est� el padre? </p>
<p>Soluci�n:</p>
<p>El ni�o tiene hoy X a�os y su madre tiene hoy Y a�os. Sabemos que la madre es 21 a�os mayor que el hijo. Entonces:</p>
<p>X + 21 = Y</p>
<p>Sabemos que en 6 a�os el ni�o ser� 5 veces menor que su madre. Por lo que podemos deducir la siguiente ecuaci�n:</p>
<p>5 (X+6) = Y+6</p>
<p>Reemplazamos Y por X + 21 y procedemos a despejar:</p>
<p>5 (X+6) = X + 21 + 6<br /> 5X + 30 = X + 27<br /> 5X - X = 27 - 30<br /> 4X = -3<br /> X = -3/4</p>

<p>""You know, love,"" she says, ""I look in the mirror and I see an old woman. My<br /> face is all wrinkled, my boobs are barely above my waist, my bum is hanging out<br /> a mile. I've got fat legs and my arms are all flabby."" She turns to her husband<br /> and asks, ""Tell me something positive to make me feel better about myself.""</p>
<p>He thinks about it for a bit and then says in a soft voice,<br /> ""Well... there's nothing wrong with your eyesight.""</p>

6801,"<p>Two weeks ago was my 44th birthday and I wasn't feeling too good that morning. </p>
<p>I went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say,<br /> ""Happy Birthday!"", and probably have a present for me. </p>
<p>As it turned out, she didn't even say good morning, let alone any happy birthday. </p>
<p>I thought, well, that's wives for you, the children will remember...The children came in to breakfast and didn't say a word.</p>
<p>So when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and despondent..</p>
<p>As I walked into my office, my secretary Janet said, ""Good morning, Boss, Happy Birthday"". And I felt a little better that someone had remembered.</p>
<p>I worked until noon, then Janet knocked on my door and said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me."" </p>
<p>I said, ""That's the greatest thing I've heard all day, let's go!""</p>
<p>We went to lunch we didn't go where we normally go; instead we went out to a private little place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. </p>
<p>On the way back to the office, she said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day, we don't need to go back to the office, do we?""</p>
<p>I said, ""No, I guess not."" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment.""</p>
<p>After arriving at her apartment she said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom. ""Sure!"" I excitedly replied.</p>
<p>She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake ----- followed by my wife, children, and dozens of our friends, all singing Happy Birthday.</p>
<p>And I just sat there...on the couch...naked.</p>

Probablmente tenga que dejar el f�tbol y quede impotente. La jugada del penalti viene precedida por 7 faltas claras en el medio campo a favor del Madrid que el �rbitro no pita y el jugador al que le hacen el penalti est� en claro fuera de juego, por lo menos 5 metros. El penalti lo lanzo yo, de tac�n, el bal�n bota siete veces antes de llegar a la porter�a, da en el larguero, luego en un poste, vuelve a dar en el larguero, rebota en la nuca de Casillas, dej�ndolo inconsciente y se queda muerto en la l�nea de gol, sin entrar. En su af�n por salvar el gol, Robertos Carlos y Hierro se lanzan a por �l, con tal mala suerte que se lesionan mutuamente. Hierro est� tan grave que un guardia civil lo sacrifica en el mismo campo con su pistola reglamentaria. Guti pierde totalmente el habla para siempre y queda paral�tico. Consiguen sacar el bal�n, pero con tal mala suerte que da, primero, en los huevos de Morientes, que muere al instante y luego le rompe la cara a Iv�n Campo que queda desfigurado y tienen que reconstru�rsela de modo que su cara parece el culo de un mono aullador del amazonas (lo m�s parecido a la realidad). El bal�n sigue botando y entra a gol.

"
6806,"<p>Is there a Santa Claus?</p>
<p>As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research help<br /> from that renown scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990) -<br /> I am pleased to present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus.</p>
<p>1) No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of<br /> living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects<br /> and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only<br /> Santa has ever seen.</p>
<p>2) There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world.<br /> BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and<br /> Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total -<br /> 378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average<br /> (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes.<br /> One presumes there's at least one good child in each.</p>
<p>3) Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different<br /> time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west<br /> (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This is<br /> to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has<br /> 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney,<br /> fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat<br /> whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the<br /> sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these<br /> 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth<br /> (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purposes of our<br /> calculations we will accept), we are now talking about .78 miles per<br /> household, a total trip of 75-1/2 million miles, not counting stops to do<br /> what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding<br /> and etc.</p>
<p>This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000<br /> times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made<br /> vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per<br /> second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.</p>
<p>4) The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element.<br /> Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set<br /> (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who<br /> is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can<br /> pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that ""flying reindeer""<br /> (see point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the<br /> job with eight, or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases<br /> the payload - not even counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons.<br /> Again, for  comparison--this is four times the weight of the<br /> Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>5) 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air<br /> resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as<br /> spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer<br /> will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short,<br /> they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer<br /> behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake.<br /> The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a<br /> second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces<br /> 17,500.06 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa<br /> (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh<br /> by 4,315,015 pounds of force.</p>
<p>In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve,<br /> he's dead now.</p>

6821,"<p>Dear Tech Support:</p>
<p>I am desperate for some help. I recently upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that the new program began unexpected child processing and also took up a lot of space and valuable resources. This wasn't mentioned in the product brochure.</p>
<p>In addition Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialisation where it monitors all other system activity.</p>
<p>Applications such as Boys Night Out 2.5, and Golf 5.3 no longer run and crash the system whenever selected. Attempting to operate Sunday Football 6.3 always fails but Saturday Shopping 7.1 runs instead. I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background whilst attempting to run any of my favourite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0 but de-install doesn't work on this program.</p>
<p>Can you please help!<br /> Joe.</p>
<p>Dear Joe,</p>
<p>This is a very common problem resulting from a basic misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Many men upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 thinking that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT program. Whereas Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM designed by its creator to run everything.</p>
<p>You are unlikely to be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0 as Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this and it is impossible to de-install, delete or purge the program files from the system once installed.</p>
<p>Some people have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0, but have<br /> ended up with even more problems. (See in manual under Alimony/Child Support and Solicitors Fees). Having Wife 1.0 installed myself I recommend you keep it installed and deal with the difficulties as best you can.</p>
<p>When any faults or problems occur, whatever you think has caused them, you must run the C: IAPOLOGISE program and avoid attempting to use the *Esc-key. It may be necessary to run C: I APOLOGISE a number of times, but hopefully eventually the operating system will return to normal.</p>
<p>Wife 1.0 although a very high maintenance program can be very rewarding. To get the most out of it consider buying additional software such as Flowers 2.0 and Chocolates 5.0.</p>
<p>Do not under any circumstances install Secretary (Short Skirt version) as this is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and the system will almost certainly crash.</p>
<p>Best of luck!<br /> Tech Support</p>

6864,"<p>A Colorado Springs, Colo., school district says it did the right thing  when it suspended 6-year-old Seamus Morris under the school's  zero-tolerance drug policy. The drug? Lemon drops.  Taylor Elementary  School administrators called an ambulance after a teacher saw the boy give  another student some candy, which was a brand teachers didn't recognize.  'It was not something you would purchase in a grocery store,' a district  spokesman said.  'It was from a health-food store.' A spokesman for St.  Claire's Lemon Tarts, however, noted that the candy is indeed sold in  Colorado's largest grocery store chain. School officials were not  impressed, and not only upheld the half-day suspension, but told the boy's  mother that a child who brings candy to school is comparable to a teen  who takes a gun to school.

6900,"<p>One of my friends works in the customer service call center of a national pager company. He deals with the usual complaints regarding poor pager operation, as well as the occasional crank caller demanding to be paged less often, more often, or by more interesting people. The best call came from a man who repeatedly complained that he keeps being paged by ""Lucille."" He was instructed that he would have to call her and tell her to stop paging him. ""She don't never leave no number, so I can't call her back,"" he said. After three such calls, someone thought to ask how he knew it was Lucille if she didn't leave a number. ""She leaves her name,"" was the reply. After establishing that the customer had a numericonly pager, the light bulb came on. ""How does she spell her name?"" the service rep asked. ""L-O-W C-E-L-L"" Another problem solved.</p>

So I went out onto the balcony, we live on the 25th<br /> floor, and found this man hanging over the edge by his fingertips. I went<br /> inside, got a hammer, and started hitting his hands. He fell, but landed in some<br /> bushes. So, I got the refrigerator and pushed it over the balcony and it crushed<br /> him. The strain of the act gave me a heart attack, and I died.""<br /> St. Peter couldn't deny that this was a pretty bad day, and since it was a<br /> crime of passion, he let the man in.<br /> He then asked the next man in line about the day he died. ""Well, sir, it was<br /> awful,"" said the second man. ""I was doing aerobics on the balcony of my 26th<br /> floor apartment when I twisted my ankle and slipped over the edge. I managed to<br /> grab the balcony of the apartment below, but some maniac came out and started<br /> pounding on my fingers with a hammer. Luckily I landed in some bushes. But, then<br /> the guy dropped a refrigerator on me!""<br /> St. Peter chuckled, let him into heaven and decided he could really start to<br /> enjoy this job.<br /> ""Tell me about the day you died?� he said to the third man in line.<br /> ""OK, picture this; I'm naked, hiding inside a refrigerator....""</p>

6934,"<p>There was this basically-good man who died and appeared before St. Peter at<br /> the Holy Gates. St. Peter checks out his books and discovers that there is a<br /> problem. He says that there is no clear answer in the books on where the man is<br /> supposed to go, Heaven or Hell. He suggests that the man go to Hell and check it<br /> out, so that he may make the decision himself. If he didn't like what he saw<br /> there, he could come back to Heaven. </p>
<p>Well, this man had only one true vice while he was alive. It seems he had an<br /> uncontrollable desire to play golf at any opportunity. He had traveled the world<br /> playing all the famous golf courses. </p>
<p>When the man arrived in Hell, Satan welcomed him, but he too was surprised at<br /> the man's situation. He had assumed that since the question about the man's<br /> ultimate destination wasn't clear, the man would go to Heaven. The man could<br /> just see behind Satan a Most Beautiful Golf Course. It had beautiful trees, blue<br /> ponds, water separating the fairways, everything. The man fell in love with at<br /> at first site, and he couldn't control himself. He just had to play a round. </p>
<p>The devil showed him a wonderful electric golf cart, a perfect leather bag, a<br /> matched set of clubs. Satan reached into his pocket and presented the man with a<br /> Golden Tee. The devil then said that only members could play. The man couldn't<br /> control himself. He just had to play there. </p>
<p>He goes back up to Heaven and tells St. Peter that he has decided to stay in<br /> Hell so he could play on the Beautiful Golf Course there. When the man returns<br /> to Hell, he approaches Satan and asks for a tee time. The devil says that<br /> anytime at all, the man could play. No one else uses the course. </p>
<p>Chuckling with glee, the man approaches the first tee. He gets out of his<br /> beautiful golf cart, reaches for his perfectly matched clubs and selects his<br /> driver, reaches into his pants pocket and pulls out his Golden Tee, then<br /> frantically searches everywhere for a ball. </p>
<p>Satan comes up and the man asks him for a ball. </p>
<p>""That's the Hell of it,"" says Satan with a devilish laugh.</p>

<p>Caca perfecta: Es cuando uno caga, se limpia y ve que el papel higi�nico est� completamente limpio: listo para sonarse la nariz.</p>
<p>Caca h�meda: Cuando, no importando que te hayas limpiado 50 veces, sigues sintiendo el culo h�medo. Entonces decides ponerte un poco de papel entre la cola y la ropa interior y sales del ba�o disimulando la incomodidad.</p>
<p>Caca 'encore': Cuando ya habiendo cagado te est�s levantando los pantalones y a medio camino, apenas por las rodillas, sientes que todav�a queda m�s por cagar.</p>
<p>Caca tipo isla: Esta ocurre cuando la cagada es de tales proporciones �picas, que la mierda supera la l�nea del agua del inodoro formando una peque�a monta�a de tierra seca. Suele requerir dos bajadas a la palanca para que se vaya completamente por el ca�o.</p>
<p>Caca explosiva: Esta va acompa�ada de ruidosos gases y suele ser escuchada por todos los habitantes de la vivienda.</p>
<p>Caca alcoh�lica: Muy com�n despu�s de una noche de beber y beber. Se caracteriza por los pincelazos que deja a su paso sobre las paredes interiores del inodoro. Es de color negro, excesivamente olorosa y tiene una consistencia poco s�lida.</p>
<p>Caca quiero pero no puedo: Cuando uno siente que se est� cagando y se sienta en el inodoro, pero al cabo de unos minutos sin poder cagar decide regresar m�s tarde.</p>
<p>Caca parto dif�cil: Esa que duele tanto al salir que uno piensa que el moj�n est� saliendo atravesado.</p>
<p>Caca 'splash!': Es la que viene tan r�pido y tan pesada que al caer en el agua nos salpica las nalgas y el culo, haci�ndonos encabronar.</p>
<p>Caca alta sociedad: Es aquel tipo de caca que no tiene olor.</p>
<p>Caca esp�a: D�cese de aquella que despu�s de haber jalado la cadena regresa sorpresivamente.</p>
<p>Caca de exhibici�n: La clase de cagada tan monstruosa que es dif�cil creer que haya sido producida por un ser humano. El creador suele dejar su obra en el inodoro para que todos la aprecien y evita arrojar el papel higi�nico encima para no obstruir la visi�n de su obra.</p>
<p>Caca estalactita: Es esa que parece venir en una sola tira y que por m�s que uno intente fruncir el ano no se corta. Suele colgar unos instantes hasta que uno comienza a agitar las caderas.</p>
<p>Caca sorpresa: Es ese tipo de cagada que uno piensa que puede aguantar, por lo que entonces decide no ir al ba�o, pero...</p>
<p>Caca orgullosa: Cuando uno lucha tanto con el moj�n que una vez que logra sacarlo lo primero que hace al salir del ba�o es cont�rselo a alg�n amigo.</p>
<p>Caca ritual: Es la que ocurre a la misma hora, d�a tras d�a. Genera costumbres como: no puedo dormir si no cago a las 22:30, etc.</p>
<p>Caca gru�ona: Es la clase de cagada de tal tama�o que no sale sin asistencia vocal.</p>
<p>Caca mosca: Es esa que queda prendida de las paredes del inodoro y el agua no consigue despegar. Suele retirarse con un trozo peque�o de papel higi�nico.</p>
<p>Caca �y ahora?: Sucede cuando uno, despu�s de cagar, observa que no hay papel. Suelen sacrificarse las hojas del peri�dico o revista que se tenga a la mano; una media o calcet�n; incluso el tubo de cart�n del rollo de papel vac�o, finamente despegado capa por capa y enrollado y desenrollado varias veces para darle suavidad y textura al material resultante.</p>

6961,"<p>Here follows a tale of an accident report form filed by a<br /> bricklayer:</p>
<p>""I put 'poor planning' as the cause of my accident. You ask for<br /> a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be<br /> sufficient. I was working alone on the roof of a six-story<br /> building. When I completed my work I found I had some bricks<br /> left over which later were found to weigh 240lbs. Rather than<br /> carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a<br /> barrel by using a pulley. Securing the rope at ground level, I<br /> went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks<br /> into it. Then I went down to the ground and untied the rope,<br /> holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240lbs of<br /> bricks. You will note on the accident reporting form that my<br /> weight is 135lbs.</p>
<p>Needless to say i proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the<br /> building. In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel<br /> which was proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed.<br /> This explains the fractured skull, minor abrasions, and the<br /> broken collarbone. Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid<br /> ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two<br /> knuckles deep in to the pulley.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had regained my presence of mind and was able to<br /> hold tightly on to the rope. At approximately the same time,<br /> however, the barrel hit the ground and the bottom fell out of<br /> the barrel . Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, the barrel<br /> weighed approximately 50lbs. I refer you again to my weight.</p>
<p>I began a rapid descent. In the vicinity of the third floor, I<br /> met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured<br /> ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower<br /> body.</p>
<p>Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the<br /> barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when i<br /> fell onto the pile of bricks and fortunately only three<br /> vertebrae were cracked.</p>
<p>I am sorry to report, however, as I lay in pain on the pile of<br /> bricks I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go<br /> of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its<br /> rapid descent back towards me.....""</p>

""Well, he stuck a grape up his ass, then pulled it out and ate it"", says the barkeeper. ""Well, what did you expect?"", replied the patron.
