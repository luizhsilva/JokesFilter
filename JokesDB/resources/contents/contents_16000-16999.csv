16001,"<p>Two dyslexics were on the ski slope unsure of which way to ski down the<br /> hill.  They spot another man and go over to ask him.  ""When we go down<br /> the slope do we zig zog or do we zog zag??"" asked one of them.  ""Don't<br /> ask me"", said the man, ""I'm a tobogannist"".</p>
<p>  ""In that case then, I'll have 20 Cuban cigars and a box of matches please"".</p>

16002,"<p>Upon arriving home in eager anticipation of a leisurely evening, the husband<br /> was met at the door by his sobbing wife. Tearfully she explained, ""It's the<br /> pharmacist - he insulted me terribly this morning on the phone.""<br /> Immediately the husband drove downtown to accost the pharmacist and demand an<br /> apology. Before he could say more than a word or two, the pharmacist told him,<br /> ""Now, just a minute - listen to my side of it. This morning the alarm failed to<br /> go off, so I was late getting up. I went without breakfast and hurried out to<br /> the car, but I'll be darned if I didn't lock the house with both house and car<br /> keys inside. I had to break a window to get my keys. Driving a little too fast,<br /> I got a speeding ticket. Then, about three blocks from the store, I had a flat<br /> tire. When I finally got to the store, there was a bunch of people waiting for<br /> me to open up. I got the store opened and started waiting on these people, and<br /> all the time the darn phone was ringing its head off. Then I had to break a roll<br /> of nickels against the cash register drawer to make change and they spilled all<br /> over the floor. I got down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels - the<br /> phone is still ringing - when I came up, I cracked my head on the open cash<br /> drawer, which made me stagger back against a showcase with a bunch of perfume<br /> bottles on it, and half of them hit the floor and broke. The phone is still<br /> ringing with no let up; I finally got back to answer it.<br /> It was your wife - she wanted to know how to use a rectal thermometer. Well,<br /> Mister, I TOLD HER!!!""</p>

16006,"<p>Un famoso mariconazo, que tantas veces hab�a dado y tantas otras recibido, un buen d�a muere y llega en presencia de San Pedro.</p>
<p>El Santo le dice paternal: ""Querido hijo, para entrar al para�so deber�s respoder a mi pregunta, para la cual seguramente no est�s todav�a preparado; en tanto, toma �sta pastilla. Y le d� un comprimido blanco del tama�o de un botoncito, ""vuelve a la tierra y t�mala con un poco de agua, luego vuelve a m�"".</p>
<p>El mariconazo, estupefacto lleva a cabo la �rden y, despu�s de algunos minutos, comienza a sentir un gran malestar de panza; corre al ba�o, donde se libera en una terrible y maloliente diarrea por 10 minutos seguidos.</p>
<p>Terminada la cagada, se reencuentra, blanco y demacrado de frente a San Pedro, que lo mira con ojo cl�nico, y le dice: ""a�n no te encuentro listo"", y le d� una pastilla del tama�o de un cacahuate y le pide hacer lo mismo de la vez anterior.</p>
<p>�sta vez el efecto de la pastilla es mortal, el mariconazo caga diarrea ininterrumpidamente por 3 horas, y luego, extenuado, se encuentra delante del Santo. Despu�s de un atento examen, le dice ""todav�a no est�s listo"" y le da otra pastilla, ahora de la dimensi�n de una nuez. El efecto es terrible, espantoso, bestial... una megacagada de 12 horas con fisura de ano y hemorroides m�ltiples. </p>
<p>El maricon, ya convertido en una larva humana, vuelve delante del Santo hombre, que lo mira y aprueba con la cabeza: ""si, si, ahora seguramente est�s listo para mi pregunta: ""�hab�is entendido ya para qu� sirve el culo?""</p>

16018,"<p>Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like? </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse and a miniskirt and high heels. My measurements are 36-24-36. I work out every day. I'm toned and perfect. What do you look like? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm 6'3"" and about 250 pounds. I wear glasses and I have on a pair of blue sweatpants I just bought at Walmart. I am also wearing a T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from dinner - it smells a little funny. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me? </p>
<p>Wellhung: OK. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: We're in my bedroom. There's soft music playing on the stereo and candles on my dresser and night table. I'm looking up into your eyes, smiling. My hand works its down to your crotch and begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm gulping. I'm beginning to sweat. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest. </p>
<p>Wellhung: Now I'm unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm moaning softly. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk slides off my warm skin. I'm rubbing your bulge faster, pulling and rubbing. </p>
<p>Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and I accidently rip a hole in your blouse. I'm sorry. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: That's OK, it wasn't really too expensive. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'll pay for it. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Don't worry about it. I'm wearing a lacy black bra. My soft breasts are rising and falling, rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm fumbling with the clasp on your bra. I think it's stuck. Do you have any scissors? </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly. I'm reaching back and undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my breasts. My nipples are erect for you. </p>
<p>Wellhung: How did you do that? I'm picking up the bra and inspecting the clasp. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your tongue all over me. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm dropping the bra. Now I'm licking your, you know, breasts. They're neat! </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm running my fingers through your hair. Now I'm nibbling your ear. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breasts are covered with spit. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: What? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm so sorry. Really. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm wiping your spit off my breasts with the remains of my blouse. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with a 'plop'</p>
<p>Sweetheart: OK. I'm pulling your sweatpants down and rubbing your hard tool. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee! </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over, in and out, nibbling on your ... umm ... wait a minute. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: What's the matter? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I've got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I'm choking. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Are you OK? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm having a coughing fit. I'm turning all red. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Can I help?</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I'm fumbling through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups? </p>
<p>Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm drinking a cup of water. There, that's better. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm washing the cup now. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm on the bed, aching for you. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm drying the cup. Now I'm putting it back in the cabinet. And now I'm walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it's dark. I'm lost. Where's the bedroom? </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I found it. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm tugging off your pants. I'm moaning. I want you so badly. </p>
<p>Wellhung: Me too. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately - our naked bodies pressing against each other. </p>
<p>Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Why don't you take off you glasses? </p>
<p>Wellhung: OK, but I can't see very well without them. I place the glasses on the night table. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby! </p>
<p>Wellhung: I have to pee. I'm fumbling my way blindly across the room and toward the bathroom. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I find the bathroom. It's dark. I'm feeling around for the toilet. I lift the lid. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm waiting eagerly for your return. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm done going. I'm feeling around for the flush handle, but I can't find it. Uh-oh! </p>
<p>Sweetheart: What's the matter now? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I've realized that I've peed into your laundry hamper. Sorry again. I'm walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my way. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on. </p>
<p>Wellhung: OK, now I'm going to put my ... you know ... thing ... in your ... you know ... woman's thing. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it! </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss your neck. Umm, I'm having a little trouble here. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can't stand it another second! Slide it in! Screw me now! </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm flaccid. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: What? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm limp. I can't sustain an erection. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm standing up and turning around, an incredulous look on my face. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm shrugging with a sad look on my face, my weiner all floppy. I'm going to get my glasses and see what's wrong. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: No, never mind. I'm getting dressed. I'm putting on my underwear. Now I'm putting on my wet, nasty blouse. </p>
<p>Wellhung: No wait! Now I'm squinting, trying to find the night table. I'm feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray, picture frames and your candles. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm buttoning my blouse. Now I'm putting on my shoes. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I've found my glasses. I'm putting them on. My God! One of your candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I'm pointing at it, a shocked look on my face. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Go to hell. I'm logging off, you loser! </p>
<p>Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!</p>

Until the a guy show up and decided to take up this challenge. He paid the elephant owner 1 grand and went to his car and took out a golf club. He held the club behind him and walked around the elephant. After walking around the elephant a few times, he stopped right behind the elephant. He raised his club and swung as hard as he could right smack between the elephant's hind legs. Being a bull elephant, it leaped twenty feet into the air and landed with a crash. The elephant owner, disgusted with the elephant's performance, paid the guy with the golf club his 10 k. After that, the elephant owner decided to create another challenge. The prize money was now double but so was fee required to pay. This time, the challenge was to make the elephant shake it's head. Again, lots of people came to make the elephant shake it's head and they all failed until the same guy with the golf club came again. He paid the elephant owner 2 grand and once again took out his golf club. Once again, the guy with the golf club walked aroung the elephant. This time, he stopped in front of the elephant. ""Hello."" The guy said. ""Remember me?"" The elephant nodded. ""Remember this golf club?"" The guy asked, showing the elephant his glof club. The elephant nodded. ""Remember what I did to you the last time?"" The elephant nodded nervously. Then the guy said ""DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT AGAIN?!""</p>

16045,"<p>Once upon a time, there once was a traveling salesman who's wife was a well known sex addict. But because the man could not be home all of the time, he often worried about his wife's faithfullness. He had noticed that she had been eyeing the young neighbor boy who cut their lawn recently. So one day the man decided to try to do something about this. After work the man entered a sexual aid shop and asked the owner to show him the selection of dildos.</p>
<p>""Why yes, of course."" said the owner, ""We have a very wide selection.""</p>
<p>But after looking for quite a long time, the man just did not find anything that satisfied him.</p>
<p>""Well, maybe I have just what you need."" remarked the owner, ""Wait here.""</p>
<p>And with that, the owner ran into the back and started digging around for quite some time. After about twenty minutes, the owner finally came out carrying a strange, rectangular box with ancient writing all over it. He set the box down on the counter and opened it for the man. Inside, resting on a bed of satin, la lay an ancient wooden dildo.</p>
<p>""Wow, that pretty neat."" said the man, ""But what's so special about it?""</p>
<p>""This is the Voodoo dick."" remarked the owner, ""Watch."" Then the owner commanded, ""Voodoo dick, rise.""</p>
<p>All of a sudden the dildo rose and hovered in front of the man's face. ""Voodoo dick, door.""</p>
<p>The dildo then flew to the door and started pounding on it like a jackhammer.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, when the door was nothing but a pile of splinters, the owner finally commanded, ""Voodoo dick, box.""</p>
<p>The dildo stopped suddenly and zipped back to rest in its box. The man, being in amazement, pronounced, ""My god, this thing is incredible. I must have it. How much is it?""</p>
<p>""Oh no, I cannot sell it to you. It is a family hierloom and is not for sale.""</p>
<p>""Well, I must have it.  I'll give you $200 for it."" demanded the man. ""No, not for sale."" ""$<br /> 500."" ""No, I cannot."" ""$<br /> 700."" ""I am sorry."" ""$<br /> 1000."" ""Well, ok.""</p>
<p>So the man took the dildo home and presented it to his wife, ""When I am gone and you start to get hot and horny, all you need to do is say 'Voodoo dick, cunt' and it will do the rest."" explained the man.</p>
<p>The next day the man had to leave for his business trip. He was not gone more than thirty minutes when his wife started to get that feeling again. She picked up a magazine to read and noticed that their lawn was being mowed, but wanting to stay faithful to her husband, she decided to try her new toy.  She ran to the bedroom, fell onto the bed, opened the box, and commanded 'Voodoo dick, cunt'.</p>
<p>With that, the Voodoo dick started to fuck away at her pussy. The wife thought that this was incredible and was having one orgasm after another. An hour passed and she was still orgasming like crazy.  Another hour passed and she was begining to tire and getting a bit sore. But she realized that she did not know the command to stop the Voodoo dick.  She decided that she had better get help as soon as she could. So she got into her car and raced to the hospital.</p>
<p>While speeding there,she flew past a cop who then proceeded to pull her over.</p>
<p>""Why in the hell were you driving so crazy?"" asked the officer.</p>
<p>""Well officer,"" answered the wife, ""I have this Voodoo dick in my cunt, and I dont know how to stop it.""</p>
<p>To which the officer responded, ""Voodoo dick, my ass!""</p>

She found him in his bed ''sleeping''. She called his name, but he didn't get up. So she took him to the vet and told the vet that her dog wouldn't wake up. So he looked at her dog and said, ''Your dog is dead''. She asked the doctor to perform another test to be sure.The doctor went into another room, and came back with a cage. In it there was a cat. He let the cat out, and she walked arund the dog, sniffed, and went back in her cage. The doc put the cat back in the other room. He came out and said again, ''Your dog is dead''. She was like ''Ok, how much do I owe you?'' The doctor said ''$300''She said, ''What!?!? How could it cost that much??''He said ''$15 for me to say he was dead. Then $285 for the cat scan''</p>

16050,"<p>Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event. It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer came to him and said, 'Now don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never  lost a match because of this pretzel hold he has. Whatever  you do, don't let him get you in this hold! If he does, you're finished!' The wrestler nodded in agreement. The American and the Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the ending. Suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian's back hit the mat with a  thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him,  getting the pin and winning the match. The trainer was  astounded! When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asks, 'How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!' The wrestler answered, 'Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. 'I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could; and you would be amazed how strong  you get when you bite your own balls!'</p>

As you are probably aware, the competition was exceedingly tough and dozens of well-qualified candidates such as yourself also failed to make the final cut. I will, however, keep your name on file should an opening become available. So that you may find better success in your future romantic endeavors, please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were disqualified from the competition:</p>
<p>[Check all those that apply]</p>
<p>___ Your breasts are bigger than mine.</p>
<p>___ Your last name is objectionable. I can't imagine taking it, hyphenating it, or subjecting my children to it.</p>
<p>___ The fact that our finest dining experience to date has been at McDonald's reveals a thriftiness that I find unappealing.</p>
<p>___ Your inadvertent admission that you ""buy condoms bythetruckload"" indicates that you may be interested in me for something other than my personality.</p>
<p>___ You failed the 20 Question Rule, i.e., I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me one.</p>
<p>___ Your legs are skinnier than mine. If you can FIT into my pants, then you can't GET into my pants.</p>
<p>___ Your ""Putting on a few, aren't you babe?"" comment, given the 9-months pregnant size of your beer gut, was inappropriate.</p>
<p>___ You failed the credit check.</p>
<p>___ I find your inability to fix my car extraordinarily unappealing.</p>
<p>___ The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable.</p>
<p>___ The phrase ""My Mother"" has popped up far too often in conversation.</p>
<p>___ You still live with your parents.</p>
<p>___ You mention your ex-girlfriend's name more than you mention mine.</p>

16078,"<p>One beautiful morning a athiest was walking through the forest, admiring<br /> natures surroundings... </p>
<p>He looked up and saw the trees swaying in the wind high above him and<br /> smiled... </p>
<p>He saw the river glisten in the sun twinkle like a new born star and it made<br /> him warm inside... </p>
<p>He thought to himself that mother nature had made a true and wonderful<br /> world... </p>
<p>The athiest had walked a little further down the track he had taken when<br /> suddenly a bear jumped out of the bushes only a few yards ahead of him and<br /> started growling, looking hungry and ran quickly towards him... </p>
<p>Seeing the big bear bounding towards him he screamed in horror and started<br /> running as fast as he could away from the bear... </p>
<p>Knowing that the bear would catch up to him and he had no chance, the athiest<br /> soon ran out of breath and in a few paces fell to the ground... </p>
<p>As the bears shadow fell upon his face and his paws come down upon his chest,<br /> the athiest screamed<br /> ""oh help me god"" </p>
<p>Suddenly the trees that he so much admired stopped swaying... </p>
<p>The river he loved suddenly stopped flowing.. </p>
<p>And the sky opened up and a voice begun to speak.. </p>
<p>""I am god, and even though you dont believe in me, i am here for every being<br /> on this earth"" </p>
<p>The athiest felt relieved a little bit and asked god... </p>
<p>""Im sort of in this situation, im only asking if you can help me get out of<br /> it"" </p>
<p>God thought for a moment and said... </p>
<p>""I will give you one wish to help you and that is all, you may proceed with<br /> this wish"" </p>
<p>The athiest thought about this wish for a moment and then spoke to god.. </p>
<p>"" Well i dont really want to become a christian, so i wish the bear to become<br /> a christian"" </p>
<p>God spoke... </p>
<p>""So be it done"" </p>
<p>Suddenly the sky closed up... </p>
<p>The river turned back into its flowing glory... </p>
<p>The trees began to sway again... </p>
<p>And the bear clapped his paws together and said... </p>
<p>""Thankyou god for this meal im about to recieve""</p>

<p>He says , ""Ma'am I'm blind but if you drop it on the counter I can tell you everything you need to know about it from the sound that it makes.""</p>
<p>She didn't believe him, but dropped it on the counter anyway. He said ""That's a 6' graphite rod with Zebco 202 reel and 10 lb. test line......It's a good all around rod and reel and it's $20.00.""</p>
<p>She says, ""That's amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. I think it's what I'm looking for so I'll take it"" He walks behind the counter to the register.  In the meantime the woman farts. At first she is embarrassed but then realizes that there is no way he could tell it was her ... being blind he wouldn't know that she was the only person around.</p>
<p>He rings up the sale and says, ""That will be $25.50.""</p>

16090,"<p>A middle-aged businessman took a young woman half his age as his wife. The fantasy of having a young woman in his bed soon became a nightmare when he found that he could not last long enough to satisfy his young bride.</p>
<p>His wife, as understanding as she was exciting, told him that all was well even if he was quick to get out of the saddle.</p>
<p>Determined to satisfy this sweet young thing, the man visited the doctor to get some advice.</p>
<p>""Doctor, I can't seem to hold back for very long when I make love to my young wife and I can't satisfy her. What  can I do?""</p>
<p>The doctor smiled, patted him on the shoulder, and said in a professional manner, ""Try a bit of self-stimulation before having intercourse with your wife and you'll find that you'll last longer and ultimately satisfy her.""</p>
<p>""Okay, Doctor. If you think that will help.""</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, his young bride called him at work to let him know that she would be attacking him at the front door when he arrived home.</p>
<p>""Be prepared, my darling. I'm going to ravish you,"" she cooed over the phone.</p>
<p>Undaunted, the man decided to follow the doctor's advice. But where?  In the office? The Xerox room? What if someone walked in on him?</p>
<p>He got in his truck and began the journey home. Soon he decided he would find a spot on the road to pull over, climb underneath the truck and pretend to be inspecting the rear axle, and do the deed there.</p>
<p>A moment later, he pulled over, crawled beneath the truck, closed his eyes tightly, fantasized about his young wife, and began his ""therapy"".</p>
<p>A few minutes later, just as he was about to complete his therapy session, he felt someone tugging on his pants leg. Keeping his eyes tightly shut to avoid ruining the fantasy he was enjoying, he said, ""Yes?""</p>
<p>""Sir, I'm with the Police Department. Could you tell me what you are doing, please?"" said the officer.</p>
<p>""Yes, officer, I'm inspecting my truck's rear axle,"" he replied confidently.</p>

<p>14.) A friend of mine came up with a very quick response over vacation. We were walking down the street and I glanced at a girl who had just walked by.  She turned around and said to me, ""What are you looking at?""  My friend, walking next to me came  to the rescue, ""He thought you were good looking, but he was mistaken.""</p>
<p>15.) While at college, a few friends were discussing how their ""passes"" had been rejected by the intended female recipient. One of the ladies explained how she handled it once.</p>
<p>When the guy, obviously getting irritated, blurted out something like, ""Hey, come on, we're both here at this bar for the same reason!"" </p>

<p>16.) The attractive young woman was sitting at the bar, alone, when the lounge lizard made his move.</p>
<p>""I'm here,"" he breathed huskily, ""to fulfill your every sexual fantasy."" </p>
<p>The woman turned and looked at him. Her lips parted and she moistened them with the tip of her tongue. She leaned toward him with her hands on her thighs, and her eyes opened to the size of dinner plates. </p>
<p>She paused just a second and then delivered the crusher line, ""Well is it the size of  donkey or Doberman?""</p>

16092,"<p>One day a certain lady was driving on the Highway. She frequently checked her speed gauge to make sure she stayed within the speed limit.  However, when she looked into her rear mirror, much to her dismay, she saw a police car not far behind!  And, to make matters worse, the police car turned on his flashing lights.  She thought to herself, ""Uh-oh, what have I done now?  I'm not speeding.  I'm not drinking. I have my seat belt on!  I have kept up my license dues and everything!""So, she pulled over and the police car pulled over to the side right behind her car.  She drove her car slowly to a stop, slowly rolled down the window, and prepared for a ticket when she knew she didn't deserve it.  A policeman walked up to her window, and spoke to her.  The lady pointed to her ear and shook her head, meaning she was deaf.  The policeman smiled slightly, and knowing sign language, signed back, ""I know. I'm here to tell you that your horn is stuck.""</p>

<p>""So, did you jump?"" The father asked. </p>

<p>""I'm getting to that. Every one else had jumped, and I was the last man<br /> left on the plane. I told the sergeant that I was too scared to jump. He<br /> told me to get off the plane or he'd kick my butt."" </p>
<p>""So, did you jump?""</p>
<p>""Not then. He tried to push me out of the plane, but I grabbed onto the<br /> door and refused to go. Finally he called over the Jump Master.

<p>The shop assistant thinks for a minute, knowing full well that they don't stock, or have ever sold, such an item. She smiles at the thick blonde pillock and says, ""One moment please, I will get the pharmacist.""</p>
<p>The pharmacist looks at the blonde and says, ""Can I help you miss?""</p>
<p>""I would like to buy some bottom deodorant please,"" says the blonde.</p>
<p>""I'm sorry,"" says the pharmacist, ""we don't have any.""</p>
<p>""But I always get it here,"" says the blonde.</p>
<p>""Do you have the container it comes in?""</p>
<p>""Yes!"" Said the blonde, ""I will go and get it.""</p>
<p>She returns with the container and hands it to the pharmacist who looks at it and says to the her ""This is just a normal stick of under arm deodorant.""</p>
<p>The annoyed blonde snatches the container back and reads out loud from the container, ""To apply, push up bottom.""</p>

<p>Morris, somewhat of a loud mouth, shouted across the garage, ""Hey DeBakey...Is dat you? Come over here a minute.""</p>
<p>The famous surgeon, a bit surprised, walked over to where Morris was working on a car. Morris in a loud voice, all could hear, said argumentatively, ""So Mr. fancy doctor, look at this work. I also take valves out, grind 'em, put in new parts, and when I finish this baby will purr like a kitten.</p>
<p>So how come you get the big bucks, when you and me are doing basically the same work?""</p>
<p>DeBakey, very embarrassed, walked away, and said softly, to Morris, ""Try doing your work with the engine running.""</p>

16121,"<p>Neighbors had complained to the mayor about the noisy pub on the corner of 3rd &amp; Lambourne. Seems that the old cronies got together every friday &amp; saturday, played cards, drank beer, told lies and jokes until 2am Saturday morning, when the pub had to close.</p>
<p>Officer Redding, parked down the street was not amused. He checked his watch, noted it was 01:55, time for the old drunks to start leaving. If he hadn't been assigned this crap detail he'd be down at the I-80 Truck stop about now having a nice hot cup of coffee.  Redding pulled out a cigarette and was about to light up when the door of the pub slammed open and an old geezer stumbled out. Redding put the smoke back in the pack; he was ""on point"" now.</p>
<p>The old man stumbled around, fished his car keys out of his pocket, dropped them a couple of times, finally found them and weaved down the sidewalk and across the road to his car.</p>
<p>Redding started his engine, watching carefully as the old man fumbled to unlock his door. Other patrons leaving the pub seemed a little tipsy, but nothing like the old goat trying to get into his car. As soon as the old man's car started to pull away from the curb, Redding was on him like a hound on a bone, siren, redlights and loudspeaker. Redding wanted these complaining neighbors to know the city was doing it's job.</p>
<p>""Outta the car, old man!"" demanded Redding. ""But officer, I haven't had anything to drink!"" complained the old boy. ""Sure, you haven't, oldtimer, sure you haven't"", replied Redding as he put the cuffs on the old guy and hauled him downtown.</p>
<p>At the station, the old man blew into the breathalyzer and the needle didn't move. ""What the...YOU haven't been drinking, old timer!""</p>
<p>But that's what I tried to tell you back there, officer!"" ""Well then why were you stumbling all over the place?"" asked Redding. ""Well, officer, tonight when we all got to the pub, they elected me to be the 'designated drunk' when the place closed down!""</p>

Inches before hitting the street, the man begins to rise<br /> back up, and gently lands back on the roof.<br />   ""That was amazing!"" responds the drunk.

16144,"<p>Subject: a day at the gym</p>
<p>Dear Diary,</p>
<p>For my forty fifth birthday this year, my wife (the dear) purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me. </p>
<p>Although I am still in great shape since playing on my college football team 20 yrs ago, I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try.</p>
<p>I called the club and made my reservation with a personal trainer named Belinda, who identified herself as a 26 yr old aerobics instructor and model for athletic clothing and swimwear. </p>
<p>My wife seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started! The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress.</p>
<p>MONDAY:</p>
<p>Started my day at 6:00am.</p>
<p>Tough to get out of bed, but it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Belinda waiting for me. She was something of a Greek goddess - with blonde hair, dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile. Woo Hoo!!!!!</p>
<p>Belinda gave me a tour and showed me the machines. She took my pulse after 5 minutes on the treadmill. She was alarmed that my pulse was so fast, but I attributed it to standing next to her in her Lycra aerobics outfit. </p>
<p>I enjoyed watching the skillful way in which she conducted her aerobics class after my workout today. Very inspiring, Belinda was encouraging as I did my sit-ups, l though my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time she was around. </p>
<p>This is going to be a FANTASTIC week!!</p>
<p>TUESDAY:</p>
<p>I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out the door. Belinda made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air, and then she put weights on it! My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made the full mile. Belinda's rewarding smile made it all worthwhile. </p>
<p>I feel GREAT!! It 's a whole new life for me.</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY:</p>
<p>The only way I can brush my teeth is by lying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I believe I have a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was OK as long as I didn�t try to steer or stop. I parked on top of a GEO in the club parking lot. </p>
<p>Belinda was impatient with me, insisting that my screams bothered other club members.  Her voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when she scolds, she gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying.</p>
<p>My chest hurts when I got on the treadmill, so Belinda put me on the stair monster. Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators? </p>
<p>Belinda told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life. She said some other shit too.</p>
<p>THURSDAY:</p>
<p>Belinda was waiting for me with her vampire-like teeth exposed as her thin, cruel lips were pulled back in a full snarl. I couldn't help being a half an hour late; it took me that long to tie my shoes. </p>
<p>Belinda took me to work out with dumbbells. When she was not looking, I ran and hid in the men's room. She sent Lars to find me, then, as punishment, put me on the rowing machine - which I sank.</p>
<p>FRIDAY:</p>
<p>I hate that bitch Belinda more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. Stupid, skinny, anemic little cheerleader. </p>
<p>If there were a part of my body I could move without unbearable pain, I would beat her with it. Belinda wanted me to work on my triceps. I<br /> don't have any triceps! And if you don't want dents in the floor, don't hand me the *&amp;%#(#&amp;**!!@*@. Barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich. (Which I am sure you learned in the sadistic school you attended<br /> and graduated magna cumlaude from.)</p>
<p>The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and nutrition teacher. Why couldn�t it have been someone softer, like the drama coach or the choir director?</p>
<p>SATURDAY:</p>
<p>Belinda left a message on my answering machine in her grating, shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today. Just hearing her made me want to smash the machine with my planner. However, I lacked the strength to even<br /> use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the Weather Channel.</p>
<p>SUNDAY:</p>
<p>I'm having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can go and thank GOD that this week is over. I will also pray that next year, my wife (the bitch), will choose a gift for me that is fun - like a root canal or a vasectomy. </p>

<p>""Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?"" the old man asked timidly. </p>
<p>Peter lectured, ""That's the best part...you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven."" </p>

16150,"<p>There was a group of retarded kids that were having a tough time getting through life... Group home, no one to love them.  </p>
<p>One day a music teacher happened through and wondered if music might cheer the kids up.  It worked! A few of them were musically inclined, and the rest hummed along... The teacher kept coming back and working with the kids.  They were improving, so one day she stopped at the store and bought a big bag of apples and some Coca-Cola as a treat to the kids. That day, the kids sang like never before, and the teacher attributed it to the apples and Coke.  Every time she came back and brought apples and Cokes the kids were singing like songbirds, and really improving musically... </p>
<p>The music teacher started coming every day, bringing a big load of apples and cases of Coke, and lo and behold, what a choir.  The downside of eating a lots of apples and drinking Coke was the kids were getting rather obese...So she decided to keep up with the apples, but changed their beverage to Tab diet cola...</p>

16166,"<p>One day at a busy airport, the passengers on a commercial<br /> airliner are seated, waiting for the cockpit crew to show up so<br /> they can get under way.</p>
<p>The pilot and co-pilot finally appear in the rear of the plane,<br /> and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle.</p>
<p>Both appear to be blind. The pilot is using a white cane,<br /> bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the<br /> aisle, and the co-pilot is using a guide dog.</p>
<p>Both have their eyes covered with huge sunglasses.</p>
<p>At first the passengers do not react; thinking that it must be<br /> some sort of practical joke.</p>
<p>However, after a few minutes the engines start spooling up and<br /> the airplane starts moving down the runway.</p>
<p>The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness,<br /> whispering among themselves and looking desperately to the<br /> stewardesses for reassurance.</p>
<p>Then the airplane starts accelerating rapidly and people begin<br /> panicking.</p>
<p>Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and<br /> closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more<br /> and more hysterical.</p>
<p>Finally, when the airplane has less than 20 feet of runway left,<br /> there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone<br /> screams at once, and at the very last moment the airplane lifts<br /> off and is airborne.</p>
<p>Up in the cockpit, the co-pilot breathes a sigh of relief and<br /> turns to the Captain: ""You know, one of these days the they're<br /> going to scream too late, and we're gonna get killed!""</p>

<p>The first night there, she began to undress, as did he. There she stood nude except for a pair of black lacy panties. He was in his birthday suit. Looking at her he asked, ""Why the black panties? Is this a mystery thing?""</p>
<p>She replied, ""The rest of my body is yours, but down there I am still in mourning."" He understood and accepted her choice, though somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>The following night the same scenario: She presented herself to him, clad in only her black panties and he was in his birthday suit, except that he donned a black condom.</p>

16168,"<p>A few months ago, there was an opening with the CIA for an assassin. These highly classified positions are hard to fill, and there's a lot of testing and background checks involved before you can even be considered for the position. After sending some applicants through the background checks, training and testing, they narrowed the possible choices down to two men and a woman, but only one position was available.The day came for the final test to see which person would get the extremely secretive job. The CIA men administering the test took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun.""We must know that you will follow our instructions whatever the circumstances,"" they explained.""Inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her.""The man looked horrified and said, ""You can't be serious! I could never shoot my wife!"" ""Well,"" said the CIA man, ""you're definitely not the right man for this job then.""So they brought the second man to the same door and handed him a gun.""We must know that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances,"" they explained to the second man.""Inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her.""The second man looked a bit shocked, but nevertheless took the gun and went in the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes; then the door opened. The man came out of the room with tears in his eyes.""I tried to shoot her; I just couldn't pull the trigger and shoot my wife. I guess I'm not the right man for the job.""""No,"" the CIA man replied, ""You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.""Now they only had the woman left to test. They led her to the same door to the same room and handed her the same gun.""We must be sure that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances;this is your final test. Inside you will find your husband sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill him.""The woman took the gun and opened the door. Before the door even closed all the way, the CIA men heard the gun start firing, one shot after another for 13 shots. Then all hell broke loose in the room. They heard screaming, crashing,and banging on the walls. This went on for several minutes; then all went quiet. The door opened slowly, and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat the son of a bitch to death with the chair!""</p>

16190,"<p>The 5 questions most feared by men are:<br /> 1...What are you thinking about?<br /> 2...Do you love me?<br /> 3...Do I look fat?<br /> 4...Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5...What would you do if I died?</p>
<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly(i.e., tells the truth).</p>
<p>As a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible Responses.</p>
<p>Question # 1:  What are you thinking about?</p>
<p>The proper answer to this, of course, is: ""I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you.""<br /> This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer,which most likely is one of the following:<br /> a...Baseball.<br /> b...Football.<br /> c...How fat you are.<br /> d...How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e...How I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, ""If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!""</p>
<p>Question # 2:  Do you love me?</p>
<p>The proper response is: ""YES!"" or, if you feel a more detailed  answer is in order, ""Yes, dear."" Inappropriate responses include:<br /> a...Oh Yeah, crap loads.<br /> b...Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> c...That depends on what you mean by love.<br /> d...Does it matter?<br /> e...Who, me?</p>
<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat?</p>
<p>The correct answer is an emphatic: ""Of course not!""<br /> Among the incorrect answers are:<br /> a...Compared to what?<br /> b...I wouldn't call you fat, but you're not exactly thin.<br /> c...A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d...I've seen fatter.<br /> e...Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>Question # 4: Do you think she's prettier than me?</p>
<p>Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: ""Of course not!""<br /> Incorrect responses include:</p>
<p>a...Yes, but you have a better personality.<br /> b...Not prettier, but definitely thinner.<br /> c...Not as pretty as you when you were her age.<br /> d...Define pretty.<br /> e...Could you repeat the question?  I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>Question # 5: What would you do if I died?</p>
<p>A definite no-win question.(The real answer, of course, is ""Buy a Corvette and a Boat"").<br /> WARNING: No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:</p>
<p>WOMAN: Would you get married again?<br /> MAN: Definitely not!<br /> WOMAN: Why not-don't you like being married?<br /> MAN: Of course I do.<br /> WOMAN: Then why wouldn't you remarry?<br /> MAN: Okay, I'd get married again.<br /> WOMAN: You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)<br /> WOMAN: Would you sleep with her in our bed?<br /> MAN: Where else would we sleep?<br /> WOMAN: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?<br /> MAN: That would seem like the proper thing to do.<br /> WOMAN: And would you let her use my golf clubs?<br /> MAN: She can't use them; she's left-handed<br /> WOMAN: - - - silence - - -<br /> MAN: Oh  ( expletive deleted).</p>

16191,"<p>I have a moral question for you. This is an imaginary situation, but think it<br /> is fun to decide what one would do. The situation: You are in the Midwest, and<br /> there is a huge flood in progress. Many homes have been lost, water supplies<br /> compromised, and infrastructure destroyed. Let's say you're a photographer out<br /> getting still photos for a news service, traveling alone, looking for<br /> particularly poignant scenes. If you were to stumble across Bill Clinton<br /> struggling to keep from being swept away in a raging river and you had a choice<br /> of rescuing him or getting a Pulitzer prize-winning photograph of the President<br /> being swept away...........</p>

<p>When the milkman read the note he felt there must be a mistake, and thought she probably meant three litres, so he knocked on the door to clarify the point.</p>
<p>The blonde came to the door and the milkman said, 'I found your note to leave 30 litres of milk. Did you mean 30 litres or three litres?' </p>
<p>The blonde said, 'I want 30 litres. I'm going to fill my bath up with milk and take a milk bath.'</p>
<p>The milkman asked, 'Pasteurized?'</p>

16199,"<p>A guy goes to see the doctor, because he's a little too well-endowed. In fact, it's 25 inches long and he can't get any women to have sex with him.</p>
<p>Anyway, the doctor says there's nothing he can do medically, but recommends a witch doctor that he thinks might be able to help.</p>
<p>The witch doctor takes a look at the problem and tells him to go to a particular pond, deep in the forest, and talk to a frog that lives there. ""Ask the frog to marry you and each time the frog says no, you'll be 5 inches shorter.""</p>
<p>Worth a try, he thinks, and off he dashes into the forest. He finds the pond and sees the frog on the other side, sitting on a log. ""Frog, will you marry me?""</p>
<p>The frog looks at him, disinterested at best, and calls back, ""No.""</p>
<p>The guy looks down and sure enough, he's 5 inches shorter. Hey, this is great he thinks, let's try that again. ""Will you marry me?""</p>
<p>The frog rolls his eyes, and shouts back again, ""No!""</p>
<p>Zappo! The guy's down to 15 inches.  </p>
<p>Well, that's still a bit excessive, he thinks.  Down another 5 would be perfect.  So he calls across again, ""Frog, will you marry me?""</p>
<p>The irritated frog yells back, ""Look, how many times do I have to tell you?  No, No, NO!"" </p>

<p>The bartender replies, ""Here's what you do, tonight when you get home, pull down your pants, point to your willy and ask her what it is.

After a long wait the family ate without the newlyweds. The mother said, ""I wonder why they never came down to eat?""The grooms young brother said, ""Mommy, I think -- """"Oh shut up, I don't want to hear what you think!"" said the mother, not wanting to hear any inappropriate comments from the younger brother.At lunch time the mother again prepared a wonderful meal and again called the young couple to eat. After another long wait the family proceeded to eat, and after the meal was completed the mother once again said, ""I wonder why they never came down to eat?"" Once again the younger brother started to speak, but was interrupted by the mother.At dinner time once again the mother cooked a very elaborate meal, had the table set perfect and called the newlyweds to join the family for dinner. After another long wait the mother once again questioned why they had not come downstairs all day.The young lad once again said, ""Mommy I think -- """"Well what is it that you think?"" asked the mother rather irritated.""I think that when my big brother came down to get the Vaseline last night, he got my model plane glue instead.""</p>

<p>14 A girlfriend of mine once had a graying man in his 60's approach her in a club while she was in college with the line, ""Where have you been all my life?"" She took one glance at him and said, ""For the first half of it, I probably wasn't born yet.""</p>
<p>15 A friend of mine came up with a very quick response over vacation. We were walking down the street and I glanced at a girl who had just walked by.  She turned around and said to me, ""What are you looking at?""  My friend, walking next to me came to the rescue, ""He thought you were good looking, but he was mistaken.""</p>
<p>16 While at college, a few friends were discussing how their ""passes"" had been rejected by the intended female recipient. One of the ladies explained how she handled it once... When the guy, obviously getting irritated, blurted out something like, ""Hey, come on, we're both here at this bar for the same reason!""  She responded,  ""Yeah! Let's pick up some chicks!"" He immediately blanched, and decided that maybe he would look someplace else.</p>
<p>17 The attractive young woman was sitting at the bar, alone, when the lounge lizard made his move.  ""I'm here,"" he breathed huskily, ""to fulfill your every sexual fantasy.""

16231,"<p>A young college student had stayed up all night studying for his zoology test<br /> the next day. As he entered the classroom, he saw ten stands with ten birds on<br /> them. Each bird had a sack over its head; only the legs were showing. He sat<br /> straight in the front row because he wanted to do the best job possible. The<br /> professor announced that the test would be to look at each of the birds' legs<br /> and give the common name, habitat, genus and species.<br /> The student looked at each of the birds' legs. They all looked the same to<br /> him. He began to get upset. He had stayed up all night studying and now had to<br /> identify birds by their legs. The more he thought about it the madder he got.<br /> Finally he could stand it no longer. He went up to the professor's desk and<br /> said, ""What a stupid test! How could anyone tell the difference between birds by<br /> looking at their legs?"" With that the student threw his test on the professor's<br /> desk and walked to the door.<br /> The professor was surprised. The class was so big that he didn't know every<br /> student's name so as the student reached the door the professor called, ""Mister,<br /> what's your name?""<br /> The enraged student pulled up his pant legs and said, ""You tell me buddy! You<br /> tell me!""</p>

16233,"<p>Dear Santa, </p>
<p>I understand that one of my colleagues has petitioned you for changes in her contract, specifically asking for anatomical and career changes. In addition, it is my understanding that disparaging remarks were made about me, my ability to please, and some of my fashion choices. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of some issues concerning Ms. Barbie, and some of my own needs and desires. </p>
<p>First of all, I along with several other colleagues feel Barbie DOES NOT deserve preferential treatment-the bitch has EVERYTHING!! I, along with Joe, Jem, Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy, DO NOT have a dream house, Corvette, evening gowns, and in some cases, the ability t change our hairstyle. I personally have 3 outfits which I am forced to mix and match at great length. My decision to accessorize my outfits with an earring was my decision and reflects my lifestyle choice. </p>
<p>I, too, would like a change in my career. Have you considered :""Decorator Ken"", ""Beauty Salon Ken"", or ""Out of Work Actor Ken""? In addition, there are several other avenues which could be considered such as:""S&amp;M Ken"", ""Green Lantern Ken"", ""Circuit Ken"", ""Bear Ken"", ""Master Ken"". These would more accurately reflect my desires and perhaps open new markets. </p>
<p>And as for Barbie needing bendable arms so she can ""push me away"", I need bendable knees so I can kick that bitch to the curb. Bendable knees would also be helpful for me in other situations-we've talked about this issue before. </p>
<p>In closing, I would like to point out that any further concessions to the blond bimbo from hell will result in action taken by myself and others. </p>
<p>PS. Barbie can forget about having Joe-he's mine, at least that is what he said last night. </p>
<p>Sincerely, Ken</p>

16239,"<p>A farmer ordered a high-tech milking machine. It happened that the equipment arrived when his wife was away, so he decided to test it on himself first. He inserted his penis into the equipment, turned the switch on and ''voila'', everything else was automatic!! He really had good time as the equipment provided him with as much pleasure as his wife did. But when the fun was over, he found that he could not<br /> take the instrument off. He read the manual, but did not find any useful information.<br /> He tried every button on the instrument. Some made the equipment squeeze, shake, or suck harder or less, but none would remove it. Panicking, he called the<br /> supplier's Customer Service Hotline. The farmer: ''Hello, I just bought a milking machine from your company. It worked fantastic. But how can I take it off from the cow's udder?'' Customer Service: ''Don't worry. The machine was programmed such that it will release automatically after collecting about 2 liters of milk.''</p>

16280,"<p>1. Never walk without a document in your hands</p>
<p>People with documents in their hands look like hardworking employees heading for important meetings. People with nothing in their hands look like they're heading for the canteen. People with a newspaper in their hand look like they're heading for the toilet. Above all, make sure you carry loads of stuff home with you at night, thus generating the false impression that you work longer hours than you do.</p>
<p>2. Use computers to look busy</p>
<p>Any time you use a computer, it looks like ""work"" to the casual observer. You can send and receive personal e-mail, chat and generally have a blast without doing anything remotely related to work. These aren't exactly the societal benefits that the proponents of the computer revolution would like to talk about but they're not bad either. When you get caught by your boss - and you *will* get caught -- your best defense is to claim you're teaching yourself to use new software, thus saving valuable training expenses.</p>
<p>3. Messy desk</p>
<p>Top management can get away with a clean desk. For the rest of us, it looks like we're not working hard enough. Build huge piles of documents around your workspace. To the observer, last year's work looks the same as today's work; it's volume that counts. Pile them high and wide. If you know somebody is coming to your desk, bury the document you'll need halfway down in an existing stack and rummage for it when he/she arrives.</p>
<p>4. Voice Mail</p>
<p>Never answer your phone if you have voice mail. People don't call you just because they want to give you something for nothing - they call because they want YOU to do work for THEM. That's no way to live. Screen all your calls through voice mail. If somebody leaves a voice mail message for you and it sounds like impending work, respond during lunch hour when you know they're not there - it looks like you're hardworking and conscientious even though you're being a devious weasel.</p>
<p>5. Looking Impatient and Annoyed</p>
<p>Always try to look impatient and annoyed to give your bosses the impression that you are always busy.</p>
<p>6. Leave the office late</p>
<p>Always leave the office late, especially when the boss is still around. You could read magazines and storybooks that you always wanted to read but have no time until late before leaving. Make sure you walk past the boss' room on your way out. Send important emails at unearthly hours (e.g. 9:35pm, 7:05am, etc.) and during public holidays.</p>
<p>7. Creative Sighing for Effect</p>
<p>Sigh loudly when there are many people around, giving the impression that you are under extreme pressure.</p>
<p>8. Stacking Strategy</p>
<p>It is not enough to pile lots of documents on the table. Put lots of books on the floor etc. (thick computer manuals are the best).</p>
<p>9. Build Vocabulary</p>
<p>Read up on some computer magazines and pick out all the jargon and new products. Use the phrases freely when in conversation with bosses. Remember: They don't have to understand what you say, but you will sound impressive.</p>
<p>10. Have 2 Jackets</p>
<p>If you work in a big open plan office, always leave a spare jacket draped over the back of your seat. This gives the impression that you are still on the premises. The second jacket should be worn while swanning around elsewhere</p>

16309,"<p>There was this young boy. As he was leaving to go to church, his mother gave<br /> him a dollar for the collection plate. On the way, he passed a hamburger stand,<br /> and bought a hamburger with the offering money. He ate half, and decided to save<br /> the other half for after church. He put the other half in his pocket.<br /> During church, the preacher was preaching, ""The Lord is everywhere...He's in<br /> the heavens, He's in the air, He's on the earth, He's in your house...The Lord<br /> is everywhere!""<br /> The boy jumps up, says, ""Preacher, can I ask a question?"" ""Sure"",says the<br /> preacher. ""Do you mean the Lord is everywhere?"" ""Yep, He's everywhere"".<br /> The boy reaches down, opens his pocket and says,""Lord, if You're in there,<br /> please don't eat my hamburger!""</p>

16312,"<p>A college football coach had recruited a top talent, but the player couldn't pass the school's entrance exam. Needing the recruit badly, the coach went to the dean and asked if the recruit could take the test orally. </p>
<p>The dean agreed, and the following day the recruit and the coach were seated in his office. ""Okay,"" the dean said. ""What is seven times seven?"" </p>
<p>The recruit mulled it over for a moment, then said, ""I think it's 49."" </p>

16313,"<p>A knockout young lady decided she wanted to get rich quick so she proceeded to find herself a rich 73-year-old man, planning to love him to death on their wedding night.  The courtship and wedding went off without any problem, in spite of the half-century age difference.The first night of her honeymoon, she got undressed, and waited for him to come out of the bathroom to come to bed. When he emerged, however, he had nothing on except a rubber to cover a twelve-inch erection, and was carrying a pair of earplugs and a pair of noseplugs.Fearing her plan had gone desperately amiss, she asked, ""What are those for?""The elderly gentleman replied, ""There are two things I can't stand: the sound of a woman screaming, and the smell of burning rubber!""</p>

<p>5&gt; ""... and those of you on the left side of the cabin, if you now look to the right, you can see the towering timber of flight attendant Brian.""</p>
<p>4&gt; The guy next to you won't shut up about how tough it is to be the only African-American on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>3&gt; It's much easier to tell when somebody's coming down the aisle with nuts.</p>
<p>2&gt; ""And now in the left aisle, serving cocktails, come on guys, put your hands together for Taammyyyy*!""</p>

16318,"<p>An Irishman's been drinking at a pub all night. When he stands up to leave, he falls flat on his face. He tries to stand one more time, but to no avail. Again, he falls flat on his face. He figures he'll crawl outside and get some fresh air and maybe that will sober him up. Once outside, he stands up and, sure enough, he falls flat on his face. The Irishman decides to crawl the four blocks to his home. When he arrives at the door, he stands up and falls flat on his face. He crawls through the door into his bedroom. When he reaches his bed, he tries one more time to stand up. This time, he manages to pull himself upright but he quickly falls right into bed. He is sound asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow. He awakens the next morning to his wife standing over him, shouting, ''So, you've been out drinking again!'' ''Why do you say that?'' he asks innocently. ''The pub called. You left your wheelchair there again.''</p>

16397,"<p>There was a guy in a bar and he asked the bartender for a beer. He chugged it, looked into his pocket, asked for another beer. Which he chugged, then looked into his pocket, and asked for another beer. This went on for a while then the bartender finally asked, 'How come you ask for a beer, chug it, then look in your pocket?' The man said, 'because there is a picture of my wife in my pocket and I'm gonna keep drinking till she looks good enough to go home.'</p>

16398,"<p>I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in. </p>
<p>I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just arse holes. </p>
<p>I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and only suspicion - not proof - to destroy it. After that, you'd better have a big dick or huge tits. </p>
<p>I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more fed up than you think. </p>
<p>I've learned you should always leave loved ones with loving words. You may need to borrow money. </p>
<p>I've learned that you can keep puking long after you think you're finished. </p>
<p>I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities.</p>
<p>I've learned that either you control your attitude or you will he offered medication. </p>
<p>I've learned that money is a great substitute for character. </p>
<p>I've learned that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean you cant take advantage of them when they're passed out and naked in your bed. </p>
<p>I�ve learned that maturity is a magazine for old farts. </p>
<p>I've learned that no matter how good a woman is she'll only contribute to your alcoholism. </p>

<p>I've learned that just because two people argue, it doesn't mean they don't have secret plans to move out. </p>
<p>I've learned that we don't have to ditch bad friends because their dysfunction makes us feel better about ourselves. </p>
<p>I've learned that two people can screw the exact same person and compare notes. </p>
<p>I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon. And all the less important ones just never go away. </p>
<p>I've learned to say, 'F*** them if they can't take a joke' in six languages.</p>

<p>The old man leans forward and says softly to his wife . . .<br /> ""Dear, there is something that I must ask you. It has always bothered me that our 10th child never quite looked like the rest of our children. Now I want to assure you that these 75 years have been the most wonderful experience I could have ever hoped for, and your answer cannot take that all away. But, I must know, did he have a different father?"" </p>
<p>The wife drops her head, unable to look her husband in the eye.<br /> She paused for moment and then confessed. ""Yes. Yes he did."" </p>
<p>The old man is very shaken, the reality of what his wife was admitting hit him harder than he had expected. With a tear in his eye he asks ""Who? Who was he? Who was the father?"" </p>
<p>Again the old woman drops her head, saying nothing at first as she tried to muster the courage to tell the truth to her husband. then, finally, she says. . . . . . . ""You.""</p>

16404,"<p>The curator of a Western art museum commissioned a local artist to paint a mural-sized painting of Custer's Last Thought. The artist was told to make it highly symbolic of Custer's mindset during the debacle at Little Big Horn. Deep in thought, the artist went to her studio. After many false starts, she proceeded to paint an enormous oil painting. </p>
<p>Finally, after many months of work, the painting was unveiled for the curator. In the foreground, a beautiful crystalline blue lake with a single fish leaping. Around the fish's head is a halo. In the background, the hills and meadows are covered with naked Native American couples copulating. </p>
<p>The curator is both disgusted and baffled by what he sees. In a rage he turns to the artist and asks, ""What the hell has this got to do with Custer's Last Thought?"" </p>
<p>The artist replied, ""Custer's Last Thought had to have been: 'Holy Mackerel! Where did all these fucking Indians come from?'""</p>

<p>Tis the night before Christmas,"" I thought with a frown.<br /> I was stuck at the office. The network was down.<br /> The routers were hung in the closet. All crashed.<br /> Their tables had holes in their data. All trashed.</p>
<p>Remote distribution, it seems, just for fun,<br /> Had erased DLLs Windows needed to run<br /> On 84 desktops way down in accounting.<br /> I sat stunned at my desk, my blood pressure mounting.</p>
<p>When all of a sudden there arose such a clatter,<br /> I saw that a server had something the matter.<br /> There was smoke coming out of the main hard disk drive.<br /> ""No problem,"" I thought. ""I'm set up with RAID 5.</p>
<p>But I found out the system I thought was unstoppable<br /> Had disk drives that turned out completely unswappable!<br /> ""No problem,"" I thought. ""I've tape backup to thank.""<br /> And then I discovered my backups were blank.</p>
<p>The UPS burped, and its lights all went out.<br /> I started to scream! I started to shout!<br /> But nobody heard as I vented my rage.<br /> My gurus were all on vacation those days.<br /> And nobody's tech support answered the phone.<br /> I was nose deep in trouble, completely alone.</p>
<p>When out at reception, I heard a soft knock.<br /> As the hands just touched midnight on my desktop clock...</p>
<p>""What's your problem?"" he asked.<br /> ""Never mind, friend, I know.<br /> I checked out your network five hours ago.<br /> I did some proactive analysis, so<br /> I knew that this time bomb was going to blow.""<br /> Who was this guy? Who did he think that he was?<br /> He was dressed in red coveralls, white beard, black gloves.</p>
<p>His eyes had the twinkle of technical genius.<br /> His smile cut down personal distance between us.</p>
<p>He spread out his tools, and went straight to his work.<br /> ""Whoever configured this network's a jerk,""<br /> He said with a :-)&gt; as he quickly rebooted,<br /> Uploaded some software, and smoothly rerouted<br /> The LAN to a WAN that he quickly supplied<br /> With bandwidth at least 20 gigabits wide<br /> That went via wireless, I think, LEO,<br /> To tech support elves waiting at the North Pole.</p>
<p>""Now bridging, now routing, now Ethernet hubs!""<br /> He chanted as each piece of hardware he rubbed.<br /> ""Cheer up, my good friend! Lose that mindset so tragic!<br /> Technology often looks just like some magic<br /> To people who don't understand what we do.<br /> Now a switch, emulation, now middleware glue!<br /> Look at the protocols, check one or two,<br /> Debug a bit, test a bit, presto! We're through!""</p>
<p>My data was back! Every system checked out!<br /> Tears of joy wet my face as I wandered about.</p>
<p>""How can I thank you? You must be Saint Nick!""<br /> He said, ""Really, my friend, it's not such a great trick,<br /> If you don't give up hope, focus on what you're doing,<br /> And read all your issues of Network Computing.""<br /> And I heard him exclaim, as his reindeer were coursing,<br /> ""Merry Christmas to all! And consider outsourcing!""</p>

<p>1. In Los Angeles, Ani Saduki, 33, and his brother decided to remove a bees' nest from a shed on their property with the aid of a 'pineapple' (an illegal firecracker), which is the explosive equivalent of half a stick of dynamite. They ignited the fuse and retreated to watch from inside their home, behind a window just 3 m away from the hive. The concussion of the explosion shattered the window inwards, seriously lacerating Ani. Deciding Ani needed stitches, the two brothers headed off to a nearby hospital. While walking towards their car, Ani was stung three times by the surviving bees. Unbeknownst to either brother, Ani was allergic to bee venom and died of suffocation en route to the hospital.</p>
<p>2, Derrick L. Richards, 28, was charged in Minneapolis with third-degree murder for his involvement in the death of his beloved cousin Kenneth E. Richards. According to police, Derrick suggested a game of Russian roulette and put a semiautomatic pistol - instead of the more traditional revolver to Ken's head and fired.</p>
<p>3. In Phillipsburg, New Jersey, an unidentified 29-year-old male choked to death on sequined panties he had orally removed from an exotic dancer at a local establishment. 'I didn't think he was going to eat it,' the dancer identified only as Ginger said, adding, 'He was really drunk.'</p>
<p>4. In Moscow, a drunken security man asked a colleague at the bank they were guarding to stab his bulletproof vest to see if it would protect him against a knife attack. It didn't and the 25 year-old guard died of a heart wound. (It's good to see the Russians getting into the spirit of the Darwin Awards.)</p>
<p>5. In France, Jacques LeFevrier left nothing to chance when he decided to commit suicide. He stood at the top of a tall cliff and tied a noose around his neck. He tied the other end of the rope to a large rock. He drank some poison and set fire to his clothes. He even tried to shoot himself at the last moment. He jumped and fired the pistol. The bullet missed him completely and cut through the rope above him. Free of the threat of hanging, he plunged into the sea. The sudden dunking extinguished the flames and made him vomit the poison. He was dragged out of the water by a fisherman and was taken to hospital, where he died of hypothermia.</p>
<p>6. A Renton, Washington, man tried to commit a robbery. This was probably his first attempt, as he had no previous record of violent crime and made terminally stupid choices. The target was H. &amp; J. Leather &amp; Firearms - yes - a gun shop. The shop was full of customers in a state where a substantial portion of the adult population is licensed to carry concealed handguns in public places. To enter the shop, he had to step around a marked police patrol car parked at the front door. An officer in uniform was standing next to the counter having coffee before reporting for duty. Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a hold-up and fired a few wild shots. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, removing the robber from the gene pool. Several other customers also drew their guns, but didn't fire. No one else was hurt.</p>
<p>The winner<br /> The 1999 Darwin Award Winner is telephone relay company night watchman Edward Baker, 31, of Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. He was killed early Christmas morning by excessive microwave radiation exposure. He was apparently attempting to keep warm next to a telecommunications feed horn. Baker had been suspended on a safety violation once last year, according to Northern Manitoba Signal Relay spokesperson Tanya Cooke. She noted that Baker's earlier infraction was for defeating a safety shut-off switch and entering a restricted maintenance catwalk in order to stand in front of the microwave dish. He had told co-workers that it was the only way he could stay warm during his 12-hour shift at the station where winter temperatures often dip to 40 degrees below freezing. Microwaves can heat water molecules within human tissue in the same way they heat food in microwave ovens.</p>
<p>For his Christmas shift, Baker reputedly brought a 12-pack of beer and a plastic lawn chair, which he positioned directly in line with the strongest microwave beam. Baker had not been told about a 10-fold boost in microwave power planned that night to handle the anticipated increase in holiday long distance calling traffic. Baker's body was discovered by the daytime watchman, John Burns, who was greeted by an odor he mistook for a Christmas roast that he thought Baker must have prepared as a surprise. Burns also reported to company officials that Baker's unfinished beers had exploded.</p>

16452,"<p>Even if you think perfect pitch has something to do with baseball, you will enjoy these musical responses that young students wrote on real-life tests: </p>
<p>* Refrain means don't do it. A refrain in music is the part you better not try to sing. </p>
<p>* A virtuoso is a musician with real high morals. </p>
<p>* J.S. Bach died from 1750 to the present. </p>
<p>* Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English. He was rather large. </p>
<p>* Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was calling him. I guess he could not hear so good. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died from this. </p>
<p>* Caruso was at first an Italian. Then someone heard his voice and said he would go a long way. And so he came to America. </p>
<p>* A good orchestra is always ready to play if the conductor steps on the podium. </p>
<p>* Most authorities agree that music of antiquity was written long ago. </p>
<p>* Probably the most marvelous fugue was the one between the Hatfields and the McCoys. </p>
<p>* My very best-liked piece is the Bronze lullaby. </p>
<p>* A harp is a nude piano. </p>
<p>* My favorite composer is Opus. </p>
<p>* An opera is a song of a bigly size. </p>
<p>* Contralto is a low sort of music that only ladies sing. </p>
<p>* Agnus Dei was a woman composer famous for her church music. </p>
<p>* Music sung by two people at the same time is called a duel. </p>
<p>* I know what a sextet is, but I'd rather not say. </p>
<p>* Stradivarius sold his violins on the open market with no strings attached. </p>
<p>* Do you know that if Beethoven were alive today, he'd be celebrating the 170th anniversary of his death? </p>
<p>* Aaron Copland is one of our most famous contemporary composers. It is unusual to be contemporary. Most composers do not live until they are dead. </p>
<p>* In the last scene of Pagliacci, Canio stabs Nedda, who is the one he really loves. Pretty soon Silvio gets stabbed also, and they all live happily ever after. </p>
<p>* At one time, singers had to use musicians to accompany them. since synthesizers came along, singers can now play with themselves.</p>

What landed in the circle<br /> he kept and what landed outside the circle god kept.<br />         The second priest claimed that his method was almost the same,<br /> except that what landed outside the circle went to the priest and the<br /> money that landed inside the circle god kept.<br />         The rabbi said, ""I've got you both beat.

16458,"<p>A woman goes into a bar real depressed and uses her last 10 dollars to buy a drink. All of a sudden she gets an idea that she knows will solve her problems. </p>
<p>She takes her change and goes to the man at the end of the bar and says, "" Mister, I'm broke and my landlord said if I dont give him the rent money first thing in the morning, I'm out of a place to live. I'll bet you my last five dollars that i can come up with a rhyme that you can't come up with a reply to."" </p>
<p>The man wanting to help her says ok go ahead. </p>
<p>So she tells him, ""six times six is thirty-six and three is thirty-nine. I can tell the length of yours but you can't tell the depth of mine."" </p>
<p>The man scratches his head and says, ""your right, I can't top that."" and he pays her the five dollars. </p>
<p>Then she goes to the next man and the next until she has beat every man in the bar. So she goes to the next bar and starts betting 100 at a time. She does this at every bar on the block until she has 3,000 dollars. Deciding thats enough she heads for home. </p>
<p>On her way she meets a bum in an alley and decides to have a little fun. So she tells the bum that she will bet her 3,000 dollars against his bottle of booze that she can tell him a ryhme to wich he cant come up with a reply. The bum figures what the heck and says ""your on"" </p>
<p>Six times six is thirty-six and three is thirty-nine, I can tell the length of yours but you can't tell the depth of mine. </p>
<p>The bum sits back, thinks for a minute and says ""six times six is thirty-six and three is thirty-nine, I can piss in yours but you can't piss in mine!!""</p>

16462,"<p>There was once a Scotsman and an Englishman who lived next door to each other. The Scotsman owned a hen and each morning would look in his garden and pick up one of his hen's eggs for breakfast. One day he looked into his garden and saw that the hen had laid an egg in the Englishman's garden. He was about to go next door when he saw the Englishman pick up the egg. The Scotsman ran up to the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged to him because he owned the hen. The Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property. ""In my family,"" the Scotsman said, ""we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I knock you down and time how long it takes you to get back up. Then you kick me down and time how long it takes for me to get up. Whoever gets up quicker wins the egg."" The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman found his heaviest pair of boots kicked the Englishman as hard as he could and knocked him over. The Englishman fell to the floor and howled in agony for 30 minutes. Eventually the Englishman stood up and said, ""Now it's my turn to kick you.""The Scotsman said, ""No. You can keep the egg!""</p>

<p>They took their habits off, tied them together to make a rope, and climbed out the window.</p>
<p>After they were safely on the ground and out of the building, a news reporter came over to one of the nuns and said to her, ""Weren't you afraid that the habits could have ripped or broken since they are old?</p>

<p>The first guy says, ""Man, I don't think that our idea was so great! I was sitting on the couch watching TV and I dropped my cigarette on the couch. My wife said, 'Why don't you burn the whole house down?' That place is still smoldering.""</p>
<p>The second guy said, ""That ain't nothing. I was working on the car, and dropped my wrench and it nicked the fender. My wife said, 'Why don't you tear the whole car apart?' It took me all night.""</p>
<p>The third guy said, ""You guys don't have nothing on me. When I walked in the door, my wife was doing the dishes, and I felt a little romantic. I reached down, and grabbed her crotch, she said, 'Cut that out!'""</p>

16480,"<p>Preparation for parenthood is not just a matter of reading books and decorating the nursery. Here are 12 simple tests for expectant parents to take to prepare themselves for the real-life experience of being a mother or father.</p>
<p>1. Women: to prepare for maternity, put on a dressing gown and stick a beanbag down the front. Leave it there for 9 months. After 9 months, take  out 10% of the beans. Men: to prepare for paternity, go to the local drugstore, tip the contents of your wallet on the counter, and tell the pharmacist to help himself. Then go to the supermarket. Arrange to have your salary paid directly to their head office. Go home. Pick up the paper. Read it for the last time.</p>
<p>2. Before you finally go ahead and have children, find a couple who are already parents and berate them about their methods of discipline, lack of patience, appallingly low tolerance levels, and how they have allowed their children to run riot. Suggest ways in which they might improve their child's sleeping habits, toilet training, table manners and overall behavior. Enjoy it -- it'll be the last time in your life that you will have all the answers.</p>
<p>3. To discover how the nights will feel, walk around the living room from 5pm to 10pm carrying a wet bag weighing approximately 8-12 lbs. At 10pm put the bag down, set the alarm for midnight, and go to sleep. Get up at 12 and walk around the living room again, with the bag, till 1am. Put the alarm on for 3am. As you can't get back to sleep get up at 2am and make a drink. Go to bed at 2:45am. Get up again at 3am when the alarm goes off. Sing songs in the dark until 4am. Put the alarm on for 5am. Get up. Make breakfast. Keep this up for 5 years. Look cheerful.</p>
<p>4. Can you stand the mess children make? To find out, smear peanut butter onto the sofa and jam onto the curtains. Hide a fish finger behind the stereo and leave it there all summer. Stick your fingers in the flower beds then rub them on the clean walls. Cover the stains with crayons. How does that look?</p>
<p>5. Dressing small children is not as easy as it seems: first buy an octopus and a string bag. Attempt to put the octopus into the string bag so that none of the arms hang out. Time allowed for this: all morning.</p>
<p>6. Take an egg carton. Using a pair of scissors and a pot of paint turn it into an alligator. Now take a toilet tube. Using only scotch tape and a piece of foil, turn it into a Christmas cracker. Last, take a milk container, a ping pong ball, and an empty packet of Coco Pops and make an exact replica of the Eiffel Tower. Congratulations. You have just qualified for a place on the play group committee.</p>
<p>7. Forget the Miata and buy a Taurus. And don't think you can leave it out in the driveway spotless and shining. Family cars don't look like that. Buy a chocolate ice cream bar and put it in the glove compartment. Leave it there. Get a quarter. Stick it in the cassette player. Take a family-size packet of chocolate cookies. Mash them down the back seats. Run a garden rake along both sides of the car. There. Perfect.</p>
<p>8. Get ready to go out. Wait outside the toilet for half an hour. Go out the front door. Come in again. Go out. Come back in. Go out again. Walk down the front path. Walk back up it. Walk down it again. Walk very slowly down the road for 5 minutes. Stop to inspect minutely every cigarette end, piece of used chewing gum, dirty tissue and dead insect along the way. Retrace your steps. Scream that you've had as much as you can stand, until the neighbors come out and stare at you. Give up and go back into the house. You are now just about ready to try taking a small child for a walk.</p>
<p>9. Always repeat everything you say at least five times.</p>
<p>10. Go to your local supermarket. Take with you the nearest thing you can find to a pre-school child -- a fully grown goat is excellent. If you intend to have more than one child, take more than one goat. Buy your week's groceries without letting the goats out of your sight. Pay for everything the goats eat or destroy. Until you can easily accomplish this do not even contemplate having children.</p>
<p>11. Hollow out a melon. Make a small hole in the side. Suspend it from the ceiling and swing it from side to side. Now get a bowl of soggy Weetabix and attempt to spoon it into the swaying melon by pretending to be an airplane. Continue until half the Weetabix is gone. Tip the rest into your lap, making sure that a lot of it falls on the floor. You are now ready to feed a 12-month-old baby.</p>
<p>12. Learn the names of every character from Postman Pat, Fireman Sam and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. When you find yourself singing ""Postman Pat"" at work, you finally qualify as a parent.</p>

16482,"<p>Three British educational institutions were commissioned by the government to discover why the human penis is the shaped the way it is. Oxford University allocated a budget of �500,000 for research. After 2 years they concluded that the reason the head of the penis is wider than the shaft is that it fits better, when in situ, so to speak. This would prevent leakage of semen and increase the probability of successful fertilisation. </p>
<p>Cambridge University spent �750,000 on a research programme that lasted years. The results showed that the penis widened near the tip because it maximised the number of nerve endings stimulated during sex. This would lead to increased sensitivity and a better chance of impregnation. </p>
<p>Finally, the Open University spent �2.50 on a copy of Playboy and 10 minutes in the staff toilet, only to discover that the penis widens at the tip in order to prevent your hand from slipping off the end.</p>

16486,"<p>Yes, I'm tired. For several years I've been blaming it on<br /> iron-poor blood, lack of vitamins, air pollution, water<br /> pollution, saccharin, obesity, dieting, yellow wax build-up, and<br /> a dozen other maladies that make you wonder if life is really<br /> worth living.</p>
<p>But now I find out, tain't that. I'm tired because I'm<br /> overworked.</p>
<p>The population of this country is 200 million. Eighty-four<br /> million are retired. That leaves 116 million to do the work.<br /> There are 75 million in school, which leaves 41 million to do<br /> the work. Of this total, there are 22 million employed by the<br /> government. That leaves 19 million to do the work. Four million<br /> are in the Armed Forces, which leaves 15 million to do the work.<br /> Take from that total the 14,800,000 people who work for State<br /> and City Government and that leaves 200,000 to do the work.<br /> There are 188,000 in hospitals, so that leaves 12,000 to do the<br /> work.</p>
<p>Now there are 11,998 people in prisons. That leaves just two<br /> people to do the work. You and me. And you're sitting there<br /> reading this. No wonder I'm tired.</p>

16510,"<p>An Army Ranger was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana and he wanted a pair<br /> of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the<br /> high prices the local vendors were asking.<br /> After becoming very frustrated with the ""no haggle"" attitude of one of the<br /> shopkeepers, the Ranger shouted, ""maybe I'll just go out and get my own<br /> alligator so I can get a pair of shoes made at a reasonable price!""<br /> The vendor said, ""By all means, be my guest. Maybe you will run into a couple<br /> of Marines who were in here earlier saying the same thing.""<br /> So the Ranger headed into the bayou that same day and a few hours later came<br /> upon two men standing waist deep in the water. He thought, ""those must be the<br /> two Marines the guy in town was talking about."" Just then, the Ranger saw a<br /> tremendously long gator swimming rapidly underwater towards one of the Marines.<br /> Just as the gator was about to attack, the Marine grabbed its neck with both<br /> hands and strangled it to death with very little effort. Then both Marines<br /> dragged it on shore and flipped it on its back. Laying nearby were several more<br /> of the creatures.<br /> One of the Marines then exclaimed, ""Damn, this one doesn't have any shoes<br /> either!""</p>

16534,"<p>There once was a brother and a sister, fraternal twins, who were approaching their high school graduation. It was getting near prom night and neither of them had a date for it. So one day, the girl approaches her brother and says ""Hey, you got a date for the prom yet?""</p>
<p>He says ""No, why? You got someone lined up for me?"" ""You might say that. Why don't you take me to the prom?""</p>
<p>""Take you? You kidding? You're my sister!"" ""Well, are you taking somebody else out?""</p>
<p>""You know I don't have a date, Sis. "" ""And neither do I. But we both want to go to the prom, don't we?"" Her brother nods. She continues, ""So we should go with each other.""</p>
<p>The brother can't see anything wrong with her reasoning, so he tells his sister that if neither of them has a date by Wednesday evening he will take her to the prom. Wednesday evening rolls around. Neither of the siblings has a date, so the brother tells his sister that he'll take her to the prom on Friday.</p>
<p>At the prom, both of them have a good time. The brother is glad that his sister talked him into taking her. Then, while he's standing at the punch bowl, his sister comes up to him again.</p>
<p>""Hey, brother, let's dance. ""</p>
<p>He looks around to make sure that nobody heard her. ""Look, Sis, this is the Senior Prom, okay? I'm not going to dance with my own sister at the prom, okay?""</p>
<p>""Don't be so shy. Look, Jimmy Elder is dancing with his cousin. So why can't you dance with your sister?""</p>
<p>""Oh .  .  .  all right. ""</p>
<p>So they dance, a slow number. The rest of the prom passes by and after a while it's over and time to go. Both of them have had a good time.</p>
<p>In the car, with the brother at the wheel, the sister looks over at him and says, ""Let's not go straight home.""</p>
<p>He gives her a curious look and says, ""What are we going to do instead?""</p>
<p>""Oh, I don't know. Just drive around.""</p>
<p>He agrees, and after they have driven around a while, out in the country, she looks over at him again and says ""Want to find some place to park?""</p>
<p>""Hell,"" he says, ""are you crazy? You're my sister, I'm not going parking with you!""</p>
<p>""Who said anything about 'going parking'? Let's just pull over somewhere and talk for a while, okay? It's been a busy year for both of us-- how long has it been since we've had a chance to talk to each other?""</p>
<p>So she finally talks her brother into pulling the car over on a secluded back road, and after a few minutes of idle talk, she looks over at him again.</p>
<p>""Hey .  .  .  "" she says.</p>
<p>""What?""</p>
<p>""Why don't you kiss me?""</p>
<p>""You've been suggesting a lot of weird things lately, you know that?  I'm not going to kiss you, you're my sister! ""And he reached for the ignition switch to start the car.</p>
<p>She reached out and took his hand. ""I know I'm your sister. You've mentioned that a lot lately. And you're my brother. And don't we love each other? Why shouldn't we kiss if we feel like it?"" She kissed him on the cheek and he kissed her back. After a few minutes of kissing, she whispered in his ear, ""Come on. Let's do it.""</p>
<p>""Do what,"" said her brother, but he had a good idea of what his sister had in mind.</p>
<p>""You know what,"" his sister replied.</p>
<p>""I can't do that with you, you're my.  .  .  "" His voice trailed off.</p>
<p>While he was on top of her, his sister murmured, ""You know, you're a lot lighter than Dad.""</p>

16561,"<p>1. Breaking up would be a lot easier. A smack on the arse and a 'cheers for the sex  would pretty much do it.2. Birth control would come in ale or lager.3. Valentine's Day would be moved to 29th February so it would only occur in leap years.4. On Mothers Day, you'd get the day off to go drinking.5. The only show opposite 'Monday Night Football' would be 'Monday Night Football from a Different Camera Angle.'6. Instead of 'beer-belly,' you'd get 'beer-biceps.'7. Tanks would be far easier to rent.8. Every woman that worked would have to do so topless.9. When the Police pull you over, every smart-aleck answer you responded with would actually reduce your fine. Example - Cop: 'You know how fast you were going?' You: 'All I know is, I was spilling my beer all over the place.' Cop: Nice one, that's $20 off.'10. Daisy Duke shorts would never go out of style again.11. Every man would get four, real 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards per year.12. Telephones would cut off after 30 seconds of conversation.13. When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during the game, she'd appear in a little box in the corner of the screen when the ball goes out of play.14. Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed as an acceptable response to 'I love you.'15. The funniest guy in the office would get to be the CEO.16. 'Sorry, but I got wasted last night,' would be an acceptable excuse for absence and/or poor time keeping.17. Lifeguards could remove people from beaches for violating the public ugliness ordinance.18. Hallmark would make 'Sorry, what was your name again?' cards.19. Lager would have the same effect as Viagra.20. 'Fancy a shag' would be the only chat up line in existence and it would work every time.21. Everyone would drive at least 70mph and anyone driving under that would be fined.22. Dinner break would happen every hour and the boss would hire in strippers and $2000 a night hookers for the duration of those breaks.23. Saying 'Let's have a threesome. You, me and your sister' to your wife/girlfriend would get the response, 'What a great idea!'24. Harrier jump jets would take you to and from work.25. Everyone would have real a Light Sabre and any disagreements would be settled by a fight to the death.26. Vomiting after 20 pints would actually make you more attractive to the opposite sex.27. Along with your milk in the morning, the milkman would deliver two Swedish milk maids.28. When it was time to leave work, a whistle would sound and you'd get to slide down the back of a Brontosaurus just like Fred Flintstone29. ""Yes"" would be an acceptable answer to a woman's question of ""Does my bum look big in this?""</p>

16563,"<p>There were three country churches in a small Texas town: Presbyterian, Methodist and Catholic. </p>
<p>Each church was overrun with pesky squirrels. One day, the Presbyterian<br /> church called a meeting to decide what to do about the squirrels. </p>
<p>After much prayer and consideration they determined that the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.</p>
<p>The Methodist group got together and decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creations. </p>
<p>So, they humanely trapped the squirrels and set them free a few miles outside of town. Three days later, the squirrels were back.</p>
<p>It was only the Catholics who were able to come up with the best and most effective solution: </p>
<p>They baptized the squirrels and registered them as members of the church. Now they see them only on Christmas and Easter.</p>

""We'll always be together."" A man can be happy with any woman as long as he doesn't love her. A man in the house is worth two in the street. A man is only a man, but a good bicycle is a ride. A woman never forgets the men she could have had; a man, the women he couldn't. Abstain from wine, women, and song; mostly song. All the good ones are taken. Beauty is skin deep; ugly goes right to the bone. Before you find your handsome prince, you've got to kiss a lot of frogs. Brains x Beauty x Availability = Constant Do it only with the best. Don't do it if you can't keep it up. Every kind action has a not-so-kind reaction. Fornication: Term used by people who don't have anybody to screw with. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. If the effort that went in research on the female bosom had gone into our space program, we would now be running hot-dog stands on the moon. If the person isn't taken, there's a reason (corollary to the above law). If you can't stand his mother and he can't stand yours, then you're bound to get  married. If you get them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow. If you meet somebody who tells you that he loves you more than anybody in the  whole wide world, don't trust him; it means he experiments. It is always the wrong time of month. It is better to be looked over than overlooked. It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. It was not the apple on the tree but the pair on the ground that caused the  trouble in the garden. Love comes in spurts. Love is a hole in the heart. Love is a matter of chemistry, sex is a matter of physics. Love is the delusion that one man or woman differs from another. Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. Love thy neighbor, but don't get caught. Money can't buy love, but it sure gets you a great bargaining position. Never argue with a women when she's tired, or rested. Never go to bed mad, stay up and fight. Never lie down with a woman who's got more troubles than you. Never say no. Never sleep with anyone crazier than yourself. Nice guys finish last. No matter how many times you've had it, if it's offered take it, because it'll never be quite the same again. No sex with anyone in the same office. Nobody is ugly after 2 A.M. Nothing improves with age. One good turn gets most of the blankets. People to whom you are attracted invariably think you remind them of someone else. Sex appeal is 50% what you've got and 50% what people think you've got. Sex discriminates against the shy and the ugly. Sex has no calories. Sex is a three-letter word which needs some old-fashioned four-letter words to convey its full meaning. Sex is dirty only if it's done right. Sex is hereditary. If your parents never had it, chances are you won't either. Sex is like snow; you never know how many inches you are going to get or how  long it is going to last. Sex is one of the nine reasons for reincarnation; the other eight are  unimportant. Sex takes up the least amount of time and causes the most amount of trouble. Sow your wild oats on Saturday night; then on Sunday, pray for crop failure. The amount of love someone feels for you is inversely proportional to how much  you love them. The best things in the world are free, and worth every penny of it. The best way to hold a man is in your arms. The game of love is never called off on account of darkness. The love letter you finally got the courage to send will be delayed in the mail long enough for you to make a fool of yourself in person. The more beautiful the woman is who loves you, the easier it is to leave her  with no hard feelings. The nicer someone is, the farther away (s)he is from you. The qualities that most attract a woman to a man are usually the same ones she can't stand years later. The younger the better. There is no difference between a wise man and a fool when they fall in love. There is no remedy for sex but more sex. There may be some things better than sex, and some things worse than sex. But there is nothing exactly like it. Thou shalt not commit adultery, unless in the mood. Virginity can be cured. What matters is not the length of the wand, but the magic in the stick. When a man's wife learns to understand him, she usually stops listening to him, and vice versa... When the lights are out, all women are beautiful. You cannot produce a baby in one month by impregnating nine women. You will always fall in love and marry someone with the opposite body temperature. and Murphy's number one law on love and sex: Don't fuck with Mrs. Murphy!!!!</p>

<p>The angel tells them, ""As a reward for being so patient through a hundred blazing summers and dismal winters, you have been given life for thirty minutes to do what you've wished to do the most.""</p>
<p>He looks at her, she looks at him, and they go running behind the shrubbery. The angel waits patiently as the bushes rustle and giggling ensues. After fifteen minutes, the two return, out of breath and laughing.</p>
<p>The angel tells them, ""Um, you have fifteen minutes left. Would you care to do it again?"" He asks her, ""Shall we?"" She eagerly replies, ""Oh, yes, let's! But let's change positions. This time I hold the pigeon down and you crap on its head!""</p>

16613,"<p>Once upon a time, there was a non-conforming sparrow who decided not to fly south for the winter.</p>
<p>However, soon the weather turned so cold that he reluctantly started to fly south. In a short time, ice began to form on his wings and he fell to earth in a barnyard, almost frozen.</p>
<p>A cow passed by and crapped on the little sparrow. The sparrow thought it was the end.  But, the manure warmed him and defrosted his wings. Warm and happy, able to breathe, he started to sing. Just then a large cat came by and, hearing the chirping, investigated the sounds.<br /> The cat cleared away the manure, found the chirping bird and promptly ate him.</p>
<p>The moral of the story:</p>
<p>1.  Everyone who craps on you is not necessarily your enemy.</p>
<p>2.  Everyone who gets you out of the crap is not necessarily your  friend.</p>
<p>3.  And, if you're warm and happy in a pile of crap, keep your mouth shut.</p>

The husband was sitting in the bathroom on the edge of the bathtub saying to himself, ""Now how can I tell my wife that I've got really smelly feet and that my socks absolutely stink? I've managed to keep it from her while we were dating, but she's bound to find out sooner or later that my feet stink. Now how do I tell her?""</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the wife was sitting in the bed saying to herself, ""Now how do I tell my husband that I've got really bad breath? I've been very lucky to keep it from him while we were courting, but as soon as he's lived with me for a week, he's bound to find out. Now how do I tell him gently?""</p>
<p>The husband finally plucks up enough courage to tell his wife and so he walks into the bedroom. He walks over to the bed, climbs over to his wife, puts his arm around her neck, moves his face very close to hers and says, ""Darling, I've a confession to make.""<br /> And she says, ""So have I, love.""<br /> To which he replies, ""Don't tell me, you've eaten my socks!""</p>

16654,"<p>Well, Mr. and Mrs. Potato had eyes for each other, and finally<br /> they</p>
<p>got</p>
<p> married, and had a little sweet potato, whom they called 'Yam'.<br /> Of</p>
<p>course,</p>
<p> they wanted the best for Yam. When it was time, they told her<br /> about</p>
<p>the</p>
<p> facts</p>
<p> of life.</p>
<p> They warned her about going out and getting half-baked, so she</p>
<p>wouldn't</p>
<p> get</p>
<p> accidentally mashed, and get a bad name for herself like 'Hot<br /> Potato',</p>
<p>and</p>
<p> end up with a bunch of Tater Tots.</p>
<p> Yam said not to worry, no Spud would get her into the sack and<br /> make a</p>
<p> rotten</p>
<p> potato out of her! But on the other hand she wouldn't stay home<br /> and</p>
<p>become</p>
<p> a</p>
<p> Couch Potato, either. She would get plenty of exercise so as<br /> not to be</p>
<p> skinny</p>
<p> like her Shoestring cousins.</p>
<p> When she went off to Europe, Mr. and Mrs. Potato told Yam to<br /> watch out</p>
<p>for</p>
<p> the Hard Boiled guys from Ireland. And the greasy guys from<br /> France</p>
<p>called</p>
<p> the</p>
<p> French Fries. And when she went out west, to watch out for the<br /> Indians</p>
<p>so</p>
<p> she</p>
<p> wouldn't get scalloped.</p>
<p> Yam said she would stay on the straight and narrow and wouldn't</p>
<p>associate</p>
<p> with those high class Yukon Golds. Mr. and Mrs. Potato sent Yam<br /> to</p>
<p>Idaho</p>
<p> P.U.</p>
<p> (that's Potato University) so that when she graduated she'd<br /> really be</p>
<p>in</p>
<p> the</p>
<p> Chips.</p>
<p> But in spite of all they did for her, one-day Yam came home and</p>
<p>announced</p>
<p> she</p>
<p> was going to marry Tom Brokaw. Tom Brokaw! Mr. and Mrs. Potato<br /> were</p>
<p>very</p>
<p> upset. They told Yam she couldn't possibly marry Tom Brokaw<br /> because</p>
<p>he's</p>
<p> just</p>

<p> Are you sure?</p>

16694,"<p>CAT MIRACLE DIET: Most diets fail because we are still thinking and eating like people. For those us who have never had any success dieting. Well now there is the new Miracle Cat Diet!</p>
<p>Except for cats that eat like people -- such as getting lots of table scraps -- most cats are long and lean (or tiny and petite). the Cat Miracle Diet will help you achieve the same lean, svelte figure. Just follow this diet for one week and you'll find that you not only look and feel better, but you will have a whole new outlook on what con- stitutes food. Good Luck!</p>
<p>DAY ONE Breakfast:  Open can of expensive gourmet cat food. Any flavor as long as it cost more than .75 per can -- and place 1/4 cup on your plate. Eat 1 bite of food; look around room disdainfully. Knock the rest on the floor. Stare at the wall for awhile before stalking off into the other room.</p>
<p>Lunch:  Four blades of grass and one lizard tail. Throw it back up on the cleanest carpet in your house.</p>
<p>Dinner:  Catch a moth and play with it until it is almost dead. Eat one wing. Leave the rest to die.</p>
<p>Bedtime snack:  Steal one green bean from your spouse's or partner's plate. Bat it around the floor until it goes under the refrigerator. Steal one small piece of chicken and eat half of it. Leave the other half on the sofa. Throw out the remaining gourmet cat food from the can you opened this morning.</p>
<p>DAY TWO Breakfast:  Picking up the remaining chicken bite from the sofa. Knock it onto the carpet and bat it under the television set. Chew on the corner of the newspaper as your spouse/partner tries to read it.</p>
<p>Lunch:  Break into the fresh French bread that you bought as your part of the dinner party on Saturday. Lick the top of it all over. Take one bite out of the middle of the loaf.</p>
<p>Afternoon snack:  Catch a large beetle and bring it into the house. Play toss and catch with it until it is mushy and half dead. Allow it to escape under the bed.</p>
<p>Dinner:  Open a fresh can of dark-colored gourmet cat food -- tuna or beef works well. Eat it voraciously. Walk from your kitchen to the edge of the living room rug. Promptly throw up on the rug. Step into it as you leave. Track footprints across the entire room.</p>
<p>DAY THREE Breakfast:  Drink part of the milk from your spouse's or partner's cereal bowl when no one is looking. Splatter part of it on the closest polished aluminum appliance you can find.</p>
<p>Lunch:  Catch a small bird and bring it into the house. Play with on top of your down filled comforter. Make sure the bird is seriously injured but not dead before you abandon it for someone else to have to deal with.</p>
<p>Dinner:  Beg and cry until you are given some ice cream or milk in a bowl of your own. Take three licks/laps and then turn the bowl over on the floor.</p>
<p>FINAL DAY Breakfast:  Eat 6 bugs, any type, being sure to leave a collection of legs, wings, antennae on the bathroom floor. Drink lots of water. Throw the bugs and all of the water up on your spouse's or partner's pillow.</p>
<p>Lunch:  Remove the chicken skin from last night's chicken-to-go leftovers your spouse or partner placed in the trash can. Drag the skin across the floor several times. Chew it in a corner and then abandon.</p>
<p>Dinner:  Open another can of expensive gourmet cat food. Select a flavor that is especially runny, like Chicken and Giblets in Gravy. Lick off all the gravy and leave the actual meat to dry and get hard.</p>

16695,"<p>Adam was roaming around the Garden of Eden making up names<br /> for all the animals that were there.  He also noticed that<br /> there were two kinds of each species - male and female.<br /> And he also noticed that most of the animals were mating<br /> and seemed to be enjoying this very act.  So, he went to<br /> his special place and called out in a loud voice, ""Hey, God!"".<br /> And a loud booming voice replied, ""Yes, Adam"". </p>
<dl>
<dt>Adam:</dt>
<dd>""Hey, God - There's an awful lot of animals down here."" </dd>
<dt>God: </dt>
<dd>""Yes, Adam - I have created many species and I trust<br />       you have not run out of names for then."" </dd>
<dt>Adam:</dt>
<dd> ""No, that's not the problem.  But, I have noticed<br />       that there are two kinds of each species."" </dd>
<dt>God: </dt>
<dd> ""Yes, Adam.  One kind is male and the other is female."" </dd>
<dt>Adam: </dt>
<dd>""Hey, God - why is there a male and a female of each<br />        species ?"" </dd>
<dt>God: </dt>
<dd> ""So they can mate and procreate.  This will ensure<br />        the continuation of the species."" </dd>
<dt>Adam:</dt>
<dd> ""Hey, God."" </dd>
<dt>God: </dt>
<dd> (sigh) ""Yes, Adam."" </dd>
<dt>Adam: </dt>
<dd>""Which am I?"" </dd>
<dt>God:  </dt>
<dd>""You, Adam, are a male."" </dd>
<dt>Adam: </dt>
<dd>""Hey, God, I've noticed that most of the animals are<br />        mating --- and they seem to be really enjoying<br />        themselves.  If it isn't too much trouble, do you<br />        think...maybe,....I could..."" </dd>
<dt>God: </dt>
<dd> ""All right, Adam.  The time has come for me to<br />        provide you with a mate.  Go lie down and when you<br />        have fallen asleep, I will create your mate."" </dd>
</dl>
<p> So, Adam leaves his special place, finds a patch of soft<br /> grass under a tree, lies down, and falls asleep.   Some<br /> time later he awakes (possibly due to a slight pain in his<br /> side) and heads immediately to his special place.<br />

<dd>""Hey, God."" </dd>
<dt>God: </dt>
<dd> ""Yes, Adam."" </dd>
<dt>Adam:</dt>
<dd> ""Hey, God - did you remember to do what you promised ?"" </dd>
<dt>God: </dt>
<dd> ""Yes, Adam.  While you were sleeping I created for<br />        you a mate.  Her name is Eve.  You will find her in<br />        the bushes near the place where you were sleeping."" </dd>
</dl>
<p> Adam rushes off to find Eve in the bushes.  A few minutes<br /> later he is back at his special place, calling ...<br />

16701,"<p>HER DIARY: </p>
<p>Sunday night I thought he was acting weird. We had made plans to meet at a bar to have a drink. I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment. Conversation wasn't flowing so I suggested that we gosomewhere quiet so we could talk, he agreed but he kept quiet and aloof. I asked him what was wrong -- he said, ""Nothing."" I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He said it had nothing to do with me and not to worry. On the way home I told him that I loved him, he simply smiled and kept driving. I can't explain his behavior; I don't know why he didn't say, ""I love you, too."" When we got home I felt as if I had lost him, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. He just sat there and watched TV; he seemed distant and vacant. Finally I decided to go to bed. About 10 minutes later he came to bed and to my surprise he responded to my caress and we made love, but I still felt that his thoughts were somewhere else. I decided that I could not take it anymore, so I decided to confront him with the situation but he had fallen asleep. I started crying and cried, until I also fell asleep. I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else. My life is a disaster.</p>

16716,"<p>A New Zealander, a sheep and a dog were survivors of a terrible shipwreck. They found themselves stranded on a desert island and after being there for a while they got into the habit of going to the beach every evening to watch the sun go down.One particular evening, the sky was red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze was warm and gentle; a perfect night for romance. As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the Kiwi.Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. But the dog got jealous, growling fiercely until the Kiwi took his arm from around the sheep. After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling.A few weeks passed by and lo, and behold, there was another shipwreck. The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the Kiwi had ever seen. She was in a pretty bad way when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health.When the young maiden was well enough, they introduced her to their evening beach ritual.It was another beautiful evening: red cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze; perfect for a night of romance.Pretty soon the New Zealander started to get 'those feelings' again. He fought them as long as he could, but he finally gave in and leaned over to the young woman, cautiously, and whispered in her ear...'Would you mind taking the dog for a walk?'</p>

"
16728,"<p>Take notes, all you Casanovas...<br /> 1) NOT KISSING FIRST. Avoiding her lips and diving straight for the erogenous zones makes her feel like you're paying by the hour and trying to get your money's worth by cutting out nonessentials. A properly passionate kiss is the ultimate form of foreplay. </p>
<p>2) BLOWING TOO HARD IN HER EAR. Admit it, some kid at school told you girls love this. Well, there's a difference between being erotic and blowing as if you're trying to extinguish the candles on your 50th birthday cake. That hurts. </p>
<p>3) NOT SHAVING. You often forget you have a porcupine strapped to your chin which you rake repeatedly across your partner's face and thighs. When she turns her head from side to side, it's not passion, it's avoidance. </p>
<p>4) SQUEEZING HER BREAST. Most men act like a housewife testing a melon for ripeness when they get their hands on a pair. Stroke, caress, and smooth them. </p>
<p>5) BITING HER NIPPLES. Why do men fasten onto a woman's nipples, then clamp down like they're trying to deflate her body via her breasts? Nipples are highly sensitive. They can't stand up to chewing. Lick and suck them gently. Flicking your tongue across them is good. Pretending they're a doggie toy isn't. </p>
<p>6) TWIDDLING HER NIPPLES. Stop doing that thing where you twiddle the nipples between finger and thumb like you're trying to find a radio station in a hilly area. Focus on the whole breasts, not just the exclamation points. </p>
<p>7) IGNORING THE OTHER PARTS OF HER BODY. A woman is not a highway with just three turnoffs: Breastville East and West, and the Midtown Tunnel. There are vast areas of her body which you've ignored far too often as you go bombing straight into downtown Vagina. So start paying them some attention. </p>
<p>8) GETTING THE HAND TRAPPED. Poor manual dexterity in the underskirt region can result in tangled fingers and underpants. If you're going to be that aggressive, just ask her to take the damn things off. </p>
<p>9) LEAVING HER A LITTLE PRESENT. Condom disposal is the man's responsibility. You wore it, you store it. </p>
<p>10) ATTACKING THE CLITORIS. Direct pressure is very unpleasant, so gently rotate your fingers along side of the clitoris. </p>
<p>11) STOPPING FOR A BREAK. Women, unlike men, don't pick up where they left off. If you stop, they plummet back to square one very fast. If you can tell she's not there, keep going at all costs, numb jaw or not. </p>
<p>12) UNDRESSING HER AWKWARDLY. Women hate looking stupid, but stupid she will look when naked at the waist with a sweater stuck over her head. Unwrap her like an elegant present, not a kid's toy. </p>
<p>13) GIVING HER A WEDGIE DURING FOREPLAY. Stroking her gently through her panties can be very sexy. Pulling the material up between her thighs and yanking it back and forth is not. </p>
<p>14) BEING OBSESSED WITH THE VAGINA. Although most men can find the clitoris without maps, they still believe that the vagina is where it's all at. No sooner is your hand down there than you're trying to stuff stolen banknotes up a chimney. This is okay in principle, but if you're not careful, it can hurt - so don't get carried away. It's best to pay more attention to her clitoris and the exterior of her vagina at first, then gently slip a finger inside her and see if she likes it. </p>
<p>15) MASSAGING TOO ROUGHLY. You're attempting to give her a sensual, relaxing massage to get her in the mood. Hands and fingertips are okay; elbows and knees are not. </p>
<p>16) UNDRESSING PREMATURELY. Don't force the issue by stripping before she's at least made some move toward getting your stuff off, even if it's just undoing a couple of buttons. </p>
<p>17) TAKING YOUR PANTS OFF FIRST. A man in socks and underpants is the worst. Lose the socks fist. </p>
<p>18) GOING TOO FAST. When you get to the penis-in-vagina situation, the worst thing you can do is pump away like an industrial power tool - she'll soon feel like an assembly-line worker made obsolete by your technology. Build up slowly, with clean, straight, regular thrusts. </p>
<p>19) GOING TOO HARD. If you bash your great triangular hip bones into her thigh or stomach, the pain is equal to two weeks of horseback riding concentrated into a few seconds. </p>
<p>20) COMING TOO SOON. Every man's fear. With reason. If you shoot before you see the whites of her eyes, make sure you have a backup plan to ensure her pleasure too. </p>
<p>21) NOT COMING SOON ENOUGH. It may appear to you that humping for an hour without climaxing is the mark of a sex god, but to her it's more likely the mark of a numb vagina. At least buy some intriguing wall hangings, so she has something to hold her interest while you're playing Marathon Man. </p>
<p>22) ASKING IF SHE HAS COME. You really ought to be able to tell. Most women make noise. But if you really don't know, don't ask. </p>
<p>23) PERFORMING ORAL SEX TOO GENTLY. Don't act like a giant cat at a saucer of milk. Get your whole mouth down there, and concentrate on gently rotating or flicking your tongue on her clitoris. </p>
<p>24) NUDGING HER HEAD DOWN. Men persist in doing this until she's eyeball-to-penis, hoping that it will lead very swiftly to mouth-to-penis. All women hate this. It's about three steps from being dragged to a cave by their hair. If you want her to use her mouth, use yours; try talking seductively to her. </p>
<p>25) NOT WARNING HER BEFORE YOU CLIMAX. Sperm tastes like sea water mixed with egg white. Not everybody likes it. When she's performing oral sex, warn her before you come so she can do what's necessary. </p>
<p>26) MOVING AROUND DURING FELLATIO. Don't thrust. She'll do all the moving during fellatio. You just lie there. And don't grab her head. </p>
<p>27) TAKING ETTIQUETTE ADVISE FROM PORN MOVIES. In X-rated movies, women seem to love it when men ejaculate over them. In real life, it just means more laundry to do. </p>
<p>28) MAKING HER RIDE ON TOP FOR AGES. Asking her to be on top is fine. Lying there grunting while she does all the hard work is not. Caress her gently, so that she doesn't feel quite so much like the captain of a schooner. And let her have a rest. </p>
<p>29) ATTEMPTING ANAL SEX AND PRETENDING IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. This is how men earn a reputation for not being able to follow directions. If you want to put it there, ask her first. And don't think that being drunk is an excuse. </p>
<p>30) TAKING PICTURES. When a man says, ""Can I take a photo of you?"" she'll hear the words ""__to show my buddies."" At least let her have custody of them. </p>
<p>31) NOT BEING IMAGINATIVE ENOUGH. Imagination is anything from drawing patterns on her back to pouring honey on her and licking it off. Fruit, vegetables, ice and feathers are all handy props; hot candle wax and permanent dye are a no no. </p>
<p>32) SLAPPING YOUR STOMACH AGAINT HERS. There is no less erotic noise. It's as sexy as a belching contest. </p>
<p>33) ARANGING HER IN STUPID POSES. If she wants to do advanced yoga in bed, fine, but unless she's a Romanian gymnast, don't get too ambitious. Ask yourself if you want a sexual partner with snapped hamstrings. </p>
<p>34) LOOKING FOR HER PROSTATE. Read this carefully: Anal stimulation feels good for men because they have a prostate. Women don't. </p>
<p>35) GIVING LOVE BITES. It is highly erotic to exert some gentle suction on the sides of the neck, if you do it carefully. No woman wants to have to wear turtlenecks and jaunty scarves for weeks on end. </p>
<p>36) BARKING INSTRUCTIONS. Don't shout encouragement like a coach with a megaphone. It's not a big turn-on. </p>
<p>37) TALKING DIRTY. It makes you sound like a lonely magazine editor calling a 1-900 line. If she likes nasty talk, she'll let you know. </p>
<p>38) NOT CARING WHETHER SHE COMES. You have to finish the job. Keep on trying until you get it right, and she might even do the same for you. </p>
<p>39) SQUASHING HER. Men generally weigh more than women, so if you lie on her a bit too heavily, she will turn blue. </p>
<p>40) THANKING HER. Never thank a woman for having sex with you. Your bedroom is not a soup kitchen.</p>

16732,"<p>The U.S. warned Iran today that it is in danger of being dropped from the three-nation ""Axis of Evil"" after a lackluster 2002 in which the purportedly evil country was largely missing in action.</p>
<p>""When it comes to remaining in the A.O.E., Iran is just hanging by a thread,"" one State Department source said today. </p>
<p>While North Korea and Iraq were both front and center in 2002 with their headline-grabbing evildoing, Iran for the most part stayed on the sidelines, jeopardizing its evil status, the source said. </p>
<p>Remaining in the Axis of Evil is a high priority for Iran, since membership in the A.O.E. results in billions of dollars of free publicity and news coverage every year.</p>
<p>Partly for this reason, the head of Iran�s Ministry of Evil in Tehran today disputed the State Department�s assessment of its less-than-evil performance, arguing that his nation had done many evil things in 2002. </p>
<p>Evil Minister Farid Mesghali said that Iran�s links to terrorist groups, as well as its firing up of its nuclear facility in southern Bushehr, had gone largely unnoticed and were overshadowed by such stories as the Trent Lott controversy and the Winona Ryder shoplifting trial.</p>
<p>""We were really, really evil last year,"" Mr. Mesghali said. ""We just need to do a better job of getting the word out.""</p>
<p>But time may be running out for Iran, who faces expulsion from the A.O.E. if they do not ""strut their stuff, evil-wise, pretty darn soon,"" the State Department source said.</p>
<p>""Without evil, Iran�s got no juice at all,"" the source said. ""They might as well be Belgium.""</p>

<p>Espero haber acertado con el modelo, la se�orita que me atendi� me dijo que eran la �ltima moda y me ense�� las suyas, que eran iguales. Entonces yo para ver si eran ligeras, me las puse ah� mismo. No sabes c�mo se ri� la se�orita, porque estos modelos femeninos en los hombres quedan muy graciosos y m�s a m�, que ya sabes que tengo unos rasgos muy alargados.  </p>

Si te quedan muy chicas av�same, que si no te van a dejar marcas cuando te las quites para ir a la calle y todo el mundo va a notar que las usas. Ll�valas con cuidado no vayas a romperlas y sobre todo, no vayas a dej�rtelas por ah� y las pierdas, que tienes la costumbre de llevarlas en la mano para que todos vean tus encantos.  </p>
<p>En fin, para qu� te voy a encargar nada m�s; s�lo te digo que estoy deseando v�rtelas puestas.</p>

16777,"<p>NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCETo the citizens of the United States of America,In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of yourindependence, effective today.Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections.Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will becirculated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary.Then look up ""aluminum"". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look ""vocabulary"". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"".2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.It really isn't that hard.4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.5. You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.6. You should stop playing American ""football"". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. ""Merde"" is French for ""sh!t"".8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a newnational holiday, but only in England. It will be called ""Indecisive Day"".9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

The worst part of spending time on Dagobah is the dadgum skeeters. Wookies are offended by your B.O.

You've ever used Jedi mind control to talk your way out of a speeding ticket or DUI. You've ever strangled someone with the force because they laughed at your accent. You built an outhouse over the Sarlaac. You've ever argued with a Jawa over scavenging rights to a broken droid. A Wookie has ever told you that you need to shave.

16789,"<p>A butcher is working, and really busy. He notices a dog in his shop and shoos him away. Later, he notices the dog is back again. He walks over to the dog, and notices the dog has a note in his mouth. The butcher takes the note, and it reads, ""Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please.""The butcher looks, and lo and behold, in the dog's mouth, there is a ten dollar bill. So the butcher takes the money, puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, and places it in the dog's mouth. The butcher is very impressed, and since it's closing time, he decides to close up shop and follow the dog.So, off he goes. The dog is walking down the street and comes to a crossing. The dog puts down the bag, jumps up and presses the crossing button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the lights to change. They do, and he walks across the road, with the butcher following. The dog then comes to a bus stop, and starts looking at the timetable. The butcher is in awe at this stage. The dog checks out the times, and sits on one of the seats to wait for the bus. Along comes a bus. The dog walks to the front of the bus, looks at the number, and goes back to his seat. Another bus comes. Again the dog goes and looks at the number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on. The butcher, by now open-mouthed, follows him onto the bus. The bus travels thru town and out to the suburbs. Eventually the dog gets up, moves to the front of the bus, and standing on his hind legs, pushes the button to stop the bus. The dog gets off, groceries still in his mouth, and the butcher still following. They walk down the road, and the dog approaches a house. He walks up the path, and drops the groceries on the step. Then he walks back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!-against the door. He goes back down the path, takes another run, and throws himself -whap!-against the door again!There's no answer at the door, so the dog goes back down the path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter of the garden.He gets to a window, and bangs his head against it several times. He walks back, jumps off the wall, and waits at the door. The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door, and starts laying into the dog, really yelling at him.The butcher runs up and stops the guy.""What the heck are you doing? This dog is a genius. He could be on TV, for God's sake!""To which the guy responds, ""Clever, my foot! This is the second time this week he's forgotten his key!""</p>

<p>The response:</p>
<p>Dear Penis;</p>
<p>After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you have raised, the administration rejects your request for the following reasons:<br /> You do not work 8 hours straight.<br /> You fall asleep after brief work periods.<br /> You do not always follow the orders of the management team.<br /> You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen visiting other locations.<br /> You must be stimulated in order to start working.<br /> You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift.<br /> You don't always observe necessary safety regulations, such as wearing the correct protective clothing.<br /> You will retire well before you are 65.<br /> You are unable to work double shifts.<br /> You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have completed the assigned task.<br /> And if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering and exiting the workplace carrying two suspicious looking bags.</p>

16810,"<p>An unemployed man goes to apply for a job with Microsoft as a janitor. The manager there arranges for him to take an aptitude test (Section: Floors, sweeping and cleaning). </p>
<p>After the test, the manager says, ""You will be employed at minimum wage, $5.15 an hour. Let me have your e-mail address, so that I can send you a form to complete and tell you where to report for work on your first day. </p>
<p>Taken aback, the man protests that he has neither a computer nor an e-mail address. To this the MS manager replies, ""Well, then, that means that you virtually don't exist and can therefore hardly expect to be employed. </p>
<p>Stunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having only $10 in his wallet, he decides to buy a 25 lb flat of tomatoes at the supermarket. Within less than 2 hours, he sells all the tomatoes individually at 100% profit. Repeating the process several times more that day, he ends up with almost $100 before going to sleep that night. </p>
<p>And thus it dawns on him that he could quite easily make a living selling tomatoes. Getting up early every day and going to bed late, he multiplies his profits quickly. </p>
<p>After a short time he acquires a cart to transport several dozen boxes of tomatoes, only to have to trade it in again so that he can buy a pickuptruck to support his expanding business. By the end of the second year, he is the owner of a fleet of pickup trucks and manages a staff of a hundred former unemployed people, all selling tomatoes. </p>
<p>Planning for the future of his wife and children, he decides to buy some life insurance. Consulting with an insurance adviser, he picks an insurance plan to fit his new circumstances. At the end of the telephone conversation, the adviser asks him for his e-mail address in order to send the final documents electronically. </p>
<p>When the man replies that he has no e-mail, the adviser is stunned, ""What, you don't have e-mail? How on earth have you managed to amass such wealth without the Internet, e-mail and e-commerce? Just imagine where you would be now, if you had been connected to the internet from the very start!"" </p>
<p>After a moment of thought, the tomato millionaire replied, ""Why, of course! I would be a floor cleaner at Microsoft!"" </p>
<p>Moral of this story:<br /> 1. The Internet, e-mail and e-commerce do not need to rule your life.<br /> 2. If you don't have e-mail, but work hard, you can still become a millionaire.<br /> 3. Since you got this story via e-mail, you're probably closer to becoming a janitor than you are to becoming a millionaire.<br /> 4. If you do have a computer and e-mail, you have already been taken to the cleaners by Microsoft.</p>

16817,"<p>A man walks into the front door of a bar. He is obviously drunk, and staggers<br /> up to the bar, seats himself on a stool and, with a belch, asks the bartender<br /> for a drink.

<p>One cardinal rule of marriage should never be forgotten: ""Give little, give seldom, and above all, give grudgingly."" Otherwise, what could have been a proper marriage could become an orgy of sexual lust. - Ruth Smythers, Marriage advice for women, 1894</p>
<p>I'd like to get married because I like the idea of a man being required by law to sleep with me every night. - Carrie Snow</p>

<p>If you meet somebody who tells you that he loves you more than anybody in the whole wide world, don't trust him. It means he experiments.

<p>* Find out where your boss shops and buy exactly the same outfits. Wear them one day after you boss does. (Note: This is especially effective if your boss is of a different gender than you.) </p>
<p>* Make up nicknames for all your co-workers and refer to them only by these names. ""That's a good point, Sparky. No, I�m sorry, but I'm going to have to disagree with you there, Cha-Cha"" </p>
<p>* Send e-mail to the rest of the company telling them exactly what you�re doing. For example: If anyone needs me, I'll be in the bathroom. </p>
<p>* Hi-Lite your shoes. Tell people you haven�t lost them as much since you did this. While sitting at your desk, soak your fingers in Palmolive liquid. Call everyone Marge. </p>
<p>* Hang mosquito netting around your cubicle. </p>
<p>* When you emerge to get coffee or a printout or whatever, slap yourself randomly the whole way. </p>
<p>* Put a chair facing a printer. Sit there all day and tell people you're waiting for your document. </p>
<p>* Every time someone asks you to do something, anything, ask them if they want fries with that. </p>
<p>* Send e-mails back and forth to yourself engaging yourself in an intellectual debate. </p>
<p>* Forward the mail to a co-worker and ask her to settle the disagreement. </p>
<p>* Encourage your colleagues to join you in a little synchronized chair-dancing. </p>
<p>* Put your trashcan on your desk. Label it IN. </p>
<p>* Feign an unnatural and hysterical fear of staplers. </p>
<p>* Send e-mail messages saying there�s free pizza or donuts or cake in the lunchroom. When people drift back to work complaining that they found none, lean back, pat your stomach and say, ""Oh you've got to be faster than that!"" </p>
<p>* Put decaf in the coffeemaker for three weeks. Once everyone has withdrawn from caffeine addiction, switch to espresso!</p>

16844,"<p>A man was digging in his garden, when his shovel hit a hard object buried in the earth, which revealed itself to be an old bottle sealed with a cork. The man wrenched the cork free and, to his astonishment, there was a cloud of smoke and a clap of thunder. Standing before him was a genie.""As a reward for freeing me, I shall grant you three wishes,"" said the genie, ""But understand, whatever you wish for, your most hated enemy shall receive twice over.""The man's most hated enemy happened to be his next door neighbour, Jones.""Let's see. My first wish is...""He looked at his weather beaten bungalow, ""...to live in a ten story luxury mansion.' The genie clapped his hands and suddenly his minute shack transformed into the most beautiful house he had ever laid eyes on. He heard a cry of astonishment from next door and looked over to see Jones standing in the doorway of his new twenty story mansion.""Now I want fifty of the most beautiful women imaginable."" said the man. There was a puff of smoke and his wish was granted. He was annoyed, however, to see Jones grinning and waving, surrounded by his own harem of 100 women, all twice as attractive.""What is your final wish, Master?' asked the genie.""I want to lose a testicle,"" said the man.</p>

<p>The first replies, ""Come on, I'll show is to you then."" </p>
<p>So the men, both quite tipsy, saunter out of the bar and walk to the bridge. When they arrive at the bridge the first man say�s, ""Here I'll show you how it works.""</p>
<p>So he climbs up on the edge and jumps off. Seconds later low and behold the man seems to just bounce back up astounding the second man. </p>
<p>The second man says ""Hey man, do that again! I can't believe it..."" So the first jumps off again and immediately comes flying back up again. </p>
<p>After seeing this the second man decides to give it a try, after all it all seems quite safe, so he climbs up and jumps off. </p>

<p>They spread some animal skins on the ground and laid the three women upon<br /> them. The first woman, who was laying on a deer skin, moaned and groaned<br /> and gave birth to a beautiful 5 pound baby boy. The entire tribe oohed and<br /> ahhed appeciatively.</p>
<p>The second woman, who was lying on a buffalo skin, then moaned and groaned<br /> and gave birth to a beautiful 6 pound baby boy. Again there was a chorus<br /> of ooohs and ahhs from the tribe.</p>
<p>Then the third woman, who was lying on a hippopotamus skin the tribe had<br /> traded for, moaned and groaned and began to yell in pain. Finally with a<br /> last giant push, the woman gave birth to an astonishing 11 pound baby boy.</p>
<p>The entire tribe was stunned and amazed at the size of this baby.<br /> Everyone, that is, except the village elder. When pressed for a reason as<br /> to why he was not impressed with an 11 pound baby, he simply answered,<br /> ""Everyone knows that the son of the squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to<br /> the sons of the squaws on the other two hides.""</p>

"
16862,"<p>Now get this.  I was sitting at my desk, when I remembered a phone call I  had to make.  I found the number and dialed it.  A man answered nicely saying, 'Hello?'  I politely said, 'This is Patrick Hanifin and could I please speak to Robin Carter?'Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me!  I couldn't believe that anyone could be that rude.  I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her.  She had transposed the last two digits incorrectly.After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk.  I decided to call it again.  When the same person once more answered, I yelled 'You're a jackass!' and hung up.Next to his phone number I wrote the word 'jackass,' and put it in  my desk drawer.  Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or had a really bad day, I'd call him up.  He'd answer, and I'd yell, 'You're a jackass!'  It would always cheer me up.Later in the year the phone company introduced caller ID.  This was  a real disappointment for me, I would have to stop calling the jackass.Then one day I had an idea.  I dialed his number, then heard his voice, 'Hello.' I made up a name.  'Hi.  This is the sales office of the telephone company and I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our caller ID program?'He went, 'No!' and slammed the phone down.  I quickly called him back and said,  'That's because you're a jackass!'The reason I took the time to tell you this story, is to show you how if there's ever anything really bothering you, you can do something about it. Just dial 823-4863.  [Keep reading, it gets better.]The old lady at the mall really took her time pulling out of the parking pace.  I didn't think she was ever going to leave.  Finally,  her car began to move and she started to very slowly back out of the slot.I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room to pull out. Great, I thought, she's finally leaving.  All of a sudden this black Camaro come flying up the parking isle in the wrong direction and pulls into her space.I started honking my horn and yelling, 'You can't just do that,Buddy.  I was here first!'  The guy climbed out of his Camaro completely ignoring me. He walked toward the mall as if he didn't even hear me.I thought to myself, this guy's a jackass, there sure a lot of jackasses in this world.  I noticed he had a 'For Sale' sign in the  back window of his car.  I wrote down the number.  Then I hunted for another place to park.A couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my desk.  I had just gotten off the phone after calling 823-4863 and yelling, 'You're jackass!' (It's really easy to call him now since I have his number on speed dial.)I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black Camaro lying on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy, too.After a couple rings someone answered the phone and said, 'Hello.' I said, 'Is this the man with the black Camaro for sale?''Yes, it is.''Can you tell me where I can see it?''Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th street.  It's a yellow house and the car's parked right out front.'I said, 'What's your name?''My name is Don Hansen.''When's a good time to catch you, Don?''I'm home in the evenings.''Listen Don, can I tell you something?''Yes,''Don, you're a jackass!' and I slammed the phone down.After I hung up I added Don Hansen's number to my speed dialer.  For a while things seemed to be going better for me.  Now when I had a problem I had two jackasses to call.  Then, after several months of calling the jackasses and hanging up on them, it just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be.  I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with a solution:First, I had my phone dial Jackass #1.  A man answered nicely saying,'Hello.'I yelled 'You're a jackass!', but I didn't hang up.The jackass said, 'Are you still there?I said, 'Yeah.'He said, 'Stop calling me.'I said, 'No.'He said, 'What's your name, Pal?'I said, 'Don Hansen.'He said 'Where do you live?''1802 West 34th Street.  It's a yellow house and my black Camaro's parked out front.''I'm coming over right now, Don.  You'd better start saying your prayers.''Yeah, like I'm really scared, Jackass!' and I hung up.Then I called Jackass #2.He answered, 'Hello.'I said, 'Hello, Jackass!'He said, 'If I ever find out who you are...''You'll what?''I'll kick your butt.''Well, here's your chance.  I'm coming over right now Jackass!' And I hung up.Then I picked up the phone and called the police.  I told them I was at 1802 West 34th Street and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as he got home.Another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war going on down W. 34th Street.After that I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to watch the whole thing.Glorious!Watching two Jackasses kicking the crap out of each other in front of 6 squad cars and a police helicopter was one of the greatest experiences of my life!Name withheld to protect the guilty.</p>

16875,"<p>There once lived a man named Jack. Jack was very unfortunate in that that he eyes having always bulged out every since he hit puberty. It was a very big problem for Jack, because no girls were every attracted to him. The bulging eyes were a big turn-off.</p>
<p>Finally, after some consideration Jack goes to the doctor with his problem, always too embarrassed to go in the past. After closely listening to Jack's problem and after long examination, the doctor tells the Jack that there's only one way to solve Jack's problem, and that way is to cut off Jack's balls.</p>
<p>Jack completely rejects the solution at first, but then begins to think that what good are his balls if he can't get laid anyway. And, since his bulging eyes are keeping him from getting laid in the first place, maybe losing his balls for the sake of looking normal wasn't such a bad idea.</p>
<p>So, a day later Jack returns to the doctor and tells him to cut off his balls. Jack goes through with the surgery, and behold, the day after the surgery he looks into the mirror and finds that his eyes are no longer bulging out. Very happy with his new look, Jack decides to treat himself to some new clothes, go to a club, and get fucked.</p>
<p>Based on recommendations from friends, Jack goes to a certain tailor to get some new clothes. As soon as Jack comes in, the tailor says, ""Stop! Don't say anything! I bet I can tell you all your clothes sizes without you telling me anything or without my even using a measuring tape.""</p>
<p>""Take your shot,"" says Jack.</p>
<p>The tailor says, ""Ok, your shirt size is large, your pants waste size is 36, your pants length is 32, your underwear size is 38, and your....""</p>
<p>""Ha!"" interrupted Jack. ""You are wrong, my underwear size is 34!""</p>
<p>""That's impossible!"" exclaimed the tailor, very puzzled, ""If your underwear size was 34, your eyes would be bulging out like crazy!""</p>

<p>He gets to the end of the bar and asks, ''excuse me sir, I couldn't help but notice that you are Neil Armstrong. </p>
<p>Mr. Armstrong replies, ''well yes I am how may I help you?'' The man states that it was a pleasure to meet him since Neil Armstrong has always been a big idol and role model in his life. Mr. Armstrong thanks him and asks him what he does for a living. ''I am a journalist'' replies the man. Mr. Armstrong gives a sigh and replies ''Oh, Okay.'' The man continues and asks him if he has a problem with journalists. Mr. Armstrong says no but states that reporters and the media had misquoted him on his moon walk statement. The man asks him what he means. Mr. Armstrong replies, you guys reported I said ''Once small step for man, one giant step for man kind'', but what I really said was ''once small step for man, one giant step for Matt Kline.'' </p>
<p>''Who the hell is Matt Kline?'' replied the man. </p>
<p>''Matt Kline is a good friend of mine ever since we were kids, we went to the same high school, college, we even served in the service at the same time. We where both in the Apollo space program but he didn't make the cut,'' said Armstrong. </p>
<p>''Okay'' replied the man. </p>
<p>''Well one day I was the best man at Matt's wedding and when the reception was over, I noticed that there were some packages left in the banquet room. Not wanting to have the couple go off without all of their gifts, I ran the packages up to their suite. when I got to the door I heard Matt's wife say, 'the day I put that in my mouth will be the day a man walks on the moon!''</p>

16902,"<p>One Sunday a pastor told the congregation that the church needed some extra money and asked the people to prayerfully consider giving a little extra in the offering plate. He said that whoever gave the most would be able to pick out three hymns.After the offering plates were passed, the pastor glanced down and noticed that someone had placed a $1,000 bill in offering. He was so excited that he immediately shared his joy with his congregation and said he'd like to personally thank the person who placed the money in the plate.A very quiet, elderly and saintly lady all the way in the back shyly raised her hand. The pastor asked her to come to the front. Slowly she made her way to the pastor. He told her how wonderful it was that she gave so much and in thanksgiving asked her to pick out three hymns.Her eyes brightened as she looked over the congregation, pointed to the three handsomest men in the building and said, ""I'll take him and him and him.""</p>

Saddam doesn't get it--what the hell is<br /> happening here? But he hasn't been harmed yet, so he sits down<br /> again to talk further.</p>
<p>After a few minutes Clinton presses the final button. This time,<br /> Saddam stays sitting, but Clinton isn't, he's rolling on the<br /> floor, doubled up from laughing. Saddam is really annoyed by<br /> now, so he stands up from his chair and shouts: ""I've had enough<br /> of this, I'm going back to Baghdad"" (Through tears of laughter<br /> from the floor): ""Baghdad?...What fucking Baghdad?""</p>

16928,"<p>There once was a lady who was tired of living with men who were<br /> either physically abusive, who ran away from her, or who were<br /> horrible in bed. So she put an Ad in the paper, that was asking<br /> for a man who: </p>
<p>1)would treat her nicely<br /> 2)wouldn't run away from her,<br /> 3)would be good in bed. </p>
<p>Three weeks passed, and there was no reply from any man. So she<br /> just figured that there wasn't a man alive who could live up to<br /> these expectations, so she just gave up. But then, one day she<br /> heard the doorbell rang. She answered it, and there on the front<br /> porch was a man in a wheel chair who didn't have any arms or<br /> legs. The man said ""I'm here about the ad you put in the paper.<br /> As you can see, I have no arms so I can't beat you, and I have<br /> no legs so I can't run away from you.""</p>
<p>The woman replied, ""Yes, but are you good in bed?""</p>
<p>And the man said with a smirk on his face, ""How do you think I<br /> rang the doorbell?""</p>

16946,"<p>A man's daughter had asked the local minister to come and pray with her<br /> father. When the minister arrived, he found the man lying in bed with his head<br /> propped up on two pillows. An empty chair sat beside his bed. The minister<br /> assumed that the old fellow had been informed of his visit. </p>
<p>''I guess you were expecting me,'' he said. ''No, who are you?'' said the<br /> father. The minister told him his name and then remarked, ''I see the empty<br /> chair; I figured you knew I was going to show up.'' ''Oh yea, the chair,'' said<br /> the bed ridden man. ''Would you mind closing the door?'' Puzzled, the minister<br /> shut the door. </p>
<p>''I have never told anyone this not even my daughter,'' said the man, ''but<br /> all of my life I have never known how to pray. At church I used to hear the<br /> pastor talk about prayer, but it went right over my head.'' ''I abandoned any<br /> attempt at prayer,'' the old man continued, ''until one day about four years ago<br /> my best friend said to me 'Johnny, prayer is just a simple matter of having a<br /> conversation with Jesus. Here am what I suggest.'' </p>
<p>''Sit down in a chair; place an empty chair in front of you, and in faith see<br /> Jesus on the chair. It's not spooky, because he promised, ''I'll be with you<br /> always.'' Then just speak to him in the same way you're doing with me. Right<br /> now.'' ''So, I tried it and I've liked it so much that I do it a couple of hours<br /> every day. I'm careful though, if my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair,<br /> she'd either have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm.'' </p>
<p>The minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the old man to<br /> continue on the journey. Then he prayed with him, anointed him with oil, and<br /> returned to the church. Two nights later the daughter called to tell the<br /> minister that her Daddy had died that afternoon. ''Did he die in peace?'' he<br /> asked. </p>
<p>''Yes, and when I left the house about two o'clock, he called me over to his<br /> bedside and told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek. When I got back from<br /> the store an hour later, I found him dead. But there was something strange about<br /> his death.'' ''Apparently just before daddy died he leaned over and rested his<br /> head on the chair beside the bed. What do you make of that?'' </p>
<p>The minister wiped a tear from his eye and said, ''I wish we could all go like<br /> that.''</p>

16976,"<p>Ok Let me just inform you that me, the person who is typing<br /> this, is 12 and a half years old, my sister Charlotte is 16 and<br /> a half. I can truly say we don't exactly like each other, in<br /> fact you could say we hate each other. Every action and word is<br /> true and that's why I'm rating this R, isn't my sister an<br /> angel? ha!</p>
<p>It was December 1st, 2001 and it was rainy and dark. My sister<br /> was ""sick"" and didn't want to do the recycling (thing where we<br /> sort plastic, paper, and glass into 3 different trash cans) my<br /> dad wanted one of us (either Camilla (13),Charles (15) me or<br /> Charlotte. Since Charlotte was ""sick"" she said to me,""You<br /> fucking bitch you fucking better do it or else I'll beat your<br /> mother fuckin' ass up."" not being threatened at all since i was<br /> used to this kind of thing i said, ""No, I did it a few days ago,<br /> you go ahead and do it."" Now Charlotte believes in those signs<br /> things so since we're Aries she thinks all Aries should be<br /> stobborn, bossy, touchy etc. So she decided the best way to<br /> react to this was to throw a trash can at me. She kicked the<br /> trash can at me. I have to admit, it did hurt. I acted like<br /> nothing happened and went to my room. She finally decided to<br /> take out the trash. Now I strongly believe inrevenge so I<br /> decided to go out back and dress in my halloween outfit. I went<br /> outside and said, ""Boo!"" I scared her shitless, well sort of,<br /> actually, she peed in her pants. She was so angry with me she<br /> jumped at me. Since we play dodge ball a lot in P.E. i easily<br /> dodged her. She fell face flat into a mud puddle. I ran inside<br /> and couldn't help but laugh very very hard. She got her best<br /> silk shirt (actually a see-through tight shirt that shows her<br /> slightly see through bra and is so low at the top that her bra<br /> (came over it) and best pants (which are actually the tightest<br /> thing her so called ""fat ass"" could fit in) ruined. Now, that's<br /> what i call revenge.</p>
