42021,"<p>A language instructor was explaining to her class that French nouns, unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically designated as masculine or feminine. </p>
<p>Things like 'chalk' or 'pencil,' she described, would have a gender association although in English these words were neutral. Puzzled, one student raised his hand and asked, ""What gender is a computer?"" </p>
<p>The teacher wasn't certain which it was,and so divided the class into two groups and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. One group was comprised of the women in the class, and the other, of men. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendation. </p>
<p>The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to in masculine gender because:<br /> 1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br /> 2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.<br /> 3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.<br /> 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model. </p>
<p>The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender because:<br /> 1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.<br /> 2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br /> 3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br /> 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories.</p>

42034,"<p>When you go fishing and you catch something, that's good. If you're making love and you catch something, that's bad.</p>
<p>Fish don't compare you to other fishermen neither and don't want to know how many other fish you caught.</p>
<p>In fishing you lie about the one that got away. In loving you lie about the one you caught.</p>
<p>You can catch and release a fish, you don't have to lie and promise to still be friends after you let it go.</p>
<p>You don't have to necessarily change your line to keep catching fish.</p>
<p>You can catch a fish on a 20 cent nightcrawler. If you want to catch a woman you're talking dinner and a movie minimum.</p>

42035,"<p>A man and his female friend woke up one morning to find an alien<br /> spacecraft in their back yard. Being curious, the man and woman<br /> went to welcome the visitors.</p>
<p>When the reached the spacecraft, a door slowly opened and<br /> standing there were two aliens (a male and a female) who looked<br /> just like humans except for minor differences. They found that<br /> the aliens spoke perfect English so they invited them to come<br /> inside for a drink.</p>
<p>After long discussions about the universe, the humans and the<br /> aliens thought it would be interesting to have sex with one<br /> another. So the female alien and the man went back to the ship,<br /> while the male alien and the woman stayed in the house.</p>
<p>When the two in the house began to undress, the woman noticed,<br /> to her disappointment, that the visitor had a very small penis.<br /> Realising that the woman was distressed, the alien said ""Don't<br /> worry, I'm not ready yet,"" and pushing his nose, his penis grew<br /> ten inches long. The woman was still not happy as the<br /> circumference was no bigger then that of a pencil. But again the<br /> alien told her not to worry and pulling his ears his penis grew<br /> thicker. After, the alien and woman made amazing love that they<br /> thouroughly enjoyed.</p>
<p>When the aliens had left the man and woman got to talking-<br /> ""How was it?"" asked the man.<br /> ""Great!"" said the woman, ""How about you?""<br /> ""It was wierd,"" replied the man, ""she kept on pushing my nose<br /> and pulling my ears the entire time.""</p>

A call came in telling them to disperse some people who were loitering.The officers drove to the street and observed a small crowd standing on a corner.The rookie rolled down his window and said, ""Let's get off the corner people.""A few glances, but no one moved, so he barked again, ""Let's get off that corner... NOW!""Intimidated, the group of people began to leave, casting puzzled stares in his direction.Proud of his first official act, the young policeman turned to his partner and asked, ""Well, how did I do?""Pretty good,"" chuckled the vet, ""especially since this is a bus stop.""</p>

42044,"<p>A man comes into the ER and yells, ""My wife is going to have her<br /> baby in the cab!"" I grabbed my stuff, rushed out to the cab,<br /> lifted the lady's dress, and began to take off her underwear.<br /> Suddenly, I noticed that there were several cabs and I was in<br /> the wrong one.</p>
<p>********************</p>
<p>At the beginning of my shift, I placed a stethoscope on an<br /> elderly and slightly deaf female patient's anterior chest wall.<br /> ""Big breaths,"" I instructed. ""Yes, they used to be,"" the patient<br /> said sadly.</p>
<p>********************</p>
<p>One day I had to be the bearer of bad news when I told a wife<br /> that her husband had died of a massive myocardial infarct. Not<br /> more than five minutes later, I heard her reporting to the rest<br /> of the family that he had died of a ""massive internal fart.""</p>
<p>********************</p>
<p>I was performing a complete physical, including the visual<br /> acuity test. I placed the patient twenty feet from the chart and<br /> began, ""Cover your right eye with your hand."" He read the 20/20<br /> line perfectly. ""Now your left."" Again, a flawless read. ""Now<br /> both,"" I requested. There was silence. He couldn't even read the<br /> large E on the top line. I turned and discovered that he had<br /> done exactly what I had asked. He was standing there with both<br /> his eyes covered. I was laughing too hard to finish the exam.</p>
<p>********************</p>
<p>While acquainting myself with a new elderly patient, I asked,<br /> ""How long have you been bedridden?"" After a look of complete<br /> confusion she answered, ""Why, not for about twenty years, when<br /> my husband was last alive.""</p>
<p>********************</p>
<p>I was caring for a woman from Kentucky and asked, ""So how was<br /> your breakfast this morning?"" ""It's very good, except for the<br /> Kentucky Jelly. I can't seem to get used to the taste,"" the<br /> patient replied. I then asked to see the jelly and the woman<br /> produced a foil packet labeled ""KY Jelly.""</p>

42133,"<p>John invited his mother over for dinner. During the meal, his mother couldn't help noticing how beautiful John's flatmate was. </p>
<p>She had long been suspicious of a relationship between John and his flatmate and this only made her more curious.</p>
<p>Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and the flatmate than met the eye.</p>
<p>Reading his mum's thoughts, John volunteered, 'I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just flatmates.'</p>
<p>About a week later, Julie came to John and said, 'Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?'</p>
<p>John said, 'Well, I doubt it but I'll write her an email just to be sure.'</p>
<p>So he sat down and wrote,<br /> 'Dear Mother, I'm not saying you did take a gravy ladle from my house and I'm not saying you did not take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner'</p>
<p>Several days later john received an email from his mother which read,<br /> 'Dear Son, I'm not saying that you do sleep with Julie and I'm not saying that you do not sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if she were sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now. Love, Mum.'</p>

42139,"<p>Golfing HitmanThere are these friends who play golf together every Saturday. One Saturday they are getting ready to tee off when a guy, by himself, asks if he can join them. The friends look at each other and then look at the guy and say, ''Sure.'' So they tee off. About two holes into the game, the friends get curious about what the guy does for a living. So they ask him. The stranger tells them he's a hitman. The friends all laugh. The guy says, ''No really, I am a hitman. My gun is in my golf bag. I carry it everywhere. You can take a look at it if you like.'' So one of the friends dicides to check it out. He opened the bag and, sure enough, there is a rifle with a huge scope attached. He gets all excited and says, ''WOW! I bet I can see my house through here! May I look?'' The hit man replies, ''Sure.'' So the guy looks for a second and says, ''YEAH! You can see my house! I can even see through the windows into my bedroom. There's my wife, naked. Isn't she beautiful? WAIT! There's my next door neighbor! And he's naked too!'' This really upsets the guy, so he asks the hitman how much it would be for a hit. The hitman replies, ''I get $1000 everytime I pull the trigger.'' The guy responds, ''$1000??? Well, ok. I want two hits. I want you to shoot my wife right in the mouth. She's always nagging at me and I can't stand it. Second, I want you to shoot my neighbor in the penis, just for screwing around with my wife.'' The hit man agrees, gears up and looks through the scope. He's looking for about five minutes until finally the man starts to get really impatient and asks, ''What are you waitng for?!? The hitman replies, ''Just hold on..... I'm a about to save you a thousand bucks!''</p>

42153,"<p>ORIGAMIArt of paper folding. In order to obtain a nice and effectiveness result, put the floppy in the disk drive after folding it several times in different directions. With a little luck, you should be able to get it jammed. Now, ask yourself. How can your disk get damaged if you can't even get it out of the drive?SMOKEUse cigarettes or anything that could be burnt. When you are smoking, blow directly to your disk. In that way, you will be able to destroy it soon, and if you are lucky, damage the drive as well.PIRANHASIf you don't have any at home, you can use a stapler, a clip, or simply write down on the disk label with a hard point pencil or pen. This wonderful method of ""caring"" for disks also often gives you a pretty bite-like design on the remaining pieces of the disk.MAGNETSThey are wonderful. You can find them in the telephone, in some paper weights, and stuck on the frige door. If you can't find any, you can leave the floppies on the printer or on your display for a while, making sure that they are on.MAILPut a disk in an envelope and don't write any warning on it; then mail it to someone, and that's all.MAGIC TOUCHTouch your floppy. As much as you can. If you have marmelade or butter in your fingers, better. Your floppy will acknowledge it.DON'T USE ANY ENVELOPEArchive them wihtout their envelope, piled under a lot of papers and manuals.DON'T MAKE BACKUPSOf course, if you don't have any security copy, you won't have to worry about how to destroy them once you have lost the original.SUPREME STUPIDITYIt is the best way of destroying floppies.

Excerpted from an article which appeared in the Dublin Times about a bank robbery on March 2,1999: ''Once inside the bank shortly after midnight, their efforts at disabling the internal security system got underway immediately. The robbers, who expected to find one or two large safes filled with cash and valuables, were surprised to see hund! reds of smaller safes scattered throughout </p>
<p>the bank. </p>
<p>The robbers cracked the first safe's combination, and inside they found only a bowl of vanilla pudding. As recorded on the bank's audiotape system, one robber said, ''At least we'll have a bit to eat.'' </p>
<p>The robbers opened up a second safe, and it also contained nothing but vanilla pudding. The process continued until all the safes were opened. </p>
<p>They found not one pound sterling, a diamond, or an ounce of gold. Instead, all the safes contained covered bowls of pudding. </p>
<p>Disappointed, the robbers made a quiet exit, each leaving with nothing more than a queasy, uncomfortably full stomach. </p>

42158,"<p>One day, a large group of people were waiting for the bus at a local Greyhound station. At the front of the line was a very attractive woman dressed in a black business vest, white blouse, leather miniskirt, and high heels. As the bus pulled up and opened the door, she went to board it, but found that her skirt was too tight for her to raise her leg to the required height. Looking around and thinking quickly, she reaches behind her and unzips the zipper on the back of her skirt a little and then tries again. Again, she finds that she cannot maneuver the step, so once more she reaches behind her and unzips her skirt a little more. With a smile, she looks at the bus driver and tries to board again. With disappointment, she finds that she still can't step that high and so with exasperation and a sigh she unzips her skirt the rest of the way down. To her amazement, her leg still will not reach the bottom step. Finally, a very large Texan behind her gently grabs her by the waist, lifts her up, and places her on the bus. The woman turns to the Texan furious and says, ""Who do you think you are to touch my body in that way? I don't even know you!"" Nonplused, the Texan looks at her and replies, ""Well, ma'am, after you unzipped my fly I thought we were pretty good friends.""</p>

<p>Doctors at Portland's University Hospital said Wednesday an Oregon man shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive, and will be released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous, in Grants Pass, Ore. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Roberts' right eye. Doctors said had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the a major blood vessel would have cut and Roberts would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Dr. Johnny Delashaw at the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches of brain, with the tip protruding at the rear of his skill, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said had Robert tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself. Roberts admitted afterwards he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts ""I feel so dumb about this."" No charges have been filed but the Josephine Court District attorney's office said the initiation stunt is under investigation. </p>

<p>Blasting Cap Explodes in Man's Mouth at Party </p>
<p>A man at a party popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off his lips, teeth and tongue, state police said Wednesday. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during a party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. ""Another man had it in an aquarium, hooked to a battery, and was trying to explode it,"" Payne said. ""It wouldn't go off and this guy said, 'I'll show you how to set it off. ""He put it in his mouth and bit down. It blew all his teeth off, his tongue and his lips,"" Payne said. Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday, with extensive facial injuries, according to a spokesman at Charleston Area Medical Division. ""I just can't imagine anyone doing something like that,"" Payne said. </p>

<p>Another true story of a guy in L.A. who was afraid of heights, and had to go up on his roof to adjust his TV antenna. So he tied a rope around himself, and tied the other end to the bumper of his car. Well, he should have told his wife . She went out and got in the car to go to the store. The man was pulled off the roof and dragged down the street before someone alerted the wife to the fact that she had some extra cargo. The man was rushed to the hospital where he spent a couple of weeks recovering, more or less. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the story does not end there. To make amends, the wife planned a little surprise party for her husband the day he returned home. She invited several couples over to enjoy the festivities, most of them smokers. Since the wife and husband smoked too, they had several lighters around the house, and the wife decided to fill them before the guests arrived. To be safe, she took them all into the bathroom and filled them over the toilet. </p>
<p>Have you guessed yet? Yes, the husband used the bathroom immediately afterward, and threw his cigarette into the toilet while sitting.</p>

His father replied, ''Don't you love this girl?''''Oh yes, very much,'' he said, ''but you see, I have very smelly feet and I'm afraid that my fiance will be put off by them.''''No problem,'' said dad, ''all you have to do is wash your feet as often as possible and always wear socks, even to bed.'' Well, to him this seemed a workable solution. The bride-to-be, overcoming her fear, decided to take her problem up with her mom.'' Mom,'' she said, ''When I wake up in the morning, my breath is truly awful.''''Honey,'' her mother consoled, ''everyone has bad breath in the morning.''''No, you don't understand. My morning breath is so bad, I'm afraid that my fianc�e will not want to sleep in the same room with me.'' Her mother said simply, ''Try this. In the morning, get straight out of bed and head for the kitchen to make breakfast. While the family is busy eating, move on to the bathroom and brush your teeth. The key is, not to say a word until you've brushed your teeth.''''I shouldn't say good morning or anything?'' the daughter asked. ''Not a word,'' her mother affirmed. ''Well, it's certainly worth a try,'' she thought. The loving couple were finally married. Not forgetting the advice each had received, he with his perpetual socks and she with her morning silence, they managed quite well. That is, until about six months later. Shortly before dawn one morning, the husband wakes with a start to find that one of his socks had come off. Fearful of the consequences, he frantically searches the bed. This, of course, wakes his bride and without thinking, she asks, ''What on earth are you doing?''''Oh, my,'' he replies, ''you've swallowed my sock!''</p>

42234,"<p>The European Union commissioners have announced that agreement has been<br /> reached to adopt English as the preferred language for European<br /> communications, rather than German, which was the other possibility.</p>
<p>As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that<br /> English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a<br /> five-year phased plan for what will be known as EuroEnglish [Euro for<br /> short].</p>
<p>In the first year, 's' will be used instead of the soft 'c'. Sertainly,<br /> sivil servants will reseive this news with joy. Also, the hard 'c' will be<br /> replased with 'k'. Not only will this klear up konfusion, but typewriters<br /> kan have one less letter.</p>
<p>There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the<br /> troublesome 'ph' will be replased by 'f'. This will make words like<br /> 'fotograf' 20 persent shorter.</p>
<p>In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted<br /> to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible.<br /> Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which ahve always<br /> ben a deternent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes<br /> of silent 'e' in the languaj is disgrasful, and they would go.</p>

42241,"<p>A father passing by his son's bedroom was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. Then he saw an envelope propped up prominently on the centre of the bed. It was addressed,""Dad"". With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter with trembling hands:</p>
<p>Dear Dad,</p>
<p>It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with mom and you. I've been finding real passion with Joan and she is so nice -- even with all her piercings, tattoos, and her tight Motorcycle clothes. </p>
<p>But it's not only the passion dad, she's pregnant and Joan said that we will be very happy. Even though you don't care for her as she is so much older than I, she already owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. </p>
<p>She wants to have many more children with me and that's now one of my dreams too. Joan taught me that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone and we'll be growing it for us and trading it with her friends for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Joan can get better; she sure deserves it!!</p>
<p>Don't worry Dad, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself.</p>
<p>Someday I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your grandchildren.</p>
<p>Your son,<br /> John</p>
<p>PS: Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at the neighbour's house.</p>
<p>I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than my report card that's in my desk centre drawer. I love you! Call when it is safe for me to come home.</p>

<p>Luke: ""I wish I had known him."" </p>

<p>Luke: ""How did my father die?"" </p>
<p>Ben: ""A young Jedi Knight named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Emperor hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Vader was seduced by the Dark Side of the Force."" </p>
<p>Luke: ""The Force?"" </p>
<p>Ben: ""Yes, the Force is what gives a Jedi Knight his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us. Penetrates us. Binds the galaxy together. Which reminds me. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your Uncle wouldn't allow. He thought you'd follow Obi-Wan on some idealistic crusade."" </p>

<p>Luke: ""Beer?"" </p>
<p>Ben: [smiles] ""Yes, Beer is what gives a frat guy his power. It's a beverage created by hops and barley, and stuff like that. It intoxicates us. Gives us beer goggles.

Your dad read in the paper that most accidents happen<br /> within twenty miles of home, so we moved. Won't be able to send you the address<br /> as the last Arkansas family that lived here took the numbers with them for their<br /> house, so they wouldn't have to change their address. </p>

<p>We got a bill from the funeral home, and it said if we didn't make the final<br /> payment on Grandma's funeral bill, up she comes. </p>
<p>About your sister, she had a baby this morning. I haven't found out whether if<br /> it is a boy or a girl so doesn�t know if you are an Aunt or Uncle. </p>
<p>Your Uncle John fell in the whiskey vat. Some men tried to get him out, but he<br /> fought them off playfully, so he drowned. We cremated him and he burned for<br /> three days. </p>
<p>Three of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup. One was driving and the<br /> other two were in the back. The driver got out. He rolled down the window and<br /> swam to safer. The other 2 drowned. They couldn't get the tailgate down. </p>

42319,"<p>KAY MARTIN, a secretary to a New Zealand MP, got the fright of her life a few weeks ago. According to the Auckland Sunday Star, she and a friend were chatting over a drink when they heard a chicken squawking. The bird sounded in some distress, so they went outside to investigate, thinking perhaps that it had escaped from one of the neighbours. But there were no chickens anywhere. </p>
<p>Then Martin realized with horror that the sound was coming from her own kitchen--coming, in fact, from the oven, where she had put a chicken in to roast half an hour earlier. ""It was as if it was shrieking at me from its grave,"" she says. ""It was so bizarre I just froze."" </p>
<p>As they approached the oven, the squawking reached a crescendo. They took the tray out, and as the chicken began to cool, the squawking died away. Martin chopped the neck off and threw it in the sink. She noticed that the vocal chords were intact. </p>
<p>""Steam was coming up the neck from the stuffing,"" says Martin, and this had caused the dead bird to squawk. She has not cooked chicken since.</p>

42323,"<p>Back in the old west, there was a need to connect the east and the west with a telegraph line. The Manager of the project advertised for workers to complete the job. </p>
<p>Three groups responded. A group of Chinese, a group of Italians, and a group of Blondes. </p>
<p>Since none of the groups would work with anyone from the other two groups, the manager decided to assign each group to a different part of the line. </p>
<p>The first task was to stand the telegraph poles. The Manager sent each group out to a different location. Before they left, he advised all three groups that the one to bury the most poles today, would receive a bonus. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, the foreman of the Italians reported back to the Manager. The Manager inquired of him how many poles had been set by his group. He replied 48. The manager was very pleased. He advised the Italian to stay awhile until he heard how the Chinese and the Blondes did. </p>
<p>Next to report was the foreman of the Chinese group. When asked, he reported that they had set 53 poles that day. Again the manager was delighted. He dismissed the Italian foreman and asked the Chinese leader to remain until the Blondes checked in. </p>
<p>A little while later the Blonde forewoman reported to the Manager. ""How many poles did your group set?"" He asked. ""Two."" Replied the Blonde forewoman. ""Two!"" Exclaimed the Manager. ""The Italians set 48 poles, and the Chinese set 53. How could you Blondes have only set two poles?"" He demanded. </p>
<p>""It may be true the Italians and Chinese buried more poles than us."" Replied the Blonde. ""But you should see how much of the poles they left sticking out of the ground!""</p>

42326,"<p>This woman has her bridge club every Thursday night. After a peaceful game or two with the ladies, she goes home to fix her husband dinner when he gets home from work. One Thursday, she's playing a great game and she has an incredible hand when she notices the time. 'Oh, no! I have to go fix my husband his dinner! He's going to be so angry if it's not ready on time.' She dashes out of her friend's house; her great hand forgotten on the table. When she gets home, she realizes she has very little time. There is enough time to go to the supermarket and all she has in the cupboard is a wilted lettuce leaf, an egg and a can of cat food. In a panic, she opens the can of cat food, stirs in the egg, and garnishes it with the lettuce leaf, just as her husband is pulling up. She watches in horror as he sits down to his dinner, and then she realizes he is loving it! 'Mmmm, darling, this is the best dinner you have made for me in forty years of marriage. You can make this for me any old day, yum!' And that night, they had sex for the first time in months and it was great. Needless to say, every Thursday from then on, she made this dinner for her husband. She tells her bridge cronies about it and they are all horrified. 'You're going to kill him,' they'd all say. Two months later, her husband died and all the bridge women the Thursday after the funeral attacked our new widow for being so callous. 'You killed him! We told you that feeding him that cat food every week would do him in! How can you just sit there so calmly and play bridge knowing you murdered your husband?' The wife stoically replied, 'Ahh, I didn't kill him. He fell off the mantle while he was licking his rear.'</p>

<p>After feeling the nurse insert the thermometer, he heard her announce, ""I have to get something. Now you stay JUST LIKE THAT until I get back!""</p>
<p>She leaves the door to his room open on her way out. He curses under his breath as he hears people walking past his door, laughing. After almost an hour, the man's doctor comes into the room.</p>

42380,"<p>A priest was in the confessional booth with a fairly long line of people<br /> waiting for their confession.  The priest had to go to the bathroom<br /> something awful and couldn't hold it for another minute.  Not wanting to<br /> upset all of the people in line, he frantically looked out the<br /> back door for another priest to help him out but there wasn't a priest<br /> to be found.</p>
<p>Suddently the janitor pushed his broom past the back of the booth and<br /> the priest grabbed him and said, ""You just gotta help me out.  I have to<br /> go to the bathroom and the line is so long.</p>
<p>""It's very simple"", said the Priest.""There on the wall is a chart ...<br /> column A lists the sins and column B lists the penance.  Just find the<br /> sin on the chart and tell them what their penance is.""</p>
<p>The janitor agreed that it sounded pretty simple and wanted to help the<br /> holy Father so he agreed to fill in for the priest in the booth while<br /> the priest hurried away to the bathroom.</p>
<p>The very next person in line entered the booth and began ... ""Forgive me<br /> Father for I have sinned.  It's been two weeks since my last<br /> confession.  Last night I let my next door neighbor's wife give me a<br /> blow job.  That's it, Father"".</p>
<p>The janitor looked at the chart but got frantic when he couldn't find<br /> ""blow job"" anywhere on the chart.  Panicking, he opened the back door to<br /> look for a Priest but there was still not a Priest to be found.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the altar boy walked by and the janitor grabbed him and<br /> stammered, ""Quick, what does the father give for a blow job?""</p>

42388,"<p>Men often find blowing off a woman the most difficult part of the dating process. The closest they ever come to telling a woman it's over is to look her straight in the eye and say, ""I'll call you next week."" But there is now a great way to blow a woman off. It's safe, it's affordable and the best thing is the female has no opportunity to throw things at you. It's at your fingertips right now: E-mail.<br /> That's how all the happening, 90's kind of guys are telling women they are not worthy. You'll feel like a real man knowing you have told her how you really feel from the safety of your keyboard. And you can delete her response without ever reading it. What could be more painless? Following is an email rejection letter: </p>
<p>Men can use it the next time they need to put their main squeeze on notice. The text of the letter follows: </p>
<p>Dear (her name),</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that you have been eliminated from further contention to become the future Mrs. (your last name). As you are probably aware, the competition was exceedingly tough this year and dozens of well-qualified candidates such as yourself also failed to make the final cut. I will, however, keep your name on file should an opening become available.</p>
<p>So that you may find better success in your future romantic endeavors, please allow me to offer the following reasons you were disqualified from the competition: (Men will check those that apply) </p>
<p>_____ Your failure to reach for your purse in even a feigned attempt to pay for dinner by the fourth date displayed a stunning ignorance of basic economics. </p>
<p>_____ Your inadvertent admission that you ""buy condoms and K-Y Jelly by the truckload"" indicates that you may be slightly over-qualified for the position. </p>
<p>_____ You failed the 20 question rule, i.e., I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself. </p>
<p>_____ The only question you did ask was how much money I make. </p>
<p>_____ You neglected to reach over and unlock my car door from the inside after I opened the passenger side door for you. </p>
<p>_____ My breasts are bigger than yours. </p>
<p>_____ Your height is out of proportion with your weight. If you should, however, happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches, please resubmit your application. </p>
<p>_____ Your repeated comments such as, ""Is it still called a penis when it's this small?"" were both uncalled for and thoughtless. </p>
<p>_____ The way you enthusiastically jumped on stage at the alternative bar and danced with the lesbians demonstrated that you are far too impressionable and have a disconcerting lack of commitment to heterosexuality. </p>
<p>_____ Your revelation that you would most certainly allow your ex-boyfriend to shack up with you again after he ""beats that domestic abuse rap"" shows compassion but makes it difficult to take you seriously. </p>
<p>_____ Although your inability to achieve orgasm was of paramount importance to me, your suggestion that we invite the basketball team </p>
<p>into the bedroom so it would be ""just like college"" seemed somewhat extreme and inappropriate. </p>
<p>_____ I am out of your league; set your sights lower next time. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>(Your name)</p>

42448,"<p>It was a sunny day in the Big Apple, but a poor black preacher was having enough troubles already.  His rent was due, and his little chapel was losing so many of his fellow followers, that he was about to jump out into the street when the pastor who had been ""robbing"" him just happened to to turn the corner.  </p>
<p>""What's the matter with you, my brother?""</p>
<p>""I'm about to lose all my friends to your church and my rent is due.""</p>
<p>""Well, not much i can do about the rent, but I can give you a little help with the patrons of yo little chapel.""</p>
<p>""shoot fo'.""</p>
<p>And the rich preacher pulled out a genuine 1846 gold pocketwatch, and said proudly but softly, ""whenever yo audience is about to sleep, just sway this back and forth, and they'll do whatever you want.""</p>
<p>""can i borrow dat?""</p>
<p>""fo' sho'.""</p>
<p>The next week, the rich pastor checks in with the poor pastor, but he looks even more down in the dumps.</p>
<p>""Well?  Didn't it work?""</p>
<p>""Hey yeah it worked.""</p>
<p>""Then why so low?""</p>
<p>""Well, I tried out yo hypnosis thing, and the audience went into a trance.  I said the sermon, I swayed the medallion, and told the audience to applaud.  It was so thunderous, you couldn't do better in an opera house!  But then, the chain snapped, and I yelled, 'SHIT!'.  It'll be a miracle if we can get the chapel cleaned up!""</p>

<p>On the far side of the parking lot is a somber stone building with a small<br /> sign next to the door saying, 'Sisters of Mercy'. </p>
<p>He climbs the steps and rings the bell. The door is answered by a nun in a<br /> long black habit who asks, 'What may we do for you, my son?'</p>
<p>He answers, 'I saw your signs along the highway and was interested in possibly<br /> doing business.'</p>
<p>'Very well, my son. Please follow me.'</p>
<p>He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. The nun<br /> stops at a closed door and tells the man, 'Please knock on this door.'</p>

"
42488,"<p>Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable. No matter how<br /> legitimate my illness, I always sense my boss thinks I am lying.<br /> On one occasion, I had a valid reason, but lied anyway because<br /> the truth was too humiliating. I simply mentioned that I had<br /> sustained a head injury and I hoped I would feel up to coming in<br /> the next day. By then, I could think up a dozy to explain the<br /> bandage on my crown.</p>
<p>The accident occurred mainly because I conceded to my wife's<br /> wishes to adopt a cute little kitty. Initially the new<br /> acquisition was no problem, but one morning I was taking my<br /> shower after breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me<br /> from the kitchen. ""Ed! the garbage disposal is dead. Come reset<br /> it.""</p>
<p>""You know where the button is."" I protested through the shower<br /> (pitter-patter). ""Reset it yourself!""</p>
<p>""I am scared!"" She pleaded ""What if it starts going and sucks me<br /> in?"" (Pause) ""C'mon, it'll only take a second.""</p>
<p>So out I came, dripping wet and butt naked, hoping to make a<br /> statement about how her cowardly behavior was not without<br /> consequence. I crouched down and stuck my head under the sink to<br /> find the button. It is the last action I remember performing.</p>
<p>It struck without warning, without respect to my circumstances.<br /> Nay, it wasn't a hexed disposal drawing me into its gnashing<br /> metal teeth. It was our new kitty, clawing playfully at the<br /> dangling objects she spied between my legs. She had been poised<br /> around the corner and stalked me as I took the bait under the<br /> sink. At precisely the second I was most vulnerable, she leapt<br /> at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged them with her<br /> needle-like claws.</p>
<p>Now when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close to<br /> their masculine region, they lose all rational thought to<br /> control orderly bodily movements. Instinctively, their nerves<br /> compel the body to contort inwardly, while rising upwardly at a<br /> violent rate of speed. Not even a well trained monk could calmly<br /> stand with his groin supporting the full weight of a kitten and<br /> rectify the situation in a step-by-step manner. Wild animals are<br /> sometimes faced with a ""fight or flight"" syndrome. Men, in this<br /> predicament, choose only the ""flight"" option.</p>
<p>Fleeing straight up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels when<br /> it is alarmed. It was a dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek<br /> great heights to escape, I never made it that far. The sink and<br /> cabinet bluntly impeded my ascent; the impact knocked me out<br /> cold.</p>
<p>When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me. Having<br /> been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics snorted as they<br /> tried to conduct their work while suppressing their hysterical<br /> laughter.</p>
<p>At the office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of<br /> me. I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk. ""What's<br /> the matter, cat got your tongue?"" If they had only known.</p>

42510,"<p>A cowboy walks into a Saloon after he rode 150 miles on his horse in one day.<br /> He had a drink about two weeks ago, but he had himself a lady about two months<br /> ago. </p>
<p>He enters the saloon sits down and orders a whiskey. He sees that he is the<br /> only one in the bar except for the bartender. ""Sorry, barkeep, tell me, you got<br /> any gals around here?� the cowboy asks ""No sir, 'Round here is only you, me, and<br /> 'Old George, there attar back,"" the barkeep replies as he shows in the direction<br /> of the toilet with his head. </p>
<p>""No,"" shouts the cowboy, ""I am not that kind�s guy."" </p>
<p>So the cowboy just sits and orders another whiskey. After he had about half a<br /> bottle he asks the barkeep the same question as earlier. He gets the same<br /> answer: </p>
<p>""No sir, Round here is only you, me, and 'Old George, there attar back. Again<br /> the cowboy says, ""No way am I not that kind�s guy."" So he just drinks and<br /> drinks. </p>
<p>The more he drinks the hornier he gets. After he had about two bottles of<br /> whiskey he asks the barkeep the same question and gets the same answer. But he<br /> is so horny by now that he decides 'Old George there attar back will have to do,<br /> but he doesn't want anybody to know that he did 'Old George there attar back. </p>
<p>So he asks the barkeep: ""If I do 'Old George there attar back, who's going to<br /> know about it?"" The barkeep answers: ""Well, sir It will be me, you, 'Old George<br /> there attar back, and the four guys holding him down, 'cause he isn�t that kinds<br /> guy either!""</p>

42518,"<p>A woman goes to her boyfriend's parent's house for dinner. This is to be her first time meeting the family and she is very nervous.They all sit down and begin eating a fine meal. The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water. Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out a dainty little fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the fart. Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked over at the dog that had been snoozing at the women's feet, and said in a rather stern voice, ""Bailey!"" The woman thought, ""This is great!"", and a big smile came across her face. A couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The father again looked at the dog and said sternly, ""Get out of here Bailey!"" The dog didn't move. Once again the woman smiled and thought, ""Yes!"" A few minutes later the woman had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let rip with a fart that rivaled at train whistle blowing. Finally, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, ""Dammit, Bailey, get away from her before she shits on you!""</p>

<p>The next day the wife not too happy, returns the costume and gets a<br /> replacement. The husband comes home from work once more and there laid out on<br /> the bed was a Batman costume.

In one neat pile is a set of three white buttons, another is a white<br /> belt, and the third item is a 2 x 4 of wood. The husband yells at the wife,<br /> ""What the hell are these for?"" The wife yells back, ""You can take your clothes<br /> off and take the three white buttons and put them on the front of you and go as<br /> a domino, and if you don't like that one, you can take the belt and put it on<br /> and go as an Oreo cookie.

42532,"<p>ASTROLOGY: tells us about you and your future simply by your birthday. The Chinese Zodiac uses the year of your birth. Demographics tell us what you like, dislike, whom you vote for, what you buy, and what you watch on TV. Well, the Corporate Zodiac goes a step further: simply by your job title, people will have you all figured out... </p>
<p>MARKETING: You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and socializing, which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least compatible with Sales. </p>
<p>SALES: Laziest of all signs, often referred to as ""marketing without a degree,"" you are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with ""customers"" so you can ""concentrate on the big picture."" You seek admiration for your golf game throughout your life. </p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY: Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace. Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying, but who the hell can tell?! It is written that the geeks shall inherit the Earth. </p>
<p>ENGINEERING: One of only two signs that actually studied in school, it is said that ninety percent of all personal ads are placed by engineers. You can be happy with yourself: your office is typically full of all the latest ""ergodynamic"" gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your ""carpal tunnel""... </p>
<p>ACCOUNTING: The only other sign that studied in school, you are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the organization; combined with your extreme organizational traits, the majority of rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane. </p>
<p>HUMAN RESOURCES: Ironically, given your access to confidential information, you tend to be the biggest gossip within the organization. Possibly the only other person that does less work than marketing, you are unable to return any calls today because you have to get a haircut, have lunch, and mail a letter! </p>
<p>MIDDLE MANAGEMENT/DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT/""TEAM LEADS"": Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other ""Middle Managers,"" as everyone in your social circle is a ""Middle Manager."" </p>
<p>SENIOR MANAGEMENT: Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other ""Senior Managers,"" as everyone in your social circle is a ""Senior Manager."" </p>
<p>CUSTOMER SERVICE: Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride from taking your own life. As a child very few of you asked your parents for a little cubicle for your room and a headset so you could pretend to play ""Customer Service."" Continually passed over for promotions, your best bet is to sleep with your boss.</p>

42559,"<p>Below is a list of new drugs users of viagra have requested the me makers of viagra develop.VIAGRA-SKI Wonderful for those who have a hard time getting up on water-skis. Forty-five minutes after taking it, you'll get up and stay up, out of the water. DIRECTRA A dose of this drug given to men before leaving on car trips caused 72 percent of them to stop and ask directions when they got lost, compared to a control group of 0.2 percent. PROJECTRA Men given this experimental new drug were far more likely to actually finish a household repair project before starting anew one.CHILDAGRA Men taking this drug reported a sudden, overwhelming urge to perform more child-care tasks especially cleaning up spills and ""little accidents"". COMPLIMENTRA In clinical trials, 82 percent of middle-aged men administered this drug noticed that their wives had a new hairstyle. Currently being tested to see if its effects extend to noticing new clothing. BUYAGRA Married and otherwise attached men reported a sudden urge to buy their sweeties expensive jewelry and gifts after talking this drug for only two days. Still to be seen: whether the drug can be continued for a period longer than your favorite store's return limit. NEGA-VIAGRA Has the exact opposite effect of Viagra. Currently undergoing clinical trials on sitting U.S. presidents.NEGA-SPORTAGRA This drug had the strange effect of making men want to turn off televised sports and actually converse with other family members.FLYAGRA This drug has been showing great promise in treating men with O.F.D. (Open Fly Disorder). Especially useful for men on Viagra.PRYAGRA About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men in the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal affairs of other people. Note: Apparent over-dose turned three test subjects into special prosecutors.</p>

""My floppy drive won't work, can you help me ?"" she asked. I told her I'd take a look and proceeded over to her machine, where I found shredded up clear plastic Baggie-like stuff hanging out of her 3.5"" floppy drive. While I spent the next 20 minutes getting out her disk and digging out the plastic, I noticed two guys, John and Dave, in the hall trying awfully hard to keep straight faces. Suspecting some mischief, I asked her how the plastic got into the drive. ""Oh, you mean the condom!"", she said. ""Condom???"", I asked. ""Yes, John &amp; Dave over there told me to always put a condom on my disk before inserting it, to prevent catching viruses."" By this point, John &amp; Dave were roaring, and it was all I could do to keep from joining them. The ""condom"" turned out to be a standard 3.5"" plastic sleeve. I delicately explained to her that a practical joke had been played, and she shouldn't do that anymore, when she asked (as serious as one could be): ""Does that mean I don't have to stroke it ten times or blow on it either???""</p>

42632,"<p>There were these two vampires talking. One says to the other, ""I heard on TV that wine is good for the health."" The other one said, ""Well, let's go to Italy, then. The Italians drink lots of wine."" So they go to Italy, stand on the bridge and wait. A woman walks by, the vampires kill her, drink her blood and throw the body over the bridge. A few minutes later, a man walks by. They kill him, drink his blood and throw his body over the bridge. Then another man comes along, and they kill him too. Just as they were about to throw the body over the bridge, they hear a voice singing. The two vampires look down to see an alligator under the bridge, singing, ""Drained wops keep falling on my head...""</p>

42640,"<p>Shit is a powerful word. </p>
<p>Just think of all the concepts and ideas you can communicate with it. Shit may just be the most powerful word in the English language.</p>
<p>CONSIDER THIS: You can be shit faced, be shit out of luck, or have shit for brains. </p>
<p>With a little effort you can get your shit together, find a place for your shit or decide to shit or get off the pot. </p>
<p>You can smoke shit, buy shit, sell shit, lose shit, find shit, forget shit, and tell others to eat shit and die. </p>
<p>You can shit or go blind, have a shit fit or just shit your life away. </p>
<p>People can be shit headed, shit brained, shit blinded and shit over.</p>
<p>Some people know their shit while others can't tell the difference between shit and shineola. </p>
<p>There are lucky shits, dumb shits, crazy shits, and sweet shits. </p>
<p>There is bull shit, and horse shit and chicken shit. </p>
<p>You can throw shit, sling shit, catch shit, or duck when the shit hits the fan. </p>
<p>You can take a shit, give a shit, or serve shit on a shingle. </p>
<p>You can find yourself in deep shit, or be happier than a pig in shit. </p>
<p>Some days are colder than shit, some days are hotter than shit and some days are just plain shitty. </p>
<p>Some music sounds like shit, things can look like shit, and there are times when you feel like shit.</p>
<p>You can have too much shit, not enough shit, the right shit, the wrong shit or a lot of weird shit. </p>
<p>You can carry shit, have a mountain of shit, or find yourself up shit creek without a paddle. </p>
<p>Sometimes you really need this shit and sometimes you don't want any shit at all. </p>
<p>Sometimes everything you touch turns to shit and other times you swim in a lake of shit and come out smelling like a rose.</p>
<p>Shit! When you stop to consider all the facts, it's the basic building block of creation. </p>
<p>And remember, once you know your shit, you don't need to know anything else.</p>

<p>""I've pulled you over for speeding, Ma'me.... could I see your drivers license...?"" </p>
<p>""...What's a license...???"" replied the blonde, instantly giving away the fact that she was as dumb as a stump. </p>
<p>""It's usually in your wallet..."" replied the officer. After fumbling for a few minutes, the driver managed to find it. ""Now may I see your registration..."" asked the cop. </p>
<p>""Registration..... what's that....?"" asked the blonde. ""It's usually in your glove compartment..."" said the cop impatiently. After some more fumbling, she found the registration. ""I'll be back in a minute..."" said the cop and walked back to his car. </p>
<p>The officer phoned into the dispatch to run a check on the woman's license and registration. After a few moments, the dispatcher came back; </p>
<p>""Ummm.... is this woman driving a red sports car?"" ""Yes...."" replied the officer ""Is she a drop dead gorgeous blonde?"" asked the dispatcher ""Uh... yes"" replied the cop. </p>
<p>""Here's what you do...."" said the dispatcher. ""Give her the stuff back, and drop your pants..."" </p>
<p>""WHAT!!? I can't do that. Its..... inappropriate..."" exclaimed the cop. </p>
<p>""Trust me..... just do it...."" said the dispatcher. </p>
<p>So the cop goes back to the car, gives back the license and registration and drops his pants, just as the dispatcher said. The blonde looks down and sighs..... ""Ohh no... not ANOTHER breathalyzer......""</p>

42655,"<p>Bush and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all. They sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dogfight. They would have 5 years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk. After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 "" thick and nobody could get near it. When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a strange looking animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the Afghanistani dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it's cage, and slowly waddled over towards Osama's dog. Osama's dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged the American Dachshund---but when it got close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed Osama's dog in one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all. Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, ""We don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves."" ""That's nothing,"", said Bush. ""We had Michael Jackson's plastic surgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog."" GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>$ He'll make $3,710 while watching each episode of Friends.</p>

The man<br /> passed on the offer and climbed the next ladder. On the next<br /> cloud he saw an attractive lady and a ladder leading up to<br /> another cloud. She said, ""Fuck me now, or climb the ladderto<br /> success."" The man passed on the offer and climbed the next<br /> ladder. He noticed that the general pattern was the higher he<br /> went, the better the chicks got. So he climbed untill he reached<br /> a drop dead gorgous woman sitting on the cloud naked.  She said<br /> ""Fuck me now or climb to success."" He couldn't imagin what was<br /> on the next cloud (probably a better chick!), so he climbed.

42732,"<p>Once upon a time, a perfect man and a perfect woman met.  After a perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding.  Their life together was, of course, perfect. </p>
<p>One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving their perfect car (a Grand Caravan) along a winding road when they noticed someone at the side of the road in distress.  Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help.  There stood Santa Claus, with a huge bundle of toys.</p>
<p>Not wanting to disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle.</p>
<p>Soon they were driving along delivering toys. Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated, and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident.  Only one of them survived the accident.  The question is:  Who was the survivor?  Scroll down for the answer.</p>
<p>The perfect woman survived.  She's the only one that existed in the first place.  Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and no such thing as a perfect man.</p>
<p>***Women stop here.  That is the end of the joke.<br /> ***Men keep scrolling</p>
<p>So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect woman must have been driving, and that explains why there was a car accident.  </p>
<p>By the way, if you're a woman and you're reading this, this illustrates another point: Women never listen.</p>

<p>Dozens of celebrities turned out including Mrs. Butterworth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Aunt Jemima, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Skippy. The graveside was piled high with flours as longtime friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who ""never knew how much he was kneaded.""</p>
<p>Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with many turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes -- conned by those who buttered him up.</p>
<p>Still, even as a crusty old man, he was a roll model for millions. Fresh is survived by his second wife. They have two children and another bun in the oven. The funeral was held at 350 for about 20 minutes.</p>

42753,"<p>This guy has always dreamed of owning a Harley Davidson. One day he has finally saved enough money, so he goes down to the dealer. After he picks up the perfect bike, the dealer tells him about an old biker trick that will keep the chrome on his new bike free from rust.</p>
<p>The dealer tells him that all he has to do is to keep a jar of Vaseline handy and put it on the chrome before it rains and everything will be fine. He happily pays for the bike and leaves.</p>
<p>After a couple of months he meets a lady and she asks him to take her home to meet her parents over dinner. He readily accepts and the date is set. At the appointed time he picks her up on his Harley and they ride to her parents' house. </p>
<p>Before they go in, she tells him that they have a family tradition that whoever speaks first after dinner must do the dishes.</p>
<p>After a delicious dinner everyone sits in silence waiting for the first person to speak and get stuck doing the dishes. After a long 15 minutes the young man decides to speed things up, so he reaches over and kisses the girl in front of her family. No one says a word.</p>
<p>Emboldened, he throws her on the table and has sex with her in front of everyone. No one says a word. Now he is getting desperate, so he grabs her mother and throws her on the table. They have even wilder sex. No one says a word.</p>
<p>By now he is thinking of what to do next when he hears thunder in the distance. His first thought is to protect the chrome on his Harley, so he reaches into his pocket and pulls out his jar of Vaseline.</p>
<p>And the father shouts, 'Okay damn it, I'll do the dishes.'</p>

42759,"<p>It was about 2:00 A.M, and a man had just left the bar and was<br /> walking home when he heard steady footsteps behind him.  Being a<br /> little nervous, the man began to walk quicker...so the did<br /> footsteps.  The man turned around and saw a coffin following<br /> him.  He quickened his pace more...and so did the coffin.  The<br /> man was now terrified and started to run home.  He looked to see<br /> if the coffin was still behind him, and it was.  The man was<br /> only a few yards from his front door.  When he got to the door,<br /> he opened it, slammed it and locked it.  He stood back to look<br /> at the door, not knowing what else to do.  The coffin began to<br /> knock on the door forcefully, and all of a sudden, the coffin<br /> broke the door down and came after the man.  The man ran<br /> upstairs into the bathroom, slammed and locked the door.  The<br /> coffin broke through that door and began opening and shutting<br /> it's lid at the man.  The man looked for something to defend<br /> himself, so he opened the medecine cabinet.  The only thing he<br /> could find was a bottle of cough syrup, so he threw it inside<br /> the coffin.  The coffin stopped.</p>

42787,"<p>Dear Son,</p>
<p>I am writing this slow, 'cause I know you can't read fast. We<br /> don't live where we did when you left. Your dad read in the<br /> paper where most accidents happen within twenty miles of home so<br /> we moved. This place has a washing machine. The first day I put<br /> your shirts in it, I pulled the chain, and haven't seen them<br /> since.</p>
<p>It only rained twice this week. Three days the first time, and<br /> four days the second. The coat you wanted me to send you, your<br /> aunt Sue said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail<br /> with them big heavy buttons, so we cut them off and put them in<br /> the pockets. We got a bill from the funeral home, said if we<br /> didn't make the last payment on Grandma's funeral bill, up she<br /> comes. Your uncle John fell in the whiskey vat, some men tried<br /> to pull him out, but he fought then off playfully, so he<br /> drowned. We cremated him. He burned for three days.</p>
<p>Three of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup, one was<br /> driving, the other two were in the back. The driver got out, he<br /> rolled down the window and swam to safety. The other two<br /> drowned, they couldn't get the tailgate down.</p>
<p>Not much more news this time. Nothing much has happened. Write<br /> more later.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Mom</p>

42795,"<p>A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his graduate<br /> students. It had one question:</p>
<p>""Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?<br /> Support your answer with a proof.""</p>
<p>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas<br /> cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some<br /> variant.</p>
<p>One student, however, wrote the following:<br /> First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we<br /> need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are<br /> leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell,<br /> it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls<br /> are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the<br /> world today.</p>
<p>Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their<br /> religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these<br /> religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can<br /> project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death<br /> rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase<br /> exponentially.</p>
<p>Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's<br /> Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay<br /> the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives<br /> two possibilities.</p>
<p>#1 If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter<br /> Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all<br /> Hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>#2 Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of<br /> souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell<br /> freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by<br /> Ms. Laura Turner during my Freshman year, ""That it will be a cold night<br /> in Hell before I sleep with you,"" and take into account the fact that I<br /> still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then #2<br /> cannot be true, and so Hell is exothermic.</p>
<p>The student got the only A.</p>

<p>Why do all balcks have nightmares?</p>
<p>Because we killed the only one with a dream</p>
"
42798,"<p>Why won't men ever pick up after themselves?<br /> Why should we? It doesn't really bother us that much. Besides, we know darn well you'll pick it up. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> What's with all the belching and farting?<br /> This usually only occurs after months of courting. It's our way to let you know that we're comfortable with you. Believe it or not, it's actually a sign of affection. Besides, holding it for extended periods of time gives us stomach cramps. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men hate shopping?<br /> It's an evolutionary thing. Men hunt. Women gather. We just want to go out, kill it, and bring it back. Who wants to spend hours and hours to look at things we have no intention of killing? err... Buying? </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why can't men ever leave the toilet seat down?<br /> Have you ever seen one of us pee? The proper position of the toilet seat is up. Mathematically speaking, the proper position of the toilet seat is a function of the time spent peeing over the time spent sitting. The closer that ratio approaches one, the truer the proposition. Besides, it's actually a courtesy that we lift the seat. Why would we care if we pee all over the seat. You're the ones that have to sit on it. You should appreciate the fact that we actually lift the darn thing. We aim to please. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men find blonde bimbos attractive?<br /> Are you kidding? Even leaving the physical aside, blonde bimbos are generally much easier to get along (alone) with. They like having fun and doing exciting things. They don't walk around with the weight of the world on their shoulders. They don't ever give us a hard time for being a dumb male; and plus they laugh at most of our jokes (even the ones they don't get). What more could any of us males ask for? </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men act like they own the remote control?<br /> What do you mean act? We do; possession is nine tenth of the law. Besides, it is an awesome responsibility not to be entrusted to just anyone. I believe the only fair way to decide who gets the remote control is to arm wrestle for it. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why can't men stay on a single channel for more than two seconds?<br /> Are you kidding? What if there is something good on the next channel? We could miss it if we stay on one channel for too long. (See also: Why do men fear commitment?) </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men fear commitment?<br /> Don't be so surprised. Yes; most of us do know what 'commitment' means and can spell it correctly. It's like an automobile. No matter how good you think this year's model is, they're always coming out with newer, faster, better, sleeker, and sexier models. We simply cannot be expected to purchase the first one we see. We must browse around a bit and test drive a few. Who wants to end up with a lemon? At least a car, there's a slight chance of it eventually becoming a classic. It simply makes much more sense to lease and upgrade to the younger... err... I mean newer models every couple of years. Some of them come with fun extras like dual air bags. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> What does it mean when men say, ""I'm just not ready for a relationship right now"" or ""I don't want a girl friend?""<br /> It means that we like you enough to sleep with you, but not enough so that we want to see you repeatedly. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> What does it mean when men say, ""Can we just be friends?""<br /> Generally, it means that the recipient of said comment is physically repulsive enough that no beer goggles may be thick enough to provide adequate protection. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Do all men really masturbate?<br /> Yes. It is genetically inherited behavior. It's been passed on from our most primal forefathers, and it'll be passed on to our sons. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men generally have greater upper body strength?<br /> Several factors are at work, namely evolution, heredity, nutrition, and environment. (See also: Do all men really masturbate?) </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men generally have better hand-eye or spatial coordinate motor coordination?<br /> It is like with all things. Practice... Practice... Practice... (See also: Do all men really masturbate?) </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why are men so obsessed with beautiful women?<br /> As opposed to what? Really ugly women? Face it, if men were obsessed with ugly women, there would be just as much bitching about why men are so obsessed with ugly women. No matter how you set this up, some people are always going to be left out. I don't see anyone screaming about equal treatment for the stupid people either. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men like younger women?<br /> Well, let's see. Besides the fact that they like older men, they're easily impressed. They're also perky, energetic, and come with very little baggage. And gravity has less prevail over their bodies. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men only have one thing on their minds?<br /> While technically correct, this statement is not strictly true. We may only be able to entertain one idea at a time, but we do think of lots of other things besides sex, such as sports and beer. We also get hungry quite often. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> How can men possibly find that other woman attractive (i.e. whatever do you see in that fat pig)?<br /> Even if you happen to be Cindy Crawford, once we get the idea that you are ours, other women suddenly become much more attractive and you lose a few attractiveness points. I'm a bit puzzled by this one myself. I think evolution is to blame. We men are just innocent bystanders in the war of the selfish genes. You should love us despite our inherent weakness. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why are men such dogs?<br /> I resent that. Dogs are faithful... loyal... affectionate... and obedient...</p>

I ran to the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but it broke down, found a farm, bought a horse but it dropped dead, ran 10 miles, and now I'm here."" The General was very skeptical about this explanation but at least he was here so he let the G.I. go. Moments later, eight more G.I.s came up to the general panting, he asked them why they were late. ""Sorry, sir! I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but it broke down, found a farm, bought a horse but it dropped dead, ran 10 miles, and now I'm here."" The General eyed them, feeling very skeptical but since he let the first guy go, he let them go, too. A ninth G.I. jogged up to the General, panting heavily. ""Sorry, sir! I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but..."" ""Let me guess,"" the General interrupted, ""it broke down."" ""No,"" said the G.I., ""there were so many dead horses in the road, it took forever to get around them.""</p>

42815,"<p>A college student was in a philosophy class which had a discussion about God's existence. The professor presented the following logic: ""Has anyone in this class heard God?"" </p>
<p>Nobody spoke. </p>
<p>""Has anyone in this class touched God?"" </p>
<p>Again, nobody spoke. ""Has anyone in this class seen God?"" </p>
<p>When nobody spoke for the third time, he simply stated, ""Then there is no God."" </p>
<p>One student thought for a second, and then asked for permission to reply. Curious to hear this bold student's response, the professor granted it, and the student stood up and asked the following questions of his classmates: ""Has anyone in this class heard our professor's brain?"" </p>
<p>Silence. </p>
<p>""Has anyone in this class touched our professor's brain?"" </p>
<p>silence. </p>
<p>""Has anyone in this class seen our professor's brain?"" </p>
<p>When nobody in the class dared to speak, the student concluded, ""Then, according to our professor's logic, it must be true that our professor has no brain!""</p>

42832,"<p>A successful businessman flew to Vegas for the weekend to gamble.  He lost the shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter  and the second half of his round-trip ticket --  If he could just get to the airport he could get himself home. So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting.  He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home, he offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, etc. but to no avail.The cabbie said, 'If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!' So the businessman was forced to hitch-hike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight.One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck.The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan.  The businessman got in the first cab in the line, 'How much for a ride to the airport,' he asked? 'Fifteen bucks,' came the reply. 'And how much for you to give me a blow job on the way?'  'What?! Get the hell out of my cab.'The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result. When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked 'How much for a ride to the airport?' The cabbie replied 'fifteen bucks.'The businessman said 'ok' and off they went.Then, as the drove slowly past the long line of cabs the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs up sign to each driver.</p>

Wanting to do something totally different from his current occupation, he bought a mating pair of rheas and a large tract of land. His rhea farm was soon doing a booming business as there appeared to be a great demand for the birds. Not being satisfied with just selling the birds, the rhea farmer started researching how the birds were being used. He found that all parts of the birds were being utilized, except the feathers. Nobody wanted the plainly colored rhea feathers. The ex-programmer, now rhea farmer, purchased some equipment, technical people, and chemicals, and was soon selling fancy, colored rhea feathers. The resulting sales were amazing and made the new feather merchant very happy. There was one small problem. The workers making the colored feathers were becoming quite ill.

42851,"<p>College is basically a bunch of rooms where you sit for roughly two thousand hours and try to memorize things. The two thousand hours are spread out over four years; you spend the rest of the time sleeping and trying to get dates. </p>
<p>Basically, you learn two kinds of things in college: </p>
<p>1. Things you will need to know in later life (two hours).<br /> 2. Things you will not need to know in later life (1,998 hours). </p>
<p>These are the things you learn in classes whose names end in -ology, -osophy, -istry, -ics, and so on. The idea is, you memorize these things, then write them down in little exam books, then forget them. If you fail to forget them, you become a professor and have to stay in college for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>It's very difficult to forget everything. For example, when I was in college, I had to memorize -- don't ask me why -- the names of three metaphysical poets other than John Donne. I have managed to forget one of them, but I still remember that the other two were named Vaughan and Crashaw. Sometimes, when I'm trying to remember something important like whether my wife told me to get tuna packed in oil or tuna packed in water, Vaughan and Crashaw just pop up in my mind, right there in the supermarket. It's a terrible waste of brain cells. </p>
<p>After you've been in college for a year or so, you're supposed to choose a major, which is the subject you intend to memorize and forget the most things about. Here is a very important piece of advice: be sure to choose a major that does not involve Known Facts and Right Answers. This means you must not major in mathematics, physics, biology, or chemistry, because these subjects involve actual facts. If, for example, you major in mathematics, you're going to wander into class one day and the professor will say: ""Define the cosine integer of the quadrant of a rhomboid binary axis, and extrapolate your result to five significant vertices."" If you don't come up with exactly the answer the professor has in mind, you fail. The same is true of chemistry: if you write in your exam book that carbon and hydrogen combine to form oak, your professor will flunk you. He wants you to come up with the same answer he and all the other chemists have agreed on. </p>
<p>Scientists are extremely snotty about this. </p>
<p>So you should major in subjects like English, philosophy, psychology, and sociology -- subjects in which nobody really understands what anybody else is talking about, and which involve virtually no actual facts. I attended classes in all these subjects, so I'll give you a quick overview of each: </p>
<p>ENGLISH: This involves writing papers about long books you have read little snippets of just before class. Here is a tip on how to get good grades on your English papers: Never say anything about a book that anybody with any common sense would say. For example, suppose you are studying Moby-Dick. Anybody with any common sense would say that Moby-Dick is a big white whale, since the characters in the book refer to it as a big white whale roughly eleven thousand times. So in your paper, you say Moby-Dick is actually the Republic of Ireland. </p>
<p>Your professor, who is sick to death of reading papers and never liked Moby-Dick anyway, will think you are enormously creative. If you can regularly come up with lunatic interpretations of simple stories, you should major in English. </p>
<p>PHILOSOPHY: Basically, this involves sitting in a room and deciding there is no such thing as reality and then going to lunch. You should major in philosophy if you plan to take a lot of drugs. </p>
<p>PSYCHOLOGY: This involves talking about rats and dreams. Psychologists are obsessed with rats and dreams. I once spent an entire semester training a rat to punch little buttons in a certain sequence, then training my roommate to do the same thing. The rat learned much faster. My roommate is now a doctor. If you like rats or dreams, and above all if you dream about rats, you should major in psychology. </p>
<p>SOCIOLOGY: For sheer lack of intelligibility, sociology is far and away the number one subject. I sat through hundreds of hours of sociology courses, and read gobs of sociology writing, and I never once heard or read a coherent statement. This is because sociologists want to be considered scientists, so they spend most of their time translating simple, obvious observations into scientific-sounding code. If you plan to major in sociology, you'll have to learn to do the same thing. For example, suppose you have observed that children cry when they fall down. You should write: ""Methodological observation of the sociometrical behavior tendencies of prematurated isolates indicates that a casual relationship exists between groundward tropism and lachrimatory, or 'crying,' behavior forms."" If you can keep this up for fifty or sixty pages, you will get a large government grant.</p>

42854,"<p>A slightly retarded farmer has a farm up the coast of California. Unfortunately, there are no women around. He gets rather desperate, and decides to try out an old mule. He puts a stepladder behind the mule, lowers his pants, but then the mule walks forward. The farmer gets down off the ladder, moves it forward, and tries again, with the same outcome. </p>
<p>This process goes on for about 5 more iterations, until he finally gets the idea to lead the mule up to the ocean, so the mule can't walk away. When he gets on the ladder again, he hears a cry for help out to sea, and sees a drowning woman flailing her arms. He jumps off the ladder, swims out to rescue her, and drags her back in. The woman is totally nude, beautiful, and stacked as well. </p>
<p>After he revives her and nurses her back to health, she gazes into his eyes with her limpid blue eyes, and says </p>
<p>""Oh sir! I'm so thankful to you for saving my life! I'll do anything to repay you! Anything!!"" </p>
<p>So he says to her; ""Could you hold that mule for me?""</p>

<p>The teacher is first, and St. Peter asks, �Name the famous ship that was sunk<br /> by an iceberg?� �Phew, that one's easy,� says the teacher, �The Titanic.� �<br /> Alright,� said St.Peter, �you may pass.�</p>
<p>Then the thief got his question: �How many died on the Titanic?� The thief<br /> replied, �That's a toughy, but fortunately I just saw the movie. The answer is<br /> 1500 people.� And so he passed through. Last, St. Peter gave the lawyer his<br /> question: �Name them.�</p>

42886,"<p>Ho Ho Ho,</p>
<p>""Hello out there all people of the world.""</p>
<p>This is Santa and I just wanted to let you know that Christmas may be a little late this year. See after checking all the boxes and tallying them up, I found some problems with the results.</p>
<p>The first result showed:</p>
<p>428,534,120 Good </p>
<p>428,523,119 Bad </p>
<p>The second result showed:</p>
<p>428,534,118 Good </p>
<p>428,523,121 Bad </p>
<p>So you see, I can't, with good faith, go out and deliver presents while knowing I could have made a mistake. Maybe Little Johnny was good for once, then again, maybe not.</p>
<p>So, I have enlisted the help of all my elves and the Mrs. To help do a recount. We hope to have this finished up by 5pm on the 24th of December, but there is a possibility that it might take longer. You see the tally cards were not quite clear to me, although I made them my-self, I forgot what they meant. </p>
<p>You know, Good...and Bad??? And the check marks I used were not all the same, some went left, some right, some were just a mark. some went through both boxes, and some didn't even have much of a mark on them. I leave it up to them to decide what I meant.</p>
<p>So if you wake up on Christmas morning, and there are no presents under your tree, at least you can tell the kids the story. Thank you for your patience and understanding in these times, </p>

She looks at the seats in coach and then looks into the forward cabin at the first class seats. Seeing that the first class seats appear to be much larger and more comfortable, she moves forward to the last empty one. The flight attendant checks her ticket and tells the woman that her seat is in coach. The blonde replies, ''I'm young, blonde and beautiful, and I'm going to sit here all the way to New York.'' Flustered, the flight attendant goes to the cockpit and informs the captain of the blonde problem. The captain goes back and tells the woman that her assigned seat is in coach. Again, the blonde replies, ''I'm young, blonde and beautiful, and I'm going to sit here all the way to New York.'' The captain doesn't want to cause a commotion, and so returns to the cockpit to discuss the blonde with the co-pilot. The co-pilot says that he has a blonde girlfriend, and that he can take care of the problem. He then goes back and briefly whispers something into the blonde's ear. She immediately gets up, says, ''Thank you so much.'' hugs the co-pilot, and rushes back to her seat in the coach section. The pilot and flight attendant, who were watching with rapt attention, together ask the co-pilot what he had said to the woman. He replies, ''I just told her that the first class section isn't going to New York.''</p>

42914,"<p>RECEIVED FROM AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR: </p>
<p>This assignment was actually turned in by two of my English students:<br /> In-class assignment for Wednesday: Tandem Story. Each person will pair off with the person sitting next to them. One of you will then write the first paragraph of a short story. The partner will read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story. The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so on until both people agree a conclusion has been reached.

<p>At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. The camomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who had once said in happier times, that he liked camomile. But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl. His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again. So camomile was out of the question. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Advance Team Captain Carl Harris was leading his patrol squadron into orbit over Skylon 4. Carl had more important things to think about than the neuroses of that air-headed asthmatic woman named Laurie who, after one sweaty night over three months ago, was still desperately clinging to an illusion of a relationship she had fabricated in her unbalanced mind. ""Alpha Tango One to Geostation One-Niner-Three"", he said into his subspace communicator. ""Polar orbit established. No sign of resistance..."" But before he could sign off a bluish plasma beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay. The jolt from the direct hit threw him out of his seat and into the cockpit control panel. </p>
<p>He hit his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him. Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4. ""Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel"", Laurie read in her newspaper one morning. The news simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth -- when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree, with no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her. ""Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?"" she pondered wistfully. </p>
<p>Little did she know, but she has less than 10 seconds to live. Thousands of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian battleship launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles. The dim-witted, bleeding-heart peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through the U.N. had left Earth a defenseless target for the hostile alien empire who was determined to enslave the human race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet and nothing to stop them.

The receptionist suggested they set up an appointment for a convenient time for the spinster to come into the office. The woman replied, ""You must understand, I've lived alone all my life, I rarely see anyone, and I don't like to go out. Would it be possible for the lawyer to come to my house?""The receptionist checked with the attorney who agreed and he went to the spinster's home for the meeting to discuss her estate and the will.The lawyer's first question was, ""Would you please tell me what you have in assets and how you'd like them to be distributed under your will?""She replied, ""Besides the furniture and accessories you see here, I have $40,000 in my savings account at the bank.""""Tell me,"" the lawyer asked, ""how would you like the $40,000 to be distributed?""The spinster said, ""Well, as I've told you, I've lived a reclusive life, people have hardly ever noticed me, so I'd like them to notice when I pass on. I'd like to provide $35,000 for my funeral.""The lawyer remarked, ""Well, for $35,000 you will be able to have a funeral that will certainly be noticed and will leave a lasting impression on anyone who may not have taken much note of you! But tell me,"" he continued, what would you like to do with the remaining $5,000?""The spinster replied, ""As you know, I've never married, I've lived alone almost my entire life, and in fact I've never slept with a man. I'd like you to use the $5,000 to arrange for a man to sleep with me.""""This is a very unusual request,"" the lawyer said, adding, ""but I'll see what I can do to arrange it and get back to you.""That evening, the lawyer was at home telling his wife about the eccentric spinster and her weird request. After thinking about how much she could do around the house with $5,000, and with a bit of coaxing, she got her husband to agree to provide the service himself. She said, ""I'll drive you over tomorrow morning, and wait in the car until you're finished.""The next morning, she drove him to the spinster's house and waited while he went into the house. She waited for over an hour, but her husband didn't come out. So she blew the car horn.Shortly, the upstairs bedroom window opened, the lawyer stuck his head out and yelled, ""Pick me up tomorrow, she's going to let the County bury her!""</p>

<p>With a one hour lunch period each day, you have used up another 46 days, leaving only 22 days available for work.</p>

They get to the 7th<br /> hole, which is a long par 5 with a creek running across it at about 240 yards.<br /> Jesus gets up to tee off and selects his driver. Moses asks Jesus if he is going<br /> to try to drive across the creek and Jesus says that he is feeling so good that<br /> he thinks he can make it. So Jesus tees off and it is a long drive but it lands<br /> in the middle of the creek. Jesus asks Moses to part the water of the creek so<br /> he can retrieve his ball saying, ""You know how much I hate to lose a ball."" So<br /> Moses parts the waters of the creek and the ball is retrieved. Jesus tees it up<br /> again and because he is Jesus he gets unlimited mulligans. Jesus<br /> says he is going to try to drive the creek again. Moses<br /> responds, ""Ok, but I am not going to help you get it back again!"" Jesus hits<br /> tee shot again and sure enough kerr plop it lands in the creek again. So he goes<br /> down and is walking on the water looking for his ball.</p>
<p>Meanwhile back at the tee the following foursome has reached the tee. </p>

42963,"<p>""Fuck"" Perhaps one of the most interesting and colorful words in<br /> the English language today is the word ""fuck"". It is the one<br /> magical word which, just by its sound, can describe pain,<br /> pleasure, love, and hate.</p>
<p>In language, ""fuck"" falls into many grammatical categories. It<br /> can be used as a verb, both transitive (John fucked Mary) and<br /> intransitive (Mary was fucked by John). It can be an action verb<br /> (John really gives a fuck), a passive verb (Mary really doesn't<br /> give a fuck), an adverb (Mary is fucking interested in John), or<br /> as a noun (Mary is a terrific fuck).</p>
<p>It can also be used as an adjective (Mary is fucking beautiful)<br /> or an interjection (Fuck! I'm late for my date with Mary). It<br /> can even be used as a conjunction (Mary is easy, fuck she's also<br /> stupid). As you can see, there are very few words with the<br /> overall versatility of the word ""fuck""..</p>
<p>Aside from its sexual connotations, this incredible word can be<br /> used to describe many situations:</p>
<p>1.  Greetings      ""How the fuck are ya?""<br /> 2.  Fraud          ""I got fucked by the car dealer.""<br /> 3.  Resignation    ""Oh, fuck it!""<br /> 4.  Trouble        ""I guess I'm fucked now.""<br /> 5.  Aggression     ""Fuck you!""<br /> 6.  Disgust        ""Fuck me.""<br /> 7.  Confusion      ""What the fuck.......?""<br /> 8.  Difficulty     ""I don't understand this fucking business!""<br /> 9.  Despair        ""Fucked again...""<br /> 10. Pleasure       ""I fucking couldn't be happier.""<br /> 11. Displeasure    ""What the fuck is going on here?""<br /> 12. Lost           ""Where the fuck are we.""<br /> 13. Disbelief      ""Unfuckingbeliveable!""<br /> 14. Retaliation    ""Up your fucking ass!""<br /> 15. Denial         ""I didn't fucking do it.""<br /> 16. Perplexity     ""I know fuck all about it.""<br /> 17. Apathy         ""Who really gives a fuck, anyhow?""<br /> 18. Greetings      ""How the fuck are ya?""<br /> 19. Suspicion      ""Who the fuck are you?""<br /> 20. Panic          ""Let's get the fuck out of here.""<br /> 21. Directions     ""Fuck off.""<br /> 22. Disbelief      ""How the fuck did you do that?""</p>
<p>It can be used in an anatomical description- ""He's a fucking<br /> asshole.""<br /> It can be used to tell time- ""It's five fucking thirty.""<br /> It can be used in business- ""How did I wind up with this fucking<br /> job?""<br /> It can be maternal- ""Motherfucker.""<br /> It can be political- ""Fuck Dan Quayle!""</p>
<p>It has also been used by many notable people throughout history:</p>
<p>""What the fuck was that?""<br />                    Mayor of Hiroshima</p>
<p>""Where did all these fucking Indians come from?""<br />                    General Custer</p>
<p>""Where the fuck is all this water coming from?""<br />                    Captain of the Titanic</p>

<p>Teaching Math in 1960:<br /> A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His<br /> cost of production is 4/5 of the price, or $80. What<br /> is his profit?    </p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1970:<br /> A logger exchanges a set ""L"" of lumber for a set ""M""<br /> of money.  The cardinality of set ""M"" is 100. Each<br /> element is worth one dollar. Make 100 dots<br /> representing the elements of the set ""M"".  The set<br /> ""C"", the cost of production contains 20 fewer points<br /> than set ""M"". Represent the set ""C"" as a subset of set<br /> ""M"" and answer the following question: What is the<br /> cardinality of the set ""P"" of profits?    </p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1980:<br /> A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His<br /> cost of production is $80 and his profit is $20. Your<br /> assignment: Underline the number 20.    </p>

<p>Teaching Math in 1996:<br /> By laying off  402 of its loggers, a company improves<br /> its stock price from $80 to $100. How much capital<br /> gain per share does the CEO make by exercising his<br /> stock options at $80. Assume capital gains are no<br /> longer taxed, because this encourages investment.    </p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1997:<br /> A company outsources all of its loggers. They save on<br /> benefits and when demand for their product is down the<br /> logging work force can easily be cut back. The average<br /> logger employed by the company earned $50,000, had 3<br /> weeks vacation, received a nice retirement plan and<br /> medical insurance.  The contracted logger charges $50<br /> an hour. Was outsourcing a good move?    </p>
<p>Teaching Math in 1998:<br /> A logging company exports its wood-finishing jobs to<br /> its Indonesian subsidiary and lays off the<br /> corresponding half of its US workers (the higher-paid<br /> half).  It clear-cuts 95% of the forest, leaving the<br /> rest for the spotted owl, and lays off all its<br /> remaining US workers. It tells the workers that the<br /> spotted owl is responsible for the absence of fellable<br /> trees and lobbies Congress for exemption from the<br /> Endangered Species Act.  Congress instead exempts the<br /> company from all federal regulation.  What is the<br /> return on investment of the lobbying costs?</p>

42976,"<p>Legend has it that there is a bar in New York where, in the ladies room there is a very special mirror. If one stands in front of the mirror and tells the truth, one wish is granted. However, if one tells a lie--*poof*-- you are instantly swallowed up by the mirror, never to be seen again. </p>
<p>So, a redhead of questionable looks walks into the ladies room and stands before the mirror and says, ""I think I'm the most beautiful woman in the world."" --*poof*-- The mirror swallows her. </p>
<p>Next a rather large brunette stands before the mirror and says, ""I think I'm the sexiest woman alive."" --*poof*-- The mirror swallows her. </p>
<p>Then an absolutely gorgeous blonde comes in and stands before the mirror and says, ""I think. . . ."" --*poof*--</p>

42987,"<p>Two ship captains were sitting at the bar one night getting good and lit when one turned to the other and said, ""You know what gets me, though, is these damn sailors! Oh sure, they're fine for the first few weeks, but on those three-month trips at sea they start getting pretty hard up. With all the whacking off going on, it's a wonder any work is getting done, and it's making a mess all over the ship. I don't know what to do!""The other captain smiles knowingly at his companion.""Oldest trick in the book. You take the crew and divide them into two teams. Then you buy about 50 barrels and put them on the ship. You tell the crew that the team that fills the most barrels wins a bag of gold.""""Well that's a great way to keep the ship clean, but then I'm out a bag of gold every trip!""""Not so,"" replied the other captain.""After you get back to port, take all the barrels together and sell them to the wax factory to make into candles. You make a tidy profit every time.""The captain pondered this and the next day, he took his friend's advice and divided the crew, bought a bunch of barrels, and set off to sea. Before long, the crew took to the new system and began filling barrel after barrel. When they finally reached port, the captain sold the barrels for a huge profit. 'This is great,' thought the captain, 'before long, I'll be able to buy a new boat!'This went on, voyage after voyage. Then one day, the ship happened back to that very first port. Coming down the gangplank, the captain was surprised to see the cops waiting for him. As they slapped the cuffs on him, the captain cried out, ""What's the meaning of this?!""""You sick bastard,"" replied the cop.""Remember all those barrels you sold to the candle factory last time you passed through town?""""Sure,"" said the captain.""What about 'em?!""""Well, they made them into candles, sold them to the convent, and now all the nuns are pregnant!""</p>
