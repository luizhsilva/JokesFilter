7008,"<p>There's this guy who's in the market for a used motorcycle. Always wanted a nice big hog. So he's shopping around, answering ads in the newspaper,and not having much luck. One day he comes across a beautiful classic harley with a ""for sale"" sign on it. Upon inspection, he is amazed to find the bike in mint condition. He inquires about it with the owner: ""This bike is beautiful!! I'll take it. But you gotta tell me how you keep it in such good shape.""<br /> ""Well,"" says the seller, ""it's pretty simple. Just make sure that if the bike is outside and it's going to rain, rub vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain. In fact, since you're buying the bike I won't need my tube of vaseline anymore. Here, you can have it."" and he hands the buyer a tube of vaseline. </p>
<p>So the guy buys the bike and off he goes, a happy biker. He takes the bike over to show his girlfriend. She's ecstatic (being a harley fan). That night, he decides to ride the bike over to his girlfriend's parents house. See, it's the first time he's going to meet them and figures it will make a big impression. When the couple gets to the house, the girlfriend grabs her boyfriend's arm. </p>
<p>""Honey,"" she says,"" I gotta tell you something about my parents before we go in. When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes."" </p>
<p>""No problem,"" he says. And in they go. The boyfriend is astounded. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the family room, a huge stack of dishes. Piled up the stairs, dirty dishes. In fact, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes. </p>
<p>They sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word. As dinner progresses, the boyfriend decides to take advantage of the situation. So he reaches over, grabs his girlfriend, strips her naked, and they make it on the dinner table. Of course no one says a word. </p>
<p>""Her Mom's gotta good bod..."", he thinks. So he grabs his girlfriend's Mom and ravishes her right there on the dinner table. Again, no one says a word. Then, the boyfriend notices it starting to rain, he better take care of the motorcycle. He pulls the vaseline from his pocket. The father stands up and shouts: </p>
<p>""All right, I'll do the f@(#ing dishes!!""</p>

7029,"<p>She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful, brown haired,<br /> freckled-faced image of innocence. Her mom looked like someone<br /> from the Walton's or a moment captured by Norman Rockwell. Not<br /> that she was old-fashioned. Her brown hair was ear length with<br /> enough curl to appear natural. She had on a pair of tan shorts<br /> and light blue knit shirt. Her sneakers were white with a blue<br /> trim. She looked like a mom.</p>
<p>It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the<br /> tops of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has<br /> no time to flow down the spout. Drains in the nearby parking lot<br /> were filled to capacity and some were blocked so that huge<br /> puddles laked around parked cars. We all stood there under the<br /> awning and just inside the door of the Walmart. We waited, some<br /> patiently, others aggravated because nature messed up their<br /> hurried day. </p>
<p>I am always mesmerized by rain fall. I get lost in the sound and<br /> sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the<br /> world. </p>
<p>Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child come<br /> pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day. Her<br /> voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all<br /> caught in. </p>
<p>""Mom, let's run through the rain,"" she said.<br /> ""What?"" Mom asked.<br /> ""Let's run through the rain!"" she repeated.<br /> ""No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit,"" Mom replied.<br /> This young child waited about another minute and repeated her<br /> statement.<br /> ""Mom. Let's run through the rain.""<br /> ""We'll get soaked if we do,"" Mom said.<br /> ""No we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning,"" the<br /> young girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm.<br /> ""This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and<br /> not get wet?""<br /> ""Don't you remember? When you were talking to daddy about his<br /> cancer, you said, ""If God can get us through this, He can get us<br /> through anything!""</p>
<p>The entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear, you couldn't hear<br /> anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or<br /> left in the next few minutes. Mom paused and thought for a<br /> moment about what she would say.</p>
<p>Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some<br /> might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of<br /> affirmation in a young child's life. A time when innocent trust<br /> can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith.</p>
<p>""Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If<br /> God lets us get wet, well maybe we just needed washing,"" Mom<br /> said.</p>
<p>Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing<br /> as they darted past the cars and yes through the puddles. They<br /> held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got<br /> soaked. But they were followed by a few believers who screamed<br /> and laughed like children all the way to their cars.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by their faith and trust. I want to believe<br /> that somewhere down the road in life, mom will find herself<br /> reflecting back on moments they spent together, captured like<br /> pictures in the scrapbook of her cherished memories.</p>
<p>Maybe when she watches proudly as her daughter graduates. Or as<br /> her daddy walks her down the aisle on her wedding day. She will<br /> laugh again. Her heart will beat a little faster. Her smile will<br /> tell the world they love each other.</p>
<p>But only two people will share that precious moment when they<br /> ran through the rain believing that God would get them through.<br /> And, yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing.</p>

7080,"<p>�POR QU� EL POLLO CRUZ� LA CARRETERA?</p>
<p>Respuestas:</p>
<p>PROFESOR DE PRIMARIA: Porque quer�a llegar al otro lado.</p>
<p>PLAT�N: Porque buscaba el bien.</p>
<p>ARIST�TELES: Est� en la naturaleza de los pollos cruzar la carretera.</p>
<p>MARX: Era su devenir hist�rico.</p>
<p>MOIS�S: Y Dios bajo de los Cielos y le dijo al pollo: Cruzad la carretera. Y el pollo cruz� la carretera y todos se regocijaron.</p>
<p>SADAM HUSSEIN: Fue un acto de agresi�n no provocado. El que lanz�semos 50 toneladas de gas nervioso estuvo plenamente justificado.</p>
<p>RONALD REAGAN: Se me olvid�.</p>
<p>CAPIT�N KIRK: Para ir adonde ning�n pollo ha llegado jam�s.</p>
<p>HIP�CRATES: Debido a un exceso de humores en su p�ncreas.</p>
<p>ANDERSEN CONSULTING: La desregulaci�n del lado de la carretera del pollo amenazaba su posici�n dominante en el mercado. El pollo se enfrentaba a importantes retos para crear y desarrollar las competencias necesarias a fin de encarar la competitividad del mercado. Andersen Consulting, en una relaci�n de socio con el cliente, ayud� al pollo redise�ando tanto su estrategia de distribuci�n f�sica como sus procesos de implantaci�n. Empleando el M�todo de Integraci�n Av�cola (MIA), Andersen coadyuv� al pollo a emplear sus habilidades, metodolog�a, conocimiento, capital y experiencias para alinear a la gente, procesos y tecnolog�a del pollo en el apoyo de su estrategia global, dentro de un marco de trabajo de Gesti�n de Programas. Andersen Consulting convoc� un equipo multidisciplinario de analistas de carreteras y a los mejores pollos que, junto con los consultores de Andersen con profundas habilidades en la industria del transporte, llevaron a cabo durante dos d�as una serie de reuniones con el objeto de apalancar su capital personal de conocimiento, tanto expl�cito como impl�cito, y de permitirles obtener sinergias entre s�, para conseguir las metas impl�citas de la entrega y dise�o exitoso, e implementando un marco de valores de empresa a trav�s del flujo de procesos av�colas. Las reuniones se mantuvieron en un entorno que reproduc�a un parque, posibilitando y creando un ambiente de alto impacto que estaba estrat�gicamente situado, centrado en la industria y elaborando un mensaje consistente, claro y �nico frente al mercado, alineado con la misi�n, visi�n y valores principales del pollo. Esto condujo a la creaci�n de una soluci�n integradora de negocio total. Andersen Consulting ayud� a que el cambio del pollo fuese m�s exitoso. El pollo consigui� la certificaci�n de AENOR al cumplir con los requerimientos de la norma ISO 9000. (Realmente, el pollo muri� atropellado por tardar tanto en cruzar).</p>
<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING: Veo un mundo en el que todos los pollos ser�n libres de cruzar la carretera sin que sus motivos se cuestionen.</p>
<p>BILL CLINTON: El pollo no cruz� la carretera. Repito, el pollo no cruz� la carretera.</p>
<p>MAQUIAVELO: La cuesti�n es que el pollo cruz� la carretera. �A qui�n le importa por qu�? El fin de cruzar la carretera justifica cualquier motivo.</p>
<p>FREUD: El hecho de que est�s preocupado porque el pollo cruce o no la carretera revela tu inseguridad sexual.</p>
<p>BILL GATES: Acabo de lanzar el Pollo Office 2000, que no s�lo cruza carreteras sino que, adem�s, pone huevos, archiva tus documentos importantes y cuadra tus cuentas.</p>
<p>DARWIN: A lo largo de grandes periodos de tiempo, los pollos han sido seleccionados naturalmente, de modo que ahora tienen una disposici�n gen�tica a cruzar carreteras.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: La cuesti�n de s� el pollo ha cruzado la carretera o la carretera se ha movido debajo del pollo depende de tu marco de referencia.</p>
<p>BUDA: Preguntar eso niega tu propia naturaleza de pollo.</p>
<p>HEMINGWAY: Para morir bajo la lluvia.</p>

7083,"<p>A little boy wanted $100 very badly; his mother told him to pray to God for it. </p>
<p>He prayed for two weeks but nothing turned up. Then he decided perhaps he should write God a letter requesting the $100. </p>
<p>When the post office received the letter addressed to God, they opened it and decided to send it to the President. </p>
<p>The President was so impressed, touched and amused that he instructed his secretary to send the little boy $5. He thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy. </p>
<p>The little boy was delighted with the $5 and sat down to write a thank you letter, which read as follows;</p>
<p>Dear God,<br /> Thank you very much for sending me the money. I noticed that you had to send it through Washington. As usual, those thieving scallys deducted $95. </p>

7087,"<p>Two men were out playing golf on a nice Saturday afternoon.<br /> They were getting frustrated, though, because the two women who were playing right in front of them were quite slow, and were holding up the men's game.  </p>
<p>""Don't they know their supposed to let us play through?"" asked the first man.  The other man shook his head. ""I'm going to go ask them if we can play through,"" said the first man, emphatically, ""Enough is enough.""</p>
<p>He started walking over toward the women, but as he got close, he suddenly turned around and came back, white as a ghost.</p>
<p>""Oh God,"" he said to his friend, ""This is awful. You're going to have to ask those women if we can play through. You see, one of them is my wife, and the other is my mistress.""</p>
<p>The other man shrugged, and said ""No sweat."" He walked over toward the women, and just as he was getting close, turned around and came running back to his pal. His eyes wide open, he said, ""Small world!""</p>

7088,"<p>Three guys found themselves in Hell: Martin, Joe, and Dave. A<br /> little confused at their present situation, they were startled<br /> to see a door in the wall (which they hadn't noticed before)<br /> open, and behind the door was perhaps the ugliest woman they had<br /> ever seen. She was 3'4"", dirty, and you could smell her even<br /> over the Brimstone.</p>
<p>The voice of the Devil was heard, ""Martin, you have sinned!!!<br /> You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this<br /> woman!"" And Martin was whisked through the door by a group of<br /> lesser demons to his doom.</p>
<p>This understandably shook up the other two, and so they both<br /> jumped when a second door opened, and lo! an even more<br /> disgusting example of womanhood gone wrong. She was over 7',<br /> covered in thick black hair, and flies circled her.</p>
<p>The voice of the Devil was heard, ""Joe, you have sinned!!! You<br /> are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this<br /> woman!!!"" And Joe, like Martin, was whisked off.</p>
<p>Dave, now alone, felt understandably anxious, and feared the<br /> worst when the third door opened. And as the door inched open,<br /> he strained to see the figure of... Cindy Crawford!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Delighted, Dave jumped up, taking in the sight of this beautiful<br /> woman, barely dressed in a shiny metallic NASA-space-age<br /> material bikini. Then he heard the voice of the Devil say:<br /> ""Cindy, you have sinned ........""</p>

7111,"<p>Suppose you're at a party and some hotshot intellectual is expounding on the economy of Peru, a subject you know nothing about. If you're drinking some health fanatic drink like grapefruit juice, you'll hang back, afraid to display your ignorance, while the hotshot entralls your date. But if you drink several large shots of Jack Daniels, you'll discover you have STRONG VIEWS about the Peruvian economy. You'll be a WEALTH of information. You'll argue forcefully, offering searing insights and possibly upsetting furniture. People will be impressed. Some may leave the room. </p>
<p>* Make Things Up </p>
<p>Suppose, in the Peruvian economy argument, you are trying to prove Peruvians are underpaid, a position you base solely on the fact YOU are underpaid, and you're damned if you're going to let a bunch of Peruvians be better off. </p>
<p>DON'T say: ""I think Peruvians are underpaid."" </p>
<p>Say: ""The average Peruvian's salary in 1981 dollars adjusted for the revised tax base is $1,452.81 per annum, which is $836.07 before the mean gross poverty level."" </p>
<p>(NOTE: always make up exact figures.) If an opponent asks where you got your information, make THAT up too. </p>
<p>Say: ""This information comes from Dr. Hovel T. Moon's study for the Buford Commission published May 9, 1982. Didn't you read it?"" </p>
<p>Say this in the same tone of voice you would use to say ""You left your soiled underwear in my bath house"". </p>
<p>* Use Meaningless But Weightly-sounding Words and Phrases</p>
<p>Memorize this list: </p>
<p>Let me put it this way </p>
<p>In terms of </p>
<p>Vis-a-vis </p>
<p>per se </p>
<p>As it were </p>
<p>qua </p>
<p>so to speak</p>
<p>You should also memorize some Latin abbreviations such as q.e.d., e.g., and i.e. These are all short for ""I speak Latin and you do not"". </p>
<p>Here's how to use these words and phrases. Suppose you want to say: ""Peruvians would like to order appetizers more often, but they don't have enough money."" You never win arguments talking like that. But you WILL if you say: ""Let me put it this way. In terms of appetizers vis-a-vis Peruvians, they would like to order them more often, so to speak, but they do not have enough money per se, as it were. Q.E.D.""</p>
<p>Only a fool would challenge that statement. </p>
<p>* Use Snappy and Irrelevant Combacks</p>
<p>You need an arsenal of all purpose irrelevant phrases to fire back at your opponents when they make valid points. </p>
<p>The best are: </p>
<p>You're begging the question </p>
<p>You're being defensive </p>
<p>Don't compare apples and oranges </p>
<p>What are your paramaters? </p>
<p>(This last one is especially valuable. Nobody, other than mathematicians, has the vaguest idea what ""paramaters"" means.)</p>
<p>Here's how to use your comebacks: </p>
<p>You say: Liberians, like most Asians.... </p>
<p>Your opponent says: Liberia is in Africa.</p>
<p>You say: You're being defensive.</p>
<p>* Compare Your Opponent to Adolf Hitler</p>
<p>This is your heavy artillery, for when your opponent is obviously right and you are spectacularly wrong. Bring up Hitler subtly. </p>
<p>Say: ""That sounds suspiciously like something Adolf Hitler might say"" or ""You certainly do remind me of Hitler"". </p>
<p>Now you know how to out-argue anybody. Do not try to pull any of this on people who generally carry weapons.</p>

7116,"<p>A retiring Phys Chem professor was setting his last exam, for a graduate course in statistical thermodynamics. Being a bit bored with it all, and with a well-kept and wry sense of humor, he set a single question on the sheet: ""Is Hell endothermic or exothermic? Support your answer with proof.""<br /> He had little idea what to expect, or how to grade the results, but decided to reward any student who was able to come up with a reasonable and consistent reply to his query. One A was awarded. Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or some variant. The top student however wrote the following: </p>
<p>First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. </p>
<p>Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. There are two possible conditions: </p>
<p>Condition One: if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase exponentially until all hell breaks loose.<br /> Conversely, Condition Two: if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. </p>
<p>We can solve this with the 1990 postulation of Theresa LeClair, the girl who lived across the hall from me during my first year residence. Since I have still not been successful in obtaining sexual relations with her, condition two above has not been met, and thus it can be concluded that condition one is true, and hell is exothermic.</p>

After polishing off his beer, he beckons the bartender over and says, �Betcha $20 I can bite my eye.� The bartender scoffs and accepts. The man then calmly removes his false eye and bites it. The bartender grudgingly forks over a twenty.  Later that night, after a few more beers, the man wanders back to the bar and says rather drunkenly, �Hey barkeep, betcha another $20 I can bite my other eye.� Wanting to win back his money and seriously doubtful that the man has two false eyes, the bartender accepts. The man calmly removes his false teeth and bites his other eye. Scowling, the bartender hands over another twenty. The man leaves and wanders around the bar as he drinks a few more beers. He strolls back over to the bar, leaning on it, again and calls the bartender, �Hey, barkeep,� he burbles, �I'll give you a chance to win yer money back plus. Betcha $100 if you put a shot glass on that end of the bar, and I stood on this end, I could piss into it and not spill a drop.� The bartender eagerly accepts, knowing the feat to be impossible. The man wobbily climbs atop the bar, zips down his fly and promptly pisses all over the bar. He zips up, sits down, slaps the $100 on the bar and laughs uproarously.  �What's so funny?� says the barkeep, �you just lost everything you won and more!� �Well,� giggles the man, �I just bet those guys over there $200 that I could piss all over your bar and you wouldn't get angry.�</p>

7147,"<p>1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 4:00 and then bring it to me. The challenge of a deadline is refreshing.2. If it's really a rush job, run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to inquire how it's going. That helps. Or even better, hover behind me, advising me at every keystroke.3. Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where you are.4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or supplies, don't open the door for me. I need to learn how to function as a paraplegic and opening doors with no arms is good training in case I should ever be injured and lose all use of my limbs.5. If you give me more than one job to do, don't tell me which is the priority. I am psychic.6. Do your best to keep me late. I adore this office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do. I have no life beyond work.7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. If that gets out, it could mean a promotion.8. If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in conversations. I was born to be whipped.9. If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done. No use confusing me with useful information.10. Never introduce me to the people you're with. I have no right to know anything. In the corporate food chain, I am plankton. When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them.11. Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could really change your life and send you straight to manager's hell.12. Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and it's nice to know someone is less fortunate. I especially like the story about having to pay so much taxes on the bonus check you received for being such a good manager.13. Wait until my yearly review and THEN tell me what my goals SHOULD have been. Give me a mediocre performance rating with a cost of living increase. I'm not here for the money anyway.</p>

<p>Dear John: </p>
<p>When I opened the door there were actually six geese-a-laying on my front steps. So you're back to the birds again, huh? Those geese are huge. Where will I ever keep them? The neighbors are complaining and I can't sleep through the racket. PLEASE STOP! </p>
<p>Cordially, Agnes </p>

7179,"<p>Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near an abandoned gas station. They approached one of the gas pumps, and one of them said to it, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.' The gas pump, of course, didn't respond. The alien repeated the greeting. There was no response. The alien, annoyed by what he perceived to be the gas pump's haughty attitude, drew his ray gun, and said impatiently, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. How dare you ignore us in this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!' The other alien shouted to his comrade 'No, you mustn't anger him...!', but before he finished his warning, the first alien fired. There was a huge explosion that blew both of them 200 meters into the desert, where they landed in a heap. When they finally regained consciousness, the one who fired turned to the other one and said, 'What a ferocious creature. It nearly killed us! But, how did you know it was so dangerous?' The other alien answered, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my travels through the galaxy, it's that if a guy has a penis he can wrap around himself twice and then stick into his own ear, don't screw with him!'</p>

<p>""And just how would I go about doing that?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""It is very simple.  First you turn off the air conditioner so that<br /> the auditorium is warmer than usual. Then you preach in a monotone<br /> voice. Meanwhile, you dangle a watch on a chain and swing it in a<br /> slow arc above the lectern and suggest they put 20 dollars in the<br /> collection plate.""</p>
<p>So the very next Sunday, the reverend did as suggested, and lo and<br /> behold, the plates were full of 20 dollar bills!  Now, the preacher<br /> did not want to take advantage of this technique each and every<br /> Sunday. So therefore, he waited for a couple of weeks and then tried<br /> his mass hypnosis again.</p>
<p>Just as the last of the congregation was becoming mesmerized, the<br /> chain on the watch broke and the watch hit the lectern with a loud<br /> thud and springs and parts flew everywhere. ""Crap!"" exclaimed the<br /> pastor.</p>

7250,"<p>God created the mule, and told him, ""You are mule. You will work constantly from dusk to dawn, carrying heavy loads on your back. You will eat grass and lack intelligence. You will live for 35 years.""</p>
<p>The mule answered, ""To live like this for 35 years is too much. Please, give me no more than 20.""</p>
<p>And it was so.</p>
<p>Then God created the dog, and told him, ""You are dog. You will hold vigilance over the dwellings of Man, to whom you will be his greatest companion. You will eat his table scraps and live for 30 years.""</p>
<p>The dog responded, ""Lord, to live 30 years as a dog like that is too much. Please, no more than 10 years.""</p>
<p>And it was so.</p>
<p>God then created the monkey, and told him, ""You are monkey. You shall swing from tree to tree, acting like an idiot. You will be funny, and you shall live for 20 years.""</p>
<p>The monkey responded, ""Lord, to live 20 years as the clown of the world is too much. Please, Lord, give me no than 10 years.""</p>
<p>And it was so.</p>
<p>Finally, God created Man and told him, ""You are Man, the only rational Being that walks the earth. You will use your intelligence to have mastery over the creatures of the world. You will dominate the earth and live for 20 years.""</p>
<p>The man responded, ""Lord, to be Man for only 20 years is too little. Please, Lord; give me the 15 years the mule refused, the 20 years the dog refused, and the 10 years the monkey rejected.""</p>
<p>And so God made Man to live 20 years as a man, then marry and live 15 years like a mule working and carrying heavy loads on his back. Then, he is to have children and live 20 years as a dog, guarding his house and eating the leftovers after they empty the pantry; then, in his old age, to live 10 years as a monkey, acting like an idiot to amuse his grandchildren.</p>
<p>And it is so...</p>

""You should be ashamed of yourself young man! Drinking is a Sin! Alcohol is the blood of the devil!"" Now John gets pretty annoyed about this, and goes on the offensive. ""How do you know this, Sister?"" ""My Mother Superior told me so.""""But have you ever had a drink yourself? How can you be sure that what you are saying is right?"" ""Don't be ridiculous--of course I have never taken alcohol myself"" ""Then let me buy you a drink - if you still believe afterwards that it is evil I will give up drink for life"" ""How could I, a Nun, sit outside this public house drinking?!"" ""I'll get the barman to put it in a teacup for you, then no one will ever know.""The Nun reluctantly agrees, so John goes inside to the bar. ""Another pint for me, and a triple vodka on the rocks"", then he lowers his voice and says to the barman ""and could you put the vodka in a teacup?""""Oh no! It's not that Nun again is it?""</p>

7257,"<p>A great standup routine which somone typed up!---------------------Do you realize that the only time in our lives when we like to get old is when we're kids? If you're less than ten years old, you're so excited about aging that you think in fractions.""How old are you?"" ""I'm four and a half.""You're never 36 and a half....you're four and a half going on 5. You get into your teens; now they can't hold you back. You jump to the next number. ""How old  are you?"" ""I'm gonna be 16."" You could be 12, but you're gonna be 16. Eventually.Then the great day of your life; you become 21. Even the words sound like a ceremony    You BECOME 21....Yes!!!!!Then you turn 30. What happened there? Makes you  sound like bad milk. He TURNED; we had to throw him out. What's wrong? What changed? You BECOME 21; you TURN 30.Then you're PUSHING 40....stay over there.You REACH 50. You BECOME 21; you TURN 30; You're PUSHING 40; you REACH 50; then you MAKE IT to 60.  By then you've built up so much speed, you HIT 70.After that, it's a day by day thing. You HIT Wednesday...You get into your 80's; you HIT lunch, you HIT 4:30.  My Grandmother won't even buy green bananas.  ""Well, it's an investment, you know, and maybe a bad one.""And it doesn't end there....Into the 90's, you start going backwards.   ""I was JUST 92.""Then a strange thing happens; if you make it over 100, you become a little kid again.   ""I'm 100 and a half.""Happy aging!</p>

7258,"<p>A lady was a huge Paul MCCartney fan and wanted a tattoo of him on the inside of her thigh. She went to the parlour and told the guy what she wanted.</p>
<p>He says: ""OK, take your skirt and underwear off and sit in the chair with your legs apart"".</p>
<p>She did that and he started on the tattoo. Pretty soon he's done, blows off the dust and admires his work.</p>
<p>""Who the heck's that?"" she says.<br /> ""It's Paul McCartney"", he replies.</p>
<p>""Doesn't look like him at all"" says she. ""Now get it right or I'll report you"".</p>
<p>So the tattooist starts on the other thigh. Really trying hard to do a better job. Finally he's done, blows off the dust and feels pretty good.</p>
<p>The woman is pissed off ""No way that's Paul Mccartney"" she says.<br /> ""It bloody well is"" says the man. ""Listen I'll get a second opinion""</p>
<p>He goes out of his store and grabs the first person he sees. The guy is a drunk who's been stumbling along the sidewalk. The tattooist drags the drunk into his store. There's the woman, sitting legs apart with nothing on below her waist.</p>
<p>The tattoist says to the drunk (pointing at the womans legs)...<br /> ""Tell me who the hell you think that is"".</p>

7295,"<p>Un tipo muy religioso navega en un crucero por el Caribe. Una noche, mientras reflexionaba sobre las cosas de la vida en la cubierta, un fuerte oleaje lo tumb� del barco. Como era medianoche, nadie se dio cuenta que el tipo se hab�a ca�do. Pero como �ste era muy creyente empez� a decir para s� mismo:</p>
<p>""Yo creo en Dios y �l me salvar�"".</p>
<p>En esas estaba cuando apareci� una lancha guardacostas. Los marineros le gritaron que ven�an a salvarlo; el hombre, como era muy creyente, les indic� que no se preocuparan, que �l ten�a fe en Dios y que �l lo salvar�a.</p>
<p>Como a la hora de seguir flotando, lleg� un helic�ptero y lo mismo: los tripulantes le informaron que ven�an a salvarlo; el sujeto volvi� a decirles que �l ten�a fe en Dios y que el Se�or lo salvar�a. Sin embargo, esta vez insistieron, pero sus esfuerzos fueron en vano: el fulano no quiso ser rescatado y sigui� flotando en el mar.</p>

<p>He opens the door and there is man standing at the door. It didn't take the<br /> homeowner long to realize the man was drunk. ""Hi there�, slurs the stranger,<br /> ""Can you give me a push?"" </p>
<p>""No. Get lost, it's half past three. I was in bed�, says the man and slams the<br /> door. </p>
<p>He goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says ""Dave,<br /> that wasn't very nice of you. </p>

7343,"<p>An Erie, Pennsylvania executive with a new young wife and a yen for golf<br /> decided about December one year that he couldn't take it any longer.  So he<br /> said to his wife one evening, ""Honey, next Friday we're going to Hilton Head<br /> for the weekend.  We'll get a condo on the golf course and I'm going to play<br /> golf all weekend.""</p>
<p>""That sounds fine,"" she purred.  And, sure enough, next Saturday morning at 6<br /> a.m., found him on the golf course, all alone.  After playing two holes, he<br /> noticed a man carrying a golf bag walking toward him across a fairway.  The<br /> exec. waited, and the other man arrived, saying, ""Mind if I play along?""</p>
<p>The exec. said, ""Fine.  Glad to have the company.""</p>
<p>All went well for a couple of holes, until each approached the sixth green.<br /> When the new fellow laid down his clubs, the cover came off one club.  The<br /> exec. noticed, however, that it wasn't a club at all.  It was a high powered<br /> rifle.</p>
<p>""Whoa,"" he said.  ""That's a high powered rifle!""</p>
<p>""Look,"" said the other man.  ""I'm not out to cause any trouble.  If you want me<br /> to leave, I will.  No hard feelings.""</p>
<p>""No. No,"" said the exec.  ""I'm just curious as to why you have a high-powered<br /> rifle in your bag.""</p>
<p>The other man pondered for a moment and then said, ""Well, I'll tell you.  It's<br /> my business.  It's what I do for a living.""</p>
<p>""Wow,"" said the other.  ""I've heard about guys like you, but I've never met one<br /> before.""</p>
<p>""Still want me to play?"" said the other.</p>
<p>""Sure,"" said the Erie exec.  ""As a matter of fact, you know, I do a little<br /> hunting.  Would you mind if I look at it?""</p>
<p>The other man showed him the rifle.  It was beautiful--an inlaid Weatherby with<br /> a huge powerful scope mounted on it.</p>
<p>The exec. picked it up, looked through the scope, and said, ""Gee, I can see the<br /> window of my condo with this thing.  Matter of fact, there's my wife.""  He<br /> lowered the gun for a moment and said, ""she doesn't have any clothes on.""  He<br /> looked through the scope again.  ""Damn, there's a guy with her.""</p>
<p>The Erie exec. lowered the rifle and looked at the other man.  ""How much do you<br /> charge?""</p>
<p>""$10,000 a bullet,"" said the man.</p>
<p>The Erie man thought for a moment, and said, ""Do it.""</p>
<p>""Which one?"" said the hit man.</p>
<p>""Both,"" said the exec.</p>
<p>""That's $20,000, you know.""</p>
<p>""I don't care.  hit 'em both.""</p>
<p>The hit man took two cartridges from his bag and loaded the rifle.  ""Where do<br /> you want me to get the man?""  he asked.</p>
<p>""You know where to hit him,"" said the exec.</p>
<p>""How about the woman?""</p>
<p>""In the mouth.  She's always flapping her gums anyway.""</p>
<p>""Ok,"" said the hit man as he raised the rifle.  Taking careful aim, he clicked<br /> off the safety, but then he paused and chuckled.  ""Mister,"" he said, ""I think<br /> I'm going to be able to save you ten thousand dollars.""</p>

7380,"<p>Diary of a New Snow Shoveler</p>
<p>Decenber 8th 6:00 PM<br /> It started to snow. The first snow of the season and the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the window watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven. It looked like a Grandma Moses print. So romantic we felt like newlyweds again. I love snow!</p>
<p>December 9th<br /> We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering every inch of the landscape. What a fantastic sight!Can there be a more lovely place in the whole world? Moving here was the best idea I've ever had. Shovelled for the first time in years and felt like a boy again. I did both our driveway and the sidewalks. This afternoon the snowplow came along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again. What a perfect life.</p>
<p>December 12th<br /> The sun has melted all our lovely snow. Such a disappointment. My neighbor tells me not to worry, we'll definitely have a white Christmas. No snow on Christmas would be awful! Bob says we'll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to see snow again. I don't think that's possible. Bob is such a nice man I'm glad he's our neighbor</p>
<p>December 14th<br /> Snow, lovely snow! 8"" last night. The temperature dropped to -20. The<br /> cold makes everything sparkle so. The wind took my breath away, but I<br /> warmed up shovelling the driveway and sidewalks. This is the life! The<br /> snowplow came back this afternoon and buried everything again. I didn't realize I would have to do quite this much shovelling, but I'll certainly get back into shape this way. I wish I wouldn't huff and puff so.</p>
<p>December 15th<br /> 20 inches in the forecast. Sold my van and bought a 4x4 Blazer. Bought<br /> snow tires for the wife's car and 2 extra shovels. Stocked the freezer. The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out. I think that's silly. We aren't in Alaska after all..</p>
<p>December 16th<br /> Ice storm this morning. Fell on my ass on the ice in the driveway putting down salt. Hurt like hell. The wife laughed for an hour, which I think was very cruel</p>
<p>Decenber 17th<br /> Still way below freezing. Roads are too icy to go anywhere. Electricity was off for 5 hours. I had to pile blankets on to stay warm. Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her. God I hate it when she's right. More shovelling. Took all day. Goddamn snowplow came by twice. Tried to find a neighbor kid to shovel, but they said they're to busy playing hockey. I think they're lying. Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have it done and bill me. I think he's lying..</p>
<p>December 22nd<br /> Bob was right about a white Christmas because 13 more inches of white shit fell today, and it's so cold it probably won't melt 'till August. Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up to go out to shovel and then I had to piss. By the time I got undressed, pissed, and dressed again, I was too tired to shovel. Tried to hire Bob who has a plow on his truck for the rest of the winter but he says he's too busy. I think the asshole is lying.</p>
<p>December 23rd<br /> Only 2"" of snow today. And it warmed up to 0. The wife wanted me to<br /> decorate the front of the house this morning. What is she...nuts?&gt; Why<br /> didn't she tell me to do that a month ago? She says she did, but I think she's damn well lying.</p>
<p>December 24th<br /> 6"". Snow packed so hard by snowplow, I broke the shovel. Thought I was<br /> having a heart attack. If I ever catch the son of a bitch who drives that snowplow, I'll drag him through the snow by his balls. I know he hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shovelling and then he comes down the street at a 100 miles an hour and throws snow all over where I've just been! Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols with her and open our presents, but I was busy watching for the goddamn snowplow.</p>
<p>December 25th<br /> Merry Christmas. 20 more inches of the @#$%%^&amp;*(!-slop tonight. Snowed in. The idea of shovelling makes my blood boil. I hate the snow! Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over the head with my shove. The wife says I have a bad attitude. I think she's an idiot. If I have to watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" one more time, I'm going to kill her</p>
<p>December 26th<br /> Still snowed in. Why the hell did I ever move here? It was ALL HER idea. She's really getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>December 27th<br /> Temperature dropped to -30 and the pipes froze.</p>
<p>December 28th<br /> Warmed up to above -50. Still snowed in. THE BITCH is driving me<br /> crazy!!!!!</p>
<p>December 29th<br /> 10 more inches. Bob says I have to shovel the roof or it could cave in. That's the silliest thing I ever hear. How dumb does he think I am?</p>
<p>December 30th<br /> The roof caved in. The snow plow driver is suing me for a million dollars for the bump on his head. The wife went home to her Mother. 9"" predicted.</p>
<p>December 31st</p>
<p>Set fire to what's left of the house. No more shovelling.</p>
<p>Januare 8th<br /> I feel so good. I just love those little white pills they keep giving me.Why am I tied to the bed?????</p>

7392,"<p>Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer came to him and said,<br /> ""Now don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a<br /> match because of this ""pretzel"" hold he has. Whatever you do, don't let him get<br /> you in this hold! If he does, you're finished!"" </p>
<p>The wrestler nodded in agreement. </p>
<p>Now, to the match: The American and the Russian circled each other several<br /> times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward,<br /> grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! </p>
<p>A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his<br /> face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the ending. </p>
<p>Suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised<br /> his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian's back<br /> hit the mat with a thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him,<br /> getting the pin and winning the match. </p>
<p>The trainer was astounded! When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he<br /> asked, ""How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!"" </p>
<p>The wrestler answered, ""Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that<br /> hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right<br /> in front of my face. I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of<br /> strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.<br /> You'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls!""</p>

7418,"<p>All of the different religions have varying methods of<br /> determining how much money is given to God and how much they<br /> keep. The Baptists draw a circle on the ground and throw the<br /> money into the air.

The Methodists also use this method except that they<br /> draw a triangle on the ground instead of a circle. The Catholics<br /> also use this method. But when they throw the money, God keeps<br /> what he wants and they keep what comes down.</p>

7424,"<p>An old farmer decided it was time to get a new rooster for his hens. The<br /> current rooster was still doing an okay job, but he was getting on in years and<br /> the farmer figured getting a new rooster couldn't hurt. So he buys a new cock<br /> from the local rooster emporium, and turns him loose in the barnyard. </p>
<p>Well, the old rooster sees the young one strutting around and he's a little<br /> worried. So, they're trying to replace me, thinks the old rooster- I've got to<br /> do something about this! He walks up to the new bird and says, 'So you're the<br /> new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff don't you? Well I'm<br /> not ready for the chopping block yet. I'll bet I'm still the better bird. And to<br /> prove it, I challenge you to a race around that hen house over there. We'll run<br /> around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for<br /> himself.' Well, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he definitely thought he<br /> was more than a match for the old guy. 'You're on', he said, 'and since I'm so<br /> great, I'll even give you a head start of half a lap. I'll still win easy!' </p>
<p>So the two roosters go over to the henhouse to start the race with all the<br /> hens gathering to watch. The race begins and all the hens start cheering the old<br /> rooster on. After the first lap, the old rooster is still maintaining his lead.<br /> After the second lap, the old guy's lead has slipped a little but he's still<br /> hanging in there. Unfortunately, the old rooster's lead continues to slip each<br /> time around, and by the fifth lap he's just barely in front of the young fell. </p>
<p>By now the farmer has heard the commotion. He runs into the house, gets his<br /> shotgun, and runs into the barnyard figuring a fox or something is after his<br /> chickens. When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the<br /> henhouse, with the old rooster still slightly in the lead. He immediately takes<br /> his shotgun, aims, fires, and blows the young rooster away. </p>
<p>As he walks away slowly, he says to himself..... </p>
<p>'Damn, that's the third gay rooster I've bought this month.'</p>

<p>HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.</p>
<p>ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the<br /> road was threatening its dominant market position. The chicken<br /> was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the<br /> competencies required for the newly competitive market. Andersen<br /> Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped<br /> the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and<br /> implementation processes. Using the Poultry Integration Model<br /> (PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its skills,<br /> methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to align the<br /> chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its<br /> overall strategy within a Program Management framework. Andersen<br /> Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts<br /> and best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep<br /> skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day<br /> itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal<br /> knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them<br /> to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit<br /> goals of delivering and successfully architecting and<br /> implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the<br /> continuum of poultry cross-median processes. The meeting was<br /> held in a park-like setting, enabling and creating an impactful<br /> environment which was strategically based, industry-focused, and<br /> built upon a consistent, clear, and unified market message and<br /> aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, and core values.<br /> This was conducive towards the creation of a total business<br /> integration solution. Andersen Consulting helped the chicken<br /> change to become more successful.</p>
<p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man.<br /> The chicken 'crossed' the black man in order to trample him and<br /> keep him down.</p>
<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens<br /> will be free to cross roads without having their motives called<br /> into question.</p>
<p>MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the<br /> chicken, ""Thou shalt cross the road."" And the chicken crossed<br /> the road, and there was much rejoicing.</p>
<p>FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How<br /> many more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?</p>
<p>RICHARD M. NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat,<br /> the chicken did NOT cross the road.</p>
<p>MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who<br /> cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever<br /> motive there was.</p>
<p>JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why<br /> doesn't anyone ever think to ask, What the heck was this chicken<br /> doing walking around all over the place, anyway?""</p>
<p>FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken<br /> crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.</p>
<p>BILL GATES: I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000,<br /> which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your<br /> important documents, and balance your checkbook.</p>
<p>OLIVER STONE: The question is not, ""Why did the chicken cross<br /> the road?"" Rather, it is, ""Who was crossing the road at the same<br /> time, whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken<br /> crossing?""</p>
<p>DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been<br /> naturally selected in such a way that they are now genetically<br /> disposed to cross roads.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved<br /> beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.</p>
<p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road .. it<br /> transcended it.</p>
<p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die. In the rain.</p>
<p>COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one?</p>
<p>DILBERT: I hate when the title gives away the plot!</p>

Suddenly a very large bullfrog<br /> jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth.<br /> Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew<br /> away.

<p>Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.""</p>
<p>By this time the judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer and said to the lawyer, ""I'd like to hear what he has to say.""</p>
<p>Joe thanked the Judge and proceeded, ""Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side. </p>
<p>I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. </p>
<p>I was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear ol' Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans. </p>
<p>Shortly after the accident a highway patrolman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her.</p>
<p>After he looked at her, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me."" He said, ""Your mule was in such bad shape I had to shoot her. How are you feeling?</p>

7511,"<p>Good evening my fellow Americans.</p>
<p>First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New<br /> York and all Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You<br /> can rest assured that anything and everything that can be done<br /> to assure the safety of our country will be done. This is the<br /> greatest country in the world and we will get through this<br /> trying time. Now is the time for all people to set aside our<br /> petty differences and show the world that no one or nothing can<br /> destroy the fortitude of the American people.</p>
<p>To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are<br /> you fucking kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped<br /> too tight? Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not<br /> know who you are fucking with? Americans are so hungry to kill,<br /> that we shoot at each other every day. We will relish that<br /> opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you<br /> forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started<br /> fucking around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over<br /> in Japan? We slapped them all over the Pacific and roasted about<br /> 2 million of them in their own back yard. That's what we in<br /> America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen Texas on a map? Ever<br /> wonder why it's so big? Because we wanted it that way, Mexico<br /> started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our<br /> lawns. England? We sent them packing.</p>
<p>Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole USA. The<br /> only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard<br /> to shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our<br /> soldiers aren't trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now<br /> he couldn't stop a pack of cub scouts from taking over his<br /> shitty little country.</p>
<p>Trust us, Afghanistan will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go<br /> ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden. There's not a hole deep enough<br /> or a mountain high enough that's going to keep your camel riding<br /> asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that harbors<br /> him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he<br /> was there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that<br /> have pissed us off in the past. This is America. We kick ass.<br /> This is what we do. Go ahead and laugh now, but the Tomahawks<br /> are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.</p>
<p>God bless America!</p>

7568,"<p>The Washington Post  february 4, 1988 I BelieveThis is more commentary than humor, but what the heck...------------------------------------I believe the president. I have always believed him. I believed him when he said he had never been drafted in the Vietnam War and I believed him when he said he had forgotten to mention that he had been drafted in the Vietnam War. I believed him when he said he hadn't had sex with Gennifer Flowers and I believe him now, when he reportedly says he did.I believe the president did not rent out the Lincoln Bedroom, did not sell access to himself and the vice president to hundreds of well-heeled special pleaders and did not supervise the largest, most systematic money-laundering operation in campaign finance history, collecting more than $ 3 million in illegal and improper donations. I believe that Charlie Trie and James Riady were motivated by nothing but patriotism for their adopted country.I believed Vice President Gore when he said that he had made dunning calls to political contributors 'on a few occasions' from his White House office, and I believed when he said that, actually, 'a few' meant 46. I believe in no controlling legal authority.I believe Bruce Babbitt when he says that the $ 286,000 contributed the DNC by Indian tribes opposed to granting a casino license to rival tribes had nothing to do with his denial of the license. I believed the secretary when he said that he had not been instructed this matter by then-White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes. I believed him when he said that he had told lobbyist and friend Paul Eckstein that Ickes had told him to move on the casino decision, but that he had been lying to Eckstein. I agree with the secretary that it is an outrage that anyone would question his integrity. I believe in the Clinton Standard of adherence to the campaign finance and bribery laws, enunciated by the president on March 7, 1997: 'I don't believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I had changed government policy solely because of a contribution.' I note with approval the use of the word 'evidence' and also the use of the word 'solely.' I believe that it is proper to change government policy to address the concerns of people who have given the president money, as long as nobody can find evidence of this being the sole reason. I believe the president has lived up to his promise to preside over the most ethical administration in American history. I believe that indicted former agriculture secretary Mike Espy did not accept $35,000 in illegal favors from Tyson Foods and other regulated businesses. I believe that indicted former housing secretary Henry Cisneros did not lie to the FBI and tell others to lie to cover up $ 250,000 in blackmail payments to his former mistress.  I believe that convicted former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell was not involved in the obstruction of justice when the president's minions arranged for Hubbell to receive $ 400,000 in sweetheart consulting deals at a time when he was reneging on his promise to cooperate with Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation. I believe Paula Jones is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Kathleen Willey is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Monica Lewinsky is a cheap tramp who was asking for it. I believe Lewinsky was fantasizing in her 20 hours of conversation in which she reportedly detailed her sexual relationship with the president and begged Linda Tripp to join her in lying about the relationship. I believe that any gifts, correspondence, telephone calls and the 37 post-employment White House visits that may have passed between Lewinsky and the president are evidence only of a platonic relationship; such innocent intimate friendships are quite common between middle-aged married men and young single women, and also between presidents of the United States and White House interns. I see nothing suspicious in the report that the president's intimate, Vernon Jordan, arranged a $ 40,000-per-year job for Lewinsky shortly after she signed but before she filed an affidavit saying she had not had sex with the president. Nor do I read anything into the fact that the ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, visited Lewinsky at the Watergate to offer her a job. I believe the instructions Lewinsky gave Tripp informing her on how to properly perjure herself in the Willey matter simply wrote themselves.I believe that The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News &amp; World Report, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS and NPR are all part of a vast right-wing conspiracy. Especially NPR.</p>

<p>She responded, ""Why, yes, I do know you Mr. Williams. I've known<br /> you since you were a young boy. And frankly, you've been a big<br /> disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you<br /> manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You<br /> think you're a rising big shot when you haven't the brains to<br /> realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit<br /> paper pusher. Yes, I know you.""</p>
<p>The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do he pointed<br /> across the room and asked, ""Mrs. Williams, do you know the<br /> defense attorney?"" </p>
<p>She again replied, ""Why, yes I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since<br /> he was a youngster, too. I used to baby-sit him for his parents.<br /> And he, too, has been a real disappointment to me. He's lazy,<br /> bigoted, he has a drinking problem. The man can't build a normal<br /> relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the<br /> shoddiest in the entire state. Yes, I know him."" </p>
<p>At this point, the judge rapped the courtroom to silence and<br /> called both counselors to the bench. In a very quiet voice, he<br /> said with menace, ""If either of you asks her if she knows me,<br /> you'll be in jail for contempt within 5 minutes!""</p>

7577,"<p>Dateline, September 3, 2147Minneapolis -- In a rare view of 20th century life, Cyber Archaeologist Ole Anderson of Minneapolis has discovered an extremely rare throwback to the 20th century: an ancient IP version 4 packet containing HTTP --the primitive method that early Internet builders used to transfer data in what predated our now familiar way of communications. Anderson is convinced of the packet's authenticity since IP version 4 packets have not been seen on the global network in 115 years.""When I discovered the packet"", says Anderson, ""I couldn't believe my eyes. It contained an IP version 4 header which at first I couldn't decipher. Amazingly, the the contents of the packet are in plain text which means that I didn't even have to break the primitive crypto algorithms they had in those days. The packet seems to be directed at what was termed a `web site' and an individual called bodacious-ta-tas@bambisbimbos.com. We are still trying determine what a `ta-tas' is.""Anderson claims that the packet was trapped in a networking equivalent of suspended animation which preserved it for close to 150 years.""The packet got trapped in a MPLS forwarding loop. It was widely believed at the time that packet life times were unnecessary because routing tables would converge and that misconfiguration would be rare. This was proven to be wrong and culminated in what has now known as the Network Panic of 2002 where a critical mass of packet entropy caused a worldwide collapse of the nascent Internet. Since then, all packets are marked with explicit lifetimes.""More remarkable is that Anderson found the packet at all. The packet was found in an antique shop in Duluth run by Doris Davenport on relic hardware by a company once known as Cisco Systems. Cisco, we all remember, was the first company that officially disbanded in the early 2020's because all of the employees were worth enough to retire in comfort, some as young as 19 years old. The packet has been kept alive by the good fortune of battery backup and the bustling market for antique electronics.""It's certainly fortunate that people are so fond of these relics,"" says Anderson, ""I guess it must be the blinking lights and the knowledge that our great-great grandfathers worked so hard on these simple little toys.""As far as Anderson can tell this may be the earliest known packet yet. It dates to 1999 which was right at the cusp of wide spread MPLS usage.""It's hard to imagine that we'll find anything that predates this packet, so we're examining it very carefully for clues as to what life was like so very long ago. Conventional wisdom has always held that it was digital media swapping that fueled the early Internet, but this packet brings that all into question because by all appearances it seems to be directed at some sort of pornography distribution point.""Anderson will continue his search for more sources of ancient packets to bolster his new and disturbing theory about 20th Internet economics.</p>

7590,"<p>1.  Never give me work in the morning.   Always wait until 4:00 and then bring<br /> it to me.  The challenge of a deadline is refreshing.</p>
<p>2.  If it's really a rush job, run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to<br /> inquire how it's going.  That helps.  Or even better, hover behind me, advising<br /> me at every keystroke.</p>
<p>3.  Always leave without telling anyone where you're going.  It gives me a<br /> chance to be creative when someone asks where you are.</p>
<p>4.  If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or supplies, don't open the<br /> door for me.  I need to learn how to function as a paraplegic and opening doors<br /> with no arms is good training in case I should ever be injured and lose all use<br /> of my limbs.</p>

<p>7.  If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret.  If that gets out, it could<br /> mean a promotion.</p>
<p>8.  If you don't like my work, tell everyone.  I like my name to be popular in<br /> conversations.  I was born to be whipped.</p>
<p>9.  If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. In<br /> fact, save them until the job is almost done.  No use confusing me with useful<br /> information.</p>
<p>10.  Never introduce me to the people you're with.  I have no<br /> right to know anything.  In the corporate food chain, I am plankton.  When you<br /> refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them.</p>
<p>11.  Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could really change<br /> your life and send you straight to managers' hell.</p>
<p>12.  Tell me all your little problems.   No one else has any and it's nice to<br /> know someone is less fortunate.  I especially like the story about having to pay<br /> so much taxes on the bonus check you received for being such a good manager.</p>

7600,"<p>A woman was out golfing one day when she hit her ball into the woods. She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in a trap. The frog said to her, ""If you release me from this trap, I will grant you three wishes."" The woman freed the frog. </p>
<p>The frog said, ""Thank you, but I failed to mention that there is a condition to your wishes -- that whatever you wish for, your husband will get ten times more or better!"" </p>
<p>The woman said, ""That would be okay."" </p>
<p>For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the world. The frog warned her, ""You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, women will flock to him like bees to honey."" </p>
<p>The woman replied, ""That will be okay because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will only have eyes for me. So, ""KAZAM"" -- she's the most beautiful woman in the world! For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.</p>
<p>The frog said, ""That will make your husband the richest man in the world and</p>
<p>he will be ten times richer than you."" </p>
<p>The woman said, ""That will be okay because what's mine is his and what's his is mine."" So, ""KAZAM""-she's the richest woman in the world! </p>
<p>The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, ""I'd like a mild heart attack."" </p>
<p>Moral of the story: Women are clever bitches. Don't mess with them.</p>

7605,"<p>Hello, my name is Basmati Kasaar. I am suffering from rare and<br /> deadly diseases, poor scores on final exams, extreme virginity,<br /> fear of being kidnapped and executed by anal electrocution, and<br /> guilt for not forwarding fifty billion fucking chain letters<br /> sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them<br /> on, then that poor fucking six-year-old girl in Arkansas with a<br /> breast on her forehead will be able to raise enough money to<br /> have it removed before her redneck parents sell her off to the<br /> traveling freak show. </p>
<p>Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you and<br /> everyone you send his email to $1000? How stupid are you? </p>
<p>Ooooh, looky here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish,<br /> I'll get laid by every Playboy Bunny in the magazine! What a<br /> bunch of fucking bullshit. So basically, this message is a big<br /> ""FUCK YOU!"" to all the people out there who have nothing better<br /> to do than to send me stupid chain mail forwards. </p>
<p>If you re going to forward something, at least send me something<br /> mildly fucking amusing. Send this to fifty of your closest<br /> friends, and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will<br /> somehow receive a nickel from some omniscient being forwards<br /> about ninety times. I don t fucking care. Show a little<br /> intelligence and think about what you re actually contributing<br /> to by sending out forwards. Chances are it s your own<br /> unpopularity. </p>
<p>THE THREE BASIC TYPES OF CHAIN LETTERS: </p>
<p>Chain Letter Type 1 </p>
<p>Hello, and thank you for reading this letter. You see, there is<br /> a starving little boy in Baklaliviatatlaglooshen who has no<br /> arms, no legs, no parents, and no goats. This little boy s life<br /> could be saved, because for every time you pass this on, a<br /> dollar will be donated to the Little Starving Legless Armless<br /> Goat less Boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen Fund. Oh, and<br /> remember, we have absolutely no way of counting the e-mails sent<br /> and this is all a complete load of bullshit. So go on, reach<br /> out. Send this to 5 people in the next 47 seconds. Oh, and a<br /> reminder, if you don t send this to 4 or 6 people, you will die<br /> instantly. Thanks again!!</p>
<p>Chain Letter Type 2</p>
<p>Hi there!! This chain letter has been in existence since 1897.<br /> This is absolutely incredible because there was no email then<br /> and probably not as many sad pricks with nothing better to do.<br /> So this is how it works...pass his on to 15,067 people in the<br /> next 7 minutes or something horrible will happen to you!!! I<br /> Promise!</p>
<p>Chain Letter Type 3 </p>
<p>As if you care, here is a poem that I wrote. Send it to all your<br /> ""so called "" friends. </p>
<p>FRIENDS: </p>
<p>A friend is someone who likes you even though you stink of shit,<br /> and your breath smells like you've been eating cat food. </p>
<p>A friend is someone who likes you even though you re as ugly as<br /> a hat full of assholes. </p>
<p>A friend is someone who stays with you all night while you cry<br /> about your sad, sad life. </p>
<p>A friend is someone who pretends they like you when they really<br /> think you should be raped by mad gorillas, then thrown to<br /> vicious dogs. </p>
<p>A friend is someone who scrubs your toilet, vacuums and then<br /> gets the check and leaves and doesn't speak much English...no,<br /> sorry that s the cleaning lady. </p>
<p>A friend is not someone who sends you chain letters because he<br /> wants his wish of being rich to come true. </p>
<p>Now pass this on! If you don't, you'll never have sex ever<br /> again! </p>
<p>The point being? If you get some chain letter that s threatening<br /> to leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life,<br /> delete it. If it s funny, send it on. Don t piss people off by<br /> making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth,<br /> who's been tied to a dead elephant for 27 years, whose only<br /> savior is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward<br /> this mail, otherwise you'll end up like Miranda. Right? </p>
<p>Now forward this to everyone that you know otherwise you'll find<br /> all your undies missing tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Edgar Allan Poe is his usual gloomy self:<br /> Once upon a campaign dreary, one which left us weak and weary<br /> O'er many a quaint and curious promise of political lore<br /> While we nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a yapping,<br /> As of some votes overlapping, energy-zapping to the core<br /> ""'Tis a mess here,"" we all muttered, as the network anchors stuttered,<br /> Stuttered over Bush and Gore.<br /> Could there be another election with such a case of misdirection,<br /> One with such a weak selection, yet fraught with tension to the core?<br /> Quoth the ravers, ""Nevermore.""<br /> Britain's Edward Lear's limerick is lighter:<br /> There once was a U.S. election<br /> That called for some expert detection -<br /> How thousands of pollers<br /> Could become two-holers<br /> Like outhouses of recollection.<br /> Ditto Ogden Nash:<br /> I regret to admit that all my knowledge<br /> Is what I learned at Electoral Colleges,<br /> So tell me please, though I hate to troubya,<br /> Will the winner be Al, or will it be Dubya?<br /> Joyce Kilmer's a media analyst:<br /> I thought that I would never see<br /> The networks all so up a tree.<br /> Walt Whitman is lyrical, as always:<br /> O'Captain! My Captain!<br /> Our fearful trip's not done<br /> The ship has weather'd every rack,<br /> But nobody knows who's won.<br /> Alfred Noyes rhythmically rumbles:<br /> And still of an autumn night they say, with the White House on the line,<br /> When the campaign's a ghostly galleon and both candidates cry ""Tis mine!""<br /> When the road is a ribbon of ballots, all within easy reach,<br /> A highwayman comes riding, riding, riding,<br /> A highwayman comes riding, and punches two holes in each.<br /> Dr. Seuss takes a look at election officials:<br /> I cannot count them in a box<br /> I cannot count them with a fox<br /> I cannot count them by computer<br /> I will not with a Roto-Rooter<br /> I cannot count them card-by-card<br /> I will not 'cause it's way too hard<br /> I cannot count them on my fingers<br /> I will not while suspicion lingers.<br /> I'll leave the country in a jam -<br /> I can't count ballots, Sam-I-Am.<br /> ""Clement Moore"" adopts a holiday theme:<br /> 'Twas the month before Christmas, when all through the courts,<br /> All the plaintiffs made stirring bad ballot reports.<br /> Which leaves the problem.<br /> Perhaps the best way to stop complaints that are so raucous is to start over<br /> again, with the Iowa caucuses!</p>

<p>Then Moses said,""God, everytime you use you driver you always slice it."" </p>
<p>So God said, ""If Arnold Palmer can do it, I can do it."" So he approched the ball. Got ready, then hit a long one. It drifted to the right, SPLISH! Right in the middle of the lake. </p>
<p>So Moses said, ""See God, I told you that would happen. I'll get it this time but you'll have to get it next time."" So Moses went out to the lake, held up his club, and parted the lake. Then he went down, picked up the ball, and came back. After that, everything was going fine. </p>
<p>Until the 18th hole, straight away, with a long lake on the right. Moses hit a nice straight shot down the fairway. Then God took out his driver. </p>
<p>Moses said, ""God, last time you used your driver you sliced it. You always slice it."" </p>
<p>And God repeated, ""If Arnold Palmer can do it, I can do it."" So he got up, and hit the ball. Long hard shot, sliced, PLUNK! </p>
<p>Moses said, ""I got the last one."" So God walked on the water, bent over, picked up the ball. About this time there was a foursome coming up behind them. One if the guys saw what God was doing and asked Moses, ""Who does that guy think he is, Jesus?"" </p>
<p>Moses replied, ""No. He thinks he's Arnold Palmer.""</p>

<p>For his wish, the rabbit asked for a crash helmet, and<br /> immediately put it on. The bear was amazed at the stupidity of<br /> the rabbit, wasting his wish like that.</p>
<p>It was the bear's second turn for a wish. ""Well, I wish that all<br /> the bears in the next forest were female as well.""</p>
<p>The rabbit asked for a motorcycle and immediately hopped on it<br /> and gunned the engine. The bear was shocked that the rabbit was<br /> asking for these stupid things, after all, he could have asked<br /> for money and bought the motorcycle.</p>

7673,"<p>A local preacher was dissatisfied with the small amount in the collection plates each Sunday. Someone suggested to him that perhaps he might be able to hypnotize the congregation into giving more. 'And just how would I go about doing that?' he asked. 'It is very simple. First you turn up the air conditioner so that the auditorium is warmer than usual. Then you preach in a monotone. Meanwhile, you dangle a watch on a chain and swing it in a slow arc above the lectern and suggest they put 20 dollars in the collection plate.' So the very next Sunday, the reverend did as suggested, and lo and behold the plates were full of 20 dollar bills. Now, the preacher did not want to take advantage of this technique each and every Sunday. So therefore, he waited for a couple of weeks and then tried his mass hypnosis again. Just as the last of the congregation was becoming mesmerized, the chain on the watch broke and the watch hit the lectern with a loud thud and springs and parts flew everywhere. 'Crap!' exclaimed the pastor. It took them a week to clean up the church.</p>

7693,"<p>An aquarium is just interactive television for cats.</p>
<p>Anything on the ground is a cat toy. Anything not there yet, will be.</p>
<p>At least dogs do what you tell them to do. Cats take a message and get back to you.</p>
<p>Buy a dog a toy and it will play with it for ever. Buy a cat a present and it will play with the wrapper for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Cat's motto: No matter what you've done wrong, always try to make it look like the dog did it.</p>
<p>Cat rule #2: Bite the hand that won't feed you fast enough.</p>
<p>Cats are rather delicate creatures and they are subject to a good many ailments, but I never heard of one who suffered from insomnia.</p>
<p>Cats are smarter than dogs. You can't get eight cats to pull a sled through snow.</p>
<p>Cats aren't clean, they're just covered with cat spit.</p>
<p>Cats don't hunt seals. They would if they knew what they were and where to find them. But they don't, so that's all right.</p>
<p>Cats instinctively know the exact moment their owners will wake up. Then they wake them 10 minutes sooner.</p>
<p>Cats know what we feel. They don't care, but they know.</p>
<p>Cats seem to go on the principle that it never does any harm to ask for what you want.</p>
<p>Dogs have owners. Cats have staff.</p>
<p>Dogs believe they are human. Cats believe they are God.</p>
<p>I had to get rid of my wife. The cat was allergic.</p>
<p>I have studied many philosophers and many cats. The wisdom of cats is infinitely superior.</p>
<p>In a cat's eye, all things belong to cats.</p>
<p>On the Internet, nobody knows you're a cat.</p>
<p>One cat just leads to another.</p>
<p>People that hate cats will come back as mice in their next life.</p>
<p>Some people say that cats are sneaky, evil, and cruel. True, and they have many other fine qualities as well.</p>
<p>There are many intelligent species in the universe. They are all owned by cats.</p>
<p>When I wash the cat, it takes me hours to get the hair off my tongue.</p>
<p>You can always tell a cat, but you can't tell him much.</p>

7699,"<p>Microsoft Corporation today announced its intent to purchase, copyright, and upgrade God Himself. The new product would be named, predictably enough, Microsoft God,"" and would be available to consumers sometime in late 1998. Too many people feel separated from God in today's world,"" said Dave McCavaugh, director of Microsoft's new Religions division. </p>
<p>""Microsoft God will make our Lord more accessible, and will add an easy, intuitive user interface to Him, making Him not only easier to find, but easier to communicate with."" The new Microsoft Religions line will be expanded to include a multitude of add-on products to Microsoft God, including: </p>
<p>Microsoft Crusades: This conversion product will bring all worshipper accounts and prayer files over from previous versions of God, or from competing products like Buddha or Allah. </p>
<p>Microsoft God for the World Wide Web: This product ties Microsoft God with Microsoft Internet Information Server, making our Lord accessible from the World Wide Web using a standard Web browser interface. It introduces several new Web technologies, including Dynamic Salvation and Active Prayer Pages (APP). Donations for the poor can be donated via a Secure Alms Server. </p>
<p>Microsoft Prayers: Using a Windows-based WYSIWYG interface, this product will allow worshippers to construct effective prayers in a minimum of time. A Secure Prayer Channel technology allows guaranteed delivery of the prayer to Microsoft God servers, and Prayer Wizards enable users to construct new types of prayers with a minimum learning curve.</p>
<p>Microsoft Savior: This product will allow worshippers to transfer their sins to its internal Vice Database. After a preset interval, the product will erase itself from the user's system and establish a clear line of secure communications to the user's Microsoft God server. </p>
<p>Additionally, Microsoft is expected to announce a line of complimentary products for the new Religions line, which will enhance the functionality of the Microsoft God server product by providing a customized user interface. These interfaces will be based on popular religious sects, allowing worshippers to interact with the new God product in much the same way as the previous version. This line is expected to include Microsoft Christianity, Microsoft Catholicism, Microsoft Judaism (incompatible with Microsoft Savior), etc. </p>
<p>Competitor Netscape Communications denies rumors that it is planning to release a competing product, Netscape Satanism, that would attempt to render Microsoft God installations inoperable.</p>

7706,"<p>Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br /> Not a circuit was working not even in my mouse;<br /> The files were all loaded on the hard disc with care,<br /> In hopes that the FAT would list them as there.<br /> The backups were nestled all snug in their sleeves,<br /> To keep the bytes from dropping off them like leaves;<br /> And the disc drive was quiet, taking a rest<br /> Just waiting to run the next boot-up test.<br /> When out of the speaker there arose such a clatter<br /> I sprang to my desk to see what was the matter.</p>
<p>Away to the keyboard I flew like a flash,<br /> Threw open the drive-door and heard a loud crash.<br /> The lights on the breast of the new-fallen dust<br /> Gave a luster of mid-day to a CRT covered with crust.<br /> When what to my wondering eyes did appear,<br /> But a miniature sleigh and the eight data registers I fear.<br /> With a little old driver, so lively and gloss<br /> I knew in a moment he was a master of DOS.<br /> More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br /> And he whistled out and called them by name<br /> ""Now Binkley! Now Maximus! Now timEd and Squish!<br /> On, Telix! On, X00! On, Bark and WaZoo!<br /> To the top of the memory! To the top of the stack!<br /> Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""<br /> As leaves before the wild hurricane fly,<br /> When they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky,<br /> So up on the screen the coursers they flew,</p>
<p>With a sleigh full of utilities, and DOS commands too.<br /> As I drew back my head and was turning around,<br /> Out the RS-232 port he came with a bound.<br /> He was dressed all in ROM, from his head to his foot,<br /> And his clothes were all tarnished with bytes and some soot;<br /> A bundle of data he had flung on his back,<br /> And he looked like he had a program he wanted to crack.<br /> His eyes -- How they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!<br /> His cheeks were like roses, his nose was a cherry!<br /> His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br /> And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;<br /> The stump of a pipe he held in his teeth,<br /> And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br /> He had a broad face and a round little belly<br /> That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.<br /> He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br /> And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;</p>
<p>A flash of the CRT and a twist of his head<br /> Soon gave me to know I had lost programs to dread;<br /> He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br /> And filled all the RAM; then turned, the big jerk,<br /> And laying a finger aside of his nose,<br /> And giving a nod, in the RS-232 port he goes.<br /> He sprang to the sleigh, his team they all whistled,<br /> And away they all flew like they had sat on a thistle.<br /> But I heard him exclaim, ere he faded out of sight,<br /> ""Bug-free programs to all and to all a good night!""</p>

<p>He was so excited! He walked up and said, ""Mr. Kidd, I am your biggest fan. I have always wanted to be just like you."" ""Look at me. Do I look like a gunfighter?""</p>
<p>Billy looked him over and said, ""Well, you have the right clothes and you have a nice black hat, and I see you rode up on a black horse. But, can you shoot?""</p>
<p>Marvin looked around the room and said, ""See that piano player over there?"" He drew his pistol and fired, shooting the cufflink off the piano player's shirt.</p>
<p>Billy said, ""Not bad. Can you shoot with your left hand? A gunfighter's got to be able to shoot with both hands.""</p>
<p>Marvin drew his other pistol and fired, shooting off the piano player's other cufflink.</p>
<p>Billy said, ""That's mighty fine shooting. I just have one piece of advice for you.""</p>
<p>Marvin was bubbling with excitement, ""What is it? What else should I do?""</p>
<p>Billy spoke slowly, ""Well, go back into the kitchen there and get a big tub of lard. Take both of your pistols and rub them around in the lard, get them good and slick.""</p>
<p>Marvin was puzzled. He asked, ""Why is that important? What good will rubbing my pistols in lard do?""</p>
<p>Billy replied, ""It won't help your shooting at all, but when Wyatt Earp finishes playing the piano over there he's going to shove both of your pistols up your ass.""</p>

7735,"<p>Long ago, when sailing ships ruled the waves, a captain and his crew were in danger of being boarded by a pirate ship. As the crew became frantic, the captain bellowed to his First Mate, 'Bring me my red shirt!'</p>
<p>The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt, which the captain put on and led the crew to battle the pirate boarding party. Although some casualties occurred among the crew, the pirates were repelled.</p>
<p>Later that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels sending boarding parties. The crew cowered in fear, but the captain, calm as ever bellowed, 'Bring me my red shirt!'</p>
<p>And once again the battle was on. However, the Captain and his crew repelled both boarding parties, though this time more casualties occurred.</p>
<p>Weary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting the day's occurrences when an ensign looked to the Captain and asked, 'Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before the battle?'</p>
<p>The Captain, giving the ensign a look that only a captain can give, exhorted, 'If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the wound and thus, you men will continue to fight unafraid.'<br /> The men sat in silence marveling at the courage of such a man.</p>
<p>As dawn came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate ships, 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way.<br /> The men became silent and looked to the Captain, their leader, for his usual command.<br /> The Captain, calm as ever, bellowed, 'Bring me my brown pants!'</p>

7762,"<p>An Irishman walks into a bar in Dublin, orders three pints of Guinness and sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finishes, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.</p>
<p>The barman asks him,<br /> 'You know, a pint goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time.'</p>
<p>The Irishman replies,<br /> 'Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in America and the other's in Australia and I'm here in Dublin. </p>

7764,"<p>An old hillbilly and his wife had never been more than 7 miles from their home in the East Tennesse Smokies. One day the man said to his wife, ""Honey, you know we're not getting any younger and I sure would like to take a vacation and stay in one of those fancy hotels in the city before I die."" </p>
<p>That sounded good to her so they started scrimping and saving. Four years later they had enough for them and their never-married adult son to go and spend 5 nights in a very posh hotel in the big city. They all piled into the man's old pickup and headed out. </p>
<p>When they got to the hotel the man said to his wife, ""Mama, you just wait in the truck. Junior and I will go in and be sure this is the right place."" </p>
<p>When they stepped into the lobby they both thought they had died and gone to heaven. There were indoor streams and water fountains, polished marble and gleaming brass everywhere. But the most amazing thing of all was the elevators. They stood there and watched the lights flash, the doors open and close and people getting on and off. </p>
<p>A stooped over little lady who was 90 if she was a day approached the elevators and pushed the ""Up"" arrow. The door opened and she got on. The door closed. The lights above the door flashed. They flashed some more and the door opened. The most stunning 24-year-old, green-eyed blonde you've ever seen stepped off and went into the lounge. The son looked at his dad. </p>
<p>The dad looked at his son for just a second and then said, ""Son, go git yer Ma.""</p>

7783,"<p>One day a man was taking a tour of the Vatican, snapping<br /> pictures with his camera as he went. But suddenly, he had this<br /> urge to go to the washroom, but he held it in because the tour<br /> guide told the group that they were going to see the pope! And<br /> he was excited.</p>
<p>So they met the pope, and the man was very happy having met the<br /> pope. When the pope left, he decided to go to the washroom,<br /> finally, since he really had to go. He followed the signs to the<br /> washrooms, unknowingly following the pope as he went.</p>
<p>He entered the washroom not knowing that the pope had just<br /> entered the washroom. And since we all know that the pope is<br /> horny, as he always is, he is jacking off to a nudie-mag in the<br /> stall.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the man, he enters the same stall as the pope,<br /> who is jerkin' his gerkin. Completely astonished, the man snaps<br /> a picture.</p>
<p>""Whoa, wait"" pleads the pope, ""You can't let that picture get to<br /> the media. It will be spread all over the world, they would tear<br /> me apart! I will be ruined. You have to sell me that camera. I<br /> will give you $1000 for it.""</p>
<p>""Whoa, a thousand bucks!"" exclaims the man, ""That is more than<br /> five times what I paid for it! I will do it! Yeah!""</p>
<p>So he sells his camera to the pope, and leaves happy, but after<br /> he utilizes the facilities. The pope opens up the camera,<br /> exposing the film as to erase the discriminating evidence. While<br /> he was doing this he realizes that his new camera is quite nice,<br /> so he keeps it.</p>
<p>Later, the pope goes on a much needed and wanted vacation. He<br /> visits Amsterdam, and during his many travels, he goes on some<br /> tours.</p>
<p>One day he is snapping photos with his $1000 camera. Another<br /> tourist, not recognizing the pope, remarks: ""That is a really<br /> nice camera. How much did you spend on it?""</p>
<p>""Well, I bought it from this guy for a thousand dollars."" says<br /> the pope.</p>
<p>""Oh boy!"" remarks the other tourist, ""he must have seen you<br /> coming!""</p>

<p>""Why, right here of course!"" said the Scot, ""Come in and avail yourself of our world famous hospitality.""</p>
<p>The traveler duly entered the humble but cozy residence.</p>
<p>""Jeannie,"" shouted the host in the direction of the kitchen, and in response to his call his beautiful daughter appeared. ""Jeannie, make a meal for the gentleman and remember to uphold our great tradition of Highland hospitality.""</p>
<p>The traveler was soon tucking into an appetizing meal, and he saw that the girl had indeed spared no effort to extend Highland hospitality to the guest. </p>
<p>""And now,"" said the Highlander, ""I'm afraid I must go out and milk the cows, but just make yourself at home and take full advantage of our world famous Highland hospitality.""</p>
<p>No sooner had the door closed behind him than the traveler set about seducing the lovely daughter. In no time at all he had her on floor and was on the job. Suddenly the door opened and there stood the Highlander. </p>
<p>He took one look at what was going on and his face turned purple with rage. He dropped his two buckets of milk with a crash and gave verbal vent to his wrath.</p>
<p>""After all I have been saying about the Highland hospitality,"" he roared, ""Arch your back, woman, and take the poor man's balls off the cold floor."" </p>

<p>I had been doing Tech Support for Hewlett-Packard's DeskJet division for about a month when I had a customer call with a problem I just couldn't solve. She could not print yellow. All the other colors would print fine, which truly baffled me because the only true colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. For instance, green is a combination of cyan and yellow, but green printed fine. </p>
<p>Every color of the rainbow printed fine except for yellow. I had the customer change ink cartridges. I had the customer delete and reinstall the drivers. Nothing worked. I asked my co-workers for help; they offered no new ideas. </p>
<p>After over two hours of troubleshooting, I was about to tell the customer to send the printer in to us for repair when she asked quietly, </p>
<p>""Should I try printing on a piece of white paper instead of this ""yellow"" construction paper?"" </p>

<p>A man attempting to set up his new printer called the printer's tech support number, complaining about the error message: ""Can't find the printer."" </p>

<p>Customer: ""Hello? I'm trying to dial in. I installed the software okay, and it dialed fine. I could hear that. Then I could hear the two computers connecting.

Would you like to initialize it'?""<br /> Tech Support: ""Er, what happened next?""<br /> Customer: ""After they were initialized all the disks appeared to be blank.

<p>For a computer programming class, I sat directly across from someone, and our computers were facing away from each other. </p>
<p>A few minutes into the class, she got up to leave the room. I reached between our computers and switched the inputs for the keyboards. She came back and started typing and immediately got a distressed look on her face. </p>
<p>She called the teacher over and explained that no matter what she typed, nothing would happen. The teacher tried everything. By this time I was hiding behind my monitor and quaking red-faced. </p>
<p>I started to type, ""Leave me alone!"" </p>
<p>They both jumped back, silenced. ""What the . . . "" the teacher said.<br /> I typed, ""I said leave me alone!"" </p>
<p>The kid got real upset. ""I didn't do anything to it, I swear!""<br /> It was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud. The conversation between them and HAL 2000 went on for an amazing five minutes. </p>
<p>Me: ""Don't touch me!"" </p>
<p>Her: ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit your keys that hard."" </p>
<p>Me: ""Who do you think you are anyway?!"" Etc. Finally, I couldn't contain myself any longer and fell out of my chair laughing. </p>
<p>After they had realized what I had done, they both turned beet red. Funny, I never got more than a C- in that class. </p>

<p>Milty, for twenty dollars you can talk to your zayde (grandfather) who you misses so much!""</p>

"
7818,"<p>It started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties now and then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and soon I was more than just a social thinker. I began to think alone - ""to relax,"" I told myself - but I knew it wasn't true. </p>
<p>Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself. I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, ""What is it exactly we are doing here?"" </p>
<p>Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's. I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called me in. He said, "" I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job."" This gave me a lot to think about. I came home early after my conversation with the boss. </p>
<p>""Honey,"" I confessed, ""I've been thinking..."" </p>
<p>""I know you've been thinking,"" she said, ""and I want a divorce!"" </p>
<p>""But Honey, surely it's not that serious."" </p>
<p>""It is serious,"" she said, lower lip aquiver. ""You think as much as college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!"" </p>
<p>""That's a faulty syllogism,"" I said impatiently, and she began to cry. I'd had enough. ""I'm going to the library,"" I snarled as I stomped out the door. </p>
<p>I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed. As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. ""Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?"" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinkers Anonymous poster. Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was ""Porky's."" Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting. </p>
<p>I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.</p>

7823,"<p>This chain letter was started in hopes of bringing relief to other tired and discouraged men. Unlike most chain letters, this one does not cost anything. Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are equally tired and discontented. Then bundle up your wife or girlfriend and send her to the man whose name appears at the top of the following list and add your name to the bottom of the list. When your turn comes, you will receive 15,625 women. One of them is bound to be better than the one you already have. At the writing of this letter, a friend of mine had already received 184 women, of whom 4 were worth keeping. REMEMBER this chain brings luck. One man's pit bull died and the next day he received a Playboy swimsuit model. An unmarried man living with his widowed mother was able to choose between a Hooters waitress and a Hollywood super model. You can be lucky too, but DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN! One man broke the chain and got his own wife back again. Let's keep it going, men! Just add your name to the list below! &gt; Bill Clinton&gt; 1600 Pennsylvania Ave&gt; Washington DC&gt;&gt; William Jefferson Clinton&gt; 1600 Pennsylvania Ave&gt; Washington DC&gt;&gt; W. J.

Maybe you'll luck out and<br /> catch yourself a big one!"" Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the<br /> swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.<br /> Later in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home, when he spotted the young<br /> woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he saw a<br /> huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She took aim, killed the<br /> creature, and with a great deal of effort hauled it on to the swamp bank. Lying<br /> nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watched in<br /> amazement.

<p>Please don't answer it without giving it some serious thought. By giving an honest answer you will be able to test where you stand morally.</p>
<p>The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, where you will have to make a decision one way or the other. Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous. Please scroll down slowly and consider each line - this is important for the test to work accurately.</p>

You are a CNN photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless. You're trying to shoot very impressive photos. There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destructive power and is ripping everything away with it.</p>
<p>Suddenly you see a man in the water, he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.</p>
<p>Suddenly you know who it is -- it's George W. Bush!</p>
<p>At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away, forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the best photo of your life. So you can save the life of George W. Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer prize winning photo, a unique photo displaying the death of one of the world's most powerful men.</p>

7866,"<p>This was actually an essay written by a college applicant<br /> applying to colleges/universities. The author of this essay,<br /> Hugh Gallagher, now attends NYU</p>
<p>ESSAY IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF OF OUR COLLEGE TO GET TO<br /> KNOW YOU, THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE<br /> FOLLOWING QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU<br /> HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED<br /> TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON?</p>
<p>I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing<br /> ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch<br /> breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat<br /> retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write<br /> award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I<br /> tread water for three days in a row. I woo women with my<br /> sensuous and godlike trombone playing.</p>
<p>I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed,<br /> and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an<br /> expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.<br /> Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once<br /> single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin<br /> from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I<br /> was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous<br /> documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges<br /> in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after<br /> school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge. I am an<br /> abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie.<br /> Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy<br /> evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I<br /> receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won<br /> the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a<br /> traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft<br /> floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany<br /> circles.</p>
<p>Children trust me. I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving<br /> objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby<br /> Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to<br /> refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact<br /> location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed<br /> several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when<br /> I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I<br /> successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had<br /> seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me. I<br /> balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.<br /> On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact<br /> origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot<br /> to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals<br /> using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning<br /> clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving<br /> competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I<br /> have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I<br /> have spoken with Elvis. But I have not yet gone to college.</p>

"
7867,"<p>As I let go of my feelings of guilt, I can get in touch with my Inner<br /> Sociopath.</p>
<p>I have the power to channel my imagination into ever-soaring levels of<br /> suspicion and paranoia.</p>
<p>I assume full responsibility for my actions, except the ones that are<br /> someone else's fault.</p>
<p>I no longer need to punish, deceive or compromise myself. Unless, of<br /> course, I want to stay employed.</p>
<p>In some cultures what I do would be considered normal.</p>
<p>Having control over myself is nearly as good as having control over others.</p>
<p>My intuition nearly makes up for my lack of good judgment.</p>
<p>I honor my personality flaws, for without them I would have no personality<br /> at all.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc heard voices too.</p>
<p>I am grateful that I am not as judgmental as all those censorious,<br /> self-righteous people around me.</p>
<p>I need not suffer in silence while I can still moan, whimper and complain.</p>
<p>As I learn the innermost secrets of the people around me, they reward me<br /> in many ways to keep me quiet.</p>
<p>When someone hurts me, forgiveness is cheaper than a lawsuit. But not<br /> nearly as gratifying.</p>
<p>The first step is to say nice things about myself. The second, to do nice<br /> things for myself. The third, to find someone to buy me nice things.</p>
<p>As I learn to trust the universe, I no longer need to carry a gun.</p>
<p>All of me is beautiful and valuable, even the ugly, stupid, and disgusting<br /> parts.</p>
<p>I am at one with my duality.</p>
<p>Blessed are the flexible, for they can tie themselves into knots.</p>
<p>I will strive to live each day as if it were my 40th birthday.</p>
<p>Only a lack of imagination saves me from immobilizing myself with<br /> imaginary fears.</p>
<p>I honor and express all facets of my being, regardless of state and local<br /> laws.</p>
<p>Today I will gladly share my experience and advice, for there are no<br /> sweeter words than ""I told you so.""</p>
<p>False hope is nicer than no hope at all.</p>
<p>A good scapegoat is nearly as welcome as a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Just for today, I will not sit in my living room all day watching TV.<br /> Instead I will move my TV into the bedroom.</p>
<p>Who can I blame for my own problems? Give me just a minute... I'll find<br /> someone.</p>
<p>Why should I waste my time reliving the past when I can spend it worrying<br /> about the future?</p>
<p>The complete lack of evidence is the surest sign that the conspiracy is<br /> working.</p>
<p>I am learning that criticism is not nearly as effective as sabotage. </p>
<p>Becoming aware of my character defects leads me to the next step --<br /> blaming my parents.</p>
<p>To have a successful relationship I must learn to make it look like I'm<br /> giving as much as I'm getting.</p>
<p>I am willing to make the mistakes if someone else is willing to learn from<br /> them.</p>

<p>""Ooooooh, it's much more beautiful here than I ever imagined,"" George answered. </p>
<p>""The sky is bluer, the air is cleaner, and the pastures are much more lush and green than I ever expected. And the only thing we do all day long is eat and sleep, eat and sleep, over and over."" </p>

7881,"<p>To the citizens of the United States of America: </p>
<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. </p>
<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. </p>
<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: </p>
<p>1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up ""aluminium"" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. </p>
<p>Look up ""vocabulary"". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"". </p>
<p>2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. </p>
<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. </p>
<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. </p>
<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through. </p>
<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. </p>
<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. </p>
<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for ""shit"" </p>
<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day. </p>
<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. </p>
<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy. </p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<p>No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't walk on water. Pool filters ""do not like Jell-O!""</p>
<p>A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot house 4 inches deep.</p>
<p>Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.</p>
<p>Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.</p>
<p>If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough however to spread paint on all four walls of 20 by 20 foot room.</p>
<p>You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. And the glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a<br /> baseball hit by a ceiling fan.</p>
<p>Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four year old.</p>
<p>VCR's do not eject peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, even though TV commercials show they do.</p>
<p>Always look in the oven before you turn it on. It's been proven that plastic toys do not like ovens.<br /> Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence.</p>
<p>If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades, they can ignite.</p>

7910,"<p>Sitting on the side of the highway waiting to catch speeding drivers, a State Police Officer see's a car puttering along at 22 MPH.He thinks to himself, ""This driver is just as dangerous as a speeder!""So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies, two in the front seat and three in the back, wide eyed and white as ghosts.The driver, obviously confused, says to him, ""Officer, I don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems to be the problem?""""Ma'am,"" the officer replies, ""You weren't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers.""""Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly twenty-two miles an hour!"" the old woman says a bit proudly.The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that ""22"" was the route number, not the speed limit.A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error.""But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to ask... Is everyone in this car OK? These women seem awfully shaken and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time,"" the officer asks.""Oh, they'll be all right in a minute officer.

"
7911,"<p>As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research help from that renowned scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990) - I am pleased to present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus.</p>
<p>1. No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen.</p>
<p>2. There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since Santa doesn't (appear to) handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one good child in each.</p>
<p>3. Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purpose of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household, a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and so forth. This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.</p>
<p>4. The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized Lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that ""flying reindeer"" (see point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>5. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft reentering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.</p>
<p>In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now!</p>

Recently he upgraded Fiancee1.0 to Wife1.0 and it's a memory hogger, has taken all his space; and   Wife1.0 must be running before he can do anything. Although he   didn't ask for them, Wife1.0 came with plug-ins such as MotherInLaw   and BrotherInLaw.   Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend4.0...    - A 'Don't remind me again' button    - Minimize button    - Shutdown feature    - An installshield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be completely      uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache and other      objects)    - 'Abort' button     I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still    installed, they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted.    Then I tried to uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 but it didn't have an    uninstall program.  I tried to unstall it by hand, but it put    files in my system directory.   Another thing that sucks -- in all versions of Girlfriend that    I've used is that it is totally 'object orientated' and only    supports hardware with gold plated contacts.          *****  BUG WARNING  ********   Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress   1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney   files before doing the uninstall itself.

7925,"<p>I never have quite figured out why the sexual urges of men &amp; women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Mars &amp; Venus thing. And, I never have figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart. And, I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene gets thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words ""I do"".</p>
<p>One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""</p>
<p>I said, ""WHAT??"" So she says the words that I and every husband on the planet dreads. She explains that I must not be in tune with her emotional needs as a Woman. I'm thinking, ""What was her first clue?""</p>
<p>I finally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to bed. The very next day we went shopping at a big unnamed department store... I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them.</p>
<p>She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say OK. And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond earrings. Let me tell you ...she was so excited. She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don't think she cared. I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she doesn't even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK.</p>
<p>She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have seen her face when she said, ""I'm ready to go, let's go to the cash register.""</p>
<p>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No, honey. I don't feel like buying all this stuff now."" You should have seen her face ... it went completely blank. I then said, ""Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.""</p>
<p>And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a Man.""</p>
<p>I figure that I should be having sex again sometime during the Spring thaw.</p>

7929,"<p>She spent the first day packing her belongings into boxes, crates and suitcases. </p>
<p>On the second day, she had the movers come and collect her things. </p>
<p>On the third day, she sat down for the last time at their beautiful dining room table by candlelight, put on some soft background music and feasted on a pound of shrimp, a jar of caviar and a bottle of Chardonnay.. </p>
<p>When she had finished, she went into each and every room and deposited a few half-eaten shrimp shells dipped in caviar, into the hollow of the curtain rods. She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. </p>
<p>When the husband returned with his new girlfriend, all was bliss for the first few days. Then slowly, the house began to smell. They tried everything; cleaning, mopping and airing the place out. Vents were checked for dead rodents and carpets were steam cleaned. Air fresheners were hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in to set off gas canisters, during which they had to move out for a few days, and in the end they even paid to replace the expensive wool carpeting. </p>
<p>Nothing worked. People stopped coming over to visit. Repairmen refused to work in the house. The maid quit. </p>
<p>Finally, they could not take the stench any longer and decided to move.  A month later, even though they had cut their price in half, they could not find a buyer for their stinky house. Word got out and eventually even the local realtors refused to return their calls. Finally, they had to borrow a huge sum of money from the bank to purchase a new place. </p>
<p>The ex-wife called the man and asked how things were going. He told her the saga of the rotting house. She listened politely and said that she missed her old home terribly, and would be ! willing to reduce her divorce settlement in exchange for getting the house back. Knowing his ex-wife had no idea how bad the smell was, he agreed on price that was about 1/10th of what the house had been worth, but only if she were to sign the papers that very day. She agreed and within the hour his lawyers delivered the paperwork. </p>

<li>Ask for the bits from the middle of your washers so that you can use them for Tiddlywinks.</li>
<li>Take your cat into the Pet Department and put him into different baskets. Call him ""Timmy"" and ask which he prefers. Then start arguing with him and say that the ones he prefers is too expensive. Ask passers-by if they have the same problem with their cats.</li>
<li>Complain that the 13 amp plug you bought leaks and that as a result you've not had a bath for months.</li>
<li>Go to the Customer Service desk and ask how to connect the plumb line you've just bought to your washing machine.</li>
<li>Take some planks of wood into the store and ask to try their best orbital sander. Afterwards ask them where they keep the wood varnish... you'd like to try that as well.</li>
<li>Order 90 metres of nylon cable with a strain rating of 6 Kg. Once they've measured and cut it produce a piece of paper from your pocket, stare at it and turn it upside down. Apologise and say that you really wanted 9 metres of nylon cable with a strain rating of 60 Kg.</li>
<li>Complain that none of the taps work in the model bathroom. Threaten to sue them on health grounds because they've also forgotten to provide soap or towels.</li>
<li>Try to hold up the cashier with a glue gun. Shout ""Stick 'em up!"" and start sniggering. When the cops come say ""It was only a joke. Geddit? Glue. Stick 'em up. Joke."" Keep protesting your innocence and sue them for not having a sense of humour.</li>
<li>Take a section of bright yellow carpet into the paint department and get people's opinion of which paint matches it best. Then produce some bright yellow curtain material and ask whether the paint still matches. Next get some bright pink cloth (""the color of my sofa"") and ask which paint goes best with all three. You can then produce another patch of material from your cushions, rugs, light-shades...</li>
<li>Join the longest checkout queue when ready to pay for your goods. Then move to the back of another long queue when just about to be served. Start complaining about the slow service - but keep moving to the back of another long queue when just about to be served. Eventually the manager will come out and take you to the front of a queue - just to get rid of you. When this happens turn round and grin at everybody else who you've just jumped in front of.</li>
<li>Produce a shopping list for a Jack Daniels spirit level, a long weight, a left-handed screw-driver and a tin of blue and white striped paint.</li>
<li>Shake all the Christmas trees until their needles start to fall out. Decide which tree was best. Then go buy a plastic tree because all the real ones were reduced to bare twigs.</li>
<li>Get a friend to hold each tape measure in turn while you pull the tape out to its fullest extent. Then shout ""Yeeha!"" and let the tape go. Time which recoils the fastest.</li>
<li>Switch off all the lights in the building so that you can try out the torches. When the staff get angry and turn them back on ask ""what they've got to hide?"".</li>
<li>Go to the Customer Service desk with a tin of paint (for example ""Egg-shell blue"", ""Buttermilk white"" or ""Jasmine yellow"") and ask whether they've got the same color but with a different name; the color's just right but there's no way you're going to paint your wall with something called *that*.</li>
<li>Borrow a volt meter from the electrical section, undo all packs of batteries and test them to find the freshest ones. Then decide to buy rechargeables instead.</li>
<li>Visit the garden department and ask for daffodil bulbs with the screw-type fitting. Then ask whether you can change the ones you bought by mistake last week with the bayonet fitting.</li>
<li>Ask if they have any Australian hose-pipes because you are going to live there and everybody knows that water flows the other way in the southern hemisphere.</li>
<li>Take your dimmer switch to the Returns Desk and complain that it is too intelligent - you wanted something dimmer.</li>
<li>Open all the glue pots and start sniffing them. When an assistant asks what you're doing thrust one of them under his nose and say ""Smell for yourself, this one's stale"".</li>
<li>Activate all the burglar alarms in the security section. When an innocent member of public sets them off, tie him up with some rope and shout ""I've caught him! I've caught him!"".</li>
<li>Pick up one of the demonstration models in the phone section and pretend to have a private conversation. Say to the (imaginary) person on the other end ""It's amazing, they must have wired this one in by mistake"". See how many people you can get to pick it up and try it after you've left.</li>
<li>Take items of bird food (bags of nuts and bars of seed) out into the garden section and fix them to the bird tables, so that the birds can eat them. If stopped by staff just say you thought somebody had put them in the wrong place and ask ""they are meant to be for the birds outside, aren't they?"".</li>
<li>Try cooking your Sunday lunch in one of their example kitchens. See how far you can get. Try and build up an audience as if you were doing a demonstration. If there's no electricity say ""Darn it, they forgot to wire it up for me again."" and move onto some other food preparation which doesn't need electricity. Keep saying things like ""Note the stylish doors"", ""Look at the quality of this work surface"" and ""The sink comes in four sizes, three shapes and seven colors"".</li>
<li>Buy twelve light bulbs and - when you get to the checkout - ask if you can test whether they are working because ""The last time I bought some from [insert name of rival store] half of them were already blown"". After they find you a socket and you've tested them all, suddenly remember you wanted a different fitting. Repeat the whole process then remember you wanted a different wattage. Repeat the whole process yet again then remember you wanted the special ""reflector"" spotlight ones. Eventually remember that the Electricity Company has cut your power because you've not been paying the bills. Ask them where they keep the candles.</li>

Unlike most chain letters, this one does not cost anything.<br /> Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are equally tired and discontented. Then bundle up your wife or girlfriend and send her to the man whose name appears at the top of the following list and add your name to the bottom of the list. </p>
<p>When your turn comes, you will receive 15,625 women. One of them is bound to be better than the one you already have. At the writing of this letter, a friend of mine had already received 184 women, of whom 4 were worth keeping. </p>
<p>REMEMBER this chain brings luck. One man's pit bull died and the next day he received a Playboy swimsuit model. An unmarried man living with his widowed mother was able to choose between a Hooters waitress and a Hollywood super model. </p>

<p>While examining the grandma, one of the paramedics pulls out a little plastic green soldier from her throat.

Hoping to get her into bed; he began showing her his collection of expensive paintings, first editions by famous authors and offered her a glass of wine. </p>
<p>He asked whether she preferred Port or Sherry and she said, ""Oh, Sherry by all means. To me it's the nectar of the gods. Just looking at it in a crystal-clear decanter fills me with a glorious sense of anticipation. When the stopper is removed and the gorgeous liquid is poured into my glass, I inhale the enchanting aroma and I'm lifted on the wings of ecstasy. It seems as though I'm about to drink a magic potion and my whole being begins to glow. The sound of a thousand violins being softly played fills my ears and I'm transported into another world. On the other hand, Port makes me fart.""</p>

7961,"<p>A small bottle containing urine sat upon the desk of Sir William Osler, the<br /> eminent professor of medicine at Oxford University. Sitting before him was a<br /> class full of young, wide-eyed medical students, listening to his lecture on the<br /> importance of observing details. To emphasise his point, Sir Osler announced,<br /> ""This bottle contains a sample for analysis. It's often possible by tasting it<br /> to determine the disease from which the patient suffers.""<br /> He then dipped a finger into the fluid and brought it into his mouth. He<br /> continued speaking, ""Now I am going to pass the bottle around. Each of you<br /> please do exactly as I did. Perhaps we can learn the importance of this<br /> techinque and diagnose the case.""</p>
<p>The bottle madeit's way from row to row, each student gingerly poking his<br /> finger in and bravely sampling the contents with a frown.</p>
<p>Dr. Osler then retrieved the bottle and startled his students by saying,<br /> ""Gentlemen, now you will understand what I mean when I speak about details. Had<br /> you been observant, you would have seen that I put my INDEX FINGER in the bottle<br /> but my MIDDLE FINGER into my mouth!""</p>

<p>""Great! Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into the wall.""<br /> [pause] ""Yes, it is.""</p>
<p>[Hmm. Well, that's interesting. I doubt s/he would have accidentally turned it off, and I don't want to send him/her hunting for the power switch because I don't know what kind of monitor s/he has and it's bound to have more than one switch on it. Maybe the video cable is loose or something.] ""When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?""</p>

<p>""Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?""<br /> [clear again] ""No.""</p>
<p>""Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?""<br /> ""Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle--it's because it's dark.""</p>
<p>""Dark?""<br /> ""Yes--the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window.""</p>
<p>""Well, turn on the office light then.""<br /> ""I can't.""</p>
<p>""No? Why not?""<br /> ""Because there's a power outage.""</p>
<p>""A power--!?!"" ...[AAAAAAARGH!]""A power outage? Aha! Okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?""<br /> ""Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.""</p>
<p>""Good! Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.""</p>

7974,"<p>Accountants What's the definition of an accountant? Someone who solves a problem you didn't know you had in a way you don't understand. What's the definition of a good tax accountant? Someone who has a loophole named after him. When does a person decide to become an accountant? When he realises he doesn't have the charisma to succeed as an undertaker. What does an accountant use for birth control? His personality. What's an extroverted accountant? One who looks at your shoes while he's talking to you instead of his own. What's an auditor? Someone who arrives after the battle and bayonets all the wounded. Why did the auditor cross the road? Because he looked in the file and that's what they did last year. There are three kinds of accountants in the world. Those who can count and those who can't. How do you drive an accountant completely insane? Tie him to a chair, stand in front of him and fold up a road map the wrong way. What do accountants suffer from that ordinary people don't? Depreciation. An accountant is someone who knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing. An accountant is having a hard time sleeping and goes to see his  doctor. ""Doctor, I just can't get to sleep at night."" ""Have you tried counting sheep?"" ""That's the problem - I make a mistake and then spend three hours  trying to find it.""</p>
