37008,"<p>A kid is walking around his house when he sees his dad watching a football game. The team his dad wants to win is losing, so out of anger, he yells, ""C'MON YOU BASTARDS, JUST SCORE A TOUCHDOWN!!""<br /> The kid doesn't know what bastards are, so he says, ""Daddy, what does bastards mean?""</p>
<p>His dad didn't want to admit to his son that he had cursed, so he said, ""Umm, it means, umm, uh, boys. Yeah, it means boys.</p>
<p>Then he walks into the room across the hall and sees his mom watching women's basketball. His mom's team is losing, so she says, ""C'MON YOU BITCHES, JUST SCORE A BASKET!!""</p>
<p>The kid doesn't know what that means either, so he says, ""Mommy, what does bitches mean?""</p>
<p>The mom says, ""Umm, it means, umm, uh, girls. Yeah, that's what it means, girls.""</p>
<p>So the next day, the kid's dad walks in from work and puts his coat on a coat rack. Because of his stupidity, the kid's dad pokes his eye on the coat rack and yells, ""OH DICK!!""</p>
<p>The kid comes up to his dad and says, ""Daddy, what does dick mean?""</p>
<p>The dad says, It means, umm, uh, coat. Yeah, it means coat.</p>
<p>So then the kid walks into the kitchen where his mom is painting. She accidentally leans over her painting too far, and her hat falls off her head and gets smothered with paint. She yells, ""OH PUSSY!!""</p>
<p>The kid says, ""Mommy, what does pussy mean?"" </p>
<p>The mom says, ""umm, it means, uhh, umm, hat. Yeah, that's what it means, hat.""</p>
<p>So then, the kid walks upstairs to his parents room, where his dad is taking a shower. But his dad accidentally slips on a bar of soap and yells, ""OH SCREW!!"" </p>
<p>The kid walks up to him and says, ""Daddy, what does screw mean?""</p>
<p>The dad says, ""Umm, uh, it means, uhh, cleaning. Yeah, cleaning.""</p>
<p>So then he walks downstairs and sees his mom cutting turkey for dinner that night. She accidentally cuts herself and yells, ""OH FUCK!!""</p>
<p>The kid says, ""Mommy, what does fuck mean?""</p>
<p>His mom says, ""It means, umm, uh, cutting. Yeah, cutting.""</p>
<p>So then some friends come over for dinner. The kid opens the door and says, ""Welcome bitches and bastards. May I take your dicks and pussys? If you'd like to see my parents, my dad is upstairs screwing himself and my mom is in the kitchen fucking the turkey.""</p>

37019,"<p>I know I'm not the only person in the world who hates<br /> telemarketers. I got bored one day, and made this list of stupid<br /> things to say to telemarketers. I've tried most of them. Enjoy!</p>
<p>1. Ask what state they live in. Proceed to call this state the<br /> ""I Hate That State"" state.</p>
<p>2. Tell them that you recognize their voice from an old<br /> schoolhouse rock cartoon. No matter what they say, insist on it.<br /> Demand an autograph.</p>
<p>3. Yell the word ""ouch"" at random intervals.</p>
<p>4. Ask the person to keep speaking up until he/she is<br /> practically screaming at the phone. Then, in a calm voice, tell<br /> them that you have not understood a word they have said, and<br /> hang up.</p>
<p>5. Ask when their birthday is. Proceed to sing ""Happy Birthday"",<br /> no matter the date.</p>
<p>6. Ask what they are wearing. Say that you have one of those two.</p>
<p>7. Speak, if you can, in a foreign language.</p>
<p>8. Pretend to be Regis Philbin from the Millionaire Show. Ask a<br /> very simple question, such as who the first President was. When<br /> they get it correct, sound very scientific and tell them why<br /> they are wrong.</p>
<p>9. Tell them to turn around. Hang up the phone when they do.</p>
<p>10. Ask a lot of real questions about the product. Pretend to be<br /> very interested. After about ten minutes of this, ask what color<br /> the product is. Tell the person that if it came in hot pink, you<br /> might think about it.</p>
<p>11. Tell your life story.</p>
<p>12. Tell your grandfather's life story.</p>
<p>13. Say that you have to go to the bathroom, but ask them to<br /> stay on the line. Leave the phone sitting there for about 3<br /> minutes. Return and yell out to nobody but so that the<br /> telemarketer can hear, ""Damn honey, you're good at that!""</p>
<p>14. Tell them that now is a bad time, as you're in the middle of<br /> having sex.</p>
<p>15. Ask to borrow some money.</p>
<p>16. Pretend to be selling the same product they are. Just repeat<br /> everything they say.</p>
<p>17. Do the ""Kerpal"" shtick. If you do not know what Kerpal is,<br /> download it now on Napster.</p>
<p>18. Tell them that you're having phone troubles and may get<br /> disconnected at random ti-</p>
<p>19. Ask to buy their left leg for $10.</p>
<p>20. Tell them that there is no ""product"", like from the kid in<br /> the Matrix.</p>

37022,"<p>Jesus and Satan were having an argument as to who was the better programmer. This went on for a few hours until they agreed to hold a contest with God as the judge. They sat at their computers and began.They typed furiously for several hours, lines of code streaming up on the screen. Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning struck, taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power was restored, and God announced that the contest was over. He asked Satan to show what he had come up with. Satan was visibly upset, and cried, ""I have nothing! I lost it all when the power went out.""""Very well, then,"" God said, ""Let us see if Jesus did any better.""Jesus entered a command, and the screen came to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir poured forth from the speakers. Satan was astonished. He stuttered, ""But how?! I lost everything, yet Jesus' program is intact! How did he do it?""God chuckled, ""Jesus saves""</p>

37052,"<p>It was afternoon in the crowded cafeteria. The elderly matron sitting at the counter was obviously upset at the cigarette smoke of the young woman beside her.</p>
<p>Finally the older woman could take it no longer. She turned to the girl and bellowed with a loud voice ""Young lady, I would rather commit adultery than smoke!""</p>

37054,"<p>A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house. He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. ""I'm lost,"" said the man. ""Can you put me up for the night?"" </p>
<p>""Certainly,"" the Chinese man said, ""but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."" </p>
<p>""Ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. </p>
<p>Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. </p>
<p>He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest."" </p>
<p>""Well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about."" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: ""Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle."" </p>
<p>In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. </p>
<p>As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.""</p>

37071,"<p>The Darwin Awards </p>
<p>The annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. </p>
<p>And 1996's winner true story is as follows: The Arizona Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The lab finally figured out what it was and what had happened. It seems that a guy had somehow gotten hold of a JATO unit (Jet Assisted Take Off - actually a solid fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra ""push"" for taking off from short airfields. </p>
<p>He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed and fired off the JATO unit. The facts as best as could be determined are that the operator of the 1967 Impala hit JATO ignition at a distance of approximately 4.0 miles from the crash site. This was established by the prominent scorched and melted asphalt at that location. The JATO, if operating properly, would have reached maximum thrust within 5 seconds, causing the Chevy to reach speeds well in excess of 350 mph and continuing at full power for an additional 20-25 seconds. </p>
<p>The driver, soon to be pilot, most likely would have experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 fighter pilots under full afterburners, basically causing him to become two dimensional for the remainder of his trip. The automobile, surprisingly, remained on the straight highway for about 2.5 miles (15-20) seconds before the driver, applied and instantly, melted the brakes. Not suprisingly, the now blown tires left thick rubber marks on the road surface just before he became airborne for an additional 1.4 miles and impacting the cliff face at a height of 125 feet leaving a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock. </p>
<p>It is estimated that the driver hit the cliff face at a whopping 468 mph, the average cruising speed of a DC-9. Most of the driver's remains were not recoverable; however, small fragments of bone, teeth and hair were extracted from the crater and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.</p>

37074,"<p>Singing Tree Tattles On Burglar Suspects </p>
<p> BATON ROUGE, La. (Reuters) - A singing Christmas tree tattled on two teenage<br /> burglary suspects in Louisiana, leaving the boys with backsides full of<br /> buckshot rather than handfuls of loot, police said Tuesday.<br />  Businessman Leon Wilson, Sr., 59, had been robbed twice last week, so he<br /> started sleeping in his store Friday night and set up a makeshift burglar<br /> alarm -- a motion-activated toy Christmas tree his wife had perched near the<br /> store's cash register. Wilson said the toy annoyed him everytime someone<br /> walked by.<br />  When motion is detected, the tree's eyes pop open, its mouth moves and it<br /> calls out ""Merry Christmas, Everybody!"" before singing ""Jingle Bells."" Wilson<br /> set up the toy near the door and stretched out on a couch in the back.<br />  Early Monday morning, the singing Christmas tree went off and he spotted two<br /> burglars near the cash register, armed with a crowbar they allegedly used to<br /> pry open the door, Wilson said.<br />  ""They spotted me and bolted for the door and I started shooting, aiming low<br /> cause I didn't want to kill them,"" he said. ""I don't think the Lord would have<br /> blessed me for that. But now, maybe, burglars won't come back here.""<br />  Baton Rouge police said the two 16-year-old suspects, one with buckshot in<br /> his buttocks and the other with a minor leg wound, were arrested on burglary<br /> charges and released to their parents.<br />  Police did not identify the boys because they are juveniles.<br />  Police said no charges were filed against Wilson, although the case will be<br /> forwarded to the district attorney for review.</p>

The Retriever went right to work, checking the poor dead dog out thoroughly with his nose.

37120,"<p>I recently finished up teaching Comp 4, the computer literacy course here at UNC, during a compressed summer session.  Comp 4 is an introductory class that assumes NO knowledge of computers among its students, and believe me when I say that this was often the case.  The class was great fun to teach, and one of the facets that made it interesting (day-in and day-out) was the wealth of new knowledge that the students imparted to me on tests and examinations.  I thought that I'd share some of these nuggets with you.  My comments are in the standard C delimiters (/* and */).  *Your* comments are encouraged. Here goes:     Bacchus invented FORTRAN.  /* I knew FORTRAN was old, and that it      may have been designed under the influence of alcohol, but...  */     There are three kinds of program statements:  sequence,      repetition, and seduction.     There are two types of graphics:  vector and rascal.  /* Otay...      */     Programming languages have specifictions.  /* Obviously this      student has dealt with a few standards.  */     Macs are compatible with each other.  /* Imagine the alternative:      ""What's your Mac's serial number?  We'll go back to the warehouse      and get your software.""  */     Doctors use computers to create a three demential picture of a      person's brain.  /* Is this classic, or what?  */     One kind of a hostile computer program is a Trojan.     C is a logical programming language.  /*  */     Heuristics (from the French heure, ""hour"") limit the amount of      time spent executing something.  [When using heuristics] it      shouldn't take longer than an hour to do something.  /* An      absolutely terrific ""false cognate"".  */     Having the computer automatically fill in images for animation is      called ""spleening"".  /* Derivation:  most likely ""splines"" +      ""tweening"".  */     One method of computer security is a phone line.  /* She qualified      it later by adding, ""You have to know the number.""  */     Video games are examples of fault-tolerant systems.On one test, I gave the students some abbreviations and asked them to tell me what they stood for.  You won't believe the creativity of a student in a test situation.  For example, one of the abbreviations was ""fax"", which *really* stands for ""facsimile"".  However, various Comp 4'ers said it stood for:  Fiber-optic Aided Xeroxing  Frequency Automatic X-rays/* and my favorite... */ Fast A** Xeroxing The students also had to hand in term papers, and these were rife with interesting tidbits.  I've clipped a few, quoted verbatim:     ""The worst thing the Mac has to offer, is that cooperative      multitasking is not available to be used.""     ""...  footnotes present an interesting problem, which may be      solvable by Hypercad.""  /* I assume the last term is the newest      rage -- a free-form database for designers.  */     ""...Linda, a blind girl, was able to attend public school due to      the aid of a speaking computer that taught her the basic      fundmamentals [sic] of grammar and spelling.""  /* Linda may want      to lend her computer out...  */     ""The program is manufactured by Quantel, a Silicon Valley company      located in Clearwater, Florida.""  /* A *long* valley, as my      roommate put it.  */     ""At the beginning of each season [Edwin] Moses teats himself on      computerized weight machines...""  /* Ouch!  */</p>

37133,"<p>During the ""rush hour"" at Houston's Hobby Airport, my flight was delayed due to a mechanical problem. Since they needed the gate for another flight, the aircraft was backed away from the gate while the maintenance crew worked on it. We were then told the new gate number, which was some distance away. </p>
<p>Everyone moved to the new gate, only to find that a third gate had been designated for us. After some further shuffling, everyone got on board, and as we were settling in, the flight attendant made the standard announcement, ""We apologize for the inconvenience of this last-minute gate change. This flight is going to Washington, D.C. If your destination is not Washington, D.C., then you should 'deplane' at this time."" </p>
<p>A very confused-looking and red-faced pilot emerged from the cockpit, carrying his bags. ""Sorry,"" he said, ""wrong plane."" </p>
<p>A true story.</p>
"
37134,"<p>An old farmer decided it was time to get a new rooster. The current rooster was still doing okay, but he was getting on in years, and the farmer figured getting a new rooster couldn't hurt anything. So he buys a young cock from the local rooster emporium and turns him loose in the barn yard. The old rooster sees the young one strutting around and he gets a little worried. ""So, they're trying to replace me"", thinks the old rooster. ""I've got to do something about this"".</p>
<p>He walks up to the new bird and says, ""So you're the new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff, don't you? Well I'm not ready for the chopping block yet. I'll bet I'm still the better bird. And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around that hen house over there.  We'll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for himself"". The young rooster was a proud sort, and he definitely thought he was more than a match for the old guy. ""You're on"" said the young rooster. ""And since I know I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of half a lap. I'll still win easy,"" said the young rooster.</p>
<p>The two roosters went to the hen house to start the race and all the hens gathered to watch. The race begins and all the hens start cheering the roosters on. After the first lap, the old rooster is still maintaining his lead. After the second lap, the old guy's lead has slipped a little but he's still hanging in there. Sadly, the old rooster's lead continues to slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he's just barely in front of the young rooster.</p>
<p>By now the farmer has heard all the commotion. He runs into the house, gets his shotgun, and runs out to the barn yard figuring a fox or something is after his chickens. When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the hen house, with the old rooster still slightly in the lead. He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires, and blows the young rooster away.</p>
<p>As he walks away slowly, he says to himself........  ""Damn, that's the third gay rooster I've bought this month!""</p>

<p>Along Interstate 35E near St. Paul, Minn., a motorist who had set the cruise control on her minivan was baffled when it began to speed up anyway, so she looked down and saw that a raccoon had sneaked into the van and was stepping on the accelerator. </p>
<p>At a busy intersection in Port Clinton, Ohio, a skunk got its head caught in a Coke can and held up traffic for 20 minutes when it became blinded and confused, running around in circles and spraying motorists. </p>

Not everything works according to the specs in the databook.<br />    4.

Engineering is like having an 8 a.m. class and a late afternoon lab<br /> every day for the rest of your life.<br />    6. Overtime pay? What overtime pay?<br />    7.

<p>We always used to spend Christmas with Grandpa and Grandma. They used to live here in a big brick home, but Grandpa got retarded and they moved to Florida. Now they live in a place with a lot of other retarded people. They all live in little tin boxes. They ride on three-wheeled tricycles and they all wear name tags, because they don't know who they are.</p>
<p>They go to a big building called a wrecked hall, but if it was wrecked, they got it fixed because it is alright now. They play games and do exercises there, but they don't do them very good. There is a swimming pool there. They go in it and just stand there with their hats on. I guess they don't know how to swim.</p>
<p>As you go into their park, there is a doll house with a little man sitting in it. He watches all day so they can't get out without him seeing them. When they can sneak out they go to the beach and pick up shells that they think are dollars.</p>
<p>My grandma used to bake cookies and stuff, but I guess she forgot how. Nobody cooks, they just eat out. They eat the same thing every night - early birds. Some of the people are so retarded they don't know how to cook at all, so my Grandma and Grandpa bring food into the wrecked hall and they call it ""Pot Luck"".</p>
<p>My Grandma says Grandpa worked all his life and earned his retardment. I wish they would move back up here, but I guess the little man in the doll house won't let them out.</p>

37175,"<p>////THE TYPES OF CHAIN LETTERS//// </p>
<p>I bet most of you people out there are plenty tired of all those<br /> stupid annoying pointless chainletters out there. Well, I have<br /> put together a list of the types of chain letters that you all<br /> hate. Enjoy! </p>
<p>///TYPE 1/// </p>
<p>Please help! Sammy, from Oogalablotscanda needs desperate help!<br /> He has no legs, no arms, and he has to drink 40 gallons of<br /> chocolate syrup before he can eat bannanas! All you have to do<br /> to help Sammy, is send this to 49,092 people in the next 2.998<br /> seconds, and sign your name at the bottom! For every person you<br /> send this to, Sammy will get 1 doller!!!! </p>
<p>///TYPE 2/// </p>
<p>Make a wish, and scroll down! </p>
<p>Have you made your wish??? </p>
<p>C'mon...make it dammit. </p>
<p>I haven't got all day here. </p>
<p>K got it??? </p>
<p>Good!! </p>
<p>Just keep scrolling.. </p>
<p>Scroll more........ </p>
<p>Getting tired???????? </p>
<p>HAHA!!! </p>
<p>OK STOP! </p>
<p>STOP I SAID STOP!!! </p>
<p>MAN STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
<p>Okay got your wish? Okay good. Now, all you have to do, is send<br /> this to more people so they can be tortured with anoying<br /> scrolling wish crap!<br /> If you send it to.... </p>
<p>0-15 people: Purple donkeys will jump through the moniter and<br /> attack you!<br /> 15-30 people: The donkeys will still attack you, but you wont be<br /> injured quite as severely.<br /> 30-50 people: Sheesh...so many people will be annoyed with you<br /> for sending this!<br /> 50-70: You will get $20! Who knows how..but you'll get it!<br /> 70-100: You will win the $20,000 lottery, but a big rock will<br /> fall out of the sky and crush you and your computer </p>
<p>Now send away!! </p>
<p>///TYPE 3/// </p>
<p>This chain letter has been going on since 1876. This is<br /> incredibly amazing, since there weren't any computers back then.<br /> Send this on (to 200,099 people in the next minutue)...or face<br /> the coniquences! Take a look at these examples- </p>
<p>(Dumbass horror story 1): Lue Ser, a 9 year old boy, was an<br /> average boy. He knew a lot about computers, and he figured that<br /> nothing bad could ever happen to him if he didn't pass this on.<br /> So, he deleted it, without hesitation. The next day, while<br /> getting ready for school, rabid squirrels arived at his door,<br /> and nibbled him to death!! </p>
<p>(Dumbass horror story 2): Stu Pidwun was about eh 12. Nobody<br /> liked him at all, so he didn't have too many friends. He only<br /> sent this to 4 people! After he sent it, he grinned and thought<br /> ""what a stupid chain letter nothing bad happend!"" Well, little<br /> did he know, an hour later, When he went to take his bath, he<br /> got sucked down the drain! For some strange reason, he shrunk<br /> down in size, and went right down the drain. Noone really cared<br /> tho, cuz no one liked him anyways. </p>
<p>(Dumbass happy story): Linda Luckee, a 12 year old, just like<br /> stu. She had lots of friends though. She really didn't believe<br /> in this chain letter, but she was bored so she sent it to<br /> 200,099 people, just like you're supposed to. The next day, she<br /> came home from school super happy. She had won the lottery! This<br /> is surprising, since you have to be an adult to enter the<br /> lottery but she won it alright! Plus, the guy she had been<br /> crusing on for 14 years asked her out!!! </p>
<p>Now, you wouldn't want to end up like Lue, or Stu would you? I'd<br /> much rather be like Linda. Well, it's your choice! Send this to<br /> 200,099 people now before the minute is over! Don't break the<br /> chain that's been in existance since 1876!!!!! </p>
<p>///TYPE 4/// </p>
<p>Hey this is really cool, try it! Send this to 789 people now!<br /> Exactly 789, if it's any higher or lower you will instantly be<br /> attacked by purple-butted-baboons! Okay, after you send it to<br /> the 789 peeps, hold 1+M+s+t+u+p+1+d+5+g+9+b, then a little<br /> window will pop up. In that window, type in ""I don't have enough<br /> fingers to press all the buttons!"" Then, a pig will fly across<br /> your screen with you name, hair color, and address on it!<br /> Amazing, huh! Send away!</p>

37184,"<p>Michigan, USA. </p>
<p>Guy buys brand new Grand Cherokee for 30 some thousand dollars and has 400+ dollar monthly payments. He immediately gets ahold of his friend and they go do some male bonding. They go duck hunting and of course all the lakes are frozen. These 2 Atomic Brains go to the lake with the guns, the dog, the beer and of course the new vehicle.</p>
<p>They drive out onto the lake ice and get ready. Now, they want to make some kind of a natural landing area for the ducks, something for the decoys to float on. Remember, it's all ice and in order to make a hole large enough to look like something a wandering duck wants to fly down and land on, it is going to take a little more effort than an ice hole drill. Out of the back of the new Grand Cherokee comes a stick of dynamite with a short, 40 second fuse. </p>
<p>Now these 2 Rocket Scientists do take into consideration that if they place the stick of dynamite on the ice at a location far from where they are standing (and the new Grand Cherokee), they take the risk of slipping on the ice when they run from the burning fuse and possibly going up in smoke with the resulting blast. So, they decide to light this 40 second fuse and throw the dynamite which is what they end up doing. </p>
<p>Remember a couple of paragraphs back when I mentioned the vehicle, the beer, the guns AND THE DOG???? Yes, the dog. A highly trained Black Lab used for retrieving, especially things thrown by the owner. </p>
<p>You guessed it, the dog takes off at a high rate of doggy speed on the ice and gets the stick of dynamite with the burning 40 second fuse about the time it hits the ice all to the woes of the 2 idiots yelling, stomping, waving arms and wondering what the hell to do now. The dog, well it is happy and heads back from where it came from moments before, with the stick of dynamite, only to the mounting woes of the 2 bozo's now really waving their arms, yelling even louder and jumping to new heights than ever before. </p>
<p>Now one of the guys decides to think, something that he has never done before this moment, grabs a shotgun and shoots the dog. The shotgun is loaded with #8 buck shot, hardly big enough to stop a Black Lab on its appointed rounds. Dog stops for a moment, slightly confused and continues on. Another shot and this time the dog, still standing, becomes really confused &amp; of course scared, thinking these 2 Nobel Prize winners have gone insane and takes off to find covep, with the now really short short fuse burning on this stick of dynamite. </p>
<p>The cover the dogs finds? Underneath the brand new Grand Cherokee 30 some thousand dollar 400+ monthly payment vehicle sitting on the lake ice. BOOM ! Dog dies, and it and the brand new Grand Cherokee 30 some thousand dollar 400+ monthly payment vehicle sink to the bottom of the lake leaving the 2 candidates for Co-leaders of the Known Universe standing there with this ""I can't believe this happened"" look on their faces. </p>
<p>Later, the owner of the vehicle calls his insurance company which tells him that sinking a vehicle in a lake by illegal use of explosives is not covered. </p>
<p>He had yet to make the first of those 400+ a month payments. </p>
<p>I felt pretty sorry for the dog myself.</p>

<p>The golfer thinks the man is crazy and that his answer will be<br /> meaningless but also that perhaps this is a good omen and will put him<br /> in the right frame of mind to make the difficult putt and says, ""OK.""<br /> And sinks the putt.</p>

37188,"<p>URGENT ASSISTANCE - FROM USA </p>
<p>IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED : HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL </p>
<p>FROM: GEORGE WALKER BUSH<br /> 202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111<br /> FAX: 202.456.2461 </p>
<p>Dear Sir / Madam, </p>
<p>I am GEORGE WALKER BUSH, son of the former president of the United States of<br /> America George Herbert Walker Bush, and currently serving as President of the<br /> United States of America. This letter might surprise you because we have not met<br /> neither in person nor by correspondence. I came to know of you in my search for<br /> a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business<br /> transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to an account<br /> requiring maximum confidence. </p>
<p>I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in<br /> acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq. My<br /> partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my<br /> father, who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the<br /> United States of America, and bravely served his country as director of the<br /> United States Central Intelligence Agency. </p>
<p>In the decade of the nineteen-eighties, my father, then vice-president of the<br /> United States of America, sought to work with the good offices of the President<br /> of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring<br /> Islamic republic of Iran. This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a<br /> falling-out with his Iraqi partner, who sought to acquire additional oil revenue<br /> sources in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait, a wholly-owned U.S.-British<br /> subsidiary. </p>
<p>My father re-secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of<br /> sixty-one billion u.s. dollars ($61,000,000,000). Out of that cost, thirty-six<br /> billion dollars ($36,000,000,000) were supplied by his partners in the Kingdom<br /> of Saudi Arabia and other persian gulf monarchies, and sixteen billion dollars<br /> ($16,000,000,000) by German and Japanese partners. But my father's former Iraqi<br /> business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum<br /> reserves. </p>
<p>My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the<br /> President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his<br /> country, as compensation for the costs of removing him from power.<br /> Unfortunately, our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of<br /> this new venture, which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to<br /> 200 billion dollars ($100,000,000,000 - $200,000,000,000), both in the initial<br /> acquisition and in long-term management. </p>
<p>Without the funds from our 1991 partners, we would not be able to acquire the<br /> oil revenue trapped within Iraq. That is why my family and our colleagues are<br /> urgently seeking your gracious assistance. Our distinguished colleagues in this<br /> business transaction include the sitting vice-president of the United States of<br /> America, Richard Cheney, who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and<br /> former head of the Halliburton oil company, and Condoleeza Rice, whose<br /> professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a<br /> Chevron oil tanker after her. </p>
<p>I would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty-five percent<br /> (10-25 %) of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important venture.<br /> The internal revenue service of the United States of America will function as<br /> our trusted intermediary. I propose that you make this transfer before the<br /> fifteenth (15th) of the month of April. </p>
<p>I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and<br /> worried. But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. A<br /> bold step taken shall not be regretted, I assure you. Please do be informed that<br /> this business transaction is 100% legal. If you do not wish to co-operate in<br /> this transaction, please contact our intermediary representatives to further<br /> discuss the matter. </p>
<p>I pray that you understand our plight. My family and our colleagues will be<br /> forever grateful. Please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers<br /> below.<br /> 202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111</p>

<p>Let's say you're an ape.  You're hanging out, you've got cool boots with individual toes. Ape City swings. Your job keeps you in torches and horse food. your wife looks good in green, which is a bit of luck, since that's all the women wear.</p>
<p>You lips move funny when you talk, but whatever.</p>
<p>Then this... this THING shows up. he's like an ape, but not quite. He's practically hairless. Does he shave his body? Creepy freak.</p>
<p>Then he opens his mouth and speaks. And he sounds just like Charlton Heston.  And he won't shut up. And that voice. And sorry, but you can't deal with that today.  He calls you names. he goes off on your stinking paws."" He disrespects your leather.</p>
<p>So you bounce his scrawny head off some walls. you clamp a collar on him and lean him around town. You and your boys put the fire hose on his non-hairy self.</p>
<p>Where, exactly,  is the problem here?  No, seriously. If Charlton Heston came up to you, right now, in your house while you're reading this at your computer and started rasping with his teeth clenched together about ""this-upside-down-civilization"" you'd slap his narrow backside into a cage, too. Beat it, gun boy. Tell 'em ""Hi"" at the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>All I'm saying is no one ever looks at this from the ape's point of view...</p>

<p>There was a young farmer who was in need of a rooster. So he head down to the local shop to buy one.</p>
<p>He then says to the shopkeeper: ""hello mister! I am in need of a rooster. Do you have one?"" The shopkeeper replies:<br /> ""Why yes I do, but around these parts we don't call them roosters. We call them coq's.""<br /> The man replies: ""ok, ill take one coq""<br /> So the man is off home with his coq.</p>
<p>The next day the farmer heads down to the shop again. This time to buy a goat. He says to the shopkeeper like yesterday...</p>
<p>""Hello again! I am in need of a goat. Do you have one?"" The shopkeeper replies:<br /> ""Why yes I do, but we dont call them goat's around here. We call them pullets"" The farmer is confused of the shopkeepers habits, but decides to reply kindly: ""Ok I'll take one pullet."" So the farmer is on his way home with his coq and pullet.</p>
<p>The very next day he goes to the very same shop to find the very same shopkeeper and he asks: ""Hello once again! I am in need of a donkey, do you have one?"" The shopkeeper is about to reply before the farmer butts in and says: ""Don't tell me! You call it something else around these parts!"" The shopkeeper pauses for a slight seconds then replies with:<br /> ""We do have a donkey, we nicknamed it ass because it's useless and the only one left.""<br /> The farmer replies with: ""What's wrong with it?""<br /> The farmer says ""It randomly stops while you ride it. The only way to make it move is to scracth it behind it's ears."" The farmer isn't too pleased with this but since he is desperate he buys the ass.</p>
<p>While on the ride home on his donkey, with his coq and pullet, the ass stops. Since the farmers hands are full he asks a nearby lady this... ""Lady, Please will you hold my coq and pullet while I scratch my ass?""</p>

"
37279,"<p>Kitty ToysToo Absurd Not to be TrueCalling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable because no matter how legitimate my illness, I always sense my boss thinks I am lying.  On one occasion, I had a valid reason but lied anyway because the truth was too humiliating to reveal.I simply mentioned that I had sustained a head injury and I hoped I would feel up to coming in the next day.  By then, I could think up a doozy to explain the bandage on my crown.In this case, the truth hurt. I mean it really hurt in the place men feel the most pain.  The accident occurred mainly because I conceded to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute little kitty.As the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower after breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen.  'Ed!' she hearkened, 'The garbage disposal is dead.  Come reset it.''You know where the button is.'  I protested through the shower (pitter-patter).  'Reset it yourself!''I am scared!'  She pleaded.  'What if it starts going and sucks me in?' . . . .Pause. . . . .  'C'mon, it'll only take a second.'No logical assurance about how a disposal can't start itself will calm the fears of a person who suffers from 'Big-ol-scary-machinephobia,' a condition brought on by watching too many Stephen King movies.  It is futile to argue or explain, kind of like telling Lloyd Bentsen Americans are over-taxed.  And if a poltergeist did, in fact, possess the disposal, and she was ground into round, I'd have to live with that the rest of my life.So out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to make a statement about how her cowardly behavior was not without consequence but it was I who would suffer.I crouched down and stuck my head under the sink to find the button.  It is the last action I remember performing.  It struck without warning, without respect to my circumstances.  Nay, it wasn't a hexed disposal, drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth.  it was our new kitty, clawing playfully at the dangling objects she spied between my legs.She ('Buttons' aka 'the Grater') had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I took the bait under the sink.  At precisely the second I was most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged them with her needle-like claws.Now when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close to their masculine region, they lose all rational thought to control orderly bodily movements.  Instinctively, their nerves compel the body to contort inwardly, while rising upwardly at a violent rate of speed.  Not even a well trained monk could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full weight of a kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure.  Wild animals are sometimes faced with a 'fight or flight' syndrome; men, in this predicament, choose only the 'flight' option.Fleeing straight up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels when it is alarmed.  It was a dismal irony.  But, whereas cats seek great heights to escape, I never made it that far.  The sink and cabinet bluntly impeded my ascent; the impact knocked me out cold.When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me.  Having been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics snorted as they tried to conduct their work while suppressing their hysterical laughter.  My wife told me I should be flattered.At the office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me. I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk.  'What's the matter, cat got your tongue?'If they had only known.</p>

37298,"<p>- Redneck Driving Etiquette -<br /> Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun is loaded and the deer is in sight.<br /> When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires always has the right of way.<br /> Never tow another car using pantyhose and duct tape.<br /> When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer.<br /> Never relieve yourself from a moving vehicle, especially when driving.<br /> Do not remove the seats from the car so that all your kids can fit in.<br /> Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.</p>
<p>- Redneck Personal Hygiene -<br /> Unlike clothes and shoes, a toothbrush should never be a hand-me-down item.<br /> If you have to vacuum the bed, it's time to change the sheets.<br /> While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.<br /> Plucking unwanted nose hair is time-consuming work.<br /> A cigarette lighter and a small tolerance for pain can accomplish the same goal and save hours.<br /> Note: Its a good idea to keep a bucket of water handy when using this method. </p>
<p>- Redneck Dining Out -<br /> Remember to leave a generous tip for good service. After all, their mobile home costs just as much as yours. </p>
<p>- Redneck Entertaining in Your Home -<br /> A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist.<br /> Do not allow the dog to eat at the table . . . no matter how good his manners are.<br /> If your dog falls in love with a guest's leg, have the decency to leave them alone for a few minutes. </p>
<p>- Redneck Dating (Outside the Family) -<br /> Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.<br /> Be aggressive. Let her know you are interested: ""I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the men's bathroom wall two years ago.""<br /> If a girl's name does not appear regularly on a bathroom wall, watertower, or an overpass, odds are good that the date will end in frustration. </p>

37307,"<p>Bubba and Jake chartered a plane with a pilot to drop them off in the wilds of<br /> Alaska for a week of elk hunting, just the same as they did the year before.<br /> When the pilot returned with the plane Bubba exclaimed joyfully to the pilot,<br /> ""We had a great hunting trip! We bagged four elk!""</p>
<p>The pilot regretfully explained, ""Unfortunately, our plane can only fly with<br /> the weight of two elk. You'll have to leave the other two behind.""</p>

37308,"<p>Dear Son,</p>
<p>I am writing this slow cause I know you can't read fast.  We don't live where we did when you left.  Your dad read in the paper that most accidents happened within 20 miles of home, so we moved.  I won't be able to send you the address cause the last family that lived here took<br /> the numbers with them for their next house so they won't have to change their address.  Wish I had thought of that.</p>
<p>This place has a small washing machine.  The first day I put four shirts in it, pulled the chain and haven't seen them since.</p>
<p>It only rained twice this week - three days the first time and four days the second.</p>
<p>The coat you wanted me to send you;  your aunt Sue said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with them heavy buttons, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. Don't tell anyone.</p>
<p>We got a bill from the funeral home, said we didn't make the last payment on Grandma's funeral bill;  up she comes.  Lucky we have a spare bedroom in the new place.  We can move her when you come to visit.</p>
<p>About your father - he has a lovely new job.  He has over 500 people under him; he is cutting grass at the cemetary.</p>
<p>Your sister had a baby this morning.  I haven't found out if it was a boy or a girl, so I don't know if you are an aunt or an uncle.</p>
<p>Three of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup truck.  One was driving and the other two were in the back bed.  The driver got out - he rolled down the window and swam to safety.  The other two drowned; they couldn't get the tailgate down.</p>
<p>Your uncle Mike fell in the whiskey vat at work.  Some men tried to pull hem out but he fought them off and drowned.  He wanted to be cremated,  burned for three days.</p>
<p>Not much more news at this time, nothing much happened. Write more often.</p>
<p>Love,<br />  Mom from somewhere in West Virginia</p>
<p>P.S. I was going to send money but the envelope was already sealed.</p>

<p>If you push the stick forward, the houses get bigger, if you pull the stick back they get smaller. (Unless you keep pulling the stick back -- then they get bigger again) </p>
<p>Flying is not dangerous; crashing is dangerous. </p>
<p>It's better to be down here wishing you were up there, than up there wishing you were down here. </p>
<p>The propeller is just a big fan in the front of the plane to keep the pilot cool. Want proof? Make it stop; then watch the pilot break out into a sweat. </p>
<p>Speed is life, altitude is life insurance. No one has ever collided with the sky. </p>
<p>It's best to keep the pointed end going forward as much as possible. </p>
<p>The only time you have too much fuel is when you're on fire. </p>
<p>Every one already knows the definition of a 'good' landing is one from which you can walk away. But very few know the definition of a 'great' landing. It's one after which you can use the airplane another time. </p>
<p>The probability of survival is equal to the angle of arrival. </p>
<p>Always remember you fly an airplane with your head, not your hands. Never let an airplane take you somewhere your brain didn't get to five minutes earlier. </p>
<p>You know you've landed with the wheels up when it takes full power to taxi. </p>
<p>Those who hoot with the owls by night should not fly with the eagles by day. </p>
<p>A helicopter is a collection of rotating parts going round and round and reciprocating parts going up and down - all of them trying to become random in motion. Helicopters can't really fly - they're just so ugly that the earth immediately repels them. </p>
<p>Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long enough to make all of them yourself. </p>
<p>Trust your captain .... but keep your seat belt securely fastened. </p>
<p>Good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment. </p>
<p>Aviation is not so much a profession as it is a disease. </p>
<p>There are three simple rules for making a smooth landing. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are. </p>
<p>The only thing worse than a captain who never flew as copilot is a copilot who once was a captain. </p>
<p>Be nice to your first officer, he may be your captain at your next airline. </p>
<p>It's easy to make a small fortune in aviation. You start with a large fortune. </p>
<p>A fool and his money are soon flying more airplane than he can handle. </p>
<p>Remember, you're always a student in an airplane. </p>
<p>Keep looking around; there's always something you've missed. </p>
<p>Try to keep the number of your landings equal to the number of your takeoffs. </p>
<p>You cannot propel yourself forward by patting yourself on the back. </p>
<p>There are old pilots, and there are bold pilots, but there are no old, bold, pilots! </p>
<p>Gravity never loses -- the best you can hope for is a draw! </p>
<p>You start out flying with a bag of luck and a bag of experience, the trick is to get your bag of experience full before your bag of luck is empty.</p>

37320,"<p>The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A death. What's that, a bonus? I think the life cycle is all backwards.   You should die first, get it out of the way. Then you live in an old age home. You get kicked out when you're too young, you get a gold watch, you go to work.   You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You do drugs, alcohol, you party, you get ready for high school.   You go to grade school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little baby, you go back into the womb, you spend your last nine months floating, and finally, the life cycle finishes off as an orgasm.</p>

<p>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first session of Housekeeping Tips for Regular People. If you're a Martha Stewart type of housekeeper, this column is NOT for you. However, for the rest of you, this is your chance to learn 15 Secret Shortcuts to Good Housekeeping that your mother never told you.</p>
<p>SECRET TIP 1: DOOR LOCKS </p>
<p>If a room clearly can't be whipped into shape in 30 days--much less 30 minutes--employ the Locked Door Method of cleaning. Tell anyone who tries to go in the room that the door is intentionally locked. CAUTION: It is not advisable to use this tip for the bathroom. </p>
<p>Time: 2 seconds </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 2: DUCT TAPE </p>
<p>No home should be without an ample supply. Not only is it handy for plumbing repairs, but it's a great way to hem drapes, tablecloths, clothes, just about anything. No muss, no fuss. </p>
<p>Time: 2-3 minutes </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 3: OVENS </p>
<p>If you think ovens are just for baking, think again. Ovens represent at least 9 cubic feet of hidden storage space, which means they're a great place to shove dirty dishes, dirty clothes, or just about anything you want to get out of sight when company's coming. </p>
<p>Time: 2 minutes </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 4: CLOTHES DRYERS </p>
<p>Like Secret Tip 3, except bigger. </p>
<p>CAUTION: Avoid hiding flammable objects here. </p>
<p>Time: 2.5 minutes </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 5: WASHING MACHINES &amp; FREEZERS</p>
<p>Like Secret Tip 4, except even bigger. </p>
<p>Time: 3 minutes </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 6: DUST RUFFLES </p>
<p>No bed should be without one. Devotees of Martha Stewart believe dust ruffles exist to keep dust out from under a bed or to help coordinate the colorful look of a bedroom. The rest of us know a dust ruffle's highest and best use is to hide whatever you've managed to shove under the bed. (Refer to Secret Tips 3, 4, 5.) </p>
<p>Time: 4 minutes </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 7: DUSTING </p>
<p>The 30-Minutes-To-A-Clean-House method says: Never dust under what you can dust around. </p>
<p>Time: 3 minutes </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 8: DISHES </p>
<p>Don't use them. Use plastic or paper and you won't have to. </p>
<p>Time: 1 minute </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 9: CLOTHES WASHING (EEWWW) </p>
<p>This secret tip is brought to you by an inventive teenager. When this teen's mother went on a housekeeping strike for a month, the teen discovered you can extend the life of your underwear by two ...if you turn it wrong side out and, yes, rerun it. </p>
<p>CAUTION: This tip is recommended only for teens and those who don't care if they get in a car wreck. Time: 3 seconds </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 10: IRONING </p>
<p>If an article of clothing doesn't require a full press and your hair does, a curling iron is the answer. In between curling your hair, use the hot wand to iron minor wrinkles out of your clothes. Yes, it really does work, or so I'm told, by other disciples of the 30-Minutes-To-A-Clean-House philosophy. </p>
<p>Time: 5 minutes (including curling your hair) </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 11: VACUUMING </p>
<p>Stick to the middle of the room, which is the only place people look. Don't bother vacuuming under furniture. It takes way too long and no one looks there anyway. </p>
<p>Time: 5 minutes, entire house; 2 minutes, living room only </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 12: LIGHTING </p>
<p>The key here is low, low, and lower. It's not only romantic, but bad lighting can hide a multitude of dirt.</p>
<p>Time: 10 seconds </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 13: BED MAKING </p>
<p>Get an old-fashioned waterbed. No one can tell if those things are made up or not, saving you, oh, hundreds of seconds over the course of a lifetime. </p>
<p>Time: 0 </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 14: SHOWERS, TOILETS, AND SINKS </p>
<p>Forget one and two. Concentrate on three. </p>
<p>Time: 1 minute </p>
<p>SECRET TIP 15: </p>
<p>If you already knew at least 10 of these tips, don't even think about inviting a Martha Stewart type to your home.</p>

37329,"<p>A man was walking in the mountains just enjoying the scenery when he stepped<br /> too close to the edge of the mountain and started to fall. In desperation he<br /> reached out and grabbed a limb of a gnarly old tree hanging onto the side of the<br /> cliff.</p>
<p>Full of fear he assessed his situation. He was about 100 feet down a<br /> shear cliff and about 900 feet from the floor of the canyon below. If he should<br /> slip again he'd plummet to his death. Full of fear, he cries out, ""Help me!"" But<br /> there was no answer. Again and again he cried out but to no avail. Finally he<br /> yelled, ""Is anybody up there?�</p>
<p>A deep voice replied, ""Yes, I'm up here.""<br /> ""Who is it?""<br /> ""It's the Lord.""<br /> ""Can you help me?""<br /> ""Yes, I can help. Have faith in me.""<br /> ""Help me!""<br /> ""Let go.""<br /> Looking around the man became full of panic. ""What?!?!""<br /> ""Have faith in me. Let go. I will catch you.""</p>
<p>""Uh... Is there anybody else up there?""</p>

37347,"<p>Water is importantWe all know that water is important but I've never seen it written down like this before.*** 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. *** In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger.Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%. One glass of water shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study. Lack of water, the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue. Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers. A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page.Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop bladder cancer.

37368,"<p>Three blondes died in an accident trying to jump the<br />    Grand Canyon. They  are  at the pearly gates of<br />    Heaven. St. Peter tells them that they can enter the<br />    gates only if they can answer one simple question. The<br />    question posed by St. Peter is - ""What is Easter""?</p>
<p>   The first blonde replies, ""Oh, that's easy! It's the<br />    holiday in November when we all get together, eat<br />    turkey and are thankful.""</p>
<p>   ""Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You<br />    must go to the other place!"" replies St. Peter. Then<br />    he turns to the second blonde, and asks her the same<br />    question - ""What is Easter?""</p>
<p>   The second blonde replies, ""Easter is the holiday in<br />    December when we put up a nice tree, exchange<br />    presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus.""<br />    St. Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head<br />    on the pearly gates in disgust and tells her she's<br />    wrong and will have to join her friend in the other<br />    place, she is not welcome in Heaven.</p>
<p>   He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and<br />    asks, ""Do YOU know what Easter is?""<br />    The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St.<br />    Peter in the eyes, ""I know what Easter is.""</p>
<p>   ""Oh?"" says St. Peter, incredulously.</p>
<p>   ""Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with<br />    the Jewish celebration of Passover. Jesus and his<br />    disciples were eating at the last supper and Jesus was<br />    later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one of<br />    his disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and<br />    he was stabbed in the side, made to wear a crown of<br />    thorns, and was hung on a cross with nails through his<br />    hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which<br />    was sealed off by a large boulder.""</p>
<p>   St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.</p>
<p>   Then the third blonde continues...""Every year the<br />    boulder is moved aside so that Jesus can come out and,<br />    if he sees his shadow, there will be six more weeks of<br />    winter!""</p>

<p>The other guy replied, ""This is a very special golf ball. I won't lose it so I<br /> don't need another one."" </p>
<p>""Well,"" the friend asked, ""what happens if you miss your shot and the ball<br /> goes in the lake?"" </p>
<p>""That's okay,"" he replied, ""this special golf ball floats. I'll be able to<br /> retrieve it."" </p>
<p>""Well what happens if you hit it into the trees and it gets lost among the<br /> bushes and shrubs? </p>
<p>""The other guy replied, ""That's okay too. You see, this special golf ball has<br /> a homing beacon. I'll be able to get it back -- no problem."" </p>
<p>Exasperated, the friend asks, ""Okay. Let's say our game goes late, the sun<br /> goes down, and you hit your ball into a sand trap. What are you going to do<br /> then?"" </p>
<p>""No problem,"" says the other guy, ""You see, this ball is fluorescent. I'll be<br /> able to see it in the dark."" </p>
<p>Finally satisfied that he needs only the one golf ball, the friend asks, ""Hey,<br /> where did you get a golf ball like that anyway?"" </p>

Hours later here came Tom with a pound of butter.The next week Tom went back into town this time he had a horsefly and again sat the man in the sombrero.""What you got there""?asked the man Tom replied ""I got me a horsefly,I'm going into town to get me a horse"". The man just looked at him and then said""You won't get no horse"". Sure enough a few hours later here comes Tom with a horse. The man in the sombrero was starring with bewildermentbut said nothing. Well a few weeks went by and Here came Tom again and the man in the sombrero asked,""What you got there""? And Tom said ""Got me a pussywillow going to go into town..."" And before Tom could finish the man in the sombrero replied ""hold on I'm coming with you"".</p>

37461,"<p>If Oracle made toasters... They'd claim their toaster was compatible with all<br /> brands and styles of bread, but when you got it home you'd discover the Bagel<br /> Engine was still in development, the Croissant Extension was three years away<br /> and that, indeed, the whole appliance was just blowing smoke.<br /> If Hewlett-Packard made toasters... They would market the Reverse Toaster,<br /> which takes in toast and gives you regular bread. </p>
<p>If IBM made toasters... They would want one big toaster where people bring<br /> bread to be submitted for overnight toasting. IBM would claim a worldwide market<br /> for five, maybe six toasters. </p>
<p>If Xerox made toasters... You could toast one-sided or double-sided.<br /> Successive slices would get lighter and lighter. The toaster would jam your<br /> bread for you. </p>
<p>If Radio Shack made toasters... The staff would sell you a toaster, but not<br /> know anything about it. Or you could buy all the parts to build your own<br /> toaster. </p>
<p>If Thinking Machines made toasters... You would be able to toast 64,000 pieces<br /> of bread at the same time. </p>
<p>If Cray made toasters... They would cost $16 million but would be faster than<br /> any other single-slice toaster in the world. </p>
<p>If the Rand Corporation made toasters... It would be a large, perfectly smooth<br /> and seamless black cube. Every morning there would be a piece of toast on top of<br /> it. Their service department would have an unlisted phone number and the<br /> blueprints for the box would be highly classified government documents. The<br /> X-Files would have an episode about it. </p>
<p>If the NSA made toasters... Your toaster would have a secret trap door that<br /> only the NSA could access in case they needed to get at your toast for reasons<br /> of national security. </p>
<p>If Sony made toasters... The ToastMan, which would be barely larger than the<br /> single piece of bread it is meant to toast, can be conveniently attached to your<br /> belt. </p>
<p>If Timex made toasters... They would be cheap and small quartz-crystal wrist<br /> toasters that take a licking and keep on toasting. </p>
<p>If Fisher Price made toasters... 'Baby's First Toaster' would have a<br /> hand-crank that you turn to toast the bread that pops up like a jack-in-the-box. </p>
<p>If Microsoft made toasters... Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you<br /> would have to buy a toaster. You wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'd<br /> still have to pay for it anyway. Toaster '02 would weigh 15,000 pounds<br /> (requiring a reinforced steel countertop), draw enough electricity to power a<br /> small city, take up 95% of the space in your kitchen, would claim to be the<br /> first toaster that lets you control how light or dark you want your toast to be,<br /> and would secretly interrogate your other appliances to find out who made them.<br /> Everyone would hate Microsoft toasters, but nonetheless would buy them since<br /> most of the good bread only works with their toasters. </p>
<p>If Apple made toasters... It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does,<br /> but five years earlier.</p>

<p>Paddy: I reckon he's an accountant. Shamus: No bleedin way, he's a stockbroker. Paddy: He ain't no bleedin stockbroker!  A stockbroker wouldn't be seen dead in here!</p>

<p>On entering the toilet he sees that the suit is standing at a urinal.  Curiosity and the several Guinness get the better of the Paddy ...</p>

<p>Suit: No offence taken!  I'm a Logical Scientist by profession! Paddy: Oh! What's dat den? Suit:  I'll try to explain by example ... Do you have a goldfish at home? Paddy: Er .. mmm ... well yeah, I do as it happens! Suit: Well, it's logical to follow that you keep it in a bowl or in a pond. Which is it? Paddy: It's in me pond! Suit: Well then, it's reasonable to suppose that you have a large garden then? Paddy: As it happens, yes I have got a huge big garden! Suit: Well then it's logical to assume that in this town, if you have a large garden then you have a large house? Paddy:  As it so happens, I've got a five bedroom house... built it myself, I did! Suit: Well, given that you've built a five bedroom house it is logical to assume that you haven't built it just for yourself and that you are quite probably married? Paddy: Yes I am married, I live with me wife and three fine kids. Suit: Well then it is logical to assume that you are sexually active with your wife on a regular basis? Paddy: Yep!  Regular as clockwork four nights a week! Suit: Well then it is logical to suggest that you do not masturbate very often? Paddy: Me? No never ever. Suit:  Well there you are! That's logical science at work! Paddy: How's dat den? Suit: Well from finding out that you have a goldfish, I've also found out all about your sex life! Paddy:  I see! That's pretty impressive ... thanks mate!</p>
<p>Both leave the toilet and Paddy returns to Shamus.</p>

37488,"<p>A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where he had been born and brought up. As he scurried away from the fencing of the compound, he felt grass under his little feet and saw the dawn breaking for the first time in his life. 'Wow, this is great,' he thought. It wasn't long before he came to a hedge and, after squeezing under it he saw a wonderful sight lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and nibbling at the lush grass.'Hey,' he called. 'I'm a rabbit from the laboratory and I've just escaped. Are you guys wild rabbits?''Yes we are.  We're so glad you escaped, welcome to freedom, please come and join us,' they cried.Our friend hopped over to them and after normal rabbit introductions, started eating the grass. It tasted so good. 'What else do you free rabbits do?' he asked.'Well,' one of them said. 'You see that field there? It's got carrots growing in it. We dig them up and eat them.'This, he couldn't resist and he spent the next hour eating the most succulent carrots. They were wonderful. Later, he asked them again, 'What else do free rabbits do?''You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it. We eat them as well.'The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned a while later completely full.  'Is there anything else free rabbits do?' he asked. One of the other rabbits came a bit closer to him and spoke softly.'There's one other thing you must try. You see those rabbits there,' he said, pointing to the far corner of the field. 'They're girls. We shag them. Go and try it.'Well, our friend spent the rest of the morning screwing his little heart out until, completely knackered, he staggered back over to the guys.'That was fantastic,' he panted.'So are you going to live with us then?' one of them asked.'I'm sorry, I had a great time but I can't.'The wild rabbits all stared at him, a bit surprised. 'Why? We thought you liked it here.''I do,' our friend replied. 'But I must get back to the laboratory. I'm dying for a cigarette.'</p>

Is there anything you can do to help me?"" The doctor says, ""Medically, no, but here's something you can try.

37574,"<p>One day Bill complained to his friend, ""My elbow really hurts, I<br /> guess I should see a doctor."" His friend offered, ""Don't do<br /> that.

<p>Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a<br /> urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer,<br /> he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer<br /> started making some noise and various lights started flashing.<br /> After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which<br /> was printed: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water.<br /> Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks.</p>
<p>Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology<br /> was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to<br /> wonder if this machine could be fooled.

To top it off,<br /> he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug<br /> store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited<br /> the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out<br /> the following message: Your tap water is too hard. Get a water<br /> softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is<br /> using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is<br /> pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And<br /> if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get<br /> better.</p>

37589,"<p>Rules for Buying Gifts for Men</p>
<p>Rule #1:<br /> When in doubt - buy him a cordless drill. It does not matter if he already has one. I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain. As a man, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #2:<br /> If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word<br /> ratchet or socket in it. Men love saying those two words. ""Hey George, can I borrow your ratchet?"" ""OK. By-the-way, are you through with my 3/8-inch socket yet?"" Again, no one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #3:<br /> If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car. A 99-cent ice scraper, a small bottle of de-icer or something to hang from his rear view mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #4:<br /> Do not buy men socks. Do not buy men ties. And never buy men bathrobes. I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, he wouldn't have invented Jockey shorts.</p>
<p>Rule #5:<br /> You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn out.If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the little picture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips, and flips.</p>
<p>Rule #6:<br /> Do not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. If you do, it will sit in a cupboard for 23 years.  Real men drink whiskey or beer.</p>
<p>Rule #7:<br /> Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after shave or deodorant. I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy.</p>
<p>Rule #8:<br /> Buy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a couple of weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. ""Socks.  Shorts. Cups. Saucers.  Door.  Lock.  Sink.""  You get the idea. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #9:<br /> Never buy a man anything that says ""some assembly required"" on the box. It will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.</p>
<p>Rule #10:<br /> Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, Parr Lumber, Home Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire. (NAPA Auto Parts and Sears' Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. It doesn't matter if he doesn't know what it is.  ""From NAPA Auto,eh? Must be something I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane? Wow! Thanks.""</p>
<p>Rule #11<br /> Men enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue. Get him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him the gas line leaks. ""Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?""</p>
<p>Rule #12:<br /> Tickets to a Patriots game are a smart gift. However, he will not appreciate tickets to ""A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts."" Everyone knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #13:<br /> Men love chainsaws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chainsaw. If you don't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets a label maker.</p>
<p>Rule #14:<br /> It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension ladder. Never buy a real man a step ladder. It must be an extension ladder. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #15:<br /> Rope. Men love rope. It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least The Boy Scouts. Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8"" manilla rope. No one knows why.</p>

37630,"<p>Why is there never a working ballpoint pen attached to those chains you see hanging around banks?Once imprisoned, the ballpoint pen soon loses the will to write. Even if released, it develops a deep-seated pattern of skipping and blotching that will soon send it back to the chain gang. Repeat offender ballpoint pens are sent to the post office, where they become federal pens. If not watched carefully, these pens will hang themselves from the writing desks. To prevent this, postal workers are particularly attentive, which is why they so often seem to be standing around staring at the pens. To avoid contributing to this destructive and unwholesome situation, I use a high-resolution dot-matrix printer when I write, and I recommend you do the same.</p>

37636,"<p>Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion<br /> for baked beans. He loved them, but they always had an<br /> embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him. One day he met<br /> a girl and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would<br /> marry, he thought to himself, she'll never go through with the<br /> marriage with me carrying on like this, so he made the supreme<br /> sacrifice and gave up beans.</p>
<p>Shortly after that they were married. A few months later, on his<br /> birthday and on the way home from work, his car broke down.<br /> Since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her<br /> that he would be late because he had to walk home. On his way<br /> home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked<br /> beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk<br /> he figured he could walk off any ill affects before he got home.<br /> It was, after all, his birthday. So he went in and ordered, and<br /> before leaving had 3 extra large helpings of baked beans. </p>
<p>All the way home he putt-putted. By the time he arrived home he<br /> felt reasonably safe. His wife met him at the door and seemed<br /> somewhat excited. She exclaimed, ""Darling, I have the most<br /> wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!"" She put a<br /> blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the<br /> table and made him promise not to peak. At this point he was<br /> beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as his wife was<br /> about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again<br /> made him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she<br /> went to answer the phone. While she was gone, he seized the<br /> opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was<br /> not only loud, but ripe as a rotten egg. He had a hard time<br /> breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about<br /> him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came<br /> on. He raised his leg and RRIIPPP !!! It sounded like a diesel<br /> engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he<br /> tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would<br /> dissipate. He got another urge. This was a real blue ribbon<br /> winner, the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled and a<br /> minute later the flowers on the table were dead.</p>
<p>With his blindfold still on, when he heard the phone farewells<br /> he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top<br /> of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when<br /> his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if<br /> he had peeked at the dinner table. After assuring her he had not<br /> peeked, she removed the blindfold and yelled, ""SURPRISE!!!""</p>
<p>To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated<br /> around the table for his surprise birthday party.</p>

The booth operator at first refused to let him have a turn, considering that his inebriated state would endanger the public. But the drunk insisted and was given a gun.He aimed unsteadily in the general direction of the target and after tying to focus, pulled the trigger three times. The booth owner, on inspecting the target, was astonished to see that he had scored three bullseyes. The star prize for the evening was a large set of glassware, but the showman was certain that the drunk wasn't aware of what he had done, and gave him instead a consolation prize, a turtle. The drunk wandered off into the crowd.An hour or so later he came back, even more drunk than before. Once again the showman demurred, but once again the drunk insisted, and once more scored three bullseyes and was given another turtle.Eventually the drunk rolled up again and insisted on a third attempt. Once more he picked up the rifle, waved it around in the general direction of the target, and pulled the trigger three times. Once more he had scored three bullseyes. But this time there was an onlooker with good eyesight.""That's fantastic"", the man said. ""Hasn't he scored three bulls?""The showman, cursing his luck, made a play of going over to the target and inspecting it closely.""Yes Sir!"" , he announced to the crowd. ""This is fantastic! Congratulations, sir, you have won the star prize, this magnificent 68-piece set of glassware""""I don't want any bloody glasses"", the drunk replied. ""Give me another one of those delicious crusty meat pies.""</p>

37662,"<p>The five toughest questions women ask - and their answers:1. `What are you thinking?' 2. `Do you love me?' 3. `Do I look fat?' 4. `Do you think she's prettier than me?' 5. `What would you do if I died?'What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example:1. `What are you thinking?'The proper answer to this question, of course, is: 'I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you.' Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things: a - football. b - baseball. c - How fat you are. d - How much prettier she is than you. e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died.The best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married with Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. His answer: 'If I wanted you to know I'd be talking instead of thinking'The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers:2. 'Do you love me?' The correct answer to this question is, 'Yes.' For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer. 'Yes dear.' Wrong answers include: a - I suppose so. b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes? c - That depends on what you mean by 'love'. d - Does it matter? e - Who, me?3. 'Do I look fat?' The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, 'No, of course not' and then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include: a - I wouldn't call you fat, but I wouldn't call you thin either. b - Compared to what? c - A little extra weight looks good on you. d - I've seen fatter. e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.4. 'Do you think she's prettier than me?' The 'she' in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passerby you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is: 'No, you are much prettier.' Wrong answers include: a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. b - I don't know how one goes about rating such things. c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality. d - Only in the sense that she's younger and thinner. e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy.5. 'What would you do if I died?' Correct answer: 'Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first truck that came my way.'This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke:'Dear,' said the wife, `what would you do if I died?' 'why, dear, I would be extremely upset,' said the husband. 'Why do you ask such a question?' 'Would you remarry?' persevered the wife. 'No, of course not, dear,' said the husband. 'Don't you like being married?' said the wife. 'Of course I do, dear,' he said. 'Then why wouldn't you remarry?' 'All right,' said the husband, 'I'd remarry.' 'You would?' said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. 'Yes,' said the husband. `Would you sleep with her in our bed?' said the wife after a long pause. 'Well yes, I suppose I would,' replied the husband. 'I see,' said the wife indignantly. 'And would you let her wear my old clothes?' 'I suppose, if she wanted to,' said the husband. 'Really,' said the wife icily. `And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?' 'Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do.' 'Is that so?' said the wife, leaping to her feet. 'And I suppose you'd let her play with my golf clubs, too.' 'Of course not, dear,' said the husband. 'She's left-handed.'</p>

37675,"<p>Roscoe and his friend went moose hunting every year without success.Finally, they came up with what they hoped was a foolproof plan. They acquired a very authentic moose costume and learned the mating call of a cow moose. The plan was to hide in the costume, lure the bull, then jump out of the costume and shoot the bull.Setting themselves upon the edge of a clearing in their costume, they began to give the moose ""call o'love"". Before too long their call was answered by a bull moose some distance away. They called again, and the bull answered from somewhere closer. Again they called, and again the bull answered. Soon he came crashing out of the forest and into the clearing.As the bull's pounding hoofbeats got closer, the friend in the front said, ""O.K.! Lets get out and shoot him!""After a moment that seemed like an eternity Roscoe who's in the rear half of the costume shouted, ""THE ZIPPER IS STUCK! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?""The friend in the front replied, ""Well, I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to start nibbling grass, but you better brace yourself.""</p>

<p>When George Dubya sits down, he notices 3 buttons on the side of Saddam's chair. They begin talking. After about 5 minutes, Saddam presses the first button.</p>
<p>A boxing glove springs out of a box on the desk and punches Bush in the face. Confused, Bush carries on talking as Saddam laughs.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the second button is pressed. This time a big boot comes out and kicks Bush in the shin. Again Saddam laughs, and again Bush carries on talking, not wanting to put off the bigger issue of peace between the 2 countries.</p>
<p>But when the third button is pressed and another boot comes out and kicks Bush in the privates, he's finally had enough, knowing that he can't do much without them functioning well. 'I'm going back home!' he tells the Iraqi. 'We'll finish these talks in two weeks!'</p>
<p>A fortnight passes and Saddam flies to the United States for talks.</p>
<p>As the 2 men sit down, Hussein notices 3 buttons on Bush's chair and prepares himself for the Yank's revenge.</p>
<p>They begin talking and George Dubya presses the first button. Saddam ducks, but nothing happens. Bush sniggers.</p>
<p>A few seconds later he presses the second button. Saddam jumps up, but again nothing happens. Bush roars with laughter. When the third button is pressed, Saddam jumps up again, and again nothing happens.</p>
<p>Bush falls on the floor in a fit of hysterics. 'F*ck this,' says Saddam. 'I'm going back to Baghdad!'</p>
<p>Bush then says through tears of laughter, 'WHAT Baghdad?' </p>

Suddenly the sky clouded above his<br /> head and in a booming voice the Lord said, ""Because you have had the faith to<br /> ask, I will grant you one wish.""<br /> The man said, ""Build a bridge to Hawaii, so I can drive over anytime I want<br /> to."" The Lord said, ""Your request is very materialistic. Think of the logistics<br /> of that kind of undertaking. The supports required to reach the bottom of the<br /> Pacific!<br /> The concrete and steel it would take! I can do it, but it is hard for<br /> me to justify your desire for worldly things. Take a little more time and think<br /> of another wish, a wish you think would honor and glorify me.""<br /> The man thought about it for a long time. Finally he said, ""Lord, I have been<br /> married and divorced four times. All of my wives said that I am uncaring and<br /> insensitive. I wish that I could understand women. I want to know how they feel<br /> inside, what they are thinking when they give me the silent treatment, why they<br /> cry, what they mean when they say ""nothing"" and how I can make a woman truly<br /> happy?<br /> After a few minutes God said, ""You want two lanes or four on that<br /> bridge?""</p>

37681,"<p>After watching sales falling off for three straight months at Kentucky Fried<br /> Chicken, the Colonel calls up the Pope and ask for a favor. </p>
<p>The Pope says, ''What can I do?'' </p>
<p>The Colonel says, ''I need you to change the daily prayer from, 'Give us this<br /> day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken'. If you do it, I'll<br /> donate 10 Million Dollars to the Vatican.'' </p>
<p>The Pope replies, ''I am sorry. That is the Lord's prayer and I can not change<br /> the words.'' </p>
<p>So the Colonel hangs up. After another month of dismal sales, the Colonel<br /> panics, and calls again. </p>
<p>''Listen your Excellency. I really need your help. I'll give you $50 million<br /> dollars if you change the words of the daily prayer from 'Give us this day our<br /> daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken.''' </p>
<p>And the Pope responds, ''It is very tempting, Colonel Sanders. The church<br /> could do a lot of good with that much money. It would help us support many<br /> charities. But, again, I must decline. It is the Lord's prayer, and I can't<br /> change the words.'' </p>
<p>So the Colonel gives up again. After two more months of terrible sales the<br /> Colonel gets desperate. ''This is my final offer, your Excellency. If you change<br /> the words of the daily prayer from, 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give<br /> us this day our daily chicken' I will donate $100 million to the Vatican.'' </p>
<p>The Pope replies, ''Let me get back to you.'' </p>
<p>So the next day, the Pope calls together all of his bishops and he says, ''I<br /> have some good news and I have some bad news. The good news is that KFC is going<br /> to donate $100 million to the Vatican.'' </p>
<p>The bishops rejoice at the news. Then one asks about the bad news. </p>
<p>The Pope replies, ''The bad news is that we lost the Wonder Bread account.''</p>

<p>The doctor's reply was, ""Well, father, this is a natural phenomenon for all men, and it will happen even to you from time to time"". </p>
<p>The Pope exclaimed ""But you must do something about this! I have mass in an hour, and this thing isn't going away!"" </p>
<p>The doctor replied ""You have two options ... either I can administer an injection to your penis to make the problem go away, which will hurt and make you feel ill, or you can just quietly go into the toilet over there and relieve yourself."" </p>
<p>Fearing the injection, the Pope elects the second option.

<p>Never slow to take an opportunity, the photographer replies, ""But this is how I make my living! If you take my camera, I'll lose the money I could have sold the photographs for!"" </p>

37796,"<p>There were three guys who were in a plane crash: an American, a<br /> Japanese guy, and a Filipino. Luckily, when the plane went down,<br /> they were the only three to make it out of the wreck and onto<br /> the raft. Continuing on their lucky streak, the ocean currents<br /> brought them to an island, which they later determined to be<br /> uninhabited by humans. Not only that, but it was beautiful! Mild<br /> climate, lush vegitation, plenty of small game for food, clean,<br /> freshwater streams and waterfalls, no real predatory creatures,<br /> plenty of beaches, you get the idea... It was a virtual paradise.</p>
<p>Well, three months later, as they were all taking a swim at one<br /> of the many beaches, the saw something floating in the water,<br /> and it turned out to be a lamp! As the story goes, you rub the<br /> lamp and out comes a genie. So this they did, and lo and behold!<br /> A genie! He said:</p>
<p>""I can only grant three wishes. Since there are three of you, I<br /> will grant one wish to each of you."" The three men were<br /> overjoyed at their good fortune. </p>
<p>The American said, ""Hmm, you know, I really like it here on this<br /> island. It's very serene and clean and all that, not like New<br /> York. But I do miss the night life back in the big apple,<br /> especially my girlfriend... I WISH I WAS BACK IN A NEW YORK IN A<br /> BAR WITH A COLD BEER IN ONE HAND AND MY GIRL IN THE OTHER!!!!!""<br /> And the genie granted him his wish, and the American dissapeared<br /> in a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>The Japanese guy said, ""Hmm! Good island! Very nice! Me like,<br /> but no family! Miss family! Must go back and be with family! I<br /> wish to be in Tokyo with family!"" And so the genie granted his<br /> wish, and the Japanese guy dissapeared in a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>The Filipino guy said, ""Well, I guess I'd go home, but then<br /> again I have no family, I've been gone for three months which<br /> means that I probably lost my job, and well, Manila is so<br /> crowded and polluted and messed up. Maybe I'll just stay here.<br /> After all, it is nice here... Nut then i'd get lonely being here<br /> by myself... Geee, I wish those two guys were back...""</p>

<p>The guy pushes his empty beer glass over to the edge of the counter, walks to<br /> the other end of the bar, and says to the Bartender, ""If I could spit from here,<br /> and get it in the glass without getting any anywhere else, would you give me<br /> $50?"" </p>
<p>The bartender, not seeing how this bet could be cheated, says, ""Ok, show me""</p>
<p>The guy then spits, and makes it in the glass, without getting any on the<br /> counter or the floor. </p>
<p>The bartender says, ""That's amazing! You deserve the $50!""</p>

<p>The blonde said ""How about 50 dollars?"" The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage. The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, ""Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?"" </p>
<p>The man replied, ""She should. She was standing on the porch."" </p>

37807,"<p>A young guy out on the town with his mates spies the girl of his<br /> dreams across the dance floor. Having admired her from afar he<br /> finally gets up the courage to talk to her. Everything goes<br /> better than expected and she agrees to accompany him on a date<br /> the following Saturday evening. Saturday night the man arrives<br /> at her house with flowers and candy.</p>
<p>To his surprise, she answers the door in nothing but a towel.<br /> ""I'm sorry,"" she exclaims, ""I am running a bit late. Please come<br /> in and I'll introduce you to my parents who will entertain you<br /> while I finish getting dressed. I should warn you, though, they<br /> are both deaf mutes."" </p>
<p>With this she ushers him into the living room, introduces him to<br /> her parents and promptly disappears. As you can imagine, this is<br /> a little uncomfortable as both of the parents are completely<br /> silent. Dad is sitting in his arm chair watching golf on TV, and<br /> mom is busy knitting.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of complete silence, mom jumps from her<br /> chair, pulls up her skirt, pulls down her knickers, and pours a<br /> glass of water over her fanny. Just as suddenly, dad launches<br /> himself across the room, bends her over the couch, and takes her<br /> from behind. He then sits back down in his chair and balances a<br /> match stick in front of his eye. The room is plunged back into<br /> eerie silence and the young man is shocked into disbelief. </p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the daughter returns fully dressed and ready<br /> for the evening. The date is a complete disaster with the young<br /> man completely distracted by the ongoings earlier in the living<br /> room.</p>
<p>At the end of the night, the girl asks, ""What's the matter? Have<br /> I done something wrong?"" ""No, it's not you,"" he replied, ""It's<br /> just that the strangest thing happened while I was waiting for<br /> you and I am still a bit shocked. First your mother jumps from<br /> her chair, lifts up her skirt, pulls down her panties, and<br /> throws a glass of water over her behind. Then, as if that<br /> weren't enough, your father races from his chair, leans her over<br /> the couch and does her from behind. He then sits back down and<br /> places a match stick by his eye.""</p>
<p>""Oh, is that all?"" replies the girl. </p>
<p>The man can't believe her casual response.</p>
<p>""That's how they communicate! Mom was simply saying, 'Are you<br /> going to get this asshole a drink?' and dad replied, 'No, fuck<br /> him. I'm watching the match.'""</p>

<p>God continues: </p>
<p>""This person will cook for you and wash your clothes. She will always agree with every decision you make. She will bear your children and never ask you to get up in the middle of the night to take care of them. She will not nag you, and will always be the first to admit she was wrong when you've had a disagreement. She will never have a headache, and will freely give you love and compassion whenever needed. </p>
<p>Adam asked God, "" What would a woman like this cost me??"" </p>

37815,"<p>As soon as she had finished parochial school, a bright young girl named Lena<br /> shook the dust of Ireland off her shoes and made her way to New York where<br /> before long, she became a successful performer in show business.</p>
<p>  Eventually she returned to her home town for a visit and on a Saturday night<br /> went to confession in the church which she had always attended as a child. In<br /> the confessional Father Sullivan recognized her and began asking her about her<br /> work. She explained that she was an acrobatic dancer, and he wanted to know<br /> what that meant. She said she would be happy to show him the kind of thing she<br /> did on stage.</p>
<p>  She stepped out of the confessional and within sight of Father Sullivan, she<br /> went into a series of cartwheels, leaping splits, handsprings and backflips.</p>
<p>  Kneeling near the confessional, waiting their turn, were two middle-aged<br /> ladies. They witnessed Lena's acrobatics with wide eyes, and one said to the<br /> other: ""Will you just look at the penance Father Sullivan is givin' out this<br /> night, and me without me bloomers on!""</p>

37822,"<p>The following is an actual excerpt from Forbes magazine:</p>
<p>A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole is maintained or even improved by the regular culling of the weakest members.</p>
<p>In much the same way, the human brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells through which the electrical signals pass. </p>
<p>Recent epidemiological studies have shown that while excessive intake of alcohol kills off brain cells, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. Thus, regular consumption of beer helps eliminate the weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.</p>
<p>The result of this in-depth study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend parties and job-related performance. It also explains why, after a few short years of leaving university and getting married, most professionals cannot keep up with the performance of the new graduates.</p>
<p>Only those few that stick to the strict regimen of voracious alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that they achieved during their university years.</p>
<p>So, this is a call to arms. As our country is losing its technological edge we should not shudder in our homes. Get back into the bars. Quaff that pint. Your company and country need you to be at your peak, and you shouldn't deny yourself the career that you could have. Take life by the bottle and be all that you can be.</p>

37832,"<p>Dearn Ann:</p>
<p>I am facing a very serious problem. You see, I am a Vietnam-era deserter from the U. S. Marines, and I have a cousin who works for Microsoft. My mother peddles Nazi literature to Girl Scouts and my father (a former dentist) is in jail for 30 years for raping most of his patients while they were under anesthesia.</p>
<p>The sole supports of our large family, including myself and my $500-a-week heroin habit, are my uncle (master pick-pocket, Benny ""The Fingers""), my 70-year-old aunt Hester (a shoplifter), and my two kid sisters, who are well-known streetwalkers.</p>
<p>My problem is this:  I have just gotten engaged to the most beautiful, sweetest girl in the world.  She is just sweet sixteen, and we are going to marry as soon as she can escape from reform school.</p>
<p>To support ourselves, we are going to move to Mexico and start a fake Aztec souvenir factory staffed by child labor. We look forward to bringing our kids into the family business.</p>
<p>But I am worried that my family will not make a good impression on hers. In your opinion, Should I, or shouldn't I, tell her about my cousin who works for Microsoft?</p>

37835,"<p>Dr. Schlambaugh, a senior lecturer at the Chemical Engineering<br /> Department,University of Oklahoma, is known for posing questions on<br /> final exams like: ''Why do airplanes fly?'' </p>
<p>In May a few years ago, the ''Momentum, Heat and Mass Transfer '' exam<br /> paper contained the question: </p>
<p>''Is Hell exothermic or endothermic? Support your answer with proof.'' </p>
<p>Most students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or<br /> similar. One student, however, wrote the following: </p>
<p>First, we must postulate that if souls exist, they must have some mass.<br /> If they do, then a mole of souls also must have a mass. So, at what rate<br /> are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think<br /> we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it does not leave.<br /> Therefore, no souls are leaving. </p>
<p>As for souls entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that<br /> exist in the world today. Some religions say that if you are not a<br /> member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than<br /> one of these religions, and people do not belong to more than one<br /> religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With<br /> the birth and death rates what they are, we can expect the number of<br /> souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of<br /> change in the volume of Hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the<br /> temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass<br /> of the souls and volume needs to stay constant. </p>
<p>[Answer 1] So, if Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at<br /> which souls enter Hell, then the temperature in Hell will increase until<br /> all Hell breaks loose. </p>
<p>[Answer 2] Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the<br /> increase in souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop<br /> until Hell freezes over. </p>
<p>So which is it? If we accept the postulate (given to me by Teresa Banyan<br /> during freshman year) that ''it'll be a cold day in Hell before I sleep<br /> with you'', and taking into account that I still have not succeeded in<br /> having sexual relations with her, then [Answer 2] cannot be correct;<br /> ...... thus, Hell is exothermic. </p>
<p>The student got the only A.</p>

37863,"<p>An elderly gentleman came home one night to find a homeless girl of about seventeen ransacking the place. He grabbed her by the arm and was just about to call the police when the girl dropped down on her knees and pleaded, ""Please don't call the police, mister, oh please!! If you don't, I'll let you make love to me and do whatever you want with my body!""</p>
<p>The old man thought for a moment and decided to give in. Soon they were naked and in bed together. The old man tried hard and tried hard, but finally, he rolls over, exhausted, and embarrassed.</p>
<p>""I'm sorry, young lady...but it's no use,"" he gasped. ""I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the police after all.""</p>
"
37864,"<p>Terminology: </p>
<p>Shotgun - The rightmost front passenger seat in a vehicle, a prime choice for any passenger, since it is the most comfortable seat, and also because of the psychological advantage of not being forced to subserviently look at the back of another person's head during a trip. </p>
<p>Enthronement - The physical presence of a person in the Shotgun position. </p>
<p>By Laws: </p>
<p>Vehicle Ownership<br /> -----------------</p>
<p>The owner of a vehicle, if he/she isn't driving, always gets Shotgun in that vehicle. It is their car, it is their seat and they get it. This is a real bonus for an owner who is falling down drunk. They can rest assured Shotgun is rightfully theirs. They won't have to worry about concentrating through an alcohol-induced haze simply to remember to call Shotgun in their own hard-earned car. Once proper Shotgun ""enthronement"" rights have been established, they may also be surrendered. If the owner of the vehicle is eligible for Shotgun, but wants to sleep it off in the back seat, then they may give up Shotgun to a person of their choice. The vehicle owner is also the ultimate judge in any Shotgun disputes. Their word is law, and all passengers must defer to the owner's interpretation of Shotgun law. Arbitration should be swift and final, so that everyone can be on their way. If the owner is going to stray from the Shotgun Constitution, they must have a good reason for doing so. If the owner is not eligible for Shotgun, any passenger can call Shotgun, but only under the proper conditions. </p>
<p>Legal Conditions for Calling Shotgun<br /> ------------------------------------</p>
<p>Shotgun can only be called when the driver is enroute to the vehicle for the purpose of driving immediately, and the Shotgun position is vacant. Shotgun cannot be called upon arrival, only upon departure. For example, a group of travelers may arrive at a restaurant and get out of the car for a meal. Some bone-head might try calling Shotgun immediately for the subsequent ride home, but that is not appropriate. If this kind of precedent were allowed, it would let anyone call Shotgun ""futures"" for potential rides into eternity. Only after finishing the meal, when the driver picks up the car keys, is a Shotgun call allowed. Jingling keys is a very strong sign of an Enroute condition. If the driver says ""lets go"" that also can be reasonably construed as Enroute. Most Enroute conditions mean that driving will take place within a few minutes, but not always. If the driver of a car turns around on a three hour trail ride, and says ""lets go home,"" then an enroute condition exists and Shotgun may be called immediately. </p>
<p>Forcible Dethronement (a.k.a. Physical Challenge)<br /> -------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>There are some people in this world that always remember to call Shotgun. Although this is an admirable trait at first, it quickly grows old. These people tend to be real weenies, and if they knew better, would sometimes let someone else call shotgun just to be a little more diplomatic. The purpose of the Shotgun Constitution is to provide for a peaceful, fair method of getting to ride Shotgun. Unfortunately, if an introverted nerd consistently calls Shotgun ad nauseum, there must be accommodations for that person to be forcibly removed from the seat. Thus the Forcible Dethronement policy. This allows one other passenger (usually larger in stature) to declare ""Physical Challenge!"" and pull, push or otherwise eject the previous Shotgun participant from the seat. Although frowned upon if used regularly, this physical challenge is a legitimate means of wresting Shotgun control away from the legal party. Any physical tactics short of grievous bodily injury are employable. </p>
<p>The Dick Clause<br /> ---------------</p>
<p>Though not a formal by-law of the Constitution, the Dick Clause is a necessary refinement in semantics. Just because the driver's girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, whoever happens to be in the car, that Significant Other does not get Shotgun by default. Anyone else can legally call Shotgun and force the Significant Other to ride in the back. But then of course that would mean that person is a Dick. </p>
<p>Post-amble<br /> ----------</p>
<p>I first drafted the Shotgun Constitution in 1990 while attending Embry-Riddle University in Florida. The Constitution was widely distributed via fax, and steered many young passengers towards a more democratic form of ridership. It is time to resurrect this living document, and to let a new generation of passengers rightfully call SHOTGUN. </p>
<p>If there is any new case law I should be aware of for the Shotgun Constitution, please e-mail me at: andy@hedges.net. I will conduct a judicial review of your case and see whether it merits an amendment to the Constitution.</p>

37865,"<p>In a tiny village lived an old maid. In spite of her old age, she was still a virgin. She was very proud of it. She knew her last days were getting closer, so she told the local undertaker that she wanted the following inscription on her tombstone:</p>
<p>""Born as a virgin, lived as a virgin, died as a virgin""</p>
<p>Not long after, the old maid died peacefully, and the undertaker told his men what the lady had said. The men went to carve it in, but as the lazy no-goods they were, they thought the inscription to be unnecessarily long. They simply wrote:</p>
<p>""Returned unopened""</p>

37921,"<p>Three hunters decided if they got separated or lost, they would use the<br /> yodeling cry ""oh-lady-hoo"" to help locate each other. One hunter got lost and<br /> yelled ""oh-lady-hoo"" until he was hoarse but to no avail.<br /> When it began to get dark, he gave up trying to find his friends, saw light at<br /> a nearby farmhouse, knocked on the front door and asked the farmer if he could<br /> stay the night.<br /> ""No problem,"" he said, ""I've got a spare room you're welcome to use.""<br /> Toward morning, the hunter was awakened by the farmer's young daughter as she<br /> slipped into his bed. In no time at all they were going at it hot and heavy and<br /> in a few minutes she had an orgasm. Her cries of ecstasy soon brought an angry<br /> father into the bedroom.<br /> He had a loaded shotgun and said to the hunter, ""You better get dressed real<br /> fast 'cause you and me are going down to the barnyard to see if you can haul ass<br /> fast enough to outrun a load of buckshot!""<br /> As soon as they reached the barnyard, the frightened hunter took off like a<br /> scalded cat, jumped high in the air to clear the barnyard fence, thought of his<br /> missing friends, yelled ""oh-lady-hoo"" and instantly received a full load of<br /> buckshot in his rear end.<br /> As he lay on the ground bleeding profusely, the farmer walked up and said, ""I<br /> know my daughter pretty well and had my mind halfway made up not to shoot. But,<br /> when you yelled, 'I got the old lady too,' that changed my mind real quick.""</p>

37922,"<p>Young Tommy had always wanted to taste the flesh of Amy. He had<br /> always dreamed of penetrating his dick into the fresh kitty-cat<br /> that he imagined Amy had. His friends knew of his urge, so they<br /> plotted out a plan for him. Joe, one of Tommy's closest friend<br /> (and ideally the richest) came up with a brilliant plan that<br /> made arrangements to have all the families in the neighbourhood<br /> meet and spend a night at their hotel during Christmas; Gladly,<br /> all the families accepted to come.</p>
<p>The boys planned that Tommy would sneak into the room Amy was to<br /> be, and lay her. The important thing was that everybody was to<br /> be made very drunk, so a lot of beer and alcoholic drinks were<br /> to be availed. They believed that at such a drunken state Tommy<br /> would screw Amy without her noticing a thing of what happened<br /> when she got up the next day.</p>
<p>So, on the night of Christmas, all went as planned. Everybody<br /> drank, everyone got drunk and then one by one left for their<br /> rooms, until there was only Tommy in the room. The time had come<br /> for Tommy to perform it. So, he quickly rushed up the stairs,<br /> looked around to check whether anybody was around, opened the<br /> door, sneaked into the room and in no time he was under the<br /> blanket; by the side of Amy. This was the opportunity he had<br /> always dreamed of, so without wasting anymore time, Tommy slid<br /> under the sheets towards Amy's pussy, pulled her pants down and<br /> licked her pussy vigorously. She enjoyed every moment that she<br /> even led Tommy into dipping his joystick into the very flesh he<br /> had always dreamed of. It was as tight and as sweet as he had<br /> always imagined.</p>
<p>He left the room afterwards, happy and rushing to meet the<br /> others to tell them about his success. He rushed down the<br /> stairs, into the ballroom and thought of passing through the<br /> kitchen to have a glass of water. As he entered the kitchen,<br /> Tommy saw what he couldn't believe; Amy was in the kitchen with<br /> a glass of milk in her hand. He quickly asked anxiously, ""Amy! I<br /> thought you're already asleep?"" Amy smiled back and answered,<br /> ""Not yet Tommy, I had to get my grandma Stella a glass of milk<br /> first. She'll be sleeping in my room tonight.""</p>

37928,"<p>Jake is struggling through a bus station with two huge and obviously heavy suitcases when a stranger walks up to him and asks ""Have you got the time?""<br /> Jake sighs, puts down the suitcases and glances at his wrist. ""It's a quarter to six,"" he says. </p>
<p>""Hey, that's a pretty fancy watch!"" exclaims the stranger. Jake brightens a little. </p>
<p>""Yeah, it's not bad. Check this out"" - and he shows him a time zone display not just for every time zone in the world, but for the 86 largest metropolises. </p>
<p>He hits a few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says ""The time is eleven 'til six"" in a very West Texas accent. A few more buttons and the same voice says something in Japanese. Jake continues ""I've put in regional accents for each city"". The display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply astounding. </p>
<p>The stranger is struck dumb with admiration. ""That's not all"", says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and a tiny but very high-resolution map of New York City appears on the display. ""The flashing dot shows our location by satellite positioning,"" explains Jake. </p>
<p>""View recede ten"", Jake says, and the display changes to show eastern New York state. </p>
<p>""I want to buy this watch!"" says the stranger. </p>
<p>""Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet; I'm still working out the bugs"", says the inventor. </p>
<p>""But look at this"", and he proceeds to demonstrate that the watch is also a very creditable little FM radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper printout and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice recordings of up to 300 standard-size books, ""though I only have 32 of my favorites in there so far"" says Jake. </p>
<p>""I've got to have this watch!"", says the stranger. </p>
<p>""No, you don't understand; it's not ready -"" </p>
<p>""I'll give you $1000 for it!"" </p>
<p>""Oh, no, I've already spent more than -"" </p>
<p>""I'll give you $5000 for it!"" </p>
<p>""But it's just not -"" </p>
<p>""I'll give you $15,000 for it!"" And the stranger pulls out a checkbook. </p>
<p>Jake stops to think. He's only put about $8500 into materials and development, and with $15,000 he can make another one and have it ready for merchandising in only six months. The stranger frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of him. ""Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000. Take it or leave it."" </p>
<p>Jake abruptly makes his decision. ""OK"", he says, and peels off the watch. </p>
<p>They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily away. </p>
<p>""Hey, wait a minute"", calls Jake after the stranger, who turns around warily. Jake points to the two suitcases he'd been trying to wrestle through the bus station. ""Don't forget your batteries.""</p>

Then the preacher says even more loudly, ""And he who would like to find a place in hell please STAND UP!"" The weary man catching only the last part groggily stands up, only to find that he's the only one standing.

37956,"<p>George and Harry set out in a trans-Atlantic hot air balloon race. After 37<br /> hours in the air and appearing lost, George offers, ""We had better lose some<br /> altitude Harry so we can see exactly where we are."" Hesitantly, Harry lets some<br /> hot air out of the balloon, and it begins to slowly descend below the cloud<br /> cover. Still confused as to their exact location George again offers, ""I still<br /> can't tell where we are Harry, let's ask that gentleman down there on the<br /> ground."" Harry yells down to the stranger, ""Hey, Mister can you tell us where we<br /> are?"" ""You're in a balloon about 100 feet up in the air,"" came the reply. ""That<br /> man must be a lawyer,"" George quipped. ""How can you tell?"" said Harry. ""Because<br /> the advice he just gave us is 100% accurate and totally useless!""</p>

37957,"<p>President George W. Bush was representing the United States of<br /> America on a highly formal, orchestrated state visit to England.<br /> The President joined Queen Elizabeth II in a beautiful, ornate<br /> 17th-century coach hitched to 6 enormous matched white horses.<br /> The coach proceeded through the streets of London en route to<br /> Buckingham Palace, and the Queen and the President were waving<br /> to the cheering throngs.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the right rear horse produced a thunderous fart<br /> that reverberated through the air and rattled the doors of the<br /> coach, sending a horse-shit stench blowing through the coach.<br /> Uncomfortable, the two powerful figures try to focus their<br /> attentions elsewhere and behave as if nothing extraordinary had<br /> happened.</p>
<p>But the Queen realized that ignoring what had just happened<br /> would be ridiculous. She explained: ""Mr. President, please<br /> accept my regrets - I'm sure you understand that there are some<br /> things that even a Queen cannot control.""</p>
<p>George W. replied, ""No need to be ashamed, your majesty... it's<br /> just gas. But I gotta admit, until you confessed, I thought it<br /> was one of the horses!""</p>

37959,"<p>A young farmer couple got married, and they just couldn't seem to get enough<br /> lovin'. Just before leaving the house for the fields at dawn, they made love,<br /> and when the husband returned home at evening they had another go - both before<br /> and after supper, and then again a few more times during the night.<br /> The problems only happened during the day. The fields were far away from the<br /> house and the young man lost half an hour each time traveling home and back<br /> again at noon. Finally he decided to consult a friend, the town's doctor, about<br /> what to do. </p>
<p>""Easiest thing in the world, Homer"" said the doctor. ""You take your rifle out<br /> with you every day don't you? Well, when you feel like you're in the mood for<br /> some lovin', just fire a shot into the air as a signal to your wife, for her to<br /> come out to you. That way you won't lose any working' time."" </p>
<p>Homer tried his friend's solution and it seemed to work pretty well for a<br /> while. One day though, the doctor stopped by the house to pay a visit and he<br /> noticed Homer sitting alone inside looking very somber. </p>
<p>""What's wrong?"" he asked. ""Didn't my idea work? Where's your wife?"" </p>
<p>""Oh, it worked,� says Homer. ""Whenever I got in the mood I fired off a shot<br /> like you said, and Beckie'd comes running'. Then we'd find a secluded place and<br /> make love. Then Beckie'd go back home."" </p>
<p>""So what's the problem?"" </p>
<p>""Well I think I overdid it, Doc. I ain't seen hide nor hair of Beckie since<br /> hunting season got started...""</p>
"
37960,"<p>Some DEEP THOUGHTS to start off your week with:</p>
<p>. How much deeper would oceans be if sponges didn't live there?</p>
<p>. If it's true that we are here to help others, then what exactly are the<br />   OTHERS here for?</p>
<p>. STRESSED spelled backwards is DESSERTS.</p>
<p>. You never really learn to swear until you learn to drive.</p>
<p>. Clones are people two.</p>
<p>. If a man says something in the woods and there are no women there, is he<br />   still wrong?</p>
<p>. No one ever says ""It's only a game,"" when their team is winning.</p>
<p>. If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague.</p>
<p>. Ever wonder what the speed of lightning would be if it didn't zigzag?</p>
<p>. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.</p>
<p>. Think ""honk"" if you're telepathic.</p>
<p>. Last night I played a blank tape at full blast. The mime next door went<br />   nuts.</p>
<p>. I went to a store which said open 24 hours and he was closing. When I<br />   asked why he said, ""We're open 24 hours, but not in a row.""</p>
<p>. Why don't they just make mouse-flavored cat food?</p>
<p>. I just got skylights put in my place. The people who live above me are<br />   furious.</p>
<p>. Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?</p>
<p>. If it's tourist season, why can't we shoot them?</p>
<p>. Disney World is a people trap operated by a mouse?</p>
<p>. Since light travels faster than sound, isn't that why some people appear<br />   bright until you hear them speak?</p>
<p>. If it's zero degrees outside today and it's supposed to be twice as cold<br />   tomorrow, how cold is it going to be?</p>
<p>. Why do you press harder on a remote-control when you know the battery is<br />   dead?</p>

<p>The hunter pulled out his wallet and calmly showed the warden a Washington<br /> state hunting license. The warden took a second duck, inserted his finger in the<br /> bird's rectum, pulled it out, sniffed it, and said, ""This here's an Idaho duck.<br /> Do you have an Idaho state hunting license?""</p>
<p>The hunter, a bit put out, produced an Idaho state hunting license. The warden<br /> took a third duck, conducted the same finger test, and said, ""This here's an<br /> Oregon state duck. Do you have an Oregon state hunting license?""</p>
<p>Once again, only this time more aggravated, the hunter produced the<br /> appropriate license. The warden, a little miffed at having struck out, handed<br /> the ducks back to the hunter and said, ""You've got all of these licenses, just<br /> where the hell are you from?""</p>
