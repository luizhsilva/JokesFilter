It<br /> is getting dark and they are still far away from the convent.<br /> SL: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past half-hour? </p>
<p>SM: Yes, I wonder what he wants.<br /> SL: It's logical. He wants to have his way with us.<br /> SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most. What can<br /> we do?<br /> SL: The only logical thing to do of course is that we have to start walking<br /> faster.<br /> SM: It is not working.<br /> SL: Of course it is not working. The man did the only obvious thing to do. He<br /> started to walk faster too.<br /> SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute.<br /> SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and I'll go<br /> this way. He cannot follow both of us.<br /> So the man decided to go after Sister Logical.<br /> Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried because Sister<br /> Logical has not yet arrived. Finally, Sister Logical arrives.<br /> SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell us what happened!<br /> SL: The only logical thing happened. The man could not follow both of us, so<br /> he followed me.<br /> SM: So, what happened? Please tell us.<br /> SL: The only logical thing to happen. I started to run as fast as I could.<br /> SM: So what happened?<br /> SL: The only logical thing to happen. The man also started to run as fast as<br /> he could.<br /> SM: And what else?<br /> SL: The only logical thing to happen. He reached me.<br /> SM: Oh, no! What did you do then?<br /> SL: The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up.<br /> SM: Oh, Sister. What did the man do?<br /> SL: The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants.<br /> SM: Oh, no! What happened then?<br /> SL: Isn't it logical, Sister? A nun with her dress up can run faster than a<br /> man.</p>

34043,"<p>A man goes into a pet shop to buy a parrot. The shop owner<br /> points to three identical birds and says, ""The parrot to your<br /> left costs $500."" The man asks, ""Why does the parrot costs so<br /> much?"" The owner says, ""Well, it knows how to use a computer. He<br /> can diagnose system bugs.""</p>
<p>The customer asks about the next parrot and is told, ""That one<br /> costs $1000 because it can do everything the other parrot can do<br /> plus it knows how to configure and use UNIX.""</p>
<p>Naturally, the increasingly startled man asks about the third<br /> parrot and is told, ""That one costs $2000."" Needless to say,<br /> this begs the question, ""What can IT do?"" The owner shrugs and<br /> replies, ""To be honest I've never seen it do a thing, but the<br /> other two call him Boss!""</p>

34051,"<p>A young blonde was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana. She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking.After becoming very frustrated with the ""no haggle"" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, ""Maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!"" The shopkeeper said, ""By all means, be my guest. Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!"" Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.Later in the day, the shopkeeper is driving home, when he spots the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he sees a huge 9 foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She takes aim, kills the creature and with a great deal of effort hauls it on to the swamp bank. Lying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watches in amazement. Just then the blonde flips the alligator on its back, and frustrated, shouts out, ""Damn it, this one isn't wearing any shoes either!""</p>

"
34084,"<p>Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed on how to use it shortly. Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean Southerners can. Stay home the two days of the year it snows. If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four-wheel pick-up with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is what they live for. You can ask Southerners for directions, but unless you already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find it yourself. Remember: Y'all is singular. All y'all is plural. All y'all's is plural possessive. Get used to hearing, ""You ain't from around here, are you?""Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't understand you, either. The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective ""big ol"", as in ""big ol truck"", or ""big ol boy"".""Fixin'"", as in ""I'm fixin' to go to the store"", is 2nd. And ""Y'all"" is 3rd. As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph zone directly in the middle of the road, remember: ALL Southern folks learned to drive on a John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that vehicle. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"", stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say, or worse still, that you will ever hear. Most Southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a Southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was already turned on when the car was purchased. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone eating. The wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until December. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store. It is just something you're supposed to do. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase one, it is positioned directly in front of the house. This is logical, bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the house and should, therefore, be prominently displayed.</p>
"
34085,"<p>1. Take your own sweet time when doing ANYTHING. </p>
<p>2. Pronounce all one-syllable words with two. </p>
<p>3. When giving directions, finish with ""and it's right down yonder on the left."" Confuses the mess out of 'em. </p>

<p>5. When they talk nostalgically about the North, tell 'em ""Delta's ready when you are!"" </p>

<p>16. When invited to dinner, offer to bring dessert. Show up with a box of Moon Pies. . .preferably the banana ones. </p>
<p>17. Name all of your children ""Bubba"". (or just call em that!) </p>
<p>18. Use the word ""reckon"" in a sentence and watch their reaction. </p>
<p>19. ""Mash"" buttons. ""Cut"" off lights. ""Carry"" the kids to school. </p>
<p>20. Never simply ""do"" something. Be ""fixin to do"" something. </p>
<p>21. Tell them you don't have an accent, they do. </p>
<p>22. Be sure to include ""yes/no ma'am/sir"" in all conversations...Offends the heck out of 'em. </p>
<p>23. Only use landmarks and ramble on when giving directions. ""Now go down Jeff Davis Highway and turn left at where the Chevron station used to be. I think they turned it into a Amoco. Or maybe a BP. Anyway, turn right there..."" ""You said left."" ""Did I? Well, turn left there and follow it until you see a big fish on your left. I remember when that fish used to be on the other side of town.."" </p>
<p>24. Ask them if it's still snowing up North. Then tell 'em you went driving around in your convertible this weekend. </p>
<p>25. Call 'em a yankee. Works every time.</p>

"
34100,"<p>To: All Employees<br /> From: Management<br /> Re: Restroom Policy</p>
<p>In the past, employees were permitted to make trips to the<br /> restroom under informal guidelines. Effective Feb. 25, 1995 a<br /> Restroom Policy will be established to provide a consistent<br /> method of accounting for each employee's restroom time and<br /> ensuring equal treatment of all employees. </p>
<p>Under this policy, a ""Restroom Trip Bank"" will be established<br /> for each employee. The first day of each month, employees will<br /> be given a Restroom Trip Credit of 20 points. RTC can be<br /> accumulated from month to month. </p>
<p>Shortly, the entrances to all the restrooms will begin being<br /> equipped with personnel identification stations and computer<br /> linked voice print recognition. During the next two (2) weeks,<br /> each employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one<br /> normal and one under stress) management by Feb. 10, 1995. The<br /> voice print recognition stations will be operational, but not<br /> restrictive, for the month of Feb. Employees should acquaint<br /> themselves with the stations during this period. It will be<br /> restrictive starting March 1, 1995. </p>
<p>If an employee's RTB balances at zero (0), the doors to all<br /> restrooms will not unlock for that employee's voice print until<br /> the first of the month. </p>
<p>In addition, all the restrooms are being equipped with a time<br /> paper roll retractor. If the restroom is occupied for more than<br /> three (3) minutes, an alarm will sound throughout the entire<br /> building. A computer simulated voice will be activated and<br /> announce over the public announcing system the name of the<br /> delinquent employee. Ten (10) seconds later, the roll of paper<br /> will retract, the toilet will flush and the restroom door will<br /> automatically open. If at that time, the employee still remains<br /> seated inside the stall, the restroom cameras (which will be<br /> linked to the payroll and security console) will turn on. </p>
<p>Your cooperation on this matter will be appreciated. If you have<br /> any questions about the new policy, please feel free to ask you<br /> supervisor. </p>
<p>Thank You!<br /> Management</p>

34202,"<p>The other day I was eating in an Italian restaurant when I accidentally spilled some spaghetti sauce on my favorite white sweater.I wasn't too distressed, though, because Mr. Wong down on High Street has been doing my laundry for years, and I knew that he could remove just about any stain and get it out like it'd never been there.So I took the sweater down to Wong's Laundry and dropped it off; Mr. Wong said he'd probably be able to have it cleaned by Thursday. So on Thursday afternoon after work I stopped by Wong's again.Mr. Wong looked quite distressed when he saw me. He brought out the sweater and, apologizing profusely, explained that somehow this stain was beyond even his power to expunge.And sure enough, though fainter than before, there was still a distinct red stain on the sweater. In an attempt to make up for his failure, Mr. Wong offered to send the sweater to his brother across town, who had been in the laundry business for an even longer time, and who might have a clue as to the method of removal of this extraordinarily persistent stain.The elder Wong brother would rush it through at no extra charge, and should have it looking as white and clean as new by Friday. So on Friday I went back to Wong's to pick up my sweater, but when I arrived, Mr. Wong regretfully informed me that his brother, too, had failed to remove the red blotch. ""No charge,"" said Wong, ""but you must take sweater elsewhere to clean.The Moral: ... Two Wongs cannot make a white.""</p>

<p>PETE WILSON HARRY WALBRATH<br /> GOVERNOR DIRECTOR</p>
<p>BULLETIN NUMBER 95-2374<br /> DATE: OCTOBER 20, 1995</p>
<p>TO: ALL CALIFORNIA INSURANCE AGENCIES<br /> ALL CALIFORNIA DEALERS OF NEW/USED AUTOMOBILES</p>
<p>FROM: CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE</p>
<p>SUBJ: AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLE HEADLAMP DIMMER SWITCH</p>
<p>1. Pursuant to the California Department of Motor Vehicles Act Number DMV 95-79221, all motor vehicles sold in the State of California after November 1, 1995 will be required to have the headlamp dimmer switch mounted on the floor of the vehicle. The dimmer switch must be mounted in a position accessible to operation by pressing the switch with the left foot. The switch must be far enough removed from the left foot pedals to avoid any inadvertent operation and/or pedal confusion.</p>
<p>2. Included in the above act, and beginning January 1, 1996 all other vehicles with steering mounted switches must be retrofitted with a floor mounted dimmer switch of the type described above. The steering column mounted dimmer switch must be disabled or removed from the vehicle. Vehicles which have not made this change will fail the forthcoming California State Safety Inspection which will begin on this date.</p>
<p>3. It is recognized that this will cause some difficulties and hardship for the driving public. However, this change is being made in the interest of public safety. A recent study entitled Initiation Sequence in California Night Time Highway Traffic Accidents was conducted jointly by the California Department of Highway Patrol and the California Department of Motor Vehicles along with the University of California at Berkeley Public Safety Research Department. In this study it has been shown that 90-95% of all California night time traffic accidents are caused by a blonde getting her foot caught in the steering wheel in an attempt to dim the headlamps of her vehicle.</p>

The dog<br /> jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to type out a perfect letter.<br /> He took out the page and trotted over to the manager and gave it to him, then<br /> jumped back on the chair. The manager was stunned, but then told the dog, ""The<br /> sign says you have to be good with a computer."" The dog jumped down again and<br /> went to the computer. The dog proceeded to enter and execute a perfect program<br /> that worked flawlessly the first time. By this time the manager was totally<br /> dumb-founded! He looked at the dog and said, ""I realize that you are a very<br /> intelligent dog and have some interesting abilities. However, I *still* can't<br /> give you the job."" The dog jumped down and went to a copy of the sign and put<br /> his paw on the sentences that told about being an Equal Opportunity Employer.<br /> The manager said, ""Yes, but the sign *also* says that you have to be bilingual"".<br /> The dog looked at the manager calmly and said ""Meow.""</p>

34239,"<p>You won't beleive this. It's a true story. Ahem: About a year ago I was at Science Class and sitting beside my buddy Chad. We were in this huge science lab, and were waiting for our assighnment Mr.Hall wlked in, and wrote on the marker board. ""All students will be required to wear they're goggles and an apron. Pair up with a partner and you will each be given a series of chemicals. make predictions about what you think they are. Look, touch,(with gloves)and write down observations. Next, heat the chemical you observed, and describe what happens. Do not over heat bunsen burner! Record observations in science journal, and wait for further directions.""<br /> Chad and I put on our gear and grabbed our chemicals. I tested a few, but came up on one that I couldn't figure out. Chad on the other hand, was doing fine with his half. </p>
<p>""What do you think this is?"" ""Dunno"" Chad replied, he lit the burner. I observed the liquid. it was clear, and looked like water. </p>
<p>I poured a little out and touched it. It was cold. ""Chad. I'm going to taste this I know it's water."" Chad turned towards me. ""What? You pussey! You can't do that! You don't know what that is!"" ""It has to be water!"" ""Don't take any chances!' Chad replied. I looked at my chemical carefully. I was convinced it was water. So I began to put it to my lips when, chad knocked over his burner, and the chemical fell into the floor! His apron caught fire, and he yelled at the top of his lungs. Everyone screamed! Chad ripped off his apron and through it onto a table. But the table was covered with paper! It began getting larger. Still convinced that the chemical was H2O I picked up the glass and threw it on the fire. Unfortunantly, I found out later that the chemical was actually Gasoline!! The fire raged as the fire engulfed the two tables nearest to it!! ""Evreyone out!!!!"" Mr.hall and my classmates ran out the door as Mr.hall grabbed a fire extinguisher in the hall and ran into the room. After about two minutes, Mr.hall came out, and yelled ""Who is responsible for this?!!"" Everyone pointed to Chad and me. We looked at each other, and then at Mr.Hall. ""You two!!! To the Mr.Simpson's office!!! Now!!!"" </p>
<p>Chad and I spent the rest of the school year suspended and in detention. We never neared a fire without caution again. </p>

34330,"<p>A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA loan for a client. He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. </p>
<p>The title to the property dated back<br /> to 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down. </p>
<p>After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following reply:<br /> ""Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral proper back to 1803. Before final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin.</p>
<p>""Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows:</p>
<p>""Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been received. I note<br /> that you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application. </p>
<p>I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application. </p>
<p>For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain. </p>
<p>The land came into possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the then reigning monarch, Isabella. </p>
<p>The good queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles, almost as much as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to fund Columbus' expedition. </p>
<p>Now the Pope, as I'm sure you know, is the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And God, it is commonly accepted, created this world. </p>
<p>Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that He also made that part of the world called Louisiana. He, therefore, would be the owner of origin. </p>
<p>I hope to you find His original claim to be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Now, may we have the lousy loan?</p>

"
34339,"<p>A new contract for Santa has finally been negotiated.<br /> Please read the following carefully.</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that, effective immediately, I will no longer be able to serve Southern United States on Christmas Eve. Due to the overwhelming current population of the earth, my contract was renegotiated by North American Fairies and Elves Local 209. I now serve only certain areas of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan. As part of the new and better contract I also get longer breaks for milk and cookies.</p>
<p>However, I'm certain that your children will be in good hands with your local replacement who happens to be my third cousin, Bubba Claus. His side of the family is from the South Pole. He shares my goal of delivering toys to all the good boys and girls; however,<br /> there are a few differences between us...</p>
<p>1. There is no danger of a Grinch stealing your presents from Bubba Claus. He has a gun rack on his sleigh and bumper sticker that reads:<br /> ""These toys insured by Smith and Wesson.""</p>
<p>2. Instead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus prefers that children leave an RC cola and pork rinds [or a moon pie] on the fireplace. And Bubba doesn't smoke a pipe. He dips a little snuff though, so please have an empty spit can handy.</p>
<p>3. Bubba Claus' sleigh is pulled by floppy-eared, flyin' coon dogs instead of reindeer. I made the mistake of loaning him a couple of my reindeer one time, and Blitzen's head now overlooks Bubba's fireplace.</p>
<p>4. You won't hear ""On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen ..."" when Bubba Claus arrives. Instead, you'll hear, ""On Earnhardt, on Wallace, on Martin and Labonte On Rudd, on Jarrett, on Elliott and Petty.""</p>
<p>5. ""Ho, ho, ho!"" has been replaced by ""Yee Haw!""<br /> And you also are likely to hear Bubba's elves respond, ""I her'd dat!""</p>
<p>6. As required by Southern highway laws, Bubba Claus' sleigh does have a Yosemite Sam safety triangle on the back with the words ""Back Off!"" The last I heard it also had other decorations on the sleigh back as well. One is Ford or Chevy logo with lights that race through the letters and the other is a caricature of me (Santa Claus) going wee on the Tooth Fairy.</p>
<p>7. The usual Christmas movie classics such as ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" will not be shown in your negotiated viewing area. Instead, you'll see ""Boss Hogg Saves Christmas"" and ""Smokey and the Bandit IV"" featuring Burt Reynolds as Bubba Claus and dozens of state patrol cars crashing into each other.</p>
<p>8. Bubba Claus doesn't wear a belt. If I were you, I'd make sure you, the wife, and the kids turn the other way when he bends over to put presents under the tree.</p>
<p>9. And finally, lovely Christmas songs have been sung about me like ""Rudolph The Red-nosed Reindeer"" and Bing Crosby's ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town."" This year songs about Bubba Claus will be played<br /> on all the AM radio stations in the South. Those song titles will be:<br /> Mark Chesnutt's ""Bubba Claus Shot the Jukebox,"" Cledus T. Judd's ""All I Want for Christmas Is My Woman and a Six Pack,"" and Hank Williams Jr.'s ""If You Don't Like Bubba Claus, You Can Shove It.""</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours,<br /> Santa Claus North American Fairies and Elves Local 209</p>

34356,"<p>King Arthur was preparing to go out on an expedition and would be away from Camelot for an indefinite period of time. King Arthur was worried about leaving Queen Guinevere alone with all those horny knights of the Round Table. So he went to Merlin for some advice. </p>
<p>After explaining his predicament to Merlin, the wizard looked thoughtful, and said that he'd see if he could come up with something, and asked him to come back in a week. A week later King Arthur was back in Merlin's laboratory where the good wizard was showing him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt... except that it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place. </p>
<p>""This is no good, Merlin!"" the king exclaimed, ""Look at this opening. How is this supposed to protect m'lady, the Queen?"" </p>
<p>""Ah, sire, just observe."" said Merlin as he searched his cluttered work bench until he found what he was looking for. He then selected his most worn-out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway. He then inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two. </p>
<p>""Merlin, you are a genius!"" said the greatful monarch, ""Now I can leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected."" </p>
<p>After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his Quest. Several years passed until he returned to Camelot. Immediately he assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for an informal 'short arm' inspection. </p>
<p>Sure enough! Each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way. All of them except Sir Galahad. </p>
<p>""Sir Galahad"", exclaimed King Arthur, ""The one and only true knight! Only you among all the nobles have been true to me. What is it in my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours!"" </p>

34361,"<p>Late one Friday in Dublin, a policeman spotted a man driving very erratically. He pulled the man over and asked him if he had been drinking that evening.  ''Aye, so I have. 'Tis Friday, you know, so me and the lads stopped by the pub where I had six or seven pints. And then there was something called 'Happy Hour' and they served these mar-gar-itos which are quite good. I had four or five o' those. Then I had to drive me friend Mike home and o' course I had to go in for a couple of Guinness -- couldn't be rude, ye know. Then I stopped on the way home to get another bottle for later...'' And the man fumbled around in his coat until he located his bottle of whiskey, which he held up for inspection. The officer sighed, and said, ''Sir, I'm afraid I'll need you to step out of the car and take a breathalyzer test.''  ''Why? Don't ye believe me?''</p>

34362,"<p>Have any of you heard how Al Gore lives a Christ centered life? He gave a<br /> big speech about how his faith is so important to him. Well the funny part<br /> is, he said his favorite Bible verse is John 16:3. Of course the speech<br /> writer meant 3:16, but wasn't familiar enough to catch the error. Well,<br /> John 16:3 is, ""And they will do this because they have not known the<br /> Father or me.""</p>

34395,"<p>There are three flys in a jar. Two females and one male. One day<br /> the female flys are talking and one says to the other one 'I<br /> need to get out of this jar!' The male fly overhears this and<br /> calls the female fly over. 'I can tell you how to get out of the<br /> jar', he says. 'Really? Tell me.' The male fly replies 'Ok. But<br /> you have to sleep with me first.' The female fly doesn't think<br /> to highly of that but she agrees. So when they are finished she<br /> says tell me how to get out of the jar. The male fly says fly<br /> around the inside of the jar as fast as you can three times,<br /> then stop in the center and go straight up and out. The female<br /> fly gets all excited.

After they are finished she asks him how to<br /> get out of the jar.

34422,"<p>Every time a new Pope is elected, there are many rituals and ceremonies to perform, in accordance with tradition.But there's one tradition that very few people know about...Shortly after the new Pope is enthroned, the Chief Rabbi seeks an audience. He is shown into the Pope's presence, whereupon he presents him with a silver tray bearing a velvet cushion. On top of the cushion is an ancient, shriveled parchment envelope. The Pope symbolically stretches out his arm in a gesture of rejection. The Chief Rabbi then retires, taking the envelope with him and does not return until the next Pope is elected.John Paul II was intrigued by this ritual, whose origins were unknown to him. He instructed the best scholars of the Vatican to research it, but they came up with nothing. When the time came and the Chief Rabbi was shown into his presence, he faithfully enacted the ritual rejection but, as the Chief Rabbi turned to leave, he called him back.""My brother,"" the Holy Father whispered, ""I must confess that we Catholics are ignorant of the meaning of this ritual enacted for centuries between us and you, the representative of the Jewish people. I have to ask you, what is it all about?""The Chief Rabbi shrugs and replies: ""But we have no more idea than you do. The origin of the ceremony is lost in the mists of ancient history.""The Pope said: ""Let us retire to my private chambers and enjoy a glass of wine together, then, with your agreement, we shall open the envelope and discover at last the secret."" The Chief Rabbi agreed.Fortified in their resolve by the wine, they gingerly pried open the parchment envelope and with trembling fingers, the Chief Rabbi reached inside and extracted a folded sheet of similarly ancient paper. As the Pope peered over his shoulder, he slowly opened it. They both gasped with shock.It was the check for the Last Supper.</p>

34432,"<p>In the beginning, God created the bit. And the bit was a zero. </p>
<p>On the first day, he toggled the 0 to 1, and the Universe was. (In those days, bootstrap loaders were simple, and ""active low"" signals didn't yet exist.) </p>
<p>On the second day, God's boss wanted a demo, and tried to read the bit. This being volatile memory, the bit reverted to a 0. And the universe wasn't. God learned the importance of backups and memory refresh, and spent the rest of the day (and his first all-nighter) reinstalling the universe. </p>
<p>On the third day, the bit cried ""Oh, Lord! If you exist, give me a sign!"" And God created rev. 2.0 of the bit, even better than the original prototype. Those in Universe Marketing immediately realised that ""new and improved"" wouldn't do justice to such a grand and glorious creation. And so it was dubbed the Most Significant Bit. Many bits followed, but only one was so honored. </p>
<p>On the fourth day, God created a simple ALU with 'add' and 'logical shift' instructions. And the original bit discovered that by performing a single shift instruction, it could become the Most Significant Bit. And God realised the importance of computer security. </p>
<p>On the fifth day, God created the first mid-life kicker, rev. 2.0 of the ALU, with wonderful features, and said ""Forget that add and shift stuff. Go forth and multiply."" And God saw that it was good. </p>
<p>On the sixth day, God got a bit overconfident, and invented pipelines, register hazards, optimising compilers, crosstalk, restartable instructions, microinterrupts, race conditions, and propagation delays. Historians have used this to convincingly argue that the sixth day must have been a Monday. </p>

34443,"<p>The following are excerpts from various American medical journals.....prepare<br /> yourself, they are pretty amazing (But all are True)</p>
<p>INNER SKELETON<br /> A 63-year-old widow was admitted to hospital in Recife, Brazil,suffering<br /> abdominal pains. X-rays showed that she was carrying a 20-inch long skeleton of<br /> a fetus which she conceived a decade earlier. It had become lodged outside the<br /> womb and was never<br /> expelled from her body.</p>
<p>FEMALE SOFA<br /> 500 lb. woman from Illinois was examined in the hospital. During the<br /> examination, an asthma inhaler fell from under her armpit, a dime was found<br /> under one of her breasts, and a remote control was found lodged between the<br /> folds of her vulva.</p>
<p>OUCH!<br /> A couple hobbled into a Washington emergency room covered in bloodied<br /> restaurant towels. The man had his around his waist, and the woman had hers<br /> around her head. They eventually explained to doctors that they had gone out<br /> that evening for a romantic dinner. Overcome with passion, the woman crept under<br /> the<br /> table to administer oral sex to the man. While in the act, she had an<br /> epileptic fit, which caused her to clamp down on the man's member and wrench it<br /> from side to side. In agony and desperation, the man grabbed a fork and stabbed<br /> her in the head until she let go.</p>
<p>SEX EDUCATION<br /> a Californian doctor examining a young woman with abdominal pains asked her if<br /> she was sexually active. She said that she wasn't.<br /> A later examination showed that she was pregnant. Asked why she said that she<br /> was not sexually active, the woman replied ""I'm not, I just lie there."" When<br /> asked if she knew who the father was, with a puzzled look she replied, ""No.<br /> Who?</p>
<p>BLIND DRUNK<br /> A drunk staggered into a Pennsylvania ER complaining of severe pain while<br /> trying to remove his contact lenses. He said that they would come out halfway,<br /> but they always popped back in. A nurse tried to help using a suction pump, but<br /> without success. Finally, a doctor examined him and discovered that the man did<br /> not have his contact lenses in at all. He had been trying to rip out the<br /> membrane of his cornea.</p>
<p>GROWING SEASON<br /> An old woman in a North Carolina ER complained of green vines growing from her<br /> vagina. Investigation  revealed a large potato trapped in her womb. The woman<br /> then suddenly remembered that she had inserted it two weeks previously, because<br /> she thought that her uterus was falling out.</p>
<p>PRICKLY PAIR<br /> In Michigan, a man came into the ER with lacerations to his penis. He<br /> complained that his wife had ""a rat in her vagina"" and it bit him during sex.<br /> After an examination of his wife, it was revealed that she had a surgical needle<br /> left inside her after a recent hysterectomy.</p>
<p>LAST STAND<br /> A Cambridge man hobbled into the ER complaining of a permanent erection. He<br /> admitted to doctors that while on holiday in Cuba, he frequented many brothels,<br /> and in one he was given some erectile cream to keep him hard. He was told to use<br /> it sparingly.<br /> However, since he was having so much fun, he kept using more and more. By the<br /> time he came to the ER, all the blood vessel in his penis were swollen and his<br /> testicles had ballooned in size. Doctors could do nothing except prescribe pain<br /> killers, and told<br /> him that it would return to flaccidity in a few days. They also told him to<br /> enjoy his erection while it lasted, because it was going to be his last.</p>
<p>CALL THE BUM SQUAD!<br /> A World War II veteran came into a London clinic with a<br /> hemorrhoid problem. One painful pile would often hang down from the man's anus<br /> and he was in the habit of pushing it back up with an artillery shell. On this<br /> occasion, the shell got stuck.<br /> Doctors were going to remove it but the man told them the shell was still<br /> live. So the hospital called in the army bomb disposal squad, who built a lead<br /> box around the man's anus to defuse the shell so it could be removed.</p>

34445,"<p>Tom is applying for a job as a signalman for the local railroad, and is told to meet the inspector at the signal box. The inspector decides to give Tom a pop quiz, asking, ""What would you do if you realized that two trains were heading towards each other on the same track?"" Tom says, ""I would switch one train to another track."" ""What if the lever broke?"" asks the inspector. ""I'd run down to the tracks and use the manual lever,"" answers Tom.""What if that had been struck by lightning?"" challenges the inspector. ""Then,"" Tom continues, ""I'd run back up here and use the phone to call the next signal box."" ""What if the phone was busy?"" ""In that case,"" Tom argues, ""I'd run to the street level and use the public phone near the station"". ""What if that had been vandalized?"" ""Oh, well,"" says Tom, ""in that case I'd run into town and get my Uncle Leo."" This puzzles the inspector, so he asks, ""Why would you do that?""""Because he's never seen a train crash.""</p>

34448,"<p>The curator of a Western art museum commissioned a local artist<br /> to paint a mural-sized painting of Custer's Last Thought. The<br /> artist was told to make it highly symbolic of Custer's mindset<br /> during the debacle at Little Big Horn.</p>
<p>Deep in thought, the artist went to her studio. After many false<br /> starts, she proceeded to paint an enormous oil painting.<br /> Finally, after many months of work, the painting was unveiled<br /> for the curator. In the foreground, a beautiful crystalline blue<br /> lake with a single fish leaping. Around the fish's head is a<br /> halo. In the background, the hills and meadows are covered with<br /> naked Native American couples copulating.</p>
<p>The curator is both disgusted and baffled by what he sees. In a<br /> rage he turns to the artist and asks, ""What the hell has this<br /> got to do with Custer's Last Thought?""</p>
<p>The artist replied, ""Well, the way I see it, Custer's Last<br /> Thought had to have been: ""Holy Mackerel! Where did all these<br /> fucking Indians come from?'""</p>

34449,"<p>The only cow in a small Iowa town stopped giving milk. The people did some research and found that they could buy a cow just across the state line in Nebraska for $200.</p>
<p>They bought the cow from Nebraska and the cow was wonderful. It produced lots of milk all of the time, and the people were pleased and very happy. They decided to acquire a fine bull to mate with the cow and produce more cows like it. They would never have to worry about their milk supply again. </p>
<p>They bought the bull and put it in the pasture with their beloved cow. However, whenever the bull came close to the cow, the cow would move away. No matter what approach the bull tried, the cow would move away from the bull and he could not succeed in his quest. </p>
<p>The people were very upset and decided to ask the Vet, who was very wise, what to do. They explained to the Vet what was happening. ""Whenever the bull approaches our cow, she moves away. If he approaches from the back, she moves forward. When he approaches her from the front, she backs off. And if he approaches from the side, she walks away to the other side."" </p>
<p>The Vet thought about this for a minute and asked, ""Did you by chance, buy this cow in Nebraska?"" </p>
<p>The people were dumbfounded, since no one had ever mentioned where they bought the cow. </p>
<p>""You are truly a wise Vet,"" they said. ""How did you know we got the cow in Nebraska?"" </p>
<p>The Vet replied with a distant look in his eye, ""My wife is from Nebraska.""</p>

34497,"<p>1) No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen. </p>
<p>2) There are 2 billion children (persons under 1 in the world. BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle certain children due to various religious beliefs, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one good child in each. </p>
<p>3) Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc. </p>
<p>This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour. </p>
<p>4) The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that ''flying reindeer'' (see point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - - - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth. </p>
<p>5) 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporize</p>

<p>Desde lejos ve que su mujer le abre y lo hace entrar. El marido corre, abre con su llave sin hacer ruido, entra sigilosamente y esp�a por la puerta entreabierta del dormitorio. Fernando se saca la chaqueta revelando unos hombros poderosos y arm�nicos. La mujer lo besa apasionadamente y se saca los zapatos. </p>
<p>El marido no sabe que hacer, que decir, ni como intervenir y s�lo atina a seguir espiando. Fernando se saca la camisa de seda natural y muestra un torso perfecto, un vientre duro y sin un gramo de grasa. </p>
<p>La mujer se saca la falda y lo acaricia con locura. </p>
<p>Fernando se saca los pantalones y sus piernas son virilmente perfectas y un instrumento que le cuelga de envidia. </p>
<p>La mujer se saca la blusa y al soltarse el sost�n se le caen las ""tetas"" hasta el ombligo... ""�Qu� horrible ecena!""</p>

Although some<br /> casualties occurred among the crew, the pirates were repelled.</p>
<p>Later that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels<br /> sending boarding parties. The crew cowered in fear, but the captain, calm<br /> as ever bellowed, ""Bring me my red shirt!"" And once again the battle was<br /> on. However, the captain and his crew repelled both boarding parties,<br /> though this time more casualties occurred.</p>
<p>Weary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting<br /> the day's occurrences when an ensign looked to the captain and asked,<br /> ""Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before the battle?""</p>
<p>The captain, giving the ensign a look that only a captain can give,<br /> exhorted, ""If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the<br /> wound and thus, you men will continue to fight unafraid.""</p>
<p>The men sat in silence marveling at the courage of such a man. As dawn<br /> came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate ships,<br /> 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way.</p>

<p>Dear Scott,</p>
<p>I plan to use Dilbert cartoons in my upcoming presentation to a large<br /> industry group.  It's non-profit so I won't be paying you.  Please find<br /> all the ones about ""Teamwork"" and mail them to me.  I need them by<br /> tomorrow, so either FedEx or e-mail will be fine.</p>

<p>Dear June,</p>
<p>Nothing makes Mister Adams happier than a chance to give his work away<br /> for free, especially if it requires extra effort.  Unfortunately, Mister<br /> Adams is busy cleaning rain gutters for other inconsiderate turds who<br /> figured it ""wouldn't hurt to ask."" So he will not be able to satisfy your<br /> request in a timely manner.  He apologizes.</p>
<p>But here's a tip:  You can spice up your presentation with paintings from<br /> the Louvre.  Just write to the curator and ask him to mail you the ""ones<br /> with cherubs exhibiting teamwork.""  If he gives you any trouble, remind<br /> him that you're non-profit and he's being a jerk.</p>

<p>To reciprocate, Mister Adams suggests that you slap yourself in the head<br /> with a wooden spoon.  Judging from your quirky and irreverent style, we<br /> think you'll enjoy it.  Let us know what you think.</p>

<p>My friend named his turtle Alteriox.  It would be very funny if you named<br /> a character in the Dilbert strip Alterioxbert.  We would all be very<br /> amused.  If you do it, write and tell me because I don't read the strip.  </p>
<p>       Randy</p>
<p>Dear Randy,</p>
<p>That is an excellent suggestion for increasing the humor of the strip in<br /> a way that is relevant to a broad audience.  In fact, Mister Adams plans<br /> to name ALL of the characters Alterioxbert, except for a new character<br /> called ""Randy the Butt Pimple.""  Thank you for this excellent suggestion.</p>

34534,"<p>Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to leave Italy. There was, of course, a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He would have a religious debate with a leader of the Jewish community. If the Jewish leader won the debate, the Jews would be permitted to stay in Italy. If the Pope won, the Jews would have to leave. </p>
<p>The Jewish community met and picked an aged Rabbi, Moishe, to represent them in the debate. Rabbi Moishe, however, could not speak Latin and the Pope could not speak Yiddish. So it was decided that this would be a ""silent"" debate. </p>
<p>On the day of the great debate, the Pope and Rabbi Moishe sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. </p>
<p>Rabbi Moishe looked back and raised one finger. </p>
<p>Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. </p>
<p>Rabbi Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. </p>
<p>The Pope then brought out a communion wafer and chalice of wine. </p>
<p>Rabbi Moishe pulled out an apple. </p>
<p>With that, the Pope stood up and said, ""I concede the debate. This man has bested me. The Jews can stay."" </p>
<p>Later, the Cardinals gathered around the Pope, asking him what had happened. </p>
<p>The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us of our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?"" </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Jewish community crowded around Rabbi Moishe, asking what happened. </p>
<p>""Well,"" said Moishe, ""first he said to me, 'You Jews have three days to get out of here.' So I said to him, 'Up yours'. Then he tells me the whole city would be cleared of Jews. So I said to him, 'Listen here Mr. Pope, the Jews ... we stay right here!"" </p>

34542,"<p>A fellow stopped at a rural gas station and, after filling his tank, he paid the bill and bought a soft drink. As he stood by his car to drink his cola, he watched a couple of men working along the roadside.</p>
<p>One man would dig a hole two or three feet deep and then move on.</p>
<p>The other man came along behind and filled in the hole.</p>
<p>While one was digging a new hole, the other was about 25 feet behind filling in the old. The men worked right past the fellow with the soft drink and went on down the road.</p>

<p>""Well, we work for the county,"" one of the men said.</p>
<p>""But one of you is digging a hole and the other fills it up. You're not accomplishing anything. Aren't you wasting the county's money?""</p>
<p>""You don't understand, mister,"" one of the men said, leaning on his shovel and wiping his brow.</p>

""Mrs. Fitzgerald,"" the reverend said sternly. ""This is<br /> no place for a member of my congregation.

After<br /> rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lying on top of Mrs.<br /> Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist.

<p>""Jonny! How dare you ask such a horrible question!  I'm taking<br /> you to the principal's office!"" The teacher screamed.  So she<br /> took Jonny to the principal's office and threw him on the<br /> waiting couch.  When it was Jonny's turn, the principal said,<br /> ""Come in Jonny, did your teacher have you come down to give me<br /> some thing or tell me something?""  Cuz everyone knows Jonny.<br /> Jonny steeped in and said, ""Well, all I did was ask the teacher<br /> what a purple blurple is...""  ""Jonny!  Take your things and<br /> leave school, never come back!""  the principal raged.  So Jonny<br /> left school and went home to his house.  He knocked on the door<br /> and his mother answered. </p>
<p>""Why hi Jonny, whats up?  Why are you home early?""His mother<br /> asked.  ""Well, my teacher sent me to the principal's office and<br /> the principal sent me home!""Jonny explained.  ""Why...did that<br /> happen?""His mother asked.  ""Cuz all I did was ask what a purple<br /> blurple is!""</p>
<p>""Jonny!  Go up to your room and have your father deal with you<br /> once he gets home!""She yelled.  So Jonny went up to his room and<br /> waited for three hours when he heard a knock.  ""Come in,"" Jonny<br /> said.  Jonny's father entered and said, ""Jonny why is your<br /> mother so upset?""  Jonny replied, ""Well, my teacher sent me up<br /> to the principal's office, who sent me home, then mom sent me up<br /> to my room and that's it!""  ""Why did all this happen?"" Jonny's<br /> father asked.  ""Cuz I asked what a purple blurple is.""</p>

""And why did that happen?  What did you do?"" Bob<br /> asked.  ""All I did was ask what a purple blurple was."" he<br /> explained.</p>
<p>""Jonny! Get out of this cab!""  Bob yelled as he slammed onthe<br /> breaks.  Jonny got out of the cab and took his luggage.  By this<br /> time Jonny was only 100 feet away from the airport so he walked<br /> the rest of the way.  He had no money so he slid in a corner and<br /> slept there.</p>
<p>A flight attendant found him in the morning, ""Hi Jonny!"" Cuz<br /> everyone knows Jonny. ""Why are you in a corner in the airport.""<br /> ""It's a realy long story, I was kicked out of my house."" Jonny<br /> summarised.

He pops the cash register open, pulls out a wad of bills, and counts them out into the rancher's outstretched hand.After the rancher leaves, Mike asks the bartender, ""What was that all about?""The barkeep says, ""Haven't you boys heard?  We got us a real wolf problem in these parts, and the county ain't done a thing about it.  Why, just last week, a pack of the damn varmints come onta my property and laid waste t'my chicken coop.

So I'm offerin' a bounty -- a hundred dollars to anybody who brings in a wolf pelt.""Mike and Bill look at each other, and immediately race out of the bar to go hunt wolves.After wandering around the hills for several hours, they finally spot a lone wolf in the distance.  Mike takes aim with his rifle and shoots the wolf dead.  The two fellas sprint over to where the carcass lay, and Mike gets busy with the pelt.Suddenly, Bill says, ""Hey, Mike, look."" ""Not now,"" says Mike, ""I'm busy.""Bill tugs on Mike's sleeve and says, ""Mike, I think you *really* ought to see this."" ""Not now!"" Mike says again.""Can't you see I've got a hundred dollars in my hands?""Bill's voice starts to waver.""Mike, please, just look!"" Mike stops what he's doing and looks up:  The two men are surrounded by a pack of wolves -- at least fifty in all, every one of them growling, drooling, gnashing their teeth, and licking their chops. Mike takes in the sight and gasps:  ""Oh, my God... .... ... ... We're gonna be rich!""</p>

34615,"<p>'Twas the night before Christmas, and God it was neat.</p>
<p>The kids were both gone, and my wife was in heat.</p>
<p>The doors were all bolted, and the phone off the hook,</p>
<p>It was time for some for some pussy, fuck reading that book.</p>
<p>Momma in her teddy, and I in the nude,</p>
<p>Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube.</p>
<p>When out on the lawn there arose such a cry,</p>
<p>That I lost my boner and momma went dry.</p>
<p>Up to the window I sprang like an elf,</p>
<p>Tore back the shade while she played with herself.</p>
<p>The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built,</p>
<p>Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.</p>
<p>When what to my wondering eyes should appear,</p>
<p>But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangy reindeer.</p>
<p>With a fat little driver, half out of his sled,</p>
<p>A sock in his ear, and a bra on his head.</p>
<p>Sure as I'm speaking, he was as high as a kite</p>
<p>And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right.</p>
<p>""Whoa Shithead, whoa Asshole, hey Dickfore, whoa Putz,</p>
<p>Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your nuts.""</p>
<p>""Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree,</p>
<p>Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee.</p>
<p>They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub,</p>
<p>Just as Santa leaned out and puked on my shrub.</p>
<p>And then from the roof we heard something splatter,</p>
<p>As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder.</p>
<p>I put on my jacket to cover my ass,</p>
<p>When down the chimney Santa came with a crash.</p>
<p>His suit was all covered with dip spit galore,</p>
<p>He looked like a bum and smelled like a whore.</p>
<p>""I'm all fuckin' shit-canned ,"" he said with a smile,</p>
<p>""And Rudolf was farting the last half-a mile.""</p>
<p>He walked to the kitchen, for himself poured a drink,</p>
<p>Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink.</p>
<p>I started to laugh, as my wife turned around</p>
<p>Santa was hung half way to the ground.</p>
<p>Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack,</p>
<p>But his toys were all gone, and some new things were packed.</p>
<p>The first thing he found was a pair of false tits,</p>
<p>The next was a manual on how to pop zits.</p>
<p>A dime bag of reefer was Santa's next find,</p>
<p>And a six pair of panties, the edible kind.</p>
<p>A boarding school pisser, a penis extension,</p>
<p>And several other things that I can't even mention.</p>
<p>A cock ring, a G-string, and all types of oil,</p>
<p>And a bong that was wrapped with aluminium foil.</p>
<p>""This stuff's not for kids, Mrs. Santa will shit,</p>
<p>So I'll leave it all here, and then I'll just split.""</p>
<p>He filled both our stockings, looked at my wife's cleave. </p>
<p>And tucked my son's crack pipe up under his sleeve. </p>
<p>He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead, </p>
<p>Made it out of the chimney, on my roof smacked his head.</p>
<p>In time he was seated, took the reigns of his hitch,</p>
<p>Saying, ""Take me home, Rudolph, the night's been a bitch!""</p>
<p>The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout,</p>
<p>""The best thing about college, is that the beer won't run out.</p>

<p>Great neighborhood near conveniences - on a noisy, busy street.<br /> Near playground where street gangs congregate at night. Houses<br /> are so close you can hear your neighbors breathing.</p>
<p>Acerage included - High taxes, high taxes, high taxes!</p>
<p>With a little imagination, this could be your dream house - see<br /> Handyman's delight</p>
<p>Income potential - If you want to invest a Donald Trump sized<br /> bank account, you can convert this into rental property. Good<br /> luck trying to collect from your deadbeat tenants.</p>
<p>Appliances included - but they don't work. You'll have to buy<br /> new ones anyway and be burdened with disposing of the old ones.<br /> Nobody gives up a good freezer, stove, washer or refrigerator.</p>
<p>Excellent starter home - it's so small (how small is it?) you'll<br /> break the back window when you put the key in the front door.</p>
<p>Extensive deferred maintenance throughout - see handyman's<br /> delight.</p>
<p>Custom design - see entropy at work. This has a sunken living<br /> room - literally. The kitchen had slid 50 feet down the hillside<br /> after the last heavy rainfall. Skylights are really holes in the<br /> roof left by a hurricane. Heated pool in cellar is created by<br /> the leaking water heater.</p>
<p>For the discriminating buyer - You must have Bill Gates' income.</p>
<p>Has floors, roof and windows - Wow! I always wanted those<br /> ammenities.</p>
<p>Has possibilities - see handyman's delight.</p>
<p>Peace and privacy - A hundred miles from anywhere. No<br /> electricity, indoor plumbing or central heat. Chipmunks,<br /> mosquitoes and bears are your closest neighbors.</p>
<p>Spacious, with catherdral ceiling - Think about fuel bills when<br /> trying to heat this monstrosity!</p>
<p>On corner lot - Pedestrians, bikers and vehicular traffic make<br /> short-cuts across your front lawn.</p>
<p>A great fixer-upper - Ever see the movie ""The Money Pit""?</p>
<p>Be the frist to see this one - It's been on the market six years<br /> without an offer.</p>

34687,"<p>Why do women have foreheads?</p>
<p>So you have someplace to kiss them after they give you a blowjob.</p>
"
34688,"<p>1. Before becoming involved in any kind of cybersex, please make sure your spouse, boyfriend, kids, etc. are out of the room at the time, (preferably out of the house and not during a major holiday when your in-laws are also present or at a time when all your relatives are in attendance). It really gets difficult explaining what you are doing undressing in front of the computer, drooling out of one corner of your mouth, moaning and groaning, while the buzz of various ""toys"" can be heard. </p>
<p>2. For men, before you begin, please check that your modem protector is on, along with the splash guard for your keyboard. It will stop the future embarrassment of telling the computer technician that your keys are ""stuck"" and you have no idea why. </p>
<p>3. For women, no matter what you are truly wearing, such as: sweatpants, sweat shirt, torn bathrobe, slippers, t-shirt with stains on the front, bloomer underwear that could cover a car or be used for a parachute, always tell your potential cyber partner you are wearing a thong, garterbelt with black stockings, and your best Wonderbra (the one that has everything pulled up so high your bellybutton is under your chin), and a pair of high heels. We don't want to destroy that myth that all women dress that way when we sit down at the computer (although I truly wear these things each and every time I sit in front of my computer, it does seem to cause a bit of a commotion at the office - but I have certainly worked my way up the ranks in the company). As for what the man should be wearing, we all know that they are all naked and wearing just a smile. </p>
<p>4. If the cyber begins to get very hot please refrain from straddling your monitor. There are many emergency room stories to be told if you get overly excited, not to mention the many years of therapy to get you to let go and not continue this sordid affair with your 15"" screen. </p>
<p>5. If the cyber is not going well, please let the other person know in the best way you can. It is not very polite to tell them that you are doing your nails, have just made up your grocery list for the next month, shingled the house, pulled out one of your wisdom teeth because you were bored, would rather read the instructions on how to set the time on your VCR, checked your fridge to make sure the light still works when you open the door, and last but not least, stuck your tongue to an ice cube tray to stop the monotony. </p>
<p>6. When it really starts getting hot and heavy, please check your spelling before you send that embarrassing typo, i.e., oh baby, let me suck on those beautiful beasts of yours. I just love your hot, wet posse (although it does kinda put a western slant on things - hmmmm, things could get interesting with boots and spurs though). Oh baby, you have such a big coke, (hope you got the supersized fries and burger with that). Thats it baby, show me that beautiful clint, (go ahead, make my day), and the proverbial oh fork me hard! </p>
<p>7. Pay attention to what is going on. Please refrain from putting your ""coke"" in one place, when your cyberpartner had just typed that it was someplace else. If you have no clue as to where the cyber is going, ask to buy a vowel. If you are really lost and can't keep up, or you had a case of premature cybering, and really do not feel like typing for 3 days to satisfy your female counterpart, just pretend you got bumped offline. That always works and at least she won't take it so personal. Please refrain from the excuse, ""I have to let my dog out."" </p>
<p>8. Once both cyberpartners have been satisfied, or faked satisfaction, (oh great, we now have the added pressure of faking cyber-orgasms too), at least say thank you. (Thank you can mean, thank God its over, or THANK YOU because you truly had a wonderful time.) </p>
<p>9. If it was a truly bad experience, do not feel pressured into ever having cybersex with this person again. When they ask for your email address, just give them the wrong one. If they begin to pester you, it's proper etiquette to just bump yourself offline, or just say HUH? I never got your message. Nobody needs to suffer a really bad cyber twice. </p>
<p>10. Last but not least, remember that cybersex will not make you go blind, unless you keep all the lights out in the house while having it, watching the screen in the dark does make your eyes burn. Realize that you may be addicted if your real life partner walks by naked and you'd rather be typing with one hand and still trying to keep a steady rhythm going. Sex can be just as nice with a partner you know. And just for variety, when your right hand gets tired, try dating your left hand for something different.</p>

Navy SEAL takes the gun puts it back down on the desk and says sir I love my wife I'm sorry I cant do it and walks outs.</p>
<p>The President calls in the second candidate who is an Army Ranger. The president tells him that in the next room is his wife and that he want him to take the pistol and kill her. The Army Ranger gets up goes into the next room sees his wife and comes back out. He tells the President I cant do it I saw my wife and just couldnt do it cause I love her and he walks out.</p>
<p>Well the President calls in the last candidate who is a Marine Sniper. The President tells him that in the next room is his wife and that he wants him to take this pistol and go kill her. The Marine Sniper stands up walks into the next. A few minutes pass and the President hears a series of gunshots. Couple more minutes pass and he hears glass breaking and a woman scream.</p>
<p>The Marine walks out sits back down and asks the president what the mission is. Well the president still confused about all the noise asks the marine what happened in there. The Marine tells him ""Well some dumbass puts blanks in the gun so I had to choke the bitch out.""</p>

""Captain, pirate ship off the port bow!""The captain then called for his first mate and said, ""First mate, bring me my red shirt!"" The red shirt was brought to him, they went into battle and won.The next day the lookout again burst into the room and said, ""Captain, two pirate ships closing fast!"" Once again the captain called for the first mate and said, ""First mate, bring me my red shirt!"" The first mate brought him his red shirt and once again they won the battle.During the celebration the first-mate asked, ""Captain, why do you always ask for your red shirt when we go into battle?""""The answer is simple. That way, if I'm injured, the crew won't know and they won't lose hope.""Just then the lookout burst through the door, ""Captain, ten ships closing fast!""""First mate, bring me my brown pants!""</p>

34758,"<p>Three pastors and their wives were car-pooling their way back from a<br /> revival when suddenly their van slid off the side of a cliff. Sadly, they<br /> were all killed. </p>
<p>At the Pearly Gates, Peter called the first couple forward. Looking<br /> through his book, Peter looked up at the first preacher sharply, ""You<br /> hypocrit!"" he boomed, ""All you ever cared about in your life was money!<br /> Money is evil, money won't buy you happiness! Yet you've hoarded money all<br /> your life! You were the wealthiest person in your whole community. In<br /> fact, you were so consumed with money that you married a woman named<br /> Penny, isn't that so?"" he demanded. </p>
<p>Obviously shaken, the preacher meekly responded, ""Y-yes, Sir, That's<br /> true."" ""Well, you did preach the gospel, so I won't send you off to<br /> you-know-where, but you don't get to come in the front gate. You have to<br /> walk all the way around heaven and enter in the back door. Off you go!""<br /> And the couple went shamefully on their way. </p>
<p>St. Peter leered at the next pastor, ""And you!"" Peter hissed. ""All you<br /> ever talked and cared about was Alcohol! The bottle this and the bottle<br /> that. Yet, you've been drunk nearly every time you preached. In fact, you<br /> were so consumed with alcohol and drinking that you married a woman named<br /> Brandy, is that so!?"" he accused. The pastor only nodded in shame. ""Well,<br /> but you preached a powerful sermon -- despite being drunk -- so no hell<br /> for you either. But you don't get to come in the front gate either. You<br /> have to walk all the way around heaven and enter in the back door."" And<br /> the couple slowly shuffled off.</p>
<p>""And you!"" St. Peter began.The third Pastor held up his hand to silence<br /> St. Peter and turned to his wife and said, ""We'd better start walkin',<br /> Fanny.""</p>

<p>In all their 40 years of marriage Hillary never looked. However on the afternoon of their 40th anniversary curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer bottles and $1874.25 in cash. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why. </p>
<p>That evening they were out for a special dinner. After dinner Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, ""I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never once looked into the box under our bed. However today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know why do you keep the bottles in the box?"" </p>
<p>Bill thought for a while and said, ""I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer bottle in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again."" </p>

The friend, happy to get anything free from a lawyer, eagerly agreed. When the time came, they spent a wonderful time, getting up early every morning and enjoying the great outdoors.One morning, as the lawyer and his Czechoslovakian friend were picking raspberries and blueberries for their breakfast, they were approached by two huge bears--a male and a female.The lawyer noticed them in time to run for cover. His friend, however, was not so lucky. The male bear reached him and swallowed him whole.Seeing this, the lawyer ran back to his Mercedes and raced for the nearest town to get the local sheriff. The sheriff grabbed his high-powered rifle and raced back to the berry area with the lawyer. All the while, he was plagued by visions of lawsuit from his friend's family. He just had to save his friend.Luckily, the bears were still there. ""He's in THAT one!"" cried the lawyer, pointing to the male.The sheriff looked at the bears, leveled his gun, took careful aim, and shot the female.""What did you do that for?!"" exclaimed the lawyer, ""I said he was in the other bear!""""Exactly,"" replied the sheriff. ""Would you believe a lawyer who told you that the Czech was in the male?""</p>

34797,"<p>A blonde went to a flight school, insisting she wanted to learn to fly that day. As all the planes were currently in use, the owner agreed to instruct her on how to pilot the helicopter solo by radio. He took her out, showed her how to start it and gave her the basics and sent her on her way.After she climbed 1000 feet, she radioed in. ""I'm doing great! I love it! The view is so beautiful, and I'm starting to get the hang of this."" After 2000 feet, she radioed again, saying how easy it was becoming to fly. The instructor watched her climb over 3000 feet, and was beginning to worry that she hadn't radioed in. A few minutes later, he watched in horror as she crashed about half a mile away. He ran over and pulled her from the wreckage. When he asked what happened, she said, ""I don't know! Everything was going fine, but as I got higher, I was starting to get cold. I can't remember anything after I turned off the big fan.""</p>

34800,"<p>In today�s world, Abbott and Lou Costello's famous sketch Who's on first? might have turned out something like this:COSTELLO CALLS TO BUY A COMPUTER FROM ABBOTT . . . .</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help you?<br /> COSTELLO: Thanks. I'm setting up an office in my den, and I'm thinking about buying a computer.</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Mac?<br /> COSTELLO: No, the name's Lou.<br /> ABBOTT: Your computer?<br /> COSTELLO: I don't own a computer. I want to buy one.<br /> ABBOTT: Mac?<br /> COSTELLO: I told you, my name's Lou.<br /> ABBOTT: What about Windows?<br /> COSTELLO: Why? Will it get stuffy in here?<br /> ABBOTT: Do you want a computer with Windows?<br /> COSTELLO: I don't know. What will I see when I look in the windows?<br /> ABBOTT: Wallpaper.<br /> COSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software.<br /> ABBOTT: Software for Windows?<br /> COSTELLO: No. On the computer! I need something I can use to write proposals, track expenses and run my business. What have you got?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Office.<br /> COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything?<br /> ABBOTT: I just did.<br /> COSTELLO: You just did what?<br /> ABBOTT: Recommend something.<br /> COSTELLO: You recommended something?<br /> ABBOTT: Yes.<br /> COSTELLO: For my office?<br /> ABBOTT: Yes.<br /> COSTELLO: OK, what did you recommend for my office?<br /> ABBOTT: Office.<br /> COSTELLO: Yes, for my office!<br /> ABBOTT: I recommend Office with Windows.<br /> COSTELLO: I already have an office with windows! OK, lets just say I'm sitting at my computer and I want to type a proposal. What do I need?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Word.<br /> COSTELLO: What word?<br /> ABBOTT: Word in Office.<br /> COSTELLO: The only word in office is office.<br /> ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.<br /> COSTELLO: Which word in office for windows?<br /> ABBOTT: The Word you get when you click the blue W.<br /> COSTELLO! : I'm going to click your blue w if you don't start with some straight answers. OK, forget that. Can I watch movies on the Internet?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Yes, you want Real One.<br /> COSTELLO: Maybe a real one, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. Just tell me what I need!</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Real One.<br /> COSTELLO: If it's a long movie I also want to see reel 2, 3 &amp; 4. Can I watch them?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Of course.<br /> COSTELLO: Great! With what?<br /> ABBOTT: Real One.<br /> COSTELLO: OK, I'm at my computer, and I want to watch a movie. What do I do?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: You click the blue 1.<br /> COSTELLO: I click the blue one what?<br /> ABBOTT: The blue 1.<br /> COSTELLO: Is that different from the blue w?<br /> ABBOTT: The blue 1 is Real One and the blue W is Word.<br /> COSTELLO: What word?<br /> ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.<br /> COSTELLO: But there's three words in office for windows!<br /> ABBOTT: No, just one. But it's the most popular Word in the world.<br /> COSTELLO: It is?<br /> ABBOTT: Yes, but to be fair, there aren't many other Words left. It pretty much wiped out all the other Words out there.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: And that word is real one?<br /> ABBOTT: Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn't even part of Office.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: STOP! Don't start that again. What about financial bookkeeping? You have anything I can track my money with?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Money.<br /> COSTELLO: That's right. What do you have?<br /> ABBOTT: Money.<br /> COSTELLO: I need money to track my money?<br /> ABBOTT: It comes bundled with your computer.<br /> COSTELLO: What's bundled with my computer?<br /> ABBOTT: Money.<br /> COSTELLO: Money comes with my computer?<br /> ABBOTT: Yes. No extra charge.<br /> COSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer? How much?<br /> ABBOTT: One copy.<br /> COSTELLO: Isn't it illegal to copy money?<br /> ABBOTT: Microsoft gave us a license to copy money.<br /> COSTELLO: They can give you a license to copy money?<br /> ABBOTT: Why not? THEY OWN IT!<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A FEW DAYS LATER . . .<br /> ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store.

34802,"<p>One daya maanger of a sales company is interviewing a man who<br /> wants to become an employee in the business.  The manager is a<br /> proud owner of a business that has been selling Bibles<br /> successfully for 20 years.  The owner receives the next guy into<br /> the office and the interview begins.</p>
<p>Manager:  Hello I am the manager to Bibles Inc.  Who are you and<br /> why i should hire you?</p>
<p>Guy:  M-m-m-y-y n-n-name i-i-i-i-is-s-s F-r-r-r-r-e-e-e-d.<br /> I-i-i-i-i kn-kn-know I-i-i-i-i Stu-stu-stu-stu-tter<br /> al-al-al-alot bu-bu-but pl-pl-pl-please ju-ju-ju-just gi-gi-give<br /> me a-a-a ch-ch-ch-chance.</p>
<p>The Manager knew that this man would be just horrible at this<br /> task in fact he himself felt uncomfortable in Fred's presence<br /> wanting nearly to get rid of the man.  So he thought of a way to<br /> let Fred down without feeling too much guilt. The manager<br /> thought and thought and finally gave in saying:</p>
<p>""Okay i'll give you one chance""</p>
<p>Fred went off with a dozen Bibles (twice as much as the average<br /> salesman sells) with an air of confidence around him.  The<br /> manager looked on as Fred went on thinking ""poor kid.""</p>
<p>That night Fred returns and the manager promptly asks him how it<br /> went.  Fred beams and shows that every bible is gone.  The<br /> manager now with a look of astonishment on his face assumes that<br /> they must have all been stolen.  When he asks Fred if they had<br /> been stolen Fred shakes his head in a negative response. The<br /> manager realizes that they must have ALL been sold. Astounded<br /> the Manager asks</p>
<p>""How in the Hell did you sell all these Bibles?""</p>
<p>Fred: ""We-we-we-we-well I-i-i-i t-t-t-told th-th-them<br /> th-th-th-that if th-th-they did not wa-wa-want to buy<br /> an-an-an-any. I-i-i-i cou-cou-cou-could re-re-read it t-t-to<br /> th-th-them.</p>

<p>The Muslim smiles and thinks to himself, ""Of course, Allah is on top of heaven itself because He is most high!"" </p>
<p>At the final gate he meets the all mighty Lord himself who says ""Welcome to heaven my child, please enter."" </p>
<p>As expected, the Muslim says he cannot enter without meeting Allah, to which the Lord replies ""I understand, my child...Allah is here. But he is busy right now. Why don't you have a seat and wait for him?"" </p>
<p>The Muslim is so excited that his Allah is so important, after all he always believed this was so. The Lord says to the Muslim ""Why you must be parched, would you like a drink?"" </p>
<p>The Muslim says, ""Yes, I would like a drink. I would like that very much."" </p>
<p>And the Lord asks, ""Would you like a Coke?"" </p>
<p>The Muslim says ""Yes, that sounds good, thank you."" </p>
<p>The Lord says, ""It does indeed. I think I'll join you."" </p>
<p>And with that the Lord snapped his fingers and said, ""Allah, bring two cokes!""</p>

34829,"<p>Little Johnny applied for a salesman's job at a big department store. In fact it was the biggest store in the world - you could get anything there. </p>
<p>The boss asked him, 'Have you ever been a salesman before?' 'No, this is my first job,' said the lad, but the boss liked the cut of him and said, 'You can start tomorrow and I'll come and see you when we close up.' </p>
<p>The day was long and arduous for the young man, but finally 5 o'clock came around. The boss duly fronted up and asked, 'How many sales did you make today?' 'One,' said the young salesman. 'Only one?' blurted the boss, 'Most of my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day. How much was the sale worth??' 'Three hundred thousand, three hundred and thirty four dollars.' said Little Johnny.</p>
<p>'How did you manage that?' asked the flabbergasted boss. 'Well,' said Little Johnny, 'this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook. Then I sold him a small fishing line, a medium one and a huge big one. I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast. I said he would probably need a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that twenty foot schooner with the twin engines. Then he said his Volkswagen probably wouldn't be able to pull it, so I took him to the car department and sold him the new Deluxe Cruiser.' </p>
<p>The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, 'You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook?' 'No.' answered Little Johnny, 'He came in to buy a box of Tampons for his wife so I said to him, 'Well, your weekend's screwed - you might as well go fishing.' '</p>

<p>HANDS-DOWN WINNER OF THE IDIOT CORPORATION AWARD!<br /> AT&amp;T fired President John Walter after nine months saying he lacked intellectual leadership. He received a $26 million severance package.<br /> (Let that be a lesson to him!)</p>
<p>WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS!<br /> Police in Oakland, California spent two hours attempting to subdue a gunman who had barricaded himself inside his home. After firing ten tear gas canisters, officers discovered that the man was standing beside them, shouting out to give himself up.<br /> (No one ever said you had to be ""smart"" to be a cop.)</p>
<p>NOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS PLANNED OUT WELL...NOT!<br /> An Illinois man, pretending to have a gun, kidnapped a motorist and forced him to drive to two different automated teller machines. The kidnapper then proceeded to withdraw money from his own bank account.<br /> (Maybe he should have pretended to have a brain!)</p>
<p>WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY...READ THIS<br /> Fire investigators on Maui have determined the cause of a blaze that destroyed a $127,000 home last month - a short in the homeowner's newly installed fire prevention alarm system.

<p>NOW THIS IS WHAT I CONSIDER A DEDICATED CROOK!<br /> A man walked into a Topeka, Kansas Kwik Shop and asked for all the money in the cash drawer. Apparently, the take was too small so he tied up the store clerk and worked the counter himself for three hours until police showed up and grabbed him.<br /> (Wonder if he paid himself time and 1/2 for the overtime?)</p>
<p>I WANNA BE A BRAIN SURGEON WHEN I GROW UP!<br /> In Ohio, an unidentified man in his late twenties walked into a police station with a 9-inch wire protruding from his forehead and calmly asked officers to give him an X-ray to help him find his brain, which he claimed had been stolen. Police were shocked to learn that the man had drilled a 6-inch deep hole in his skull with a Black &amp; Decker power drill and had stuck the wire in to try and find the missing brain.<br /> (After his hospital stay, he was immediately enrolled in law school!)</p>
<p>FOOT IN MOUTH...UP TO THE KNEE!<br /> Police in Los Angeles had good luck with a robbery suspect who just couldn't control himself during a lineup. When detectives asked each man in the lineup to repeat the words, ""Give me all your money or I'll shoot"", the man shouted, ""That's not what I said!""<br /> (Turns out, the witness was Blonde and didn't pick him!)</p>
<p>NOT THE SHARPEST KNIFE IN THE DRAWER!<br /> In Modesto, CA, Steven Richard King was arrested for trying to hold up a Bank of America branch without a weapon.

34833,"<p>There once was a lawyer who was so fanatical about his golf game that he used to play every day without fail. One morning he had played the first hole and was just about to tee off on the second, when he saw the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen putting on the first.<br /> The lawyer waited until the woman had reached the second tee and asked if she would like to join him and they could finish the round together. To his surprise the woman agreed and they played the remaining holes. Not only was this woman beautiful, she was also a good golfer. </p>
<p>When they completed their round, the lawyer told the woman that, not only was he a lawyer, but he was also a cordon bleu chef and wine buff. He invited her back to his place for a meal and a few drinks. The woman accepted enthusiastically and off they went. Back at the house the lawyer cooked a magnificent meal. In fact it was more than just cooking it was a performance to behold. They enjoyed good food, good wine and good conversation. </p>
<p>After the meal, the woman repaid the lawyer with the best oral sex he had ever experienced. The lawyer was so taken by the beauty and skill of this woman and desired her no end. He then asked if she would like to play golf the following morning, to which she agreed. Once again they enjoyed a great game of golf, a magnificent evening meal and once more the woman performed sensational oral sex on the lawyer. </p>
<p>This went on for three weeks when the lawyer finally said to the woman, ""Listen, the golf and the company have been fantastic! But, there are only so many performances a man can take. When are we going to have sexual intercourse?"" </p>
<p>""We can't,"" said the woman. ""Why not?"" came the reply. ""Because I'm a transvestite"" replied the woman. </p>
<p>""YOU BITCH!"" screamed the lawyer, ""...I CAN'T BELIEVE that you've been playing off the LADIES TEE FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS!""</p>

<p>Quickly I realized she'd probably wake up, so I cuckooed another nine times and was really proud of myself for having the quick-wittedness, even when pissed, to escape a possible conflict.</p>
<p>Next morning the missus asked me what time I got in and I told her midnight. </p>
<p>Whew, got away with that one! She then told me that we needed a new cuckoo clock. </p>
<p>When I asked her why, she said,<br /> 'Well, at 3 am this morning, it cuckooed three times, paused, said bollocks, Cuckooed another four times, farted, cuckooed another three times, paused, cleared its throat and cuckooed twice, then giggled for over three minutes.'</p>
<p>'I think it's stuffed, don't you?'</p>

34875,"<p>The beautiful secretary of the president of the Chase Manhattan Bank<br /> goes on a sight-seeing tour with a very rich Taiwanese client.  The client<br /> out of the blue asks her to marry him. Naturally, the secretary is quite taken<br /> aback.  However, she remembers what her boss told her; ""Don't reject the<br /> guy outright.""</p>
<p> So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting<br /> to marry her.   So, after a few minutes, the woman says to the man, ""I will<br /> only marry you under three conditions.  First, I want my engagement ring to<br /> be a 75 carat diamond ring, with a matching 200 carat diamond tiara.""  The<br /> Taiwanese man pauses for awhile.  Then, he nods his head and says ""No<br /> problem!! I buy. I buy.""</p>

A sure-to-work condition.  She squints her eyes, looks at the man<br /> and says, rather coldly, ""Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a<br /> 12-inch penis.""   The man seems a bit disturbed.  He cups his face with his<br /> hands and rests his elbows on the table.  All the while, he's uttering<br /> something in Chinese.

<p>1) No matter how hard you try, you can't baptize cats.<br /> 2) When your Mom is mad at your Dad, don't let her brush your<br /> hair.<br /> 3) If your sister hits you, don't hit her back.

Sometimes age comes alone. </p>

34894,"<p>Ever wonder how the seven dwarves got their names?</p>
<p>Miss Snow White was a randy cow,<br /> And desperate for a fuck.<br /> So off she went into the woods,<br /> To try and get some luck!</p>
<p>She'd almost given up looking,<br /> When she saw some chimney smoke.<br /> Then stumbled on a cottage,<br /> And went in for a poke.</p>
<p>Her clothes came off in seconds.<br /> And she'd just removed her pants,<br /> When seven Dwarves came marching in,<br /> With a merry song and dance.</p>
<p>Snow White just stood there speechless,<br /> And thought she was in heaven!<br /> Originally after one good shag,<br /> But now she could have seven.</p>
<p>Straight away she took command,<br /> ""My fanny need a lick!""<br /> And when one dwarf moved forward,<br /> She said ""Oi-you'd better drop you pick!""</p>
<p>So down he went onto all fours,<br /> And said ""I ain't licking that!""<br /> ""Not there, that me arse-hole,<br /> You DOPEY little brat!""</p>
<p>The next dwarf started blushing,<br /> ""Do we have to do it here?""<br /> Snow White said ""Don't be BASHFUL!<br /> Unless you're fucking queer!""</p>
<p>So reluctantly he whipped it out,<br /> To prove he was no fool.<br /> And Snow White gave a big ""Heigh-Ho""<br /> As she rode upon his tool.</p>
<p>Now one dwarf wasn't smiling,<br /> 'Cos he hadn't had a sniff.<br /> And due to his impatience,<br /> He couldn't raise a stiff.</p>
<p>""Relax, you GRUMPY bastard"",<br /> So he did as he was told.<br /> And as soon as he was hard enough,<br /> He shot his fucking load.</p>
<p>The next dwarf got a blow job,<br /> And she took him in quite easy.<br /> But she just avoided brain-damage,<br /> Whe he sneezed, she called him SNEEZY.</p>
<p>With three dwarves left, she turned and said,<br /> ""You're next, I want your knob!""<br /> But no sooner had he entered her,<br /> Than he was sleeping on the job.</p>
<p>""Wake up you SLEEPY idiot""<br /> She wanted more from him.<br /> And he woke with such excitement,<br /> That he filled her hairy quim.</p>
<p>The next dwarf rammed his up her,<br /> And shagged her fanny raw.<br /> And dazed Snow White then whimpered,<br /> ""That should be against the law!""</p>
<p>He made poor Snow White tremble,<br /> He was so big and thick.<br /> ""No wonder you're so HAPPY,<br /> With that fucking great big dick.""</p>
<p>With one dwarf still remaining,<br /> But feeling rather sore,<br /> She said ""You'll have to use your tongue,<br /> My clit can't take no more.!""</p>
<p>And so he put his tongue to work,<br /> Where others had put their cocks.<br /> And 'cos he made Snow White feel better,<br /> She named the last one DOC.</p>
<p>Now Snow White couldn't do much,<br /> With all that cum inside her quim,<br /> So she grabbed a cup, and squatted,<br /> And filled it to the brim.</p>
<p>So there's the truth about the dwarves,<br /> And how they got their names,<br /> By satisfying miss Snow White,<br /> And joining in her games.<br /> There's one more thing you need to know,<br /> And that's what happened to that cup?</p>
<p>Well think of what you're drinking...</p>

One day they decide that they want to get married, so Johnny goes to Susie's father to ask him for her hand. Johnny bravely walks up to him and says ""Mr. Smith, me and Susie are in love and I want to ask you for her hand in marriage."" Thinking that this was the cutest thing, Mr. Smith replies, ""Well Johnny, you are only 10. Where will you two live?"" Without even taking a moment to think about it, Johnny replies ""In Susie's room. It's bigger than mine and we can both fit there nicely."" Still thinking this is just adorable, Mr. Smith says with a huge grin, ""Okay then how will you live? You're not old enough to get a job. You'll need to support Susie."" Again, Johnny instantly replies, ""Our allowance... Susie makes 5 bucks a week and I make 10 bucks a week. That's about 60 bucks a month, and that should do us just fine."" By this time Mr. Smith is a little shocked that Johnny has put so much thought into this. So, he thinks for a moment trying to come up with something that Johnny won't have an answer to. After a second, Mr. Smith says, ""Well Johnny, it seems like you have got everything all figured out. I just have one more question for you. What will you do if the two of you should have little ones of your own?"" Johnny just shrugs his shoulders and says, ""Well, we've been lucky so far...""  submitted by: Lisa</p>

34921,"<p>I was riding to work yesterday when I observed a female driver cut right in front of a pickup truck causing him to have to drive on to the shoulder to avoid hitting her. </p>
<p>This evidently angered the driver enough that he hung his arm out his window and flipped the woman off. ""Man, that guy is stupid"" I thought to myself. </p>
<p>I ALWAYS smile nicely and wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything to me in traffic and here's why: I drive 48 miles each way every day to work, that's 96 miles each day. </p>
<p>Of these, 16 miles each way is bumper-to-bumper. Most of the bumper-to-bumper is on an 8 lane highway so if you just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass something like a new car every 40 feet per lane. </p>
<p>That's 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars. Even though the rest of the 32 miles is not bumper to bumper, I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. </p>
<p>That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass every day. </p>
<p>Statistically, half of these are driven by females, that's 18,000. In any given group of females, 1 in 28 has PMS.That's 642. </p>
<p>According to Cosmopolitan, 70% describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding. That's 449. </p>
<p>According to the National Institute of Health, 22% of all females have seriously considered suicide or homicide. That's 98. And 34% describe men as their biggest problem. That's 33. </p>
<p>According to the National Rifle Association 5% of all females carry weapons and this number is increasing. </p>
<p>That means that EVERY SINGLE DAY<br /> I drive past at least one female that has...<br /> a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, has PMS, and is ARMED! </p>

34922,"<p>There was this lady (who was a butcher) whose husband always farted really loud at night! She hated it because they stunk so badly! So one night she told her husband that if he kept farting like that at night, then his guts would come out.  He didn't believe her but she told him, ""Honey, I'm a butcher. I should know.""</p>
<p>But he still wouldn't listen to her.  So that night she went to her butcher shop and got a big chunk of raw pig guts.  When she got home she stuck it in her husbands pants.  And of course, he farted really loudly as usual. The next morning when they woke up her husband went to the bathroom.  He was in there for a pretty long time so his wife said to him, ""Honey, is everything okay. You've been in there for a while.""</p>
<p>He replied, ""Yeah, everything's fine.""</p>
<p>5 minutes later he finally came out of the bathroom.  His wife asked him, ""So did your guts come out like I said they would?""</p>
<p>He replied, ""Yep, but being the smart person I am, I took two fingers and stuck them right back up there!""</p>

34933,"<p>A group of girlfriends is on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads: ""For Women Only"". Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in.</p>
<p>The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works...<br /> ""We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. It's easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you what's inside.""</p>
<p>So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads:<br /> ""All the men on this floor are short and plain."" The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor.</p>
<p>The sign on the second floor reads: ""All the men here are short and handsome.""<br /> Still, this isn't good enough, so the friends continue on up.</p>
<p>They reach the third floor and the sign reads: ""All the men here are tall and plain.""</p>
<p>They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up.</p>
<p>On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect: ""All the men here are tall and handsome.""</p>
<p>The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor.</p>
<p>There they find a sign that reads: ""There are no men here.<br /> This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman!</p>

<p>As he sits down, a man comes down and asks if anyone is sitting in the seat next to him.</p>
<p>""No,"" he says, ""The seat is empty.""</p>
<p>""This is incredible,"" said the man.</p>
<p>""Who in their right mind would have a seat like this for the Super Bowl, the biggest sporting event in the world, and not use it?""</p>

34938,"<p>On a beautiful deserted island in the middle of nowhere, the following people are stranded: </p>
<p>* 2 Italian men and 1 Italian woman<br /> * 2 French men and 1 French woman<br /> * 2 German men and 1 German woman<br /> * 2 Greek men and 1 Greek woman<br /> * 2 English men and 1 English woman<br /> * 2 Polish men and 1 Polish woman<br /> * 2 Japanese men and 1 Japanese woman<br /> * 2 Australian men and 1 Australian woman<br /> * 2 New Zealander men and 1 New Zealander woman<br /> * 2 Irish men and 1 Irish woman<br /> * 2 American men and 1 American woman </p>
<p>One month later, the following things have occurred... </p>
<p>* One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman.</p>
<p>* The two French men and the French woman are living happily together.</p>
<p>* The two German men keep a strict weekly schedule of when each is allowed to spend time with the German woman. </p>
<p>*The two Greek men have the Greek woman cooking and cleaning for them. </p>
<p>* The two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman. </p>
<p>* The Polish men took a long look at the endless ocean and one look at the Polish woman and they started swimming. </p>
<p>* The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are waiting for instructions. </p>
<p>* The two Australian men beat each other senseless fighting over the Australian woman, who is busy checking out all the other men.</p>
<p>* Both New Zealand men are searching the island for sheep to clothe their women. </p>
<p>* The Irish divided the island into North and South and are setting up a distillery. </p>
<p>* The American woman keeps ranting about the true nature of feminism, how she can do everything that men can do, about the necessity of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how her last boyfriend respected her opinions and treated her much nicer and how her relationship with her mother is improving. The two American men have joined the Polish men who are swimming out to sea.</p>

34946,"<p>Four married guys go golfing on Sunday. During the 3rd hole the following conversation ensued:First Guy: ""Man, you have no idea what I had to do to be able to come out golfing this weekend. I had to promise my wife that I will paint every room in the house next weekend.""Second Guy: ""That's nothing, I had to promise my wife that I will build her a new deck for the pool.""Third Guy: ""Man, you both have it easy! I had to promise my wife that I will remodel the kitchen for her.""They continue to play the hole when they realized that the fourth guy has not said a word. So they ask him. ""You haven't said anything about what you had to do to be able to come golfing this weekend. What's the deal?""Fourth Guy: ""That's easy! I just set my alarm for 5:30am. When it goes off, I shut off my alarm, give the wife a poke. 'Golf Course or Intercourse?', I ask. She says, 'Wear your sweater.'""</p>
"
34947,"<p>Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the ""in-flight safety lecture"" and their other announcements a bit more entertaining. Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:</p>
<p>""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane...""</p>
<p>After landing: ""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.""</p>
<p>As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, A lone voice came over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella. WHOA!""</p>
<p>After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: ""Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted.""</p>
<p>From a Southwest Airlines employee... ""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt, and if  you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised.</p>
<p>""In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it  over  your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your  mask  before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two or more  small  children, decide now which one you love more.""</p>
<p>""Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but we'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest Airlines."" ""</p>
<p>Your seat cushions can be used for flotation, and in the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments.""</p>
<p>Once on a Southwest flight, the pilot said, ""We've reached our cruising altitude now, and I'm turning off the seat belt sign. I'm switching to autopilot, too, so I can come back there and visit with all of you for the rest of the flight.""</p>
<p>""Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting children or adults acting like children.""</p>
<p>""As you exit the plane, make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses. And the last one off the plane must clean it.""</p>
<p>And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased to Have some of the best flight attendants in the industry... unfortunately, none of them are on this flight...!""</p>
<p>Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City: The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, ""That was quite a bump and I know what ya'll are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't  the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendants' fault... it was the asphalt!""</p>
<p>Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach the Captain was really having to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA and announced, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate!""</p>
<p>Another flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We  ask  you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.""</p>
<p>After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant Came on  with, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Capt. Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.""</p>
<p>Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of us here at US Airways.""</p>

34948,"<p>A man arrives at the gates of heaven. St. Peter asks, ""Religion?""<br /> The man says, ""Methodist.""<br /> St. Peter looks down his list, and says, ""Go to room 24, but be very quiet as<br /> you pass room 8.""<br /> Another man arrives at the gates of heaven. ""Religion?""<br /> ""Baptist.""<br /> ""Go to room 18, but be very quiet as you pass room 8.""<br /> A third man arrives at the gates. ""Religion?""<br /> ""Jewish."" ""Go to room 11, but be very quiet as you pass room 8.""<br /> The man says, ""I can understand there being different rooms for different<br /> religions, but why must I be quiet when I pass room 8?""<br /> St. Peter tells him, ""Well the Catholics are in room 8, and they think they're<br /> the only ones here.""</p>
"
34949,"<p>Everybody I know who has a dog usually calls him ""Rover"" or ""Boy."" I call mine ""Sex.""Now, Sex has been very embarrassing to me.When I went to the City Hall to renew his dog license, I told the clerk that I would like a license for Sex. He said, ""I'd like to have one too."" Then I said, ""You don't understand. I've had Sex since I was nine years old."" He said, ""You must have been quite a kid!""When I decided to get married, I told the minister that I would like to have Sex at the wedding. He told me to wait until after the wedding was over. I said, ""But Sex has played a big part in my life and my whole world revolves around Sex."" He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. I told him everyone would enjoy having Sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the Justice of the Peace. My family is barred from the church from then on.When I got married and went on my honeymoon, I took the dog with me. I told the hotel clerk that I wanted a room for my wife and me, and a special room for Sex. He said, ""Every room in the place is for sex."" I said, ""You don't understand. Sex keeps me awake at night."" The clerk said, ""Me too.""One day I entered Sex in a contest, but before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him I had planned to have Sex in the contest. He told me that I should have sold tickets. ""But you don't understand,"" I said, ""I had hoped to have Sex on T.V."" He called me a show-off.When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, ""Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married."" The judge said, ""Me too."" Then I told him that after I was married, Sex left me. He said, ""Me too.""Last night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking around town for him. A cop came over to me and asked, ""What are you doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning?"" I said, ""I'm looking for Sex.""Well now I've been thrown in jail, been divorced and had more damn troubles with that dog than I ever foresaw. Why just the other day when I went for my first session with the psychiatrist, she asked me, ""What seems to be the trouble?"" I replied, ""Sex has been my best friend all my life but now it has left me forever. I couldn't live any longer so lonely,"" And the doctor said, ""Look mister, you should understand that sex isn't a man's best friend, so get yourself a dog.""</p>

My parents will see us!"" ""Oh come on! Who's gonna see us at this hour?"" ""No, please. Can you imagine if we get caught ""Oh come on! There's nobody around, they're all sleeping!"" ""No way.

"
34953,"<p>1. Men like to barbecue. Men will cook if danger is involved. </p>
<p>2. Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage. They've experienced pain and bought jewelry. </p>
<p>3. Marrying a divorced man is ecologically responsible. In a world where there are more women than men, it pays to recycle. </p>
<p>4. Men are very confident people. My husband is so confident that when he watches sports on television, he thinks that if he concentrates he can help his team. If the team is in trouble, he coaches the players from our living room, and if they're really in trouble, I have to get off the phone in case they call him. </p>
<p>5. Men like phones with lots of buttons. It makes them feel important. </p>
<p>6. Men love to be the first to read the newspaper in the morning. Not being the first is upsetting to their psyches. </p>
<p>7. All men are afraid of eyelash curlers. I sleep with one under my pillow, instead of a gun. </p>
<p>8. A good place to meet a man is at the dry cleaner. These men usually have jobs and bathe. </p>
<p>9. All men hate to hear, ""We need to talk about our relationship."" These seven words strike fear in the heart of even General Schwarzkopf. </p>
<p>10. Men are sensitive in strange ways. If a man has built a fire and the last log does not burn, he will take it personally. </p>
<p>11. Men have an easier time buying bathing suits. Women have two types: depressing and more depressing. Men have two types: nerdy and not nerdy. </p>
<p>12. Men have higher body temperatures than women. If your heating goes out in winter, I recommend sleeping next to a man. Men are like portable heaters that snore. </p>
<p>13. Women take clothing much more seriously than men. I've never seen a man walk into a party and say ""Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed; get me out of here. There's another man wearing a black tuxedo."" </p>
<p>14. Most men hate to shop. That's why the men's department is usually on the first floor of a department store, two inches from the door. </p>
<p>15. If a man prepares dinner for you and the salad contains three or more types of lettuce, you should be worried about him. </p>
<p>16. No man is charming all of the time. Even Cary Grant is on record saying he wished he could be Cary Grant. </p>
<p>17. When four or more men get together, they talk about sports. </p>
<p>18. When four or more women get together, they talk about men. </p>
<p>19. Men are less sentimental than women. No man has ever seen the movie ""The Way We Were"" twice, voluntarily. </p>
<p>20. Most women are introspective: ""Am I in love? Am I emotionally and creatively fulfilled?"" Most men are outrospective: ""Did my team win? How's my car?"" </p>
<p>21. If a man says, ""I'll call you,"" and he doesn't, he didn't forget. He didn't lose your number. He didn't die. He just didn't want to call you. </p>
<p>22. Getting rid of a man without hurting his masculinity is a problem. ""Get out"" and ""I never want to see you again"" might sound like a challenge. If you want to get rid of a man, I suggest saying, ""I love you; I want to marry you; I want to have your children."" Sometimes they leave so fast, they leave skid marks. </p>
<p>23. Men are self confident because they grow up identifying with super heroes. Women have bad self images because they grow up identifying with Barbie. </p>
<p>24. Male menopause is a lot more fun than female menopause. With female menopause you gain weight and get hot flashes. With male menopause, you get to date young girls and drive motorcycles. </p>
<p>25. Men forget everything; women remember everything. That's why men need instant replays in sports. They've already forgotten what happened. </p>

34957,"<p>Is Windows A Virus? No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses do:</p>
<p>1. They replicate quickly -- okay, Windows does that.</p>
<p>2. Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as they do so -- okay, Windows does that.</p>
<p>3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk -- okay, Windows does that, too.</p>
<p>4. Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable programs and systems. Sigh...Windows does that, too.</p>
<p>5. Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware. Yup, that's with Windows, too. </p>
<p>Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences: Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most systems, their program code is fast, compact and efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they mature.</p>
<p>So, Windows is *not* a virus. It's a BUG!</p>

34965,"<p>TO: Honorable Secretary of Agriculture </p>
<p>Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>Dear Sir; </p>
<p>My friend, Ed Peterson, over at Wells Iowa, received a check for $1,000 from the government for not raising hogs.  So, I want to go into the ""not raising hogs"" business next year. What I want to know is, in your opinion, what is the best kind of farm not to raise hogs on, and what is the best breed of hogs not to raise?  </p>
<p>I want to be sure that I approach this endeavor in keeping with all governmental policies.  I would prefer not to raise razorbacks, but if that is not a good breed not to raise, then I will just as gladly not raise Yorkshires or Durocs. As I see it, the hardest part of this program will be in keeping an accurate inventory of how many hogs I haven't raised. </p>
<p>My friend, Peterson, is very joyful about the future of the business. He has been raising hogs for twenty years or so, and the best he ever made on them was $422 in 1968, until this year when he got your check for $1000 for not raising hogs. If I get $1000 for not raising 50 hogs, will I get $2000 for not raising 100 hogs?  I plan to operate on a small scale at first, holding myself down to about 4000 hogs not raised, which will mean about $80,000 the first year.  Then I can afford an airplane. </p>
<p>Now another thing, these hogs I will not raise will not eat 100,000 bushels of corn.   I understand that you also pay farmers for not raising corn and wheat.  Will I qualify for payments for not raising wheat and corn not to feed the 4000 hogs I am not going to raise? </p>
<p>Also, I am considering the ""not milking cows"" business, so send me any information you have on that too. In view of these circumstances, you understand that I will be totally unemployed and plan to file for unemployment and food stamps. Be assured you will have my tote in the coming election.</p>
<p>Patriotically Yours, </p>

34968,"<p>The ambassador of a small African nation chanced to visit Russia, and was<br /> entertained by his opposite number, the Russian ambassador. For three days, the<br /> African ambassador was wined, dined, and generally treated to the best<br /> hospitality that Russia had to offer.<br /> On the final day of his visit, the Russian ambassador said, ""As your stay is<br /> coming to an end, it is time for you to play our traditional game, Russian<br /> roulette. One of the six chambers of this gun is loaded - you spin the cylinder,<br /> point the gun at your head, and pull the trigger.""<br /> This fazed the African slightly, but he was a proud man of a warrior people,<br /> and to show fear would be unthinkable. Both men took their guns, spun, and<br /> pulled the triggers. CLICK-CLICK Both chambers were empty, and both ambassadors<br /> breathed a sigh of relief.<br /> The African ambassador was much impressed with the courageous game, and<br /> thought hard about the subject before the Russian Ambassador was due to visit<br /> his country the next year.<br /> When the visit came, the African ambassador treated the Russian with all<br /> hospitality, until the final day of his stay. Leading him to a private room in<br /> the palace, the African ambassador spoke, ""Now it is time for you to sample our<br /> game, African roulette"". So saying, he led the Russian into the room, the only<br /> occupants of which were six beautiful, naked women.<br /> The African ambassador said, ""These women are the most beautiful members of<br /> one of our tribes. Any one of them will give you a blowjob - take your pick.""<br /> The Russian was not entirely averse to this idea, but he couldn't see the<br /> connection with Russian Roulette. He said, ""Well, ok, great, but where's the<br /> roulette part? Where's the danger?""<br /> With a big grin on his face, the African ambassador answered: ""One of them is<br /> a cannibal.""</p>
