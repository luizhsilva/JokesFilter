27023,"<p>And the Lord spoke to Noah and said: ""In six months I'm going to make it rain until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people are destroyed. But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind ofliving thing on the planet. I am ordering you to build Me an Ark.""</p>
<p>And in a flash of lightning he delivered the specifications for an Ark. ""OK,"" said Noah, trembling in fear and fumbling with the blueprints. ""Six months, and it starts to rain,"" thundered the Lord. ""You'd better have my Ark completed, or learn how to swim for a very long time."" And six months passed. The skies began to cloud up and rain began to fall.</p>
<p>The Lord saw that Noah was sitting in his front yard, weeping. And there  was no Ark. ""Noah,"" shouted the Lord, ""where is my Ark?"" A lightning bolt crashed into the ground next to Noah.</p>
<p>""Lord, please forgive me!"" begged Noah. ""I did my best. But there were big problems. First I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction project, and your plans didn't meet code. So I had to hire an engineer to redraw the plans. Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark needed a fire sprinkler system. My neighbors objected, claiming I was violating zoning by building the Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city planning commission.</p>
<p>Then I had a big problem getting enough wood for the Ark because there was a ban on cutting trees to save the Spotted Owl. I had to convince U.S. Fish and Wildlife that I needed the wood to save the owls. But they wouldn't let me catch any owls. So no owls.</p>
<p>Then the carpenters formed a union and went out on strike. I had to negotiate a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board before anyone would pick up a saw or a hammer. Now we have 16 carpenters going on the boat, and still no owls.</p>
<p>Then I started gathering up animals, and got sued by an animal rights group. They objected to me taking only two of each kind. Just when I got the suit dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn't complete the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your proposed flood. They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being.</p>
<p>Then the Army Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the Proposed new flood plain. I sent them a globe.</p>
<p>Right now I'm still trying to resolve a complaint from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over how many Croatians I'm supposed to hire, the IRS has seized all my assets claiming I'm trying to avoid paying taxes by leaving the country, and I just got a notice from the state about owing some kind of use tax. I really don't think I can finish your Ark for at least another five years,"" Noah wailed.</p>
<p>The sky began to clear. The sun began to shine. A rainbow arched across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled. ""You mean you're not going to destroy the earth?"" Noah asked, hopefully.</p>
<p>""No,"" said the Lord sadly, ""Government already has.""</p>

27053,"<p>About ten years ago, a young and very successful businessman named Josh was travelling down a chicago neighborhood street. </p>
<p>He was going a bit too fast in his sleek, black, 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE, which was only two months old. </p>
<p>He was watching for kids darting out from in between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something.</p>
<p>As his car passed, no child darted out, but a brick sailed out and whomp! It smashed into the jag's shiny black side door! SCREECH!!! Brakes slammed, gears ground into reverse, and tires madly spun the Jaguar back to the spot from where the brick had been thrown.</p>
<p>Josh jumped out of the car and grabbed the kid and pushed him up against a parked car. He shouted at the kid, ""What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing?"" </p>
<p>Building up a head of steam he went on, ""That's my new jag, that brick you just threw is gonna cost you a lot of money. Why did you throw it?"" </p>
<p>""Please, mister, please...I'm sorry! I didn't know what else to do!"" pleaded the youngster. ""I threw the brick because no one else would stop!"" </p>
<p>Tears were dripping down the young boys chin as he pointed around the parked car. ""It's my brother, mister,"" he said ""he rolled off the curb and fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up."" </p>
<p>Sobbing, the boy asked the excutive, ""Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me.""</p>
<p>Moved beyond words, the young excutive tried desperately to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. </p>
<p>Straining, he lifted the young man back into his wheelchair and took out his handkerchief and wiped the scraped and cuts, checking to see if everything was going to be ok. </p>
<p>He then watched the younger brother push him down the sidewalk toward their home.</p>
<p>It was a long walk back to sleek, black, shining 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE, a long and slow walk. </p>
<p>Josh never did fix the dint in the door of his jaguar. He kept the dent as a constant reminder not to go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at him to get his attention.</p>
<p>Some bricks are softer than others!!</p>

27056,"<p>A guy walks into a bar with his pet monkey. He orders a drink and while he's drinking it the monkey jumps around all over the place. The monkey grabs some olives off the bar and eats them, then grabs some sliced limes and eats them, then jumps up on the pool table, grabs the cue ball, sticks it in his mouth and swallows it whole. </p>
<p>The bartender screams at the guy, ""Did you see what your monkey just did?"" </p>
<p>The guy says, ""No, what?"" </p>
<p>""He just ate the cue ball off my pool table, whole!"", says the bartender.</p>
<p>""Yeah, that doesn't surprise me,"" replied the patron. ""He eats everything in sight, the little bastard. I'll pay for the cue ball and stuff."" </p>
<p>He finishes his drink, pays his bill, and leaves. Two weeks later he's in the bar again, and he has his monkey with him. He orders a drink and the monkey starts running around the bar again. While the man is drinking his drink, the monkey finds a maraschino cherry on the bar. He grabs it, sticks it up his ass, pulls it out, and eats it. </p>
<p>The bartender is disgusted. ""Did you see what your monkey did now?"", he asks. </p>
<p>""Now what?"", responds the patron. </p>
<p>""Well, he stuck a maraschino cherry up his ass, then pulled it out and ate it!"" says the barkeeper. </p>
<p>""Yeah, that doesn't surprise me,"" replied the patron. ""He still eats everything in sight, but ever since he ate that damn cue ball he measures everything first!""</p>

27069,"<p>An poor old farmer was on his deathbed when he called his<br /> three teenage sons into his room.  He beckoned them to come<br /> close.<br />     ""Sons,"" he said in hardly a whisper, ""I am very old; I am<br /> about to die.  You know that we are certainly not rich.  I have<br /> very little to will to you, only the land we are living on.  But<br /> here's the problem: I can only leave it to one of you.""<br />     The three sons looked at each other.<br />     ""So,"" the farmer continued, ""I have decided on a course of<br /> action.  Each of you will take one of the three identical ducks<br /> that hatched last year.  You will go to market and sell the<br /> duck, and come back here.  Whoever sells their duck for the most<br /> money gets the property.""<br />     So the three sons go to the barnyard and each picks up a<br /> duck.  Then they all walk down to market, where they split up,<br /> in search of a buyer.<br />     The first, youngest son goes to the butcher and sells his<br /> duck for ten dollars.<br />     The middle son sells his duck to the pillowmaker for twenty<br /> dollars.<br />     The oldest, 19 year old son, Andrew, is walking down the<br /> street, musing about where to best sell his duck.  Suddenly he<br /> sees an absolutely gorgeous 18 year old girl in a daring, very<br /> short dress.  He is mesmerized by her swaying, tantalizing hips<br /> and full, almost completely exposed breasts.  He crosses the<br /> street and confronts her.<br />     ""Oh, what an adorable pet!"" she cries, stroking the duck.<br />     ""I'm selling it,"" Andrew exclaims to her cleavage.  The girl<br /> doesn't notice this, she is petting the duck.<br />     ""I would love to buy it,"" she says wistfully, ""but I don't<br /> have any money.""  Suddenly she stands up, flipping her long,<br /> golden locks over her shoulder invitingly.  ""Unless, of course,<br /> you would be willing to accept some other form of payment.""  She<br /> steps very close to Andrew, who was quite good-looking himself.<br />     ""Sure,"" Andrew squeaks, and together they walk to the motel.<br /> After nearly an hour of physical bliss and multiple spasms,<br /> Andrew lay exhausted on the bed.  The girl turned to him and<br /> tried to start up again, but the son held up a hand and panted,<br />     ""Sorry, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I can't take<br /> any more.  I am spent!""<br />     The girl looked stricken and cried, ""Oh, no, please, just<br /> one more time!  You are incredible!"" Her voice had a seductive<br /> hunger in it that made Andrew want to go over it again, but he<br /> knew his penis could not take any more for a while.  So he got<br /> up and, shaking, dressed.  As he closed the motel room door, he<br /> glanced at the girl, still lying sensuously on the bed.<br />     Leaving the motel, he suddenly realized, ""I'm supposed to be<br /> selling that duck for money!  I need that duck to get the farm!""<br />     So Andrew dashed into the motel and headed up the stairs to<br /> the room he had just left.  He burst through the door, just as<br /> the girl got up off the bed.  She stood there, the very<br /> goddess-like image of femininity, and he was very glad to do<br /> what he had to do.<br />     ""Will you give me the duck back if we do it again?""<br />     In response, the girl attacked him like a lioness, tearing<br /> off his clothes and pulling him forcefully down onto the bed.<br /> It was heaven all over again, and he stayed there for over an<br /> hour this time, thrusting his manhood into her pussy over and<br /> over again, the whole time feeling her all over and kissing her.<br /> By the time they finished, Andrew wasn't sure if he would ever<br /> be able to use his penis again.  Glancing at the shaking,<br /> sweating girl, he knew he would, but not for a while.  So he got<br /> up for good this time, and the girl did not ask him to stay.<br /> She couldn't speak.<br />     When he was dressed, he took the duck and walked outside<br /> into the sunlight.  Just as he was crossing the road, the duck<br /> flapped out of his arms and was hit by a bus.  The bus driver<br /> stopped and got out.<br />     ""Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!"" he said.  ""I will pay you for<br /> that duck.  Let me see..."" he reached into his pocket and<br /> brought out some money.  He counted it.  ""Will twenty-eight<br /> dollars be enough?""<br />     ""I guess so,"" said Andrew, and took the money and went home.<br />     He was the last one to arrive, not surprisingly.  Finally he<br /> entered the room where his father and two younger sons were<br /> waiting.<br />     ""Well,"" said the father, ""Timmy has sold his duck for ten<br /> dollars, and Greg for twenty dollars.  How about you?""<br />     ""Well, father:<br />                   I got a fuck for a duck,<br />                   And a duck for a fuck,<br />                   And twenty-eight dollars<br />                   for a fucked-up duck!""</p>

The man<br /> says, ""You don't understand. I have two brothers, one in Australia and one in<br /> the States. We made a vow to each other that every Saturday night we'd still<br /> drink together.

27081,"<p>It was spring in the old west.<br /> The cowboys rode the still snow choked trails looking for cattle that survived the winter. </p>
<p>As one cowboy's horse went around the narrow trail, it came upon a rattlesnake warming itself in the spring sunshine. The horse reared and the cowboy drew his six-gun to shoot the snake. </p>
<p>""Hold on there, partner,"" said the snake, ""don't shoot- I'm an enchanted rattlesnake, and if you don't shoot me, I'll give you any three wishes you want."" </p>
<p>The cowboy decided to take a chance. He knew he was safely out of the snake's striking range. He said, ""OK, first, I'd like to have a face like Clark Gable, then, I'd like a build like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and finally, I'd like sexual equipment like this here horse I'm riding."" </p>
<p>The rattlesnake said, ""All right, when you get back to the bunk house you'll have all three wishes."" </p>
<p>The cowboy turned his horse around and galloped at full speed all the way to the bunk house. He dismounted on the run and went straight inside to the mirror. </p>
<p>Staring back at him in the mirror was the face of Clark Gable. </p>
<p>He ripped the shirt off his back and revealed bulging, rippling muscles, just like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Really excited now, he tore down his jeans, looked at his crotch and shouted... </p>

The farmer ushered me to a chair and brought me a tall glass of corn liquor.  His wife insisted on fixing me a huge feast to eat.  The farmers boy shined my shoes and got me a pipe of really good tobacco to smoke.  Then the farmer's daughter came in dressed in a short skirt, sat on my lap and offered to take me in her bedroom.  We had great sex.  'When I came back out, they were all even friendlier than before. I tried to leave twice before I was finally able to get out of there.'Rush looks at him incredulously and asks, 'What exactly did you tell them when you first went in?'. The driver says, 'I told them that I was Rush Limbaugh's driver and that I just ran over the pig.'.</p>

27133,"<p>Era un concurso  internacional a ver quien de un pedo aventaba m�s lejos un cad�ver. Se inscribieron un gringo, un italiano y un mexicano. Para prepararse quince d�as antes del concurso, los tres se pusieron un tap�n.</p>
<p>El gringo comenz� a comer hot dogs, hamburguesas y ham and eggs; el italiano comi� pizzas, espagueti y ravioli; el mexicano se atasc� de frijoles, garnachas y tacos de todos tipos. Y empezaron a agarrar presi�n para el d�a del concurso.</p>
<p>Llego el d�a y el primero que pas� fue el gringo. Se puso en posici�n, le colocaron el cad�ver, se quit� el tap�n y empezo a pujar. Se avent� un pedo y mand� el cad�ver a cinco metros. </p>
<p>Despu�s vino el italiano, se puso en posici�n, le pusieron el cadaver, se quit� el tap�n y empez� a pujar; se avent� un pedo y lanz� el cad�ver a siete metros. </p>
<p>Le toc� el turno al mexicano, se puso en posici�n, le pusieron el cadaver, se quit� el tap�n, y la porra gritando:  M�xico, M�xico, ra, ra, ra.  Y empez� el pinche mexicano a pujar, se puso colorado, se le inflaron los cachetes y hasta le salieron lagrimitas de los ojos, y la porra: Mexico, Mexico, ra, ra, ra, y nada que pod�a, hasta que por fin se oy� un peque�o piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii. Toda la gente se quedo at�nita, y en eso se par� el cad�ver, se tap� las narices y le dijo al mexicano: ""Chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiingas a tu madre"", se fue caminado y cay� a 20 metros, y con eso gan� el mexicano.</p>

She was hungry, so I brought her home and fed her some of the roast you had forgotten about in the refrigerator. Her shoes were worn out so I gave her a pair of your shoes you didn't wear because they were out of style. She was cold so I gave her that new birthday sweater you never wear because the color didn't suit you. Her slacks were worn out so I gave her a pair of yours that you don't fit into anymore.</p>

One day he decides to throw a huge party, and during the party he announces, ""My dear guests . . . I have a proposition to every man here. I will give one million dollars or my daughter to the man who can swim across this pool full of alligators and emerge alive!"" As soon as he finished his last word, there was the sound of a large splash!! There was one guy in the pool swimming with all he could and screaming out of fear. The crowd cheered him on as he kept stroking as though he was running for his life. Finally, he made it to the other side with only a torn shirt and some minor injuries. The millionaire was impressed. He said, ""My boy that was incredible! Fantastic! I didn't think it could be done! Well I must keep my end of the bargain. Do you want my daughter or the one million dollars?"" The guy says, ""Listen, I don't want your money, nor do I want your daughter! I want the person who pushed me in that water!""</p>

<p>DEAR SIR / MADAM, </p>
<p>I AM GEORGE WALKER BUSH, SON OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF<br /> AMERICA GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, AND CURRENTLY SERVING AS PRESIDENT OF THE<br /> UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. </p>
<p>THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE MET NEITHER IN PERSON NOR BY<br /> CORRESPONDENCE. I CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE<br /> PERSON TO HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS TRANSACTION, WHICH INVOLVES THE<br /> TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO AN ACCOUNT REQUIRING MAXIMUM CONFIDENCE. </p>
<p>I AM WRITING YOU IN ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE PRIMARILY TO SEEK YOUR ASSISTANCE IN<br /> ACQUIRING OIL FUNDS THAT ARE PRESENTLY TRAPPED IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ. MY<br /> PARTNERS AND I SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE IN COMPLETING A TRANSACTION BEGUN BY MY<br /> FATHER, WHO HAS LONG BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM IN THE<br /> UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND BRAVELY SERVED HIS COUNTRY AS DIRECTOR OF THE<br /> UNITED STATES CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. (CIA) </p>
<p>IN THE DECADE OF THE NINETEEN-EIGHTIES, MY FATHER, THEN VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE<br /> UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SOUGHT TO WORK WITH THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE PRESIDENT<br /> OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ TO REGAIN LOST OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING<br /> ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN. THIS UNSUCCESSFUL VENTURE WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY A<br /> FALLING OUT WITH HIS IRAQI PARTNER, WHO SOUGHT TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUE<br /> SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING EMIRATE OF KUWAIT, A WHOLLY-OWNED U.S.-BRITISH<br /> SUBSIDIARY. </p>
<p>MY FATHER RE-SECURED THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF KUWAIT IN 1991 AT A COST OF<br /> SIXTY-ONE BILLION U.S. DOLLARS ($61,000,000,000). OUT OF THAT COST, THIRTY-SIX<br /> BILLION DOLLARS ($36,000,000,000) WERE SUPPLIED BY HIS PARTNERS IN THE KINGDOM<br /> OF SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER PERSIAN GULF MONARCHIES, AND SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS<br /> ($16,000,000,000) BY GERMAN AND JAPANESE PARTNERS. BUT MY FATHER'S FORMER IRAQI<br /> BUSINESS PARTNER REMAINED IN CONTROL OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ITS PETROLEUM<br /> RESERVES. </p>
<p>MY FAMILY IS CALLING FOR YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE IN FUNDING THE REMOVAL OF THE<br /> PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ACQUIRING THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF HIS<br /> COUNTRY, AS COMPENSATION FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVING HIM FROM POWER. </p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PARTNERS FROM 1991 ARE NOT WILLING TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN<br /> OF THIS NEW VENTURE, WHICH IN ITS UPCOMING PHASE MAY COST THE SUM OF 100 BILLION<br /> TO 200 BILLION DOLLARS ($100,000,000,000 - $200,000,000,000), BOTH IN THE<br /> INITIAL ACQUISITION AND IN LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT. </p>
<p>WITHOUT THE FUNDS FROM OUR 1991 PARTNERS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE THE<br /> OIL REVENUE TRAPPED WITHIN IRAQ. THAT IS WHY MY FAMILY AND OUR COLLEAGUES ARE<br /> URGENTLY SEEKING YOUR GRACIOUS ASSISTANCE. </p>
<p>OUR DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES IN THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION INCLUDE THE SITTING<br /> VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RICHARD CHENEY, WHO IS AN<br /> ORIGINAL PARTNER IN THE IRAQ VENTURE AND FORMER HEAD OF THE HALLIBURTON OIL<br /> COMPANY, AND CONDOLEEZA RICE, WHOSE PROFESSIONAL DEDICATION TO THE VENTURE WAS<br /> DEMONSTRATED IN THE NAMING OF A CHEVRON OIL TANKER AFTER HER... </p>
<p>I WOULD BESEECH YOU TO TRANSFER A SUM EQUALING TEN TO TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT<br /> (10-25 %) OF YOUR YEARLY INCOME TO OUR ACCOUNT TO AID IN THIS IMPORTANT VENTURE.<br /> THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (IRS) WILL FUNCTION<br /> AS OUR TRUSTED INTERMEDIARY. I PROPOSE THAT YOU MAKE THIS TRANSFER BEFORE THE<br /> FIFTEENTH (15TH) OF THE MONTH OF APRIL. </p>
<p>I KNOW THAT A TRANSACTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD MAKE ANYONE APPREHENSIVE AND<br /> WORRIED. BUT I AM ASSURING YOU THAT ALL WILL BE WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY. A<br /> BOLD STEP TAKEN SHALL NOT BE REGRETTED, I ASSURE YOU. PLEASE DO BE INFORMED THAT<br /> THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO CO-OPERATE IN<br /> THIS TRANSACTION, PLEASE CONTACT OUR INTERMEDIARY REPRESENTATIVES TO FURTHER<br /> DISCUSS THE MATTER. </p>
<p>I PRAY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PLIGHT. MY FAMILY AND OUR COLLEAGUES WILL BE<br /> FOREVER GRATEFUL. PLEASE REPLY IN STRICT CONFIDENCE TO THE CONTACT NUMBERS<br /> BELOW. </p>

<p>On their way back home, a bag of money fell out of an armored car, practically landing at their feet. Sally quickly picked it up, but not sure what to do with it, they took it home. There, she counted the money--and it's fifty-thousand dollars.</p>

27168,"<p>A Visitors' Guide to Dallas, Texas<br /> (Life in America's fifth largest city) </p>
<p>1. You must learn to pronounce the city name. It is DAL-LUS, or<br /> DAA-LIS depending on if you live inside or outside LBJ Freeway. </p>
<p>2. Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Dallas has<br /> its own version of traffic rules....Hold on and pray. There is<br /> no such thing as a dangerous high-speed chase in Dallas. We all<br /> drive like that. </p>
<p>3. All directions start with, ""Go down to Beltline""...which has<br /> no beginning and no end. </p>
<p>4. The Chamber of Commerce calls getting through traffic a<br /> ""scenic drive."" </p>
<p>5. The morning rush hour is from 6:00 to 10:00. The evening rush<br /> hour is from 3:00 to 7:00. Friday's rush hour starts Thursday<br /> morning. </p>
<p>6. If you actually stop at a yellow light, you will be rear<br /> ended, cussed out and possibly shot. When you are the first one<br /> on the starting line, count to five when the light turns green<br /> before going to avoid getting into any cross-traffic's way. </p>
<p>7. Arapaho Road can only be pronounced by a native. The same<br /> holds true for Wycliff Avenue, Worcola Street, Sul Ross and<br /> Routh Street. </p>
<p>8. Construction on I-30 is a way of life and form of<br /> entertainment. </p>
<p>9. All unexplained sights are explained by the phrase, ""Oh,<br /> we're in Fort Worth!!"" </p>
<p>10. If someone actually has their turn signal on, it is probably<br /> a factory defect. </p>
<p>11. All old ladies with blue hair in pink Cadillacs have the<br /> right of way. </p>
<p>12. Story Road mysteriously changes names as you cross<br /> intersections. Unless you're on Storey Rd...... </p>
<p>13. If asking directions in Irving, you must have knowledge of<br /> Spanish. </p>
<p>14. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport has four terminal<br /> buildings connected by one tram that never works. </p>
<p>15. A trip across town (east to west) will take a minimum of<br /> four hours, although many north/south freeways have unposted<br /> minimum speeds of 75. The minimum acceptable speed on the Dallas<br /> North Toll Road is 85. Anything less is considered downright<br /> sissy. </p>
<p>16. The wrought iron on windows in and around Oak Cliff isn't<br /> ornamental. </p>
<p>17. Never stare at the driver of the car with the bumper sticker<br /> that says,""Keep honking. I'm reloading."" In fact, don't honk at<br /> anyone. Concealed weapons are a jealously guarded, God-given<br /> right. </p>
<p>18. If you are in the left lane, and only going 70 in a 60 mph<br /> zone...people are not waving when they go by. </p>

27178,"<p>A very wealthy man, old and desperately ill, summons to his bedside his three closest advisors: his doctor, his priest, and his lawyer. </p>
<p>I know, he says, they say 'you can't take it with you.' But who knows? Suppose they're mistaken. I'd like to have something with me, just in case. So I am giving each of you an envelope containing one hundred thousand dollars and I would be grateful if at my funeral you would put the envelopes in my coffin, so that if it turns out that it's useful, I'll have something. </p>
<p>They each agree to carry out his wish. </p>
<p>Sure enough, after just a few weeks, the old man passes away. At his funeral, each of the three advisors is seen slipping something into the coffin. </p>
<p>After the burial, as the three are walking away together, the doctor turns to the other two and says, -Friends, I have a confession to make. As you know, at the hospital we are desperate because of the cutbacks in funding. Our CAT SCAN machine broke down and we haven't be able to get a new one. So, I took $20,000 of our friend's money for a new CAT SCAN and put the rest in the coffin as he asked. </p>
<p>At this the priest says, I, too have a confession to make. As you know, our church is simply overwhelmed by the problem of the homeless. The needs keep increasing and we have nowhere to turn. So I took $50,000 from the envelope for our homeless fund and put the rest in the coffin as out friend requested. </p>
<p>Fixing the other two in his gaze, the lawyer says, I am astonished and deeply disappointed that you would treat so casually our solemn undertaking to our friend. I want you to know that I placed in his coffin my personal check for the full one hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Johny's mother asked him if he thought he deserved to get a bike for<br /> his birthday. Little Johnny, of course, thought he did.</p>
<p>Johnny's mother, being a Christian woman, wanted him to reflect on his behavior over the last year and write a letter to God and tell him why he deserved a bike for his birthday.</p>
<p>Little Johnny stomped up the steps to his room and sat down to write<br /> God a letter.</p>
<p>LETTER 1:<br /> Dear God, I have been a very good boy this year and I would like a bike for my birthday. I want a red one.<br /> Your friend,<br /> Johnny</p>

<p>Johnny knew this wasn't true either. He tore up the letter and started again.</p>
<p>LETTER 3:<br /> Dear God, I have been an OK boy this year and I would really like a red bike for my birthday.<br /> Johnny</p>

<p>""Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call. I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before. In your case, I'm going to let you decide where you want to go.""<br /> ""Well, what's the difference between the two?"" Bill asks.</p>
<p>God says, ""I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision.""<br /> ""Fine, but where should I go first?""<br /> ""I'll leave that up to you.""<br /> ""Okay, then,"" says Bill. ""Let me try Hell first.""</p>
<p>So Bill goes to Hell. It's a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun is shining, the temperature is perfect. He is very pleased. ""This is great!"" he tells God. ""If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!""</p>
<p>""Fine,"" says God, and off they go.<br /> Heaven is a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It's nice, but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thinks for a quick minute and decides. ""Hmm. I think I'd prefer Hell,"" he tells God.<br /> ""Fine,"" replies God. ""As you desire.""</p>
<p>So Bill Gates goes to Hell.<br /> Two weeks later, God decides to check on the late billionaire to see how he is doing in Hell. When he gets there, he finds Bill shackled to a wall, screaming amidst hot flames in a dark cave, being burned and tortured by demons.</p>
<p>""How's everything going?"" he asks Bill.<br /> Bill responds, his voice filled with anguish and disappointment, ""This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago!

27209,"<p>Dear Mr. Johnson:<br /> Ann Landers wouldn't print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain. </p>
<p>It's about my son, Billy. He's always been a good, normal 10 year old boy. Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy. </p>
<p>We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire -- you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying. </p>
<p>I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It's where he went last year. Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago. </p>
<p>I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED. He's changed. I can't explain it. See for yourself. </p>
<p>These are some of my little Billy's letters: ----------------------------------- </p>
<p>Letter # 1 ---------- The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only good part. We're learning how to program. Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up. Love, Billy. </p>
<p>Letter # 2 ------------- Dear Mom, </p>
<p>Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We all get to choose what we want to drink. By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I'm getting used to it now. Gotta go, it's time for the flowchart class. Love, Billy. </p>
<p>P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It's spell checked too. </p>
<p>Letter # 3 ------------- Dear Mom, </p>
<p>Don't worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I don't have much of a tan cause we don't go outside very often. You can't see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I'm okay, really. </p>
<p>Love, Billy. </p>
<p>Letter # 4 ------------- Dear Mom, </p>
<p>I'm fine. I'm sleeping enough. I'm eating enough. This is the best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Can you send more money? I've got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad. </p>
<p>Love, Billy. </p>
<p>Letter # 5 ------------- Dear Mother, </p>
<p>Forget the money for the telephone. We've got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven't written. I've been learning a lot. I'm real good at getting onto any computer in the country. It's really easy! I got into the university's in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five, he's going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He's really smart. He says that I shouldn't call myself Billy anymore. So, I'm not. </p>
<p>Signed, William. </p>
<p>Letter # 6 ------------- Dear Mother, </p>
<p>How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why'd you get so upset? I haven't gained that much weight. The glasses aren't real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you'd be proud of my program. After all, I've made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I've paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won't be home until late August. </p>
<p>Regards, William. </p>
<p>Letter # 7 ------------- Mother, </p>
<p>Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.? I won't write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me. </p>
<p>Sincerely, William. </p>
<p>What can I do, Mr. Johnson? See what I mean? It's been two weeks since I've heard from my little boy. I know that it's probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so. Thank you very much. </p>

27210,"<p>Dear Employee:</p>
<p>As a result of the reduction of money budgeted for department areas, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel.</p>
<p>Under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.</p>
<p>This program will be known as SLAP (Sever Late-Aged Personnel). Employees who are SLAPPED will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company.</p>
<p>SLAPPED employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This review phase of the program is called SCREW.</p>
<p>SCREW (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers). All employees who have been SLAPPED and SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management.</p>
<p>This appeal is called SHAFT (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination).</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be SLAPPED once, SCREWED twice, but may be SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate.</p>
<p>If an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel's Early Severance) or CLAP (Combined Lump sum Assistance Payment).</p>
<p>As HERPES and CLAP are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received HERPES or CLAP will no longer be SLAPPED or SCREWED by the company.</p>
<p>Management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our:</p>
<p>Special High Intensity Training (SHIT). We take pride in the amount of SHIT our employees receive. We have given our employees more SHIT than any company in this area. If any employee feels they do not receive enough SHIT on the job, see your immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>Your supervisor is specially trained to make sure you receive all the SHIT you can stand.</p>
<p>And, once again, thanks for all your years of service with us.</p>

Unexpectedly, we stopped in Sacramento on the way. The flight attendant explained that there would be another 45-minute delay, and if we wanted to get off the aircraft, we would reboard in thirty minutes.Everybody got off the plane except one gentleman who was blind. I noticed him as I walked by and could tell he had flown before because his seeing eye dog lay quietly underneath the seats in front of him throughout the entire flight.  I could also tell he had flown this very flight before because the pilot approached him and, calling him by name, said, ""Keith, we're in Sacramento for almost an hour. Would you like to get off and stretch your legs?""Keith replied, ""No thanks, but maybe my dog would like to stretch his legs. Would you take him for me please?""Now picture this. All the people in the gate area came to a completely quiet standstill when they looked up and saw the pilot walk off the plane with a seeing eye dog! The pilot was even wearing sunglasses that day. People scattered not only trying to change planes but also trying to change airlines!</p>

27244,"<p>News anchor Dan Rather, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Today Show personality Katie Couric and an American Marine were hiking through the jungle one day when they were captured by cannibals.</p>
<p>They were tied up, led to the village and brought before the chief.</p>
<p>The chief said, ""I am familiar with your western custom of granting the condemned a last wish. Before we kill and eat you, do you have any last requests?""</p>
<p>Dan Rather said, ""Well, I'm a Texan; so I'd like one last bowlful of hot, spicy chili.""</p>
<p>The chief nodded to an underling, who left and returned with the chili. Rather ate it all and said, ""Now I can die content.""</p>
<p>Jesse Jackson said, ""You know, the thing in this life I am proudest of is my work on behalf of the poor and oppressed. So before I go, I want to sing ""We Shall Overcome"" one last time.""</p>
<p>The chief said, ""Go right ahead, we're listening.""</p>
<p>So Jackson sang the song, and then said, ""Now I can die in peace.""</p>
<p>Katie Couric said, ""I'm a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what's about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job till the end.""</p>
<p>The chief directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder, and Katie dictated some comments. She then said, ""Now I can die happy.""</p>
<p>The chief turned and said, ""And now, Mr. Marine, what is your final wish?""</p>
<p>""Kick me in the ass,"" said the Marine.</p>
<p>""What?"" said the chief. ""Will you mock us in your last hour?""</p>
<p>""No, I'm not kidding. I want you to kick me in the ass,"" insisted the Marine.</p>
<p>So the chief shoved him into the open, and kicked him in the ass. The Marine went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9mm pistol from his waistband, and shot the chief dead.</p>
<p>In the resulting confusion, he leapt to his knapsack, pulled out his M4 carbine, and sprayed the cannibals with gunfire. In a flash, the cannibals were dead or fleeing for their lives.</p>
<p>As the Marine was untying the others, they asked him, ""Why didn't you just shoot them? Why did you ask them to kick you in the ass?""</p>
<p>""What!?"" said the Marine, ""And have all you liberal poopers call ME the aggressor!?""</p>

Come into my humble shop. Salam aleekem!"" (hello in English) So the couple walked in. The bazaar merchant says to them, ""I have some special sandals I think you'd be interested in. They make you wild at sex like a great desert camel."" After hearing this statement, the wife became intrigued and encouraged her husband to try them on. Her husband smirked and winked at his wife, with the comment, ""I don't think I really need them."" But since they were having fun in the bazaar, he asked the merchant, ""So, how could sandals make you into a sex animal.?"" The merchant smiled and replied ""Just try them on, my friend, trust me!"" Well, in the combined spirit of goodwill and after much badgering from his wife, he finally consented to try them on. The husband put the shoes on and a wild look seemed to appear in his eyes, something his wife has not seen in many years -- the look of raw sexual power. In a blink of the eye, the husband rushed the merchant, threw him on the table and started tearing at the guys pants. While trying to run away, the bazaar merchant is yelling non-stop ""You've got the shoes on the wrong feet... You've got the shoes the wrong feet..""</p>

27280,"<p>Scientists have determined that the average time of intercourse lasts 4 minutes. The average number of strokes is 9 per minute, making the average intercourse 36 strokes long. Since the average length of a penis is about 6 inches, the average girl receives 216 inches of penis or 18 feet of penis per intercourse.If the average girl does it 3 times a week, (that makes 156 times annually) 156 x 18 feet of penis makes 2808 feet, or just over a half mile of penis per year.If a girl starts having sex at 16, and since the average life span of a woman is 75, you could say that you could be getting 2808 feet of penis x 59 years of sex makes 165,672 feet, or 55,224 yards, or a little over 31 miles of penis in your lifetime.Anyone whose getting more than that, well, yer just a big ol slut.</p>

27291,"<p>Joke - How to uninstall AOL.</p>
<p>Follow these steps precisely, and proceed to the next step only after discovering that AOL is still installed.</p>
<p>1. Uninstall AOL through AOL's built-in uninstaller.<br /> 2. Uninstall AOL through Add/Remove Programs.<br /> 3. Do a System Restore to a date before you had AOL installed.<br /> 4. Give up and reinstall Windows.<br /> 5. Reinstall Windows again because it crashed halfway through.<br /> 6. Scream wildly. Swearing is appropriate in this instance.<br /> 7. Format the drive completely.<br /> 8. Reinstall Windows from scratch, and find a perfectly clean desktop with nothing except the ""My Computer"", ""Recycle Bin"" and ""AOL"" icons on your desktop.<br /> 9. Turn off computer, and physically remove hard drive. Run a large magnet over hard drive, then run it over with a 20-ton steamroller, then take hard rive to nearest data recovery company, where they'll politely tell you that they were unable to recover the spreadsheet that you needed for work on Thursday, but that there's no need to panic, because amazingly AOL 8.3 (the ""Melty"" version) is still installed on the drive.<br /> 10. Weep like a little girl. Then go to your nearest hardware store and buy an axe. Upon returning to the parking lot with the axe, take the hard drive out of your trunk and commence hacking.<br /> 11. Take all the little pieces home, and toss them in a bonfire. This, of course, will not work, for as we all know from watching various B-movies, items with demonic auras don't burn.<br /> 12. Douse fire with water. Douse hard drive with Holy Water.<br /> 13. When all else fails, convert to the Amish beliefs. They never seem to have this sort of problem for some reason.</p>

Instead, they attended medical schools, many of which were condemned in the press and by the government as ""substandard.""Sugar cost four cents a pound. Eggs were fourteen cents a dozen. Coffee cost fifteen cents a pound.Most women only washed their hair once a month and used borax or egg yolks for shampoo.Canada passed a law prohibiting poor people from entering the country for any reason, either as travelers or immigrants.The five leading causes of death in the U.S. were:   1.

They recommended slipping bromide -- which was thought to diminish sexual desire -- into the woman's drinking water.Marijuana, heroin, and morphine were all available over the counter at corner drugstores. According to one pharmacist, ""Heroin clears the complexion, gives buoyancy to the mind, regulates the stomach and the bowels, and is, in fact, a perfect guardian of health.Coca-Cola contained cocaine instead of caffeine.Punch card data processing had recently been developed, and early predecessors of the modern computer were used for the first time by the government to help compile the 1900 census.Eighteen percent of households in the United States had at least one full-time servant or domestic.There were about 230 reported murders in the U.S. annually.</p>

Most of them had lived in the city all their lives, and had never seen such a thing. The day came, and the ladies filed into the rented bus which whisked them off to their destination. On the way, they watched out the windows as the city squalor turned into lovely, unpolluted countryside. After they arrived, they were greeted by the farmer who invited them to look him up should they have any questions. Myrtle, after looking about, and being amazed by what she saw, stepped into a building and viewed something she thought was quite remarkable.

<p>""Sir,"" she inquired, ""Why doesn't this cow have any horns?"" </p>

But the reason this cow don't have no horns, ma'am, is 'cause it's a horse.""</p>

<p>So she did, and she was sooooo happy with it that she went to her car and drove around just to show off her new look. She was coming up to this intersection when she saw a shepeherd by the road waiting to cross with his flock of lambs. The girl stopped and waved him to pass.</p>
<p>While the flock was crossing the road, she asked the shepherd - ""If I can guess how many sheep you got there, would you give me one?""</p>
<p>He thought about the offer for a minute and decided it was ok. The girl looked at the flock and exclaimed ""487"". The shepherd said ""WOW! That's right...well...take any sheep you like...a deal's a deal""</p>

<p>If the teaming masses were to behold my juggernaut-like genitals, surely<br /> Marx's concept of the End of History would be nigh. </p>
<p>My genitals are of such behemoth proportions, it is to the world of genitalia<br /> what Noam Chomsky is to the study of global activism! </p>
<p>My genitals are so mammoth in size, that if inches were words, my member could<br /> fill every page of one of Ayn Rand's epic Objectivist tomes! </p>
<p>A fine 1997 Chateau-La Cardonne Bordeaux would go well with my robust and<br /> flavorful genitals, even after the third helping! </p>
<p>My genitals are so bursting with sexual magnetism, I could single-handedly<br /> seduce and defile the entire lesbian population of Sarah Lawrence University! </p>

27321,"<p>There was this nun named Sister Mary who, though she tried and tried, could never please the Mother Superior. One day she comes up with an idea: since the abbey was always cold, she decided to cut some wood and build a fire in the fireplace to heat the place up. She spent all day chopping, hauling and stacking wood. Subsequently, she wound up shredding the sleeves of her habit. Later that night, as the other nuns came into the rectory, they were delighted to find the place warm and cozy, with a big fire roaring in the fireplace. Then Mother Superior comes in and yells, ""Sister Mary! Go fix your torn habit this instant!""Sister Mary, crying, asks, ""But Mother Superior, aren't you happy that the abbey is warm?"" To which the Mother Superior replies, ""Yes, but when you ax, then ye shall re-sleeve.""</p>

Then, a detective drives them back to the parking lot to see if any evidence can be found at the scene of the crime. To their amazement, the car has been returned. There is an envelope on the windshield with a note of apology and two tickets to a music concert. The note reads, ""I apologize for taking your car, but my wife was having a baby and I had to hot-wire your ignition to rush her to the hospital. Please forgive the inconvenience. Here are two tickets for tonight's concert of Garth Brooks, the country-and-western music star."" Their faith in humanity restored, the couple attend the concert and return home late. They find their house has been robbed. Valuable goods have been taken from thoughout the house, from basement to attic. And, there is a note on the door reading, ""Well, you still have your car.

27325,"<p>In 1993, the University of Kentucky did a study to see why the head of a  man's penis was larger than the shaft. After one year and $80,000.00, they concluded that the reason the head was larger than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure during sex.After the study was published, the University of South Carolina decided to do their own study. After $250,00000, and 3 years of research, they concluded that the reason was to give the woman more pleasure during sex.The University of Virginia, unsatisfied with these findings, conducted  their own study. After 2 weeks and a cost of around $75.46, they concluded it was to keep a man's hand from flying off and hitting him in the forehead.</p>
"
27326,"<p>Whenever your kids are out of control, you can take comfort from the thought that even God's omnipotence did not extend to God's kids.<br /> After creating heaven and earth, God created Adam and Eve.<br /> And the first thing He said to them was:</p>
<p>""Don't.""<br /> ""Don't what?"" Adam replied.<br /> ""Don't eat the forbidden fruit."" God said.</p>
<p>""Forbidden fruit? We got forbidden fruit?<br /> Hey, Eve...we got Forbidden Fruit!""<br /> ""No way!""<br /> ""Yes, WAY!""</p>
<p>""Don't eat that fruit!"" said God.<br /> ""Why?""<br /> ""Because I'm your Father and I said so!"" said God, wondering why he hadn't stopped after making the elephants. A few minutes later God saw the kids having an apple break and was angry.</p>
<p>""Didn't I tell you not to eat that fruit?"" the First Parent asked.<br /> ""Uh huh,"" Adam replied.<br /> ""Then why did you?""<br /> ""I dunno,"" Eve answered.<br /> ""She started it!"" Adam said.<br /> ""Did not!""<br /> ""DID so!""<br /> ""DID NOT!""</p>
<p>Having had it with the two of them, God's punishment was that Adam and Eve should have children of their own.</p>
<p>Thus the pattern was set and it has never changed. But there is a reassurance in this story. If you have persistently and lovingly tried to give them wisdom and they haven't taken it, don't be hard on yourself.</p>

27331,"<p>In the aftermath of the initial administration responses to the breaking<br /> story, it seems apparent that Mr. Clinton has left a bad taste in Lewinsky's<br /> mouth. A growing majority is finding the President's story hard to swallow,<br /> noting that it appears quite evident that Monica was influenced by some sort of<br /> Presidential �gag order.�<br /> The First Lady, the recognized steward of the President's power base, is<br /> reported to be afraid that Lewinsky has blown everything. Vernon Jordan is<br /> reported to have suggested that Ms. Lewinsky approach the President with a stiff<br /> upper lip for the time being, and is quite upset at how much damage her wagging<br /> tongue seems to have done.<br /> Meanwhile, the White House staff is engaged in a furious search for Richard<br /> Nixon's tape erasing machine, last seen on loan to the offices of the Rose Law<br /> Firm in Little Rock. In an effort of goodwill, however, the administration has<br /> extended an invitation to Ms. Lewinsky for an exclusive guided tour of the<br /> Capital City's national parks one night next week.<br /> Ms. Lewinsky's attorney has chided the mainstream media for taking out of<br /> context a comment by her close friends that she once said, �she wanted to head<br /> the Oval Office someday.� Defending his client as a victim, he said that �...<br /> this oral sex thing really has her choked up, you know.�<br /> Mr. Starr, the independent prosecutor investigating the case, remains unmoved,<br /> and has made it clear that to avoid criminal liability she, Ms. Lewinsky will be<br /> required to give a complete blow-by-blow description of her relationship with<br /> Mr. Clinton.<br /> Chelsea Clinton, when asked for her opinion of the woman who stands to<br /> dethrone her father, simply replied, �She sucks!�<br /> In a related story, a truck bomb scare in the front driveway of the White<br /> House resulted in the evacuation of the building until Secret Service agents<br /> ascertained that the Ryder van parked in the drive was just Tipper Gore waiting<br /> out front with her furniture....</p>

<p>Ancient Egy`t was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in hydraulics. They lived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere. </p>
<p>The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of their children, Cain, asked, ""Am I my brother's son?"" Moses led the hebrew slaves to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread which is bread made without any ingredients. Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. He died before he ever reached Canada. Solomom had three hundred wives and seven hundred porcupines. </p>
<p>The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we wouldn't have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a female moth. Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of that name. Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice. They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock. After his death, his career suffered a dramatic decline. In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits, and threw the java. Eventually, the Romans conquered the Greeks. </p>
<p>History calls people Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long. Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battle fields of Gaul. The Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king. Dying, he gasped out: ""Tee hee, Brutus."" Nero was a cruel tyranny who would torture his subjects by playing the fiddle to them. </p>
<p>Joan of Arc was burnt to a steak and was cannonized by Bernard Shaw. </p>
<p>Finally Magna Carta provided that no man should be hanged twice for the same offense. In midevil times most people were alliterate. </p>
<p>The greatest writer of the futile ages was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verses and also wrote literature. Another story was William Tell, who shot an arrow through an apple while standing on his son's head. </p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth was the ""Virgin Queen."" As a queen she was a success. When she exposed herself before her troops they all shouted ""hurrah."" It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. </p>
<p>Gutenberg invented removable type and the Bible. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. </p>
<p>Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes and started smoking. And Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper. </p>
<p>The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare. He was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his birthday. He never made much money and is famous only because of his plays. He wrote tragedies, comedies, and hysterectomies, all in Islamic pentameter. Romeo and Juliet are an example of a heroic couplet. Romeo's last wish was to be laid by Juliet. </p>
<p>Writing at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel Cervantes. He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton. Milton wrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained. During the Renaissance America began. </p>
<p>Christopher Columbus was a great navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic. His ships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe. Later, the Pilgrims crossed the ocean, and this was called Pilgrim's Progress. The winter of 1620 was a hard one for the settlers. Many people died and many babies were born. Captain John Smith was responsible for all this. </p>
<p>One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the English put tacks in their tea. Also, the colonists would send their parcels through the post without stamps. Finally the colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis. Delegates from the original 13 states formed the Contented Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin discovered electricity by rubbing two cats backwards and declared, ""A horse divided against itself cannot stand."" Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead. Soon the Constitution of the United States was adopted to secure domestic hostility. Under the constitution the people enjoyed the right to keep bare arms. </p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his own hands. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves by signing the Emasculation Proclamation. On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show. The believed assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposingly insane actor. This ruined Booth's career. Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time. </p>
<p>Voltaire invented electricity and also wrote a book called Candy. Gravity was invented by Issac Walton. It is chiefly noticeable in the autumn when the apples are falling off the trees. </p>
<p>Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had a large number of children. In between he practiced on an old spinster which he kept up in his attic. Bach died from 1750 to the present. Bach was the most famous composer in the world and so was Handel. Handel was half German, half Italian and half English. He was very large. </p>
<p>Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for this. </p>
<p>The French Revolution was accomplished before it happened and catapulted into Napoleon. Napoleon wanted an heir to inherit his power, but since Josephine was a baroness, she couldn't have any children. The sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is in the East and the sun sets in the West. </p>
<p>Queen Victoria was the longest queen. She sat on a thorn for 63 years. She was a moral woman who practiced virtue. Her death was the final event which ended her reign. The nineteenth century was a time of a great many thoughts and inventions. People stopped reproducing by hand and started reproducing by machine. The invention of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to spring up. </p>
<p>Cyrus McCormick invented the McCormick raper, which did the work of a hundred men. Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis. Charles Darwin was a naturalist who wrote the Organ of the Species. Madman Curie discovered radio. And Karl Marx became one of the Marx brothers. The First World War, caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by an anahist, ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.</p>

27362,"<p>When I was in high school I used to be terrified of my<br /> girlfriend's father, who I believe suspected me of wanting to<br /> place my hands on his daughter's chest. He would open the door<br /> and immediately affect my good-naturedly murderous expression,<br /> holding out a handshake that, when gripped, felt like it could<br /> squeeze carbon into diamonds.</p>
<p>Now, years later, it is my turn to be the dad. Remembering how<br /> unfairly persecuted I felt when I would pick up my dates, I do<br /> my best to make my daughter's suitors feel even worse. My motto:<br /> wilt them in the living room and they'll stay wilted all night.</p>
<p>""So,"" I'll call out jovially. ""I see you have your nose pierced.<br /> Is that because you're stupid, or did you merely want to appear<br /> stupid?""</p>
<p>As a dad, I have some basic rules, which I have carved into two<br /> stone tablets that I have on display in my living room.</p>
<p>Rule One: If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be<br /> delivering a package, because you're sure as heck not picking<br /> anything up.</p>
<p>Rule Two: You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may<br /> glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her<br /> neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's<br /> body, I will remove them.</p>
<p>Rule Three: I am aware that it is considered fashionable for<br /> boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they<br /> appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as<br /> an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots.<br /> Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I<br /> propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your<br /> underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will<br /> not object. However, In order to assure that your clothes do<br /> not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my<br /> daughter, I will take my electric staple gun and fasten your<br /> trousers securely in place around your waist.</p>
<p>Rule Four: I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex<br /> without utilizing a ""barrier method"" of some kind can kill you.<br /> Let me elaborate: when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I<br /> WILL kill you.</p>
<p>Rule Five: In order for us to get to know each other, we should<br /> talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please<br /> do not do this. The only information I require from you is an<br /> indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at<br /> my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is<br /> ""early.""</p>
<p>Rule Six: I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many<br /> opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long<br /> as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone<br /> out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but<br /> her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will<br /> make YOU cry.</p>
<p>Rule Seven: As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my<br /> daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh<br /> and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should<br /> not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process<br /> which can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge.<br /> Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something<br /> useful, like changing the oil in my car?</p>
<p>Rule Eight: The following places are not appropriate for a date<br /> with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or<br /> anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are no<br /> parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there<br /> is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or<br /> happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough<br /> to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff<br /> T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a<br /> goose down parka zipped up to her chin. Movies with a strong<br /> romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature<br /> chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay.</p>
<p>My daughter claims it embarrasses her to come downstairs and<br /> find me attempting to get her date to recite these eight simple<br /> rules from memory. I'd be embarrassed too-- there are only eight<br /> of them, for crying out loud! And, for the record, I did NOT<br /> suggest to one of these cretins that I'd have these rules<br /> tattooed on his arm if he couldn't remember them. (I checked<br /> into it and the cost is prohibitive.) I merely told him that I<br /> thought writing the rules on his arm with a ball point might be<br /> inadequate --ink washes off--and that my wood burning set was<br /> probably a better alternative.</p>
<p>One time, when my wife caught me having one of my daughter's<br /> would-be suitors practice pulling into the driveway, get out of<br /> the car, and go up to knock on the front door (he had violated<br /> rule number one, so I figured he needed to run through the drill<br /> a few dozen times) she asked me why I was being so hard on the<br /> boy. ""Don't you remember being that age?"" she challenged.</p>
<p>Of course I remember. Why do you think I came up with the eight<br /> simple rules?</p>

27374,"<p>An old, bearded shepherd, with a crooked staff, walks up to a stone pulpit and says . . .</p>
<p>And lo it came to pass that the trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot. And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com.</p>
<p>And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why doth thou travel far, from town to town, with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?""</p>
<p>And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, Dear?""</p>
<p>And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)"".</p>
<p>Abraha} thkught long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums, as long as he could have his way with her.</p>
<p>And Dot said, ""There will be a lot of banging in the land"". And Abraham replied, ""It is my most fervent wish that this be so"".</p>
<p>And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had, at the top price, without ever moving from his tent.</p>
<p>But his success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading.</p>
<p>And the young did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly to camel dung.</p>
<p>They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short.</p>
<p>And lo the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would only work if you bought Brother Gates' drumsticks.</p>
<p>And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others"". And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known, ""eBay"", he said, ""We need a name of a service that reflects what we are"".</p>
<p>And Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators"".</p>

<p>GRANDPA: In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.</p>
<p>ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.</p>
<p>KARL MARX: It was a historical inevitability.</p>
<p>SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.</p>
<p>RONALD REAGAN: What chicken?</p>
<p>CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.</p>
<p>FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it?</p>
<p>MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.</p>
<p>FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.</p>
<p>BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken 98, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken?</p>
<p>BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by chicken? Could you define chicken please?</p>
<p>IMMANUEL KANT: The chicken was acting out of a sense of duty to cross the road, as chickens have traditionally crossed roads throughout history.</p>
<p>THE BIBLE: And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken, Thou shalt cross the road."" And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.</p>
<p>COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one?</p>
<p>RICHARD M. NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did not cross the road. I don't know any chickens. I have never known any chickens.</p>

27379,"<p>After experiencing difficulties with his computer, a poor, incognizant user called the system maker's technical support line for assistance...Technician: Hello.  How can I help you today?Customer: There's smoke coming from the power supply on my computer...Technician: Looks like you need a new power supply...Customer: No, I don't!  I just need to change the startup files...Technician: Sir, what you described is a faulty power supply.  You need to replace it...Customer: No way!  Someone told me that I just had to change the system startup files to fix the problem!  All I need is for you to tell me the right command...For the next ten minutes, in spite of the technician's efforts to explain the problem and its solution, the customer adamantly insisted that he was right.  So, in frustration, the technician responded...Technician: I'm sorry.  We don't normally tell our customers this, but there's an undocumented DOS command that will fix the problem...Customer: I knew it!Technician: Just add the line 'LOAD NOSMOKE.COM' at the end of the CONFIG.SYS file and everything should work fine.  Let me know how it goes...About ten minutes later, the technician received a call back from the customer...Customer: It didn't work.  The power supply is still smoking...Technician: Well, what version of DOS are you using?Customer: MS-DOS 6.22...  Technician: Well, that's your problem. That version of DOS doesn't include NOSMOKE.  You'll need to contact Microsoft and ask them for a patch.  Let me know how it all works out...When nearly an hour had passed, the phone rang again...Customer: I need a new power supply...Technician: How did you come to that conclusion?Customer: Well, I called Microsoft and told the technician what you said, and he started asking me questions about the make of the power supply...Technician: What did he tell you?Customer: He said my power supply isn't compatible with NOSMOKE...</p>

<p>Mouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit).<br /> Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform<br /> erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Because of the<br /> delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls<br /> should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by<br /> examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be<br /> larger and harder than foreign balls. Ball removal procedures<br /> differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign<br /> balls can be replaced using the pop-off method. Domestic balls<br /> are replaced by using the twist-off method. Mouse balls are not<br /> usually static-sensitive. However, excessive handling can result<br /> in sudden discharge.</p>
<p>Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used<br /> immediately. It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of<br /> spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction. Any<br /> customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of<br /> removing these necessary items.</p>

<p>So the son takes the duck and sets off down the road. Halfway to town he runs into a hooker. She says, ""Hey kid, I could show you a really good time if you're interested.""<br /> He replies, ""I'd sure like to, but all I have to pay with is this duck.""<br /> ""Well,"" she says, ""maybe we can work something out.""</p>
<p>So they go off into the bushes and the branches are snapping and feathers flying.....</p>
<p>When they come out, she is breathless and says, ""Wow! That was incredible! Not bad for a kid. Tell you what, if you can do that again, I'll give you back your duck.""</p>
<p>As you might guess, he's all for that idea. So they return to the bushes and get it on again. When they are done she is still amazed at his abilities.</p>
<p>She says to him, ""I've got this friend who's husband is a real loser. He hasn't even been able to get it up in years, let alone satisfy her when he could. I'm gonna send you to her.

The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation.By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way.The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane...only this time there were two people in the plane. The same pilot jumped out and said, ""Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!""</p>

<p>On the big day they felt ready. The Japanese won by a mile. Afterward, the<br /> American team was discouraged by the loss. Morale sagged. Corporate management<br /> decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found, so a consulting<br /> firm was hired to investigate the problem and recommended corrective action. </p>
<p>The consultant's finding: The Japanese team had eight people rowing and one<br /> person steering; the American team had one person rowing and eight people<br /> steering. </p>
<p>After a year of study and millions spent analyzing the problem, the consultant<br /> firm concluded that too many people were steering and not enough were rowing on<br /> the American team. </p>
<p>So as race day neared again the following year, the American team's management<br /> structure was completely reorganized. The new structure: four steering managers,<br /> three area steering managers and a new performance review system for the person<br /> rowing the boat to provide work incentive. </p>
<p>The next year, the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the American<br /> corporation laid off the rower for poor performance and gave the managers a<br /> bonus for discovering the problem.""</p>

27430,"<p>Once upon a time, a blonde became so sick of hearing blonde<br /> jokes that she had her hair cut and dyed brown. A few days<br /> later, as she was driving around the countryside, she stopped<br /> her car to let a flock of sheep pass. Admiring the cute woolly<br /> creatures, she said to the shepherd, ""If I can guess how many<br /> sheep you have, can I take one?""</p>
<p>The shepherd, always the gentleman replied, ""Of course.""</p>
<p>The blonde thought for a moment and for no discernible reason<br /> said, ""352.""</p>
<p>This being the correct number, the shepherd was, understandably,<br /> totally amazed and exclaimed, ""You're right! O.K., I'll keep to<br /> my end of the deal. Take your pick of my flock.""</p>
<p>The blonde carefully considered the entire flock and finally<br /> picked one that was by far cuter and more playful than any of<br /> the others.</p>
<p>When she was done, the shepherd turned to her and said, ""O.K.,<br /> now I have a proposition for you. If I can guess your true hair<br /> color, can I have my dog back?</p>

<p>As I stand here today, looking out over this magnificent Viagra, I think we<br /> can agree that the past is over. Our country is ready for a fresh, bipolar<br /> approach.</p>
<p>I want to bring America together. We are the hill shining on a<br /> city, and each of us can get to the top if we set our feet to it Americans have<br /> made their decision. They don't need sympathy; they need ablutions. We need to<br /> move beyond the petty armadillos.</p>
<p>Politics doesn't have to be the way it is today. We can make the pie higher. A<br /> high pie lets everyone put food on their family and their family on the table.</p>
<p>That's my record: I side with the people. And the B-side of my record is<br /> Billy-Joe Gibbs and the Shoeshine Boys singing ""Streets in Laredo"".</p>

<p>A president has to think not only of himself and his family and his baseball<br /> team's families, but of all American families.

That's<br /> why my tax cut is as broad as we are. And it will give our expansion a timely<br /> second dose of wind.</p>

<p>I say there's a cost to inaction. I haven't done the acrobatics, but it's<br /> probably around a trillion dollars. That's a good round sum to offer to<br /> everyone, especially our seniors, who are the backache of our nation. I would<br /> like to take a moment to mention my mother, Barbara Bush, who taught me to read<br /> and write when I was still knee-high to a lawnmower. We need our seniors to be<br /> free to pass on their life's work to those they love, and especially to pass<br /> on.</p>

<p>We know that America is the best in the world. We are the great super-premium;<br /> we cannot afford to be unleaded. This is still a world of madmen and mental<br /> losses. And mental loss is easy to underestimate. We need a sharpened sword to<br /> light our way. To quote Ronald Reagan: ""I do not believe in a fate that will<br /> fall on us if we do nothing. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we<br /> do something. And it must never run our lives.""</p>
<p>(Exxon commercial).</p>
<p>The purpose of prosperity is to make sure the American dream touches every<br /> killing heart. Progress can be slow; you measure it in inches and feet, not<br /> miles or kilograms. Or cantilevers. I worked in Texas by common sense and plain<br /> dozing. I got on with small business, because I was one myself. I'm less now.<br /> But I'm also more. We are all less and more. More or less. And I believe we must<br /> match our compassionate hearts to our preservative minds.<br /> I know you would rather be watching TV, and so would I, so I will draw to<br /> confusion. My message is: I will get things done. I will inspire and untie. I<br /> will appeal to people's better angles. I will prove that politics can be bigger<br /> than you ever thought possible. We will trust the people we serve, and serve the<br /> people we trust. Together, we can do what needs to be done to preserve this<br /> great bastard of freedom.</p>

27447,"<p>The setting is Disneyland, ""The Happiest Place on Earth,"" where I had joined a couple of friends for a day of fun and adventure. After paying something approaching $30 each to get in, we wanted to conserve what little was left of our cash for important things like rubber lizards and the air hockey tables, so when it came time to eat we opted for a quick-n-cheap lunch rather than fine dining in one of their numerous restaurants. </p>
<p>Lunch consisted of one of those burritos in a plastic bag, and a can of cola. I could go into great detail here, but why bother. You know precisely what I'm getting at here: INTESTINAL GAS! </p>
<p>Funny thing is, lunch didn't seem to give me any problem. I don't think I flatulated once the whole afternoon. More junk food was consumed. Many violent games of air hockey were played. Little did I know what my bowels had in store. </p>
<p>So late in the afternoon we step in line for the Jungle Cruise ride (you'll also find rubber lizards for sale in this area). The lines at Disneyland are densely packed in a serpentine configuration such that it's pretty much impossible to bail out from the middle. As I shuffle around a bend deep into the line, I notice there's a little girl right behind me who it would seem has been genetically engineered to be just the height that would place her nose precisely in line for problems. </p>
<p>""Wouldn't it be funny,"" I think to myself, ""if I had to flatulate right now?"" </p>
<p>We continue shuffling through the densely-packed line, and just as we come to the exact center of the line, with the small, innocent child mere inches away and at least 20 feet of human bodies in all directions and nowhere to run, I did just that. I passed gas. </p>
<p>However, this was no ordinary flatus. Nothing like this has crept from my bowels before or since. This was ... The Doomsday Fart! You know the expression, ""silent but deadly""? You couldn't have heard this one with a stethoscope, but Landsat 4 probably picked it up in the thermal band. It was simply unholy. A fart that could melt diamond. The oil fires of Kuwait couldn't hold a candle to this thing. Chernobyl? Child's play! Weather patters were disrupted. LAX was ""fogged in."" The world knew a new evil on this day. A voluminous, hot, humid, painfully burning fart that makes the greenhose effect look like a pleasant alternative. It probably knocked down a couple local trailer parks just for good measure. </p>
<p>I farted only once on this day, but it was more than most people will manage in a lifetime. The line started moving. I did not look back, for fear that I might see a live action replay of the scene in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" where people were melting and shriveling up (or would it be more like the ash bodies in Terminator 2?). We go around one of the bends in the line, headed back toward The Mushroom Cloud. </p>
<p>My friends both choke, look back at me, and give the best glabe they can manage with their eyes watering like that. I've just got this big grin on my face. They do not need to ask where ""It"" came from (brave souls, these folks - they still joined me on the submarine ride later). Rounding the corner myself, I get a glimpse of what's left of the small child behind me. </p>
<p>Her face is scrunched in pain, her hands violently waving the air in front of her. I don't think she needs to ask either. Except for the complete depilatation, it's nothing a good plastic surgeon can't fix. </p>

27461,"<p>One day, a man had an accident at work, which resulted in him getting his eye gouged out. He was rushed to hospital, and, after awaking from an emergency operation, was told by the doctor that he'd been given a glass eye. The man looked in the mirror to see the result, and was shocked to see that, whereas his original eye colour was blue, his new glass eye was brown. The man was outraged. ''I can't walk around like this!!""""Sir,"" the doctor said, ""there is a severe shortage on blue eyes. We had to give you a brown one. If somehow you can get hold of a blue eye, and bring it here to the hospital, we will happily fit it for you.'' A few weeks later, the man was driving home from work late one night during a big storm. Suddenly, the car in front of him lost control and skidded off the road before finally hitting a tree. The man screeched to a halt, and ran down the embankment to see if he could help. He found the driver of the car sprawled out over the wreckage, dead as a doornail...with a blue glass eye! As it was so late at night and during such a big storm, no one was about. So the man proceeded to get a screwdriver and removed one of the deceased man's blue eyes, replacing it with his brown glass eye. He raced down to the local hospital to have the replacement blue eye fitted. A few days later, the man was driving along the same stretch of road when he saw the police examining the crash scene and towing the car wreck away. Concerned to find out if the police were on to him, the man decided to go over to try and see if the police had any leads. ''Excuse me, sir,"" said the policeman.""Do you know anything about this at all?''''No, constable'', said the man.''Well, we can't figure this out. Somehow, this bloke managed to drive 40 miles with two glass eyes!''</p>

27467,"<p>Police arrested Patrick Lawrence, a 22-year-old white male, resident of<br /> Dacula, GA, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 p.m. on Friday. Lawrence will be<br /> charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public<br /> intoxication at the Gwinnett County courthouse on Monday.</p>
<p>The suspect explained that as he was passing a pumpkin patch he decided to<br /> stop. ""You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one<br /> around here for miles. At least I thought there wasn't,"" he stated in a<br /> phone interview. Lawrence went on to say that he pulled over to the side of<br /> the road, picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his<br /> purposes, cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his alleged ""need.""</p>
<p>""I guess I was just really into it, you know? ""he commented with evident<br /> embarrassment. In the process, Lawrence apparently failed to notice a<br /> Gwinnett County police car approaching and was unaware of his audience<br /> until officer Brenda Taylor approached him.</p>
<p>""It was an unusual situation, that's for sure,"" said officer Taylor.  ""I<br /> walked up to (Lawrence) and he's...just working away at this pumpkin.""<br /> Taylor went on to describe what happened when she approached Lawrence.  ""I<br /> just went up and said, ""Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you are<br /> screwing a pumpkin?</p>

<p>* But it's okay to stop for directions when driving with another guy: because he won't sit patiently as you pass the same McDonald's for the third time. </p>
<p>* Inch forward at stoplights to keep up with the guys in the cars on both sides.: It's all about who's out in front. </p>
<p>* Even if you don't know a hub cap from a distributor cap, never admit you're a stranger to the male domain of auto mechanics.... If your car won't run and you're at a loss for words, try ""Could be a cracked ring. Have you checked the compression?"" </p>
<p>* A real man doesn't need the instruction sheet to figure out something as simple as programming his new VCR: but to cook something as simple as oatmeal, a guy will follow the recipe with the exactitude of a chemical engineer. </p>
<p>* Don't confess that you know little, and could care less, about a particular sport, especially if it's during the finals.... ""Yeah, that Bo, he's really something. WOW!, did you see that hook shot!."" </p>
<p>* Never admit you don't understand a political issue....Opinions are like whiskers. You're not an adult male without them. </p>
<p>* There's no need to consult the TV Guide when there's a remote control handy: Just divebomb through all 51 channels, evading commercials like flak, in the never-ending search for a suitable landing spot. </p>
<p>* If you spill something on the floor, clean it up with a bath towel.: It's unmanly to get down on the floor, so just slop the towel around with your feet. </p>
<p>* Never pay one of your buddies a compliment. Instead say things like ""Where'd you get your haircut, the school for the blind?"" or ""Who is that awesome blonde I saw you with, and what are you going to do for a date once she meets me?""...He'll instinctively get the message that this means you value his friendship. </p>
<p>* A man should make as much as or more money than his girlfriend or wife. He should be as tall or taller, and at least as smart. Naturally, he should be able to outplay her in many activity, from Ping-Pong to chess: Having met these requirements, he should be liberated enough to be unconcerned about such things. </p>
<p>* When you're in the men's room alone you needn't wash your hands when you're finished: but if another guy is in there with you, scrub your hands as if you were preparing for brain surgery. </p>
<p>* Never openly display a broken heart or discuss it with other guys: That's between you, your six-pack and your collection of Frank Sinatra records. </p>
<p>* Don't tell another man your deepest hopes or fears.: That' s like saying, ""How do you like my suit of armor"" It's only got two weak spots in it -- here and here."" </p>
<p>* Every guy should be hip about guns.: Hand an economics professor a Remington, and even if he's never been with 100 light years of a gun before, he'll work the action, sight down the barrel and generally act like a reincarnation of Daniel Boone or Rambo. </p>
<p>* When shopping with your mate, do not trail her into the women's lingerie department .: Stand clear of those racks of silk-and-lace panties like a mechanic would avoid the Whirling Fanblades of Death.</p>

As she turned to write something on the<br /> blackboard, she heard a loud whisper, ""Damned Japanese."" ""Who<br /> said that?"" she demanded. Suzuki put his hand up.

<p>At that point, feeling completely disgusted by Suzuki's<br /> classroom superiority, a student in the back sighed, ""I'm gonna<br /> throw up."" The teacher glares and asks, ""All right!

<p>Atlanta, Ga.

''Up until now we have, quite naturally, assumed that both foot-and-mouth and mad cow were spread by Microsoft Outlook,'' said Nick Brown, Britain's Agriculture Minister. </p>
<p>''By eliminating it, we can focus our resources elsewhere.'' However, researchers in the Netherlands, where foot-and-mouth has recently appeared, said they are not yet prepared to disqualify Outlook, which has been the progenitor of viruses such as ''I Love You,'' ''Bubbleboy,'' ''Anna Kournikova,'' and ''Naked Wife,'' to name but a few. </p>
<p>Said Nils Overmars, director of the Molecular Virology Lab at Leiden University: ''It's not that we don't trust the research, it's just that as scientists, we are trained to be skeptical of any finding that flies in the face of established knowledge. This one flies in the face like a blind drunk sparrow.'' </p>
<p>Executives at Microsoft, meanwhile, were equally skeptical, insisting that Outlook's patented Virus Transfer Protocol (VTP) has proven virtually pervious to any virus. The company, however, will issue a free VTP patch if it turns out the application is not vulnerable to foot-and-mouth. </p>
<p>Such an admission would be embarrassing for the software giant, but Symantec virologist Ariel Kologne insisted that no one is more humiliated by the study than she is. ''Only last week, I had a reporter ask if the foot-and-mouth virus spreads through Microsoft Outlook, and I told him, 'Doesn't everything?''' she recalled. </p>

27529,"<p>A fire started on some grassland near a farm in Indiana. The fire department from the nearby town was called to put the fire out. The fire proved to be more than the small town fire department could handle, so someone suggested that a rural volunteer fire department be called. Though there was doubt that they would be of any assistance, the call was made. The volunteer fire department arrived in a dilapidated old fire truck. They drove straight towards the fire and stopped in the middle of the flames. The volunteer firemen jumped off the truck and frantically started spraying water in all directions. Soon they had snuffed out the center of the fire, breaking the blaze into two easily controllable parts.The farmer was so impressed with the volunteer fire department's work and so grateful that his farm had been spared, that he presented the volunteer fire department with a check for $1000. A local news reporter asked the volunteer fire captain what the department planned to do with the funds. 'That should be obvious,' he responded, 'the first thing we're gonna do is get the brakes fixed on that stupid fire truck.'</p>

<p>The mermaid looks at him and says, ""You know, I normally don't try to change other people's minds when they make a wish, but I really wish you would reconsider. </p>
<p>The guy replies, ""No, I want to increase my I.Q. times five and if you don't do it, I won't set you free."" </p>
<p>""Please,"" says the mermaid, ""You don't know what your asking...it'll change your entire view of the universe...won't you ask for something else..a million dollars, anything?"" </p>

<p>Thank you for your letter of February 17th. After careful consideration I<br /> regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me<br /> employment with your bank.</p>
<p>This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large<br /> number of rejection letters. With such a varied and promising field of<br /> candidates it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.</p>
<p>Despite Company 203's outstanding qualifications and previous experience in<br /> rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at this<br /> time. Therefore I will initiate employment with your firm immediately following<br /> graduation. I look forward to seeing you then.</p>

27560,"<p>The Reverend John Fuzz was pastor of a small congregation in a little Pennsylvania town. One day, he was walking down Main Street and he happened to notice a female member of his congregation sitting in the town bar, drinking beer. The reverend thought this was sinful and not something a member of his congregation should do. He walked through the open door of the bar and sat down next to the woman.    ""Mrs. Fitzgerald,"" the reverend said sternly.""This is no place for a member of my congregation. Why don't you let me take you home?""    ""Sure,"" she said with a slur, obviously very drunk. When Mrs. Fitzgerald stood up from the bar, she began to weave back and forth. The reverend realized that she had had too much to drink and he grabbed hold of her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance and tumbled to the floor. After rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lying on top of Mrs. Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist.    The bartender looked over the bar and said, ""Here, here, buddy, we won't have any of that carrying on in this bar.""    The reverend looked up at the bartender and said, ""But you don't understand, I'm Pastor Fuzz.""    The bartender nodded, ""Well if you're that far into the game, you may as well finish!""</p>

27571,"<p>Two married buddies are out drinking one night when one turns to the other and says, ""You know, I don't know what else to do. Whenever I go home after we've been out drinking, I turn the headlights off before I get to the driveway, shut off the engine and coast into the garage.</p>
<p>I take my shoes off before I go into the house, I sneak up the stairs, I get undressed in the bathroom. I ease into bed and my wife STILL wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late!"" </p>
<p>His buddy looks at him and says, ""Well, you're obviously taking the wrong approach. I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, slap her on the butt and say, 'You as horny as I am?' . . . and, she always acts like she's sound asleep!""</p>

27576,"<p>EDITOR'S NOTE: I've seen a lot of these go by, but they keep changing, so what the heck, here it is again. ----------------------------------Tech Support Request Last year I upgraded Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that the  new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of  space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was  included in the product brochure. In addition, Wife 1.0 installs  itself into all other programs and launches during system  initialization where it monitors all other system activity.  Applications such as Pokernight 10.3 and Beerbash 2.5 no longer run,  crashing the system whenever selected. I can not seem to purge Wife  1.0 from my system. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 1.0  but un-install does not work on this program. Can you help me? - Jonathan Powell Dear Jonathan Powell- This is a very common problem men complain about but is mostly due to  a primary misconception. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 1.0 to  Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a ''UTILITIES &amp;  ENTERTAINMENT'' program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by its creator to run  everything. WARNING DO NOT TRY TO: un-install, delete, or purge the  program from the system once installed. Trying to un-install Wife  1.0 can be disasterious. Doing so may destroy your hard and/or  floppy drive. Trying to un-install or remove Wife 1.0 will destroy  valuable system resources. You can not go back to Girlfriend 1.0  because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this. Some have tried to  install Girlfriend 2.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than  the original system. Look in your manual under Warnings-  Alimony/Child Support. Others have tried to run Girlfriend 1.0 in the  background, while Wife 1.0 is running. Eventually Wife 1.0 detects  Girlfriend 1.0 and a system conflict occurs, this can lead to a non-  recoverable system crash. Some users have tried to download simular  products such as Fling and 1NiteStand. Often their systems have  become infected with a virus. I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and  just deal with the situation. Having Wife 1.0 installed myself, I might also suggest you read the  entire section regarding General Protection Faults (GPFs). You must  assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur.  The best course of action will be to push apologize button then reset  button as soon as lock-up occurs. System will run smooth as long as  you take the blame for all GPFs. Wife 1.0 is a great program but is  very high maintenance. Suggestions for improved operation of Wife 1.0 -Monthly use utilities such as TLC and FTD -Frequently use Communicator 5.0 -Tech Support</p>

A couple of weeks before,<br /> his important birthday, a young lad went to a tailor shop and found the material<br /> he wanted for his first kilt. He took the material to the tailor and said, ""I'd<br /> like ye to make me a kilt with this material here and, if ye don't mind, I'd<br /> like ye to make me a pair of matching underwear for it. I hear it gets a might<br /> drafty up dem tings!"" So the tailor took the material and promised to call the<br /> young lad when the order was completed. A few days later, the tailor called the<br /> lad back to the shop. ""Here's ye kilt, and here's ye matching underwear, and<br /> here's five yards of the material left over. Ye might want to take it home and<br /> keep it in case you want anything else made of it."" So the lad rushed home with<br /> his order, threw the material in his room, and donned his kilt. In his<br /> excitement, he decided to run to his girlfriend's house to show off his new<br /> purchase. Unfortunately, in his excitement, he forgot to don his underwear. When<br /> his girlfriend answered the door, he pointed to his kilt and said, ""well, what'd<br /> ye think?"" ""Ah, but dat's a fine looking kilt,"" she exclaimed. ""Aye, and if ye<br /> like it, ye'll really like what's underneath,"" he stated as he lifted his kilt<br /> to show here. ;Oh, but dat's a dandy,"" his girlfriend shouted admiringly. Still<br /> not realizing that he didn't have his underwear on he exclaimed quite proudly,<br /> ""aye, and if ye like it, I've got five more yards of it at home!""</p>

27612,"<p>Teenager (noun)<br /> 1) A mammal found extensively throughout the planet, often clustered in groups<br /> in front of television sets. Thought to be a member of Homo sapiens due to<br /> physical similarities, though social and emotional behavior leads many<br /> researchers to consider Teenagers to be a completely different species<br /> altogether. Very territorial.<br /> Teenagers are extraordinarily social animals, seeking contact with their peer<br /> groups to such a great extent they will forgo family, chores, food, and<br /> responsibility. The males of the species forage for food constantly and can<br /> consume three times their weight every day. When in full plumage, the males are<br /> usually drab, marked by loose fitting garments which slide off their backsides<br /> and look ridiculous.<br /> The females, on the other hand, sport striking colors under their eyes,<br /> throughout their hair, and on the tips of their fingers. Females often attract<br /> males by wearing garments to accentuate chest development. Males indicate their<br /> approval by staring at the display. The call of the female is complex and<br /> shrill: ""Like, O m'Gosh! O m' Gosh!"" Males are less vocal, signaling to other<br /> males with a salutatory ""Yo. Yo. Yo. S'up? S'up? S'up?""<br /> Teenagers line their nests with discarded undergarments. The females hold<br /> telephone receivers to their ears an average of six hours a day. When challenged<br /> for possession, they snarl and warn intruders, ""I'm doing my HOMEWORK. My<br /> HOMEWORK. My HOMEWORK."" The males lie immobile for hours at a time, conserving<br /> energy and listening to violent electronic signals from radios. Male Teenagers<br /> concentrate on important information by rolling their eyes, shrugging, kicking<br /> dirt and sighing. Females burst into tears and slam doors. Many Homo sapiens<br /> families have a host-to-parasite relationship with one or more than one<br /> Teenager. These host families often develop a resistance to the parasite,<br /> rejecting them some time in the eighteenth year of life. Often, though, this<br /> rejection is merely theoretical, with the Teenager continuing to live off of the<br /> host Homo sapiens family for many years afterward, often at great sacrifice.</p>
<p>2) Of, relating to, and especially EXPLAINING irrational, intolerable, or<br /> inexplicable behavior. (""She's a Teenager."")<br /> 3) A request for sympathy, offered by adult parents to each other in support.<br /> (""I have a Teenager at home."") Often accompanied by sighs, head shaking, tongue<br /> clucking, and shoulder shrugging.</p>

27632,"<p>Because I'm a guy, I must hold the television remote control in my hand while<br /> I watch TV.  If the thing has been misplaced, I'll miss a whole show looking<br /> for it, though one time I was able to survive by holding a calculator.</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, when I lock my keys in the car I will fiddle with a wire<br /> clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we call a road service until<br /> long after hypothermia has set in.  Oh, and when the car isn't running very<br /> well, I will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if I know what I'm<br /> looking at.  If another guy shows up, one of us will say to the other, ""I used<br /> to be able to fix these things, but now with<br /> all these computers and everything, I wouldn't know where to start.""  We will<br /> then drink beer.</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, when I catch a cold I need someone to bring me soup and<br /> take care of me while I lie in bed and moan.  You never get as sick as I do,<br /> so for you this isn't an issue.</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, I can be relied upon to purchase basic groceries at the<br /> store, like milk, or bread.  I cannot be expected to find exotic items like<br /> ""Cumin"" or ""Tofu.""  For all I know these are the same thing.  And never, under<br /> any circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which ""feminine hygiene<br /> product"" is a euphemism.</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, when one of our appliances stops working I will insist on<br /> taking it apart, despite evidence that this will just cost me twice as much<br /> once the repair person gets here and has to put it back together.</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I don't think<br /> we should stop and ask someone.  Why would you listen to a complete stranger-<br /> how the heck could HE know where we're going?</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, there is no need to ask me what I'm thinking about.  The<br /> answer is always either sex or football, though I have to make up something<br /> else when you ask, so don't.</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, I do not want to visit your mother, or have your mother<br /> come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or think about her any more than<br /> I have to.  Whatever you got her for mother's day is ok, I don't need to see<br /> it.  Did you remember to pick up something for my mom, too?</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, I am capable of announcing, ""one more beer and I really<br /> have to go,"" and mean it every single time I say it, even when it gets to the<br /> point that the one bar closes and my buddies and I have to go hunt down<br /> another.  I will find it increasingly hilarious to have my pals call you to<br /> tell you I'll be home soon, and no, I don't understand why you threw all my<br /> clothes into the front yard.  What's the<br /> connection?</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, you don't have to ask me if I liked the movie.  Chances<br /> are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't.</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy, I think what you're wearing is fine.  I thought what you<br /> were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too.  Either pair of shoes is fine.<br /> With the belt or without it looks fine.  Your hair is fine.  You look fine.<br /> Can we just go now?</p>
<p> Because I'm a guy and this is, after all, the 90's, I will share equally in<br /> the housework.  You do the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning, and the dishes.<br /> I'll do the rest.</p>

27635,"<p>This memo is to announce the development of a new software system which will be Year 2000 compliant. This program is known as 'Millennia Year Application Software System' (MYASS). </p>
<p>Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to everyone. We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at MYASS. We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands. </p>
<p>Some employees have begun using the program already. This morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. Some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of MYASS. Last week my secretary said to me, 'I'm a little nervous, I never put anything in MYASS before.' I helped her through the first time and afterward she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even ready to kiss MYASS. </p>
<p>There have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS. In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS. This database will encompass all information associated with the business. </p>
<p>As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in MYASS. As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, 'here, stick this in MYASS.' It will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond, 'Here it is, I just pulled it out of MYASS.'</p>

<p>""But mother, won't this be stealing work from the unionized people who have struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages between various people in the woods?""</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood's mother assured her that she had called the union boss and gotten a special compassionate mission exemption form.</p>
<p>""But mother, aren't you oppressing me by ordering me to do this?""</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood's mother pointed out that it was impossible for women to oppress each other, since all women were equally oppressed until all women were free.</p>
<p>""But mother, then shouldn't you have my brother carry the basket, since he's an oppressor, and should learn what it's like to be oppressed?""</p>
<p>And Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her brother was attending a special rally for animal rights of community.</p>
<p>""But won't I be oppressing Grandma, by implying that she's sick and hence unable to independently further her own selfhood?""</p>
<p>But Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her grandmother wasn't actually sick or incapacitated or mentally handicapped in any way, although that was not to imply that any of these conditions were inferior to what some people called ""health"".</p>
<p>Thus Red Riding Hood felt that she could get behind the idea of delivering the basket to her grandmother, and so she set off.</p>
<p>Many people believed that the forest was a foreboding and dangerous place, but Red Riding Hood knew that this was an irrational fear based on cultural paradigms instilled by a patriarchal society that regarded the natural world as an exploitable resource, and hence believed that natural predators were in fact intolerable competitors.</p>
<p>Other people avoided the woods for fear of thieves and deviants, but Red Riding Hood felt that in a truly classless society all marginalized peoples would be able to ""come out"" of the woods and be accepted as valid lifestyle role models.</p>
<p>On her way to Grandma's house, Red Riding Hood passed a woodchopper, and wandered off the path, in order to examine some flowers.</p>
<p>She was startled to find herself standing before a Wolf, who asked her what was in her basket.</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood's teacher had warned her never to talk to strangers, but she was confident in taking control of her own budding sexuality, and chose to dialogue with the Wolf.</p>
<p>She replied, ""I am taking my Grandmother some healthful snacks in a gesture of solidarity.""</p>
<p>The Wolf said, ""You know, my dear, it isn't safe for a little girl to walk through these woods alone.""</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood said, ""I find your sexist remark offensive in the extreme, but I will ignore it because of your traditional status as an outcast from society, the stress of which has caused you to develop an alternative and yet entirely valid worldview. Now, if you'll excuse me, I would prefer to be on my way.""</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood returned to the main path, and proceeded towards her Grandmother's house.</p>
<p>But because his status outside society had freed him from slavish adherence to linear, Western-style thought, the Wolf knew of a quicker route to Grandma's house.</p>
<p>He burst into the house and ate Grandma, a course of action affirmative of his nature as a predator.</p>
<p>Then, unhampered by rigid, traditionalist gender role notions, he put on Grandma's nightclothes, crawled under the bedclothes, and awaited developments.</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood entered the cottage and said, ""Grandma, I have brought you some cruelty free snacks to salute you in your role of wise and nurturing matriarch.""</p>
<p>The Wolf said softly ""Come closer, child, so that I might see you.""</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood said, ""Goodness! Grandma, what big eyes you have!""</p>
<p>""You forget that I am optically challenged.""</p>
<p>The Wolf could not take any more of these specist slurs, and, in a reaction appropriate for his accustomed milieu, he leaped out of bed, grabbed Little Red Riding Hood, and opened his jaws so wide that she could see her poor Grandmother cowering in his belly.</p>
<p>""Aren't you forgetting something?"" Red Riding Hood bravely shouted. ""You must request my permission before proceeding to a new level of intimacy!""</p>
<p>The Wolf was so startled by this statement that he loosened his grasp on her.</p>
<p>At the same time, the woodchopper burst into the cottage, brandishing an ax.</p>
<p>""Hands off!"" cried the woodchopper.</p>
<p>""And what do you think you're doing?"" cried Little Red Riding Hood. ""If I let you help me now, I would be expressing a lack of confidence in my own abilities, which would lead to poor self esteem and lower achievement scores on college entrance exams.""</p>
<p>""Last chance, sister! Get your hands off that endangered species! This is an FBI sting!"" screamed the woodchopper, and when Little Red Riding Hood nonetheless made a sudden motion, he sliced off her head.</p>
<p>""Thank goodness you got here in time,"" said the Wolf. ""The brat and her grandmother lured me in here. I thought I was a goner.""</p>
<p>""No, I think I'm the real victim, here,"" said the woodchopper. ""I've been dealing with my anger ever since I saw her picking those protected flowers earlier. And now I'm going to have such a trauma. Do you have any aspirin?""</p>
<p>""Sure,"" said the Wolf.</p>
<p>""Thanks.""</p>
<p>""I feel your pain,"" said the Wolf, and he patted the woodchopper on his firm, well padded back, gave a little belch, and said ""Do you have any Maalox?""</p>

'Would it help if I sent the judge a box of cigars?' 'Oh no! This judge is a stickler or ethical behavior. A stunt like that would prejudice him against you.

27682,"<p>Ribbons for Snoring</p>
<p>A woman walks into a restaraunt to have lunch with an old friend of hers. When she sees her old friend she is looking very tired and pale. She asks her friend what the problem is and she says that she isnt getting any sleep due to her husbands snoring at night. She says, ""oh i know a good remedy for that, all you have to do is when he starts to snore, find a blue ribbon and tie it around his privates."" Her friend then agrees to try it out that night.<br /> That night she wakes up to her husbands snoring and decides to try her friends method of curing it. So she goes into her closet and finds a blue ribbon and proceeds to tie it around his privates. Her husband immediately stops snoring and she says this is wonderful and then dozes off to sleep. About an hour later she wakes up to snoring again, looks over at her husband and hes not snoring and then looks to the floor and sees that the dog is snoring. So she decides to try the method on the dog. She goes into the closet but can only find a red ribbon. So she ties it around the dogs privates and the dog stops snoring.<br /> About and hour later the husband gets up to go to the restroom and naturally the dog follows him. He looks down and sees a blue ribbon, and then looks at the dog and sees a red ribbon, and he says, ""Rover i dont know where we've been or what we've been doin but we won first and second prize!""</p>

''Now what is the big thing on the end of the penis<br /> called?''<br /> ''Why that there is called the head of the penis.''<br /> ''I do declare!'' exclaimed the young woman.

27695,"<p>Introductory Chemistry at Duke has been taught for about a zillion years by<br /> Professor Bonk (really), and his course is semi-affectionately known as<br /> ""Bonkistry"". He has been around forever, so I wouldn't put it past him to come<br /> up with something like this. </p>
<p>Anyway, one year there were these two guys who were taking Chemistry and who<br /> did pretty well on all of the quizzes and the mid-terms and labs, etc., such<br /> that going into the final they had a solid A. These friends were so confident<br /> going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chem<br /> final was on Monday), they decided to go up to U Virginia and party with some<br /> friends up there. </p>
<p>They did this and had a great time. However, with their hangovers and<br /> everything, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until<br /> early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found Professor<br /> Bonk after the final and explained to him why they missed the final. They told<br /> him that they went up to UVA for the weekend, and had planned to come back in<br /> time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a<br /> spare and couldn't get help for a long time and so were late getting back to<br /> campus. </p>
<p>Bonk thought this over and then agreed that they could make up the final on<br /> the following day. The two guys were elated, relieved and very proud of their<br /> story. So, they studied that night and went in the next day at the time Bonk had<br /> told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test<br /> booklet and told them to begin. </p>
<p>They looked at the first problem, which was something simple about morality<br /> and solutions and was worth 5 points. ""Cool,"" they thought, ""this is going to be<br /> easy."" They did that problem and turned the page. They were unprepared, however,<br /> for what they saw on the next page... </p>

27696,"<p>Memo to all students:</p>
<p>In order to assure the highest levels of quality work and<br /> productivity from students, it will be our policy to keep all<br /> students well taught through our program of SPECIAL HIGH<br /> INTENSITY TEACHING (S.H.I.T.).</p>
<p>We are trying to give our students more S.H.I.T. than anyone<br /> else. If you feel that you do not receive your share of S.H.I.T.<br /> on the course, please see your lecturer. You will be immediately<br /> placed at the top of the S.H.I.T. list, and our lecturers are<br /> especially skilled at seeing that you get all the S.H.I.T. you<br /> can handle.</p>
<p>Students who don't take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in<br /> DEPARTMENTAL EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION PROGRAMS (D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T.).</p>
<p>Those who fail to take D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T. seriously will have to<br /> go to EDUCATIONAL ATTITUDE TRAINING (E.A.T. S.H.I.T.). Since our<br /> lecturers took S.H.I.T. before they graduated, they don't have<br /> to do S.H.I.T. anymore, and are all full of S.H.I.T. already.</p>
<p>If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be interested in a job<br /> teaching others. We can add your name to our BASIC UNDERSTANDING<br /> LECTURE LIST (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).</p>
<p>For students who are intending to pursue a career in management<br /> and consulting, we will refer you to the department of<br /> MANAGERIAL OPERATIONAL RESEARCH EDUCATION (M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.).<br /> This course emphasizes how to manage M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.</p>
<p>If you have further questions, please direct them to our HEAD OF<br /> TEACHING, SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING (H.O.T. S.H.I.T.).</p>
<p>Thank you, BOSS IN GENERAL, SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TEACHING<br /> (B.I.G. S.H.I.T.)</p>
<p>PS. Now send this S.H.I.T. to 5 people who need S.H.I.T. in<br /> their life, just not the same person who sent you this S.H.I.T.,<br /> they have already had their fill of S.H.I.T. Thank You for your<br /> time.</p>

27725,"<p>A young vampire bat came flapping in from the night, covered in fresh blood and perched himself on the roof of the cave to get some sleep.<br /> Before long, all the other bats smelled the blood and began hassling him about where he got it. He was tired and needing a rest, so he told them to please leave him alone. However, it was clear that he wasn't going to get any sleep until he satisfied their curiosity. </p>
<p>""OK!"" he said with exasperation, ""follow me,"" and he flew out of the cave with hundreds of bats following close behind him. </p>
<p>Down through the valley they went, across the river and into the deep forest. Finally he slowed down and all the other bats excitedly gathered around him. </p>
<p>""Do you see that tree over there?"" he asked. </p>
<p>""Yes, yes, yes!"" the bats all screamed in a frenzy. </p>
<p>""Good,"" said the first bat, ""Because I DIDN'T!""</p>

<p>He would come home from work and compliment her on her Beautiful Buns;  as<br /> she was doing the dishes he would expound on the virtues of her Beautiful<br /> Buns; even at church, he would lean over over and whisper to her what he<br /> wanted to do with those Beautiful Buns.</p>
<p>When his birthday arrived, the wife wanted to do something really<br /> special, she decided to have the words ""Beautiful Buns"" tatooed to her<br /> butt.</p>
<p>She went down to the tatoo parlor, but they said it would cost $500.  This<br /> being a bit more than he was prepared to spend, she asked what she could<br /> get for $50.</p>
<p>After a bit of discussion they decided that for $50 the guy<br /> would tatoo just a ""B"" and a ""B"" on each cheek.</p>

He started out as a hairdresser and is<br /> STILL a hairdresser after 15 years. In fact I just found out that he's gay and<br /> has SEVERAL boyfriends.

27738,"<p>At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the<br /> computer industry with the auto industry and stated: ''If GM had kept up with<br /> technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five<br /> dollar cars that got 1000 miles to the gallon.'' </p>
<p>In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating<br /> (by Mr. Welch himself): </p>
<p>If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars<br /> with the following characteristics: </p>
<p>1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day. </p>
<p>2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new<br /> car. </p>
<p>3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would<br /> just accept this, restart and drive on. </p>
<p>4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car<br /> to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall<br /> the engine. </p>
<p>5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought ''Car95'' or<br /> ''CarNT.'' But then you would have to buy more seats. </p>
<p>6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five<br /> times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five per cent<br /> of the roads. </p>
<p>7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced<br /> by a single ''general car default'' warning light. </p>
<p>8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt. </p>
<p>9. The airbag system would say ''Are you sure?'' before going off. </p>
<p>10. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and<br /> refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the<br /> key, and grab hold of the radio antenna. </p>
<p>11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand<br /> McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor<br /> want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's<br /> performance to diminish by 50% or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for<br /> investigation by the Justice Department. </p>
<p>12. Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to<br /> drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same<br /> manner as the old car. </p>
<p>13. You'd press the ''start'' button to shut off the engine.</p>

27748,"<p>CHILI COOK-OFFS</p>
<p>NOTE: Please take time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third is even better. </p>
<p>For those of you who have lived in Texas, you know how true this is! </p>
<p>They actually have a chili cook-off about the time the rodeo comes to town. It takes up a major portion of the parking lot at the Astrodome! You<br /> will likely want to read this behind closed doors because, if you are like<br /> me, you will be howling out loud.</p>
<p>INEXPERIENCED CHILI TASTER</p>
<p>Notes from An Inexperienced Chili Tester Named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast: ""Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. </p>
<p>The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge’s table asking directions to the beer wagon, when the call came. </p>
<p>I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told men I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted."" Here are the scorecards from the event:</p>
<p>CHILI # 1 MIKE'S MANIAC MOBSTER MONSTER CHILI</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.</p>
<p>FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out, I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.</p>
<p>CHILI # 2 ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor needs more peppers to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>FRANK: Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when<br /> they saw the look on my face.</p>
<p>CHILI # 3 FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: A bean less chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.</p>
<p>FRANK: Call the EPA; I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is<br /> in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.</p>
<p>CHILI # 4 BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.</p>
<p>FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it, is it possible to burnout taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. Bitch is starting to look HOT just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac?</p>
<p>CHILI # 5 LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very Impressive.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.</p>
<p>FRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. </p>
<p>The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage, Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. </p>
<p>It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop<br /> screaming. Screw those rednecks!</p>
<p>CHILI # 6 VERA’S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.</p>
<p>FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. </p>
<p>I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. </p>
<p>No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally; she must be kinkier than I thought. </p>
<p>Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!</p>
<p>CHILI # 7 SUSAN’S SCREEMING SENSATION CHILI</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. </p>
<p>I should take note that I am worried about Judge Number 3, He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. </p>
<p>My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. </p>
<p>At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.</p>
<p>CHILI # 8 LESTER'S LAST OF THE RED-HOT LOVER'S CHILI</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare it's existence.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. </p>
<p>Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. </p>
<p>Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chili?</p>

27752,"<p>Dear Mom and Dad:</p>
<p>It has been six months since I left for college. I'm sorry I<br /> haven't written more often and I'm very sorry for my<br /> unthoughtfulness. I'm sure you have been worried about me.</p>
<p>Let me bring you up to date, but before you read on, please sit<br /> down Ok? Don't read any further unless you're sitting down.</p>
<p>Ok? Good.</p>
<p>I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the<br /> concussion I got from jumping out of the window of my dormitory<br /> when it caught on fire several months ago, are pretty much<br /> healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital! Mom always<br /> said the girls in our family heal fast.</p>
<p>In fact, I can almost see normally again and I only get<br /> headaches three times a day now.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump were<br /> witnessed by a gas station attendant who immediately called 911.<br /> He's so sweet. He even visited me in the hospital, and since I<br /> had nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dorm, he was kind<br /> enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really<br /> a basement room, but it's kind of cute.</p>
<p>He really is a good person with a kind heart. We have fallen<br /> deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set<br /> the exact date yet, but I'm sure that it will be before I start<br /> to show. That's right, Mom and Dad, I'm pregnant! I know how<br /> much you are looking forward to being grandparents, and I know<br /> that you will give that baby the same love, devotion and tender<br /> care you gave me when I was growing up.</p>
<p>We would get married now, but we both failed our premarital<br /> blood tests because of some minor infection. He told me about it<br /> beforehand, but dumb me, I carelessly caught it anyway. Not to<br /> worry though, the doctor said my daily penicillin injections<br /> should clear it up by next month.</p>
<p>I know you will welcome him into our family with open arms. He<br /> is kind, and although not well educated, he is ambitious -- just<br /> like Dad!</p>
<p>Also, he is of a different race and religion than ours, but I<br /> know, after all your years of teaching me tolerance, that you<br /> won't mind the fact that he is somewhat darker than we are. I'm<br /> sure you will love him as I do. His family background is good<br /> too! I am told that his father is an important gun bearer in his<br /> native African village. That's an important government position<br /> where he comes from. Well, I guess that's all! Now you know why<br /> I wanted you to sit down when you read this letter.</p>
<p>Now that I've brought you up to date, I just wanted to let you<br /> know there was no dormitory fire, I didn't suffer a concussion<br /> or a skull fracture, I wasn't in the hospital, I'm not pregnant,<br /> I'm not engaged, I don't have syphilis and there is no boyfriend<br /> of another race or religion in my life; however, I DID vote for<br /> Gov. Bush, and I just wanted you both to see this in its proper<br /> perspective.</p>
<p>Your loving daughter,</p>
<p>-Chelsea</p>
<p>P.S. Stanford is great... I love it, though I miss you both<br /> terribly...and Socks, too!</p>
<p>P.P.S. Dad, please give my best to Monica and the others.</p>

27760,"<p>A man had recently gone through a messy divorce to his wife of 10 years.  Part of the settlement was that for every dollar he made, she would get 2/3 of it.  If he made $300, she would get $200 and he would get $100.  So, she would always get twice as much as he did.One day on a jog, he found a corked bottle lying on the ground, and of course, when he rubbed on it to try to clean it off, a genie came out.'You know the drill,' said the genie.  'You get three wishes, but be aware that for everything you wish for, you ex-wife gets twice as much.  That was in your settlement and I am obligated to stick to that.''Yea, OK,' said the man.  'For my first wish, I want a million dollars.''Done,' said the genie.  'But now your wife has 2 million.''I know, I know...' said the man.  'Now I wish for a mansion and a matching sports car in the garage.''Done,' said the genie.  'But now your wife has a mansion twice your size and two matching sports cars in the garage.''I know, I know...' said the man.  'Now, for my last wish, I want you to beat me half to death.'</p>

27814,"<p>To the citizens of the united states of america: </p>
<p>in light of your failure to elect a president of the usa and thus to govern<br /> yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence,<br /> effective today. </p>
<p>her sovereign majesty queen elizabeth ii will resume monarchial duties over<br /> all states, commonwealths and other territories. except utah, which she does not<br /> fancy. your new prime minister (the rt. hon. tony blair, mp for the 97.85% of<br /> you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders)<br /> will appoint a minister for america without the need for further elections.<br /> congress and the senate will be disbanded. a questionnaire will be circulated<br /> next year to determine whether any of you noticed. </p>
<p>to aid in the transition to a british crown dependency, the following rules<br /> are introduced with immediate effect: </p>
<p>1. you should look up ""revocation"" in the oxford english dictionary.<br /> then look up ""aluminium"" . check the pronunciation guide. you will be amazed<br /> at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. generally, you should raise<br /> your vocabulary to acceptable levels. </p>
<p>look up ""vocabulary"". using the same twenty seven words interspersed with<br /> filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient<br /> form of communication. look up ""interspersed"". </p>
<p>2. there is no such thing as ""us english"". we will let microsoft know on your<br /> behalf. </p>
<p>3. you should learn to distinguish the english and australian accents. it<br /> really isn't that hard. </p>
<p>4. hollywood will be required occasionally to cast english actors as the good<br /> guys. </p>
<p>5. you should relearn your original national anthem, god save the queen, but<br /> only after fully carrying out task 1. we would not want you to get confused and<br /> give up half way through. </p>
<p>6. you should stop playing american football. there is only one kind of<br /> football. what you refer to as american football is not a very good game. the<br /> 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have<br /> noticed that no one else plays american"" football. you will no longer be allowed<br /> to play it, and should instead play proper football. </p>
<p>initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. it is a difficult<br /> game. those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which<br /> is similar to american football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every<br /> twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). we are hoping<br /> to get together at least a us rugby sevens side by 2005. </p>
<p>7. you should declare war on quebec and france, using nuclear weapons if they<br /> give you any merde. the 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world<br /> outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. the russians have never been<br /> the bad guys. merde is french for ""s***"" </p>
<p>8. july 4th is no longer a public holiday. november 8th will be a new national<br /> holiday, but only in england. it will be called indecisive day. </p>
<p>9. all american cars are hereby banned. they are crap and it is for your own<br /> good. when we show you german cars, you will understand what we mean. </p>
<p>10. please tell us who killed jfk. it's been driving us crazy. </p>
<p>thank you for your cooperation.</p>

27822,"<p>A principal of a small middle school had a problem with a few of the older girls starting to use lipstick. When applying it in the bathroom they would then press their lips to the mirror and leave lip prints. Before it got out of hand he thought of a way to stop it. He gathered all the girls together that wore lipstick and told them he wanted to meet with them in the ladies room at 2pm. </p>
<p>They gathered at 2pm and found the principal and the school custodian waiting for them. The principal explained that it was becoming a problem for the custodian to clean the mirror every night. He said he felt the ladies did not fully understand just how much of a problem it was and he wanted them to witness just how hard it was to clean. </p>
<p>The custodian then demonstrated. He took a long brush on a handle out of a box. He then dipped the brush in the nearest toilet, moved to the mirror and proceeded to remove the lipstick. That was the last day the girls pressed their lips on the mirror.</p>

Her step-sister told her<br /> she wasn't aloud to go, but she wanted to go so bad!!!  That<br /> night while the ball was going on, her fairy godmother came and<br /> told her she will make her a different person so she could go to<br /> the ball.</p>
<p>""That is not the problem fairy godmother,"" Cinderella said</p>
<p>""What is,"" asked the godmother</p>
<p>Cinderella then said, ""I have my period, so I don't want to<br /> bleed all over the place.""</p>

<p>""Ok ok,"" said Cinderella, ""I will Thank You Godmother!""</p>
<p>So Cinderella went to the ball and was having so much fun! Well<br /> 12:00 rolled around, and she was still dancing and having a<br /> great time!  So the fairy godmother told herself, ok I will give<br /> her until 1:00.  1:00 came around, and she still hadn't changed<br /> it.  So then the godmother said to herself, i will give her<br /> until 1:30 no later.</p>
<p>1:30 came around and still she hadn't taken it out, but the<br /> godmother said to herself ""oh well, i have to change it into a<br /> pumpkin!""  When Cinderella came home at 3:00 in the morning, the<br /> fairy godmother said to her, ""so did it change to a pumpkin?""</p>

<p>Osama has probably seen 100 degree plus summers in Afghanistan, but he doesn't have fire ants to go with it. If he did, he wouldn't be sleeping on the ground in his cave.</p>
<p>He talks of pain and suffering he is going to inflict on us. He doesn't know what pain is until he gets kicked by a green broke, two year old colt in a freezing rain.</p>
<p>Germ warfare? Texas ticks will give you Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Lime disease, blister beetles kill your horse, green bugs destroy a wheat crop, and termites eat your house. Anthrax has killed Texas cattle for over 125 years.</p>
<p>What's new? Our prairie dogs carry the plague, armadillos carry leprosy, and our bats and skunks carry rabies. We have rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water moccasins. Ho hum.</p>
<p>They talk of gas and biological warfare. They have never pulled in behind a cattle truck while its raining, or ridden in the front seat of a pick-up between two cowboys after they have just eaten a big bowl of Texas Red Beans.</p>
<p>Texas ain't for sissies! We have posted signs all over the state that say ""Don't mess with Texas!"" Osama, consider yourself warned!</p>

27845,"<p>There was an expectant father who had spent quite some time waiting for the<br /> offspring to arrive - at his in-laws' place.</p>
<p>As his leave balance had gone into the red, he tells his father-in-law, ""When<br /> my son comes, do not call up my office and say that I have become a father of a<br /> boy because I'll have to shell out a lot for parties. Just leave me a message<br /> that the clock has arrived. This will be our code for the arrival of the baby.""</p>
<p>The offspring does finally arrive one day, but it's a daughter. The<br /> father-in-law now thinks to himself, ""If I tell him that the clock has not<br /> arrived, he'll misunderstand and think that something has happened to the baby<br /> and come rushing over�.</p>
<p>So the father-in-law left the following message: ""The clock has arrived, but<br /> the pendulum is missing�.</p>

27848,"<p>They had been having a few beers at the bar together recounting old times when the call of nature caused them to line up at the same time, still deep in conversation. But Fred could hardly ignore the fact that Chas was very well endowed. ""I say, that's a remarkable donger you have there old boy,"" Fred was prompted to remark. ""Wasn't always that way,"" replied Chas. ""Medical science can do wonders with transplants these days,"" he said. ""I got this done over in Harley St, England. Cost a thousand bucks, but as you can see, well worth every cent."" Fred was envious. In fact, he packed his bag that night and flew off to the Old Dart first thing. It was a good six months later before he ran into his old friend once again and Fred could hardly wait to tell him that he had taken his advice and was well pleased with the result. ""But Chas, I will tell you something else,"" said Fred. ""You were diddled. I got mine for $500, not a thousand."" Chas could hardly believe it. Same address in Harley St, same doctor. Complaining that he had been ripped off, he asked Fred if he could have a look. Once more they lined up at the porcelain and when Chas took a peek over the partition the worried frown which had creased his face disappeared. ""No wonder,"" he laughed. ""That's my old one!""</p>

<p>02. Don't write anything down. Ever. We can play back the error messages from here.</p>
<p>03. When an I.T. person says he's coming right over, go for coffee. That way you won't be there when we need your password. It's nothing for us to remember 700 screen saver passwords.</p>
<p>04. When you call the help desk, state what you want, not what's keeping you from getting it. We don't need to know that you can't get into your mail because your computer won't power on at all.</p>
<p>05. When I.T. support sends you an E-Mail with high importance, delete it at once. We're just testing.</p>
<p>06. When an I.T. person is eating lunch at his desk, walk right in and spill your guts right out. We exist only to serve.</p>
<p>07. Send urgent email all in uppercase. The mail server picks it up and flags it as a rush delivery.</p>
<p>08. When the photocopier doesn't work, call computer support. There's electronics in it.</p>
<p>09. When something's wrong with your home PC, dump it on an I.T. person's chair with no name, no phone number and no description of the problem. We love a puzzle.</p>
<p>10. When an I.T. person tells you that computer screens don't have cartridges in them, argue. We love a good argument.</p>
<p>11. When an I.T. person tells you that he'll be there shortly, reply in a scathing tone of voice: ""And just how many weeks do you mean by shortly?"" That motivates us.</p>

<p>""What's wrong, miss? Are you ok?"" he asked. </p>
<p>Wiping tears from her eyes, she looked up at him and said, ""My boyfriend just dumped me, and today is my birthday. Nice gift, isn't it?"" </p>
<p>The waiter talked with her a few moments, and was able to get her to stop crying. He kept a close eye on her, and when she had finished her meal, he went into the kitchen, cut a large slice from the best cake on the menu, and stuck a candle in it. He lit the candle, and brought it to her table. She looked very happy, and he was glad. He said, ""Make a wish and blow!"" </p>
<p>She closed her eyes, and made her wish. Then she came up to the waiter, got down on her knees, unzipped his pants, pulled out his cock, and started sucking on it. He had no idea why she was doing this, but she was really into it, sucking away, and playing with his balls. He knew that he should stop her-they didn't even know each others names-but hey, when you've got a hot blonde sucking on your cock, like you're really going to say, no don't suck it. </p>
<p>He stood there, enjoying every moment, and when she made him cum, he exploded inside her mouth, and she swallowed every drop of his huge, hot load. She looked up at him with a smile, and said, ""Did you like it?"" </p>
<p>He said, ""Yes, of course, you suck cock great...but I'm just wondering why you suddenly started sucking my cock??"" </p>
<p>She looked confused. ""Well, I was just doing what you told me to."" </p>

As he is shown the parrot, the assistant tells him<br /> that the parrot's name is Chet and the parrot will only sing if<br /> you warm up his feet with a match. So the assistant pulls out a<br /> match and lights it, he then puts it under the parrots foot.<br /> This causes the parrot to sing ""Jingle bells"", and the man say,""<br /> Wow, i've never seen anything like this.""

27898,"<p>Three bulls heard via the grapevine that the rancher was going to bring yet another bull onto the ranch, and the prospect raised a discussion among them.</p>
<p>First Bull: ""Boys, we all know I've been here 5 years. Once we settled our differences, we agreed on which 100 of the cows would be mine. Now, I don't know where this newcomer is going to get HIS cows, but I ain't givin' him any of mine.""</p>
<p>Second Bull: ""That pretty much says it for me, too. I've been here 3 years and have earned my right to the 50 cows we've agreed are mine. I'll fight 'em till I run him off or kill 'im, but I AM KEEPIN' ALL MY COWS.""</p>
<p>Third Bull: ""I've only been here a year, and so far you guys have only let me have 10 cows to ""take care of"". I may not be as big as you fellows (yet) but I am young and virile, so I simply MUST keep all MY cows.""</p>
<p>They had just finished their big talk when an eighteen-wheeler pulls up in the middle of the pasture with only ONE ANIMAL IN IT: the biggest Son-of-Another-Bull these guys had ever seen! At 4700 pounds, each step he took toward the ground strained the steel ramp to the breaking point.</p>
<p>First Bull: ""You know, it's actually been some time since I really felt I was doing all my cows justice, anyway. I think I can spare a few for our new friend.""</p>
<p>Second Bull: ""I'll have plenty of cows to take care of if I just stay on the opposite end of the pasture from HIM. I'm certainly not looking for an argument.""</p>
<p>They look over at their young friend, the 3rd bull, and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns, and snorting -- the bull's equivalent of an Ape's beating his chest or Man's bone-chilling, war-like cry of ""Stay away from my Woman, Vato!!</p>
<p>First Bull: ""Son, let me give you some advice real quick. Let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it.""</p>

27900,"<p>A Captain in the foreign legion was transferred to a desert outpost. On his orientation tour he noticed a very old, seedy looking camel tied out back of the enlisted men's barracks. He asked the Sergeant leading the tour, ""What's the camel for?"" The Sergeant replied, ""Well sir, it's a long way from anywhere, and the men have natural sexual urges, so when they do,we have the camel."" The Captain said ""Well, if it's good for morale, then I guess it's all right with me."" After he had been at the fort for about 6 months, the Captain could not stand it anymore, so he told his Sergeant, ""BRING IN THE CAMEL!!!"" The Sarge shrugged his shoulders and led the camel into the Captain's quarters. The Captain got a foot stool and proceeded to have vigorous sex with the camel. As he stepped, satisfied, down from the stool and was buttoning his pants he asked the Sergeant, ""Is that how the enlisted men do it?"" The Sergeant replied, ""Well sir, they usually just use it to ride into town.""</p>

Possessors of a cultivated palate will admire the initial assault on the taste buds which comes from the careful and loving blending of animal manure and perished jock straps strained through an old miner's sock. The maturing in small pigs' bladders gives it a very definite nose. </p>
<p>Marketed under the Saviour Brand (9 out of 10 people who drink it for the first time exclaim 'Je-e-esus Chri-ist'). </p>
<p>Caution: Keep away from 'naked flames' (both old and new). </p>

27958,"<p>About a century or two ago, the Pope decided that all the Jews had to leave the Vatican. Naturally there was big uproar from the Jewish community. So the Pope made a deal. He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave.<br /> The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked a middle-aged man named Moishe to represent them. Moishe asked for one addition to the debate. To make it more interesting, neither side would be allowed to talk. The Pope agreed. </p>
<p>The day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, ""I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay."" </p>
<p>An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened? The Pope said: ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?"" </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. ""What happened?"" they asked. ""Well,"" said Moishe, ""first he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here."" ""And then?"" asked a woman. ""I don't know,"" said Moishe. ""He took out his lunch and I took out mine...""</p>

27974,"<p>Members of Congress...people of America....I banged her. </p>
<p>I banged her like a cheap gong. Which is not news, folks, because if you think Monica Lewinsky was the only skin flute player in my orchestra, you haven't been paying attention. The only babes in DC I haven't tried to do are the First Lady, Reno, Albright, and Shalala, mostly because they're a little older than I like and they have legs that former Houston Oiler Earl Campbell would envy. Which isn't to say I don't appreciate Hillary...I do. If not for the ice-water coursing through her veins, I'd be pumping gas into farm equipment in Hope, Arkansas, and she'd be married to the President. </p>
<p>So, let me set the record straight. I dodged the draft, hid FBI files, smoked dope, flipped Whitewater property, set up a new Korean wing in the White House, fired the travel staff, paid hush money to Hubbell, sold the Lincoln bedroom like an upscale Motel 6, and grabbed every ass that entered the Oval Office. Got it? Good. </p>
<p>Six years ago, there's not a man, woman, or child who didn't know I was as horny as Woody Allen. But, you elected me anyway, which turned out to be a good move on your part. Your other choice was Bush, an aging baseball player and part-time resident of some place called ""Kennebunkport."" Before him, it was Reagan, who left the office with the same Alzheimer's he came in with. There was Carter before him who brought you a 17% prime interest rate, smiling the whole time like his lithium drip had just kicked in. Nixon before that coined, but never really understood, the concept of 'plausible deniability,' and almost got a one-way ticket to San Clemente for his crackerjack style of governing. Johnson was an inbred, power-mad war criminal whose major contribution to American society was Agent Orange. And Johnny Kennedy, who was more than a little naughty himself, didn't hang around long enough for America to spot that curious atavistic tic for beaver-wrestling shared by at least a dozen former residents of the White House. </p>
<p>Which brings me back to my point. Since I have been strumming the banjo here at the White House, government is doing more for less. The budget is balanced for the first time since JFK did a one gun salute to Marilyn, a fact the press didn't seem to care about, evidently. Unemployment is so low today a blind felon can get a job as a night-watchman. And the stock market is higher than a D-student on a full gram of dumb-dust, and anyone with a degree from a junior college who can spell 'Internet' has enough money to ponder the annual maintenance cost of his boat, instead of where his or her next meal is coming from. </p>
<p>Bottom line: I'm running a country here and I'm doing it with my pecker showing. What I'm asking for is your support, not a date with your daughter...unless, of course, she's a hotty with thin ankles, and then I'd like to discuss it. I may be a pervert, but I'm also a realist. I know that if the economy was going down the crapper, I'd-a been out on my fat ass after the '96 election. But I'm a lucky pervert-the economy is hotter than Paula Jones in a leather teddy. So think about where you are today and what kind of life you're living before you get too interested in where I'm parking the Presidential limousine</p>

27982,"<p>I love Halloween. It reminds me of my happy childhood days as a student at<br /> Wampus Elementary School in Armonk, N.Y., when we youngsters used to<br /> celebrate Halloween by making decorations out of construction paper and<br /> that white paste that you could eat. This is also how we celebrated<br /> Columbus Day, Washington's Birthday, Lincoln's Birthday, Thanksgiving,<br /> Christmas, Easter, New Year's, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's<br /> Day, Armistice Day, Flag Day, Arbor Day, Thursday, etc. We brought these<br /> decorations home to our parents, who by federal law were required to<br /> attach them to the refrigerator with magnets.</p>
<p>That was a wonderful, carefree time in which to be a youngster or<br /> construction-paper salesperson. But it all ended suddenly one day -- I'll<br /> never forget it -- when the Soviet Union launched the first satellite,<br /> called ``Sputnik'' (which is Russian for ``Little Sput''). Immediately all<br /> the grown-ups in America became hysterical about losing the Space Race,<br /> which led to a paranoid insecurity about our educational system, expressed<br /> in anguished newspaper headlines asking, ``WHY AREN'T OUR KIDS LEARNING IN<br /> SCHOOL?'' I wanted to answer, ``BECAUSE ALL WE EVER DO IS MAKE DECORATIONS<br /> OUT OF CONSTRUCTION PAPER,'' but I couldn't, because my mouth was full of<br /> paste.</p>
<p>But getting back to Halloween: It's still one of the most fun holidays of<br /> the year, as well as one of the most traditional, tracing its origins back<br /> more than 2,000 years to the Druids, an ancient religious cult that<br /> constructed Stonehenge as well as most of the public toilets in England.<br /> The Druids believed that one night each year, at the end of October, the<br /> souls of the dead returned to the world of the living and roamed from<br /> house to house costumed as Power Rangers.</p>
<p>And thus it is that to this day, youngsters come to our door on Halloween<br /> night shouting: ``Trick or treat!'' According to tradition, if we don't<br /> give the youngsters a ``treat,'' their parents will ``sue'' us. That's why<br /> most of us traditionally prepare for Halloween by going to the supermarket<br /> and purchasing approximately eight metric tons of miniature candy bars,<br /> which we dump into a big bowl by the door, ready to hand out to the hordes<br /> of trick-or-treaters.</p>
<p>The irony, of course, is that there ARE no hordes of trick-or-treaters,<br /> not any more. We in the news media make darned sure of that. Every year we<br /> publish dozens of helpful consumer-advice articles, cheerfully reminding<br /> parents of the dangers posed by traffic, perverts, poisoned candy, and<br /> many other Halloween hazards that parents would never think of if we<br /> didn't remind them (``Have fun, but remember that this year more than<br /> 17,000 Americans will die bobbing for apples'').</p>
<p>The result is that many children aren't allowed to go trick-or-treating,<br /> and the ones who ARE allowed out come to your house no later than 4:30<br /> p.m., wearing reflective tape on their Power Rangers costumes and trailed<br /> at close range by their parents, who watch you suspiciously and regard<br /> whatever candy you hand out as though it were unsolicited mail from the<br /> Unabomber.</p>
<p>So for most of Halloween, your doorbell is quiet. This means that you pass<br /> the long night alone, hour after hour, just you and the miniature candy<br /> bars. After a while they start calling seductively to you from their bowl<br /> in their squeaky little voices.</p>
<p>``Hey, Big Boy!'' they call. ``We're going to waste over here!''</p>
<p>As the evening wears on they become increasingly brazen. Eventually they<br /> crawl across the floor, climb up your body, unwrap themselves and force<br /> themselves bodily into your mouth. There's no use hiding in the bathroom,<br /> because they'll just crawl under the door and tie you up with dental floss<br /> and threaten to squeeze toothpaste in your eye unless you eat them. At<br /> least that's what they do to me. By the end of the night my blood has the<br /> same sugar content as Yoo-Hoo.</p>
<p>But eating huge amounts of candy allegedly purchased for youngsters is<br /> only part of the Halloween tradition. The other part is buying a pumpkin<br /> and carving it to make a ``jack-o'-lantern,'' which sits on your front<br /> porch, a festive symbol of the age-old truth -- first discovered by the<br /> Druids -- that there is no practical use for pumpkins.</p>
<p>Here's how to make a traditional jack-o'-lantern:</p>
<p>1. Cut a lid on top of the pumpkin.</p>
<p>2. Pull off the lid and peer down into the slimy, festering pumpkin bowels.</p>
<p>3. Put the lid back on and secure it with 200 feet of duct tape.</p>
<p>(This is also the traditional procedure for stuffing a turkey.)</p>
<p>But however you celebrate Halloween, make sure you remember this important<br /> safety tip: (IMPORTANT SAFETY TIP GOES HERE). Otherwise, you will not<br /> survive the night. I'd give you more details, but right now I need to do<br /> something about these tiny Milky Ways crawling up my legs.</p>

27990,"<p>There was once a lumberjack. He went to the woods each day with<br /> his ax and choped down 15 trees. One day on his way to work he<br /> passed a hardware store. In the window there was a wonderful<br /> chain saw and next to it was a sign that said:</p>
<p>      THIS CHAIN SAW WILL CUT DOWN 50 TREES A DAY!!!<br />                   OWN IT FOR ONLY $40!!</p>
<p>The lumberjack bought it and continued to work. Each day he only<br /> cut down 15 trees a day with his chain saw, so he brought it to<br /> the hardware store and told the clerk that he thought it was<br /> broken. </p>
<p>""Well, sir, let's see..."" The clerk turned it on and a roaring<br /> noise came. ""It seems to be working."" But the lumberjack was<br /> puzzled and he asked, ""What's that noise?!?""</p>
"
27991,"<p>The following was taken from a Florida newspaper: </p>
<p>A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the house in the kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle and somehow, the motorcycle slipped into gear. The man, still holding the handlebars, was dragged through a glass patio door and the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house. </p>
<p>The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room, and found her husband laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle laying next to him and the patio door shattered. The wife ran to the phone and summoned an ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of long steps to the street to direct the paramedics to her husband. After the ambulance arrived and transported the husband to the hospital, the wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside.</p>
<p>Seeing that gas had spilled on the floor, the wife obtained some papers towels, blotted up the gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet. The husband was treated at the hospital and was released to aome home. After arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet and smoked a cigarette.</p>
<p>After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband laying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone and called for an ambulance. The same ambulance crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street.</p>
<p>The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself. She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them tipped the stretcher and dumped the husband out. He fell down the remaining steps and broke his ankle.</p>
