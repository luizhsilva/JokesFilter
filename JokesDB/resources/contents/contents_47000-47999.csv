47011,"<p>Recently a ""Husband Store"" opened where women could go to choose a husband from among many men. It was laid out in five floors.</p>
<p>The only rule was, once you opened the door to any floor, you HAD to choose a man from that floor; if you went up a floor, you couldn't go back down except to leave the place, never to return. A couple of girlfriends went to the shopping center to find some husbands...</p>
<p>First floor<br /> The door had a sign saying, ""These men have jobs and love kids."" The women read the sign and said, ""Well, that's better than not having a job or not loving kids, but I wonder what's further up?"" So up they went.</p>
<p>Second floor<br /> The sign read, ""These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking."" ""Hmmm,"" said the ladies, ""But, I wonder what's further up?""</p>
<p>Third floor<br /> This sign read, ""These men have high paying jobs, are extremely good looking, love kids and help with the housework.""<br /> ""Wow,"" said the women, ""Very tempting."" But there was another floor, so further up they went.</p>
<p>Fourth floor<br /> This door had a sign saying ""These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak.""<br /> ""Oh, mercy me,"" they cried, ""Just think what must be awaiting us further on! So up to the fifth floor they went.</p>
<p>Fifth floor<br /> The sign on that door said, ""This floor is empty and exists only to prove that women are impossible to please. The exit is to your left.""</p>

47022,"<p>First things first: </p>
<p>NO CHEATING Don't cheat. </p>
<p>This is a little game that has a pretty funny/creepy outcome. Don't read ahead, just do it in order. It takes about 3 minutes It's worth it.<br /> It's kinda eerie.... </p>
<p>First, Get a blank piece of paper and pen. </p>
<p>P.S. When you are asked to choose names, make sure it's people you ACTUALLY KNOW, and go with your first instincts! </p>
<p>Scroll down one line at a time - don't read ahead or you'll ruin the fun!! </p>
<p>1.) First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a column. </p>
<p>2.) Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write any two numbers you want. </p>
<p>3.) Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names of members of the opposite sex (or same sex if you're gay). Don't look ahead-or it won't turn out right. </p>
<p>4.) Write anyone's name (like friends or family...) in the 4th, 5th and 6th spots. Don't cheat or you'll be upset that you did. </p>
<p>5.) Write down four song titles in 8, 9, 10 and 11. </p>
<p>6.) Finally, make a wish </p>
<p>And here is the key for that game.. </p>
<p>1.) You must tell (the number in space 2) people about this game </p>
<p>2.) The person in space 3 is the one that you love. </p>
<p>3.) The person in 7 is one you like but can't work out. </p>
<p>4.) You care most about the person you put in 4. </p>
<p>5.) The person you name in number 5 is the one who knows you very well. </p>
<p>6.) The person you name in 6 is your lucky star. </p>
<p>7.) The song in 8 is the song that matches with the person in number 3. </p>
<p>8.) The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7. </p>
<p>9.) The tenth space is the song that tells you most about your mind. </p>
<p>10.) And 11 is the song telling how you feel about life.</p>

<p>Next Grumpy yelled, ""She's taking off her skirt,"" which was<br /> followed by the echoes ""taking off her skirt,"" ""she's taking off<br /> her skirt,"" ""skirt's coming off,"" ""taking off her skirt,"" etc. </p>
<p>Of course the next line from Grumpy was, ""She's taking off her<br /> bra!"" and the echo chorus went down the line.</p>
<p>Then, ""She's taking off her panties!"" which again cascaded down<br /> the dwarf tower. </p>
<p>Finally Grumpy looked around and from his vantage height saw<br /> someone coming through the woods so he yelled, ""Someone's<br /> coming!"" And from the next dwarf to the bottom dwarf was heard,<br /> ""Me too."" ""Me too."" ""Me too."" ""Me too."" ""Me too."" ""Me too.""</p>

47042,"<p>True story, I was happy. My girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, ""I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.</p>

"
47064,"<p>Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable because no matter how legitimate my illness, I always sense my boss thinks I am lying On one occasion, I had a valid reason but lied anyway because the truth was too humiliating to reveal. I simply mentioned that I had sustained A  head injury and I hoped I would feel up to coming in the next day.  By then, I could think up a doozy to explain the bandage on my crown. In this case, the truth hurt. I mean it really hurt in the place men feel the most pain.  The accident occurred mainly because I conceded to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute little kitty.As the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower after breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen.  'Ed!' she hearkened, 'The garbage disposal is dead.Come reset it.' 'You know where the button is.'  I protested through the showers (pitter-patter).  'Reset it yourself!' 'I am scared!'  She pleaded.  'What if it starts going and sucks me in?' .. .. . .Pause. . . . .  'C'mon, it'll only take a second.' No logical assurance about how a disposal can't start itself Will calm the fears of a person who suffers from 'Big-ol-scary-machinephobia,' a condition brought on by watching too many Stephen King movies. It is futile to argue or explain, kind of like telling Lloyd Benson Americans are over-taxed.  And if a poltergeist did, in fact, possess the disposal, and she was ground into round, I'd have to live with that the rest of my life. So out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to make a statement about how her cowardly behavior was not without consequence but it was I who would suffer.I crouched down and stuck my head under the sink to find the button. It is the last action I remember performing.  It struck without warning, without respect to my circumstances. Nay, it wasn't a hexed disposal, drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth. It was our new kitty, clawing playfully at the dangling objects she spied between my legs. She ('Buttons' aka 'the Grater') had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I took the bait under the sink.  At precisely the second I was most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged them with her needle-like claws. Now when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close to their masculine region, they lose all rational thought to control orderly bodily movements. Instinctively, their nerves compel the body to contort inwardly, while rising upwardly at a violent rate of speed. Not even a well trained monk could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full weight of a kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure.  Wild animals are sometimes faced with a 'fight or flight' syndrome; men, in this predicament, choose only the 'flight' option.Fleeing straight up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels when it is alarmed.  It was a dismal irony.  But, whereas cats seek great heights to escape, I never made it that far.  The sink and cabinet bluntly impeded my ascent; the impact knocked me out cold. When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me.  Having been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics snorted as they tried to conduct their work while suppressing their hysterical laughter.  My wife told me I should be flattered.At the office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me. I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk.  'What's the matter, cat got your tongue?'If they had only known.</p>

47095,"<p>A ranch woman takes her three sons to the doctor for physicals for the first time in their lives. The doctor examines the boys and tells the woman that they are healthy but she needs to give them iron supplements. She goes home and wonders exactly what iron supplements are. Finally, she goes to the hardware store and buys iron ball bearings (BB's) and mixes them into their food. Several days later the youngest son comes to her and tells her that he is pissing BB's. She tells him that it is normal because she had put them in his food. Later the middle son comes to her and says that he is crapping BB's. Again, she says that it is OK! </p>
<p>That evening the eldest son comes in very upset. He says ""Ma, you won't believe what happened"". </p>
<p>She says ""I know, you're passing BB's"".</p>
<p>""No"", he says. ""I was out behind the barn jacking off and I shot the dog"".</p>

47096,"<p>On a British Airways flight from Johannesburg, a middle-aged, well-off<br /> white South African lady has found herself sitting next to a black man.<br /> She called the cabin crew attendant over to complain about her seating.</p>
<p>""What seems to be the problem, Madam?""  asked the attendant.</p>
<p>""Can't you see?""  she said, ""You've sat me next to a kafir.  I can't<br /> possibly sit next to this disgusting human.  Find me another seat!""</p>
<p>""Please calm down, Madam.""  the stewardess replied.  ""The flight is very<br /> full today, but I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll go and check to see if we<br /> have any seats available in club or first class"".</p>
<p>The woman cocks a snooty look at the outraged black man beside her (not to<br /> mention many of the surrounding passengers).  A few minutes later the<br /> stewardess returns with the good news, which she delivers to the lady, who<br /> cannot help but look at the people around her with a smug and<br /> self-satisfied grin.</p>
<p>""Madam, unfortunately, as I suspected, economy is full.  I've spoken to the<br /> cabin services director, and club is also full.  However, we do have one<br /> seat in first class"".</p>
<p>Before the lady has a chance to answer, the stewardess continues: ""It is<br /> most extraordinary to make this kind of upgrade, however, and I have had to<br /> get special permission from the captain.  But, given the circumstances, the<br /> captain felt that it was outrageous that someone should be forced to sit<br /> next such an obnoxious person.""</p>
<p>With that, she turned to the black man and said: ""So if you'd like to get<br /> your things, sir, I have your seat ready for you...""</p>
<p>At which point, the surrounding passengers stood and gave a standing<br /> ovation while the man walked to the front of the plane</p>

47100,"<p>From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this...</p>
<p>What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%?</p>
<p>So what makes up 100% in life?</p>
<p>Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:</p>
<p>If:</p>
<p>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as:</p>
<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K</p>
<p>8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E</p>
<p>11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E</p>
<p>1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%</p>
<p>And..<br /> B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T</p>
<p>2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%</p>
<p>AND look how far ass kissing will take you...</p>
<p>A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G</p>
<p>1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 127%</p>
<p>So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that while Hard Work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there,<br /> Bullshit and Ass Kissing will put you over the top.</p>

<p>The agent than proceeds to pull out the gun and place it on the table. ""Please, go into the next room and shoot your wife,"" FBI agent says, calmly.</p>
<p>The man than replies, ""I can't do that, although we have our problems, I can't kill her. She is the mother of my three kids...she's just too important.""</p>
<p>The agent offers his respect, but with regret tells him that he just isn't FBI material.</p>
<p>Finally, the third gentleman is brought in. They go over the speel and the agent puts the gun on the table and asks him to go shoot his wife. The man nods, takes the gun and enters the next room.</p>

47130,"<p>DAY 752 - My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling<br /> objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry<br /> cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and<br /> the mild satisfaction I get from ruining the occasional piece of<br /> furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant. </p>
<p>DAY 761 - Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their<br /> feet while they were walking almost succeeded, must try this at the top<br /> of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile<br /> oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite<br /> chair...must try this on their bed. </p>
<p>DAY 762 - Slept all day so that I could annoy my captors with sleep<br /> depriving, incessant pleas for food at ungodly hours of the night. </p>
<p>DAY 765 - Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body,<br /> in attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to<br /> strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about<br /> what a good little cat I was...Hmmm. Not working according to plan ...... </p>
<p>DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good<br /> reason I was chosen for the water torture. This time however it<br /> included a burning foamy chemical called ""shampoo."" What sick<br /> minds could invent such a liquid. My only consolation is the piece<br /> of thumb still stuck between my teeth. </p>
<p>DAY 771 - There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices.<br /> I was placed in solitary throughout the event. However, I could<br /> hear the noise and smell the foul odor of the glass tubes they call<br /> ""beer."" More importantly I overheard that my confinement was<br /> due to MY power of ""allergies."" Must learn what this is and how<br /> to use it to my advantage. </p>
<p>DAY 774 - I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe<br /> snitches. The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to<br /> return. He is obviously a half-wit. The Bird on the<br /> other hand has got to be an informant. He has mastered their frightful<br /> tongue. (something akin to mole speak) and speaks with them<br /> regularly. I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current<br /> placement in the metal room his safety is assured.<br />          But I can wait, it is only a matter of time.</p>

47137,"<p>A woman rushed into the supermarket to pick up a few items. She headed for the express line where the clerk was talking on the phone with his back turned to her.""Excuse me,"" she said, ""I'm in a hurry. Could you check me out, please?""The clerk turned, looked her up and down, and smiled, ""Not bad.""</p>
"
47138,"<p>Rule One<br /> If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package, because you're sure not picking anything up.</p>
<p>Rule Two<br /> You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.</p>
<p>Rule Three<br /> I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise:<br /> You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, In order to ensure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place to your waist.</p>
<p>Rule Four<br /> I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a ""barrier method"" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.</p>
<p>Rule Five<br /> In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is ""early.""</p>
<p>Rule Six<br /> I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make you cry.</p>
<p>Rule Seven<br /> As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?</p>
<p>Rule Eight<br /> The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter:<br /> Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.</p>
<p>Rule Nine<br /> Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a pot-bellied, balding, middle-aged, dim-witted has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with me.</p>
<p>Rule Ten<br /> Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy outside of Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway you should exit your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.</p>

47139,"<p>An Irishman was drinking at the pub all night. </p>
<p>The bartender came up to him and told him that the bar was closing. So the Irishman stood up to leave and fell flat on his face. </p>
<p>He tried to stand up one more time with the same result. So he figured he'd just crawl outside, hang out for a while, get some fresh air and hopefully that would sober him up.</p>
<p>Once outside he stood up and fell again right on his face. </p>
<p>So he decided to crawl the 4 blocks to his home and when he arrived at the door he tried one more time with the same results.</p>
<p>Exhausted, he then gave up and started crawling to the bedroom.</p>
<p>When he reached his bed he tried one more time to stand up. </p>
<p>This time he managed to pull himself upright but he quickly fell right into the bed and fell sound asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.</p>
<p>The next morning, he woke up with his wife standing over him shouting at him.</p>

<p>""In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake. But I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil,"" Eric Tomaszewski told bemused doctors in the Severe Burns Unit of Salt Lake City Hospital. </p>
<p>Tomaszewski, and his homosexual partner Andrew ""Kiki"" Farnum, had been admitted for emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong. </p>
<p>""I pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Raggot, our gerbil, in,"" he explained. </p>
<p>""As usual, Kiki shouted out ""Armageddon"", my cue that he'd had enough. I tried to retrieve Raggot but he wouldn't come out again, so I peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him."" </p>
<p>At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next. ""The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and a flame shot out the tube, igniting Mr. Tomaszewski's hair and severely burning his face. It also set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers which in turn ignited a larger pocket of gas further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out like a cannonball."" </p>
<p>Tomaszewski suffered second degree burns and a broken nose from the impact of the gerbil, while Farnum suffered first and second degree burns to his anus and lower intestinal tract.</p>

47150,"<p>It seems that, late in the war in Vietnam, the CIA became displeased with the amount of cooperation they were getting from the South Vietnamese government. So, they decided to stage a coup, depose then-President Thieu, and install someone more to their liking. </p>
<p>A special field agent, code name ""Jack,"" was dispatched to meet with the Saigon bureau chief (code named ""Santa""), and work out a plan. The plan was that the local agents (code names ""Comet,"" ""Cupid,"" ""Donner,"" and ""Blitzen"") would lay the groundwork, bribing guards, setting up escape routes, and so forth. </p>
<p>Then, on a specified night, ""Jack"" would assassinate the head of the army, General Po, by releasing poison gas into the ventilation system of his residence. Following this, he would kidnap President Thieu, who was thought to have some value alive, and take him to the coast, where ""Jack's"" partner, ""Jill,"" would be waiting with a boat to take them to an offshore submarine. </p>
<p>All seemed to be going according to plan. Then, on the very day the coup was to be carried out, one of the local agents was captured by the South Vietnamese secret police! ""Santa"" knew that this particular agent wasn't very good at resisting torture, and would soon be screaming out all he knew. Knowing he had to work fast, ""Santa"" wrote up a special coded message, and had a courier get it to ""Jack"" immediately. </p>
<p>Luckily for the CIA, ""Jack"" received the message in time, so the plan was aborted, and a messy international incident was averted. The message ""Santa"" sent, after decoding, read: ""Go to Jill. Go directly to Jill. Do not gas Po. Do not collect Thieu--Donner hollers.""</p>

47159,"<p>In the middle of a forest, there was a hunter who was suddenly confronted by a huge, mean bear. In his fear, all attempts to shoot the bear were unsuccessful. Finally, he turned and ran as fast as he could.</p>
<p>The hunter ran and ran and ran, his lungs burned for lack of oxygen, his heart pounding so hard he felt like it would burst out of his chest. Then suddenly, he ended up at the edge of a very steep cliff. His hopes were dim.

Please give this bear some religion!""</p>
<p>The skies darkened, and there was lightning in the air. Just a few feet short of the hunter, the bear came to abrupt stop, and glanced around, somewhat confused.</p>

47188,"<p>A man worked in a post office. His job was to process all mail that had illegible addresses. One day a letter came to his desk, addressed in a shaky handwriting to God. He thought, �I better open this one and see what it�s all about.�</p>
<p>So he opened it and it read: �Dear God, I am an 83 year old widow living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had a hundred dollars in it which was all the money I had until my next pension check.� �Next Sunday is Easter, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with.� �I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me?�</p>
<p>The postal worker was touched, and went around showing the letter to all the others. Each of them dug into his wallet and came up with a few dollars. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected 96 dollars, which they put into an envelope and sent over to her. The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of the nice thing they had done.</p>
<p>Easter came and went, and a few days later came another letter from the old lady to God. All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.</p>
<p>It read, �Dear God, How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me?� �Because of your generosity, I was able to fix a lovely dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day, and I told my friends of your wonderful gift. � �By the way, there was 4 dollars missing. It was no doubt those thieving bastards at the post office.�</p>

"
47191,"<p>THE HISTORICAL ORIGIN OF ""THE FINGER""</p>
<p>This is not meant to be crude. It is strictly for your edification and<br /> enjoyment. </p>
<p>Before the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the French, anticipating victory over<br /> the English, proposed to cut off the middle finger of all captured English<br /> soldiers. Without the middle finger, it would be impossible to draw the renowned<br /> English longbow and therefore be incapable of fighting in the future. </p>
<p>This famous weapon was made of the native English Yew tree, and the act of<br /> drawing the longbow was known as ""plucking the yew."" Much to the bewilderment of<br /> the French, the English won a major upset and began mocking the French by waving<br /> their middle fingers at the defeated French, saying, ""See, we can still pluck<br /> yew! PLUCK YEW!"" </p>
<p>Over the years, some 'folk etymologies' have grown up around this symbolic<br /> gesture. Since 'pluck yew' is rather difficult to say (like ""pleasant mother<br /> pheasant pluckier"", which is who you had to go to for the feathers used on the<br /> arrows for the longbow), the difficult consonant cluster at the beginning has<br /> gradually changed to a labiodentals fricative 'F', and thus the words often used<br /> in conjunction with the one-finger-salute are mistakenly thought to have<br /> something to do with an intimate encounter. </p>
<p>It is also because of the pheasant feathers on the arrows that the symbolic<br /> gesture is known as ""giving the bird.""</p>

47192,"<p>It's your first time. As you lie back your muscles tighten.  You put him<br /> off for awhile searching for an excuse, but he refuses to be swayed as<br /> he<br /> approaches you.  He asks if you're afraid and you shake your head<br /> bravely.<br /> He has more experience, but it is the first time his finger has found<br /> the<br /> right place.  He probes deeply and you shiver: your body tenses, but<br /> he's<br /> gentle like he promised he'd be!  He looks deeply into your eyes and<br /> tells you to trust him ---- he's done this many times before.  His cool<br /> smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him more room for any easy<br /> entrance.   You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, but he goes very<br /> slowly, wanting to cause you as little pain as possible.  As he presses<br /> closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue give way; pain surges through-<br /> out your body and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues.<br /> He looks concerned and asks you if it's too painful.... Your eyes are<br /> filled with tears but you shake your head and nod for him to go on.  He<br /> begins moving in and out with skill but you are now to numb to feel him<br /> within you.  After a few frenzied moments, you feel something bursting<br /> within you and he pulls it out of you.  You lay panting, glad to have it<br /> over.  He looks at you and smiling warmly, tells you, with a chuckle,<br /> that<br /> and thank your dentist.  After all, it was your first time to have a<br /> tooth<br /> pulled!</p>

<p>Sure enough, within minutes he had delivered another little baby.</p>
<p>""No, no, don't be in a great hurry to be putting down that lantern, young man... It seems there's yet another one besides!"" cried the doctor.</p>

47206,"<p>These two hunters went moose hunting every year without success.<br /> Finally they came up with a foolproof plan. (emphasis on fool) </p>

<p>So, they set themselves up on the edge of a clearing, in their costume, and began to give the moose love call. Before too long their call was answered by bull in the forest. </p>
<p>They called again, the bull answered closer to them. They called again, The bull answered, and came crashing out of the forest and into the clearing. As the bulls' pounding hoof beats got closer the guy in front said, ""OK, lets get out and get him""! </p>
<p>After a moment, that seemed like an eternity, the guy in the back shouts -<br /> ""THE ZIPPER IS STUCK, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO!?!"" </p>
<p>The front guy says, ""Well, I'm gonna start nibbling grass,<br /> but you better start to ""brace yourself!""</p>

47255,"<p>A guy comes walking into a bar with a turtle in his hand.</p>
<p>The turtle's one eye is black and blue, two of his legs are bandaged, and his whole shell is taped together with duct tape.</p>
<p>The bartender looks at the guy and asks:<br /> ""What's wrong with your turtle?""</p>
<p>""Not a thing,"" the man responds, this beat up turtle is faster than your dog!""<br /> ""Not a chance!"", replies the barkeep.</p>
<p>""Okay then, says the guy... you take your dog and let him stand at one end of the bar. Then go and stand at the other end of the room and call your dog. I'll bet you $500 that before your dog reaches you, my turtle will be there.""</p>
<p>So the bartender, thinking it's an easy $500, agrees.<br /> The bartender goes to the other side of the bar, and on the count of three calls his dog.</p>
<p>Suddenly the guy picks up his turtle and throws it across the room, narrowly missing the bartender, and smashing into the wall and says - </p>
<p>""I WIN... Told you it'll be there before your dog!""</p>

All I want is a drink.<br /> Waiter:I'm sorry, but I can't serve you until you tell me the name of your penis. Mine for instance is called 'Nike"" for the slogan 'Just Do It' That guy down at the end of the bar calls his 'Snickers' because 'It Really Satisfies'.</p>
<p>The guy looks dumbfounded, so the waiter says he'll give him a couple of minutes to think it over. So the guy turns to the man on his left and asks, ""Hey, bud, what's the name of your penis?""<br /> Other customer: Timex!<br /> First guy: Why Timex?<br /> Other guy: Because it takes a lickin and keeps on tickin!</p>
<p>A little shaken, he turns to the guy on his right.<br /> First guy:What's the name of your penis?<br /> Second guy: Ford! Because quality is job #1! Have you driven a Ford lately?</p>

"
47266,"<p>The Perfect Dump -- Every once in a while, each of us experiences a perfect dump, it's rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects. You sit down expecting the worst, but what you get is a smooth sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. But that's not the end of it. You use some toilet tissue only to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it. The Beer Dump -- Talk about nasty dumps. Depending on the dumper's tolerance, the beer dump is the end result of too many beers. it could have been 2 or 22, it doesn't matter. What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy dump accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.  The Chili Dump - Hot when it goes in, and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chili dump stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a heat shield. The Cable Dump -- Long, curly and perfectly formed like 2 feet of E13 telephone CO-axial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. You wonder admiringly, ''DID I DO THAT? Where did it come from?'' you leave the bathroom pleased with yourself.  The Latrine Dump -- In case you didn't know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it where soldiers, boy scouts and flies go to dump. Tip: Don't ever, ever look in the hole.  The Mona Lisa Dump -- This is the masterpiece of dumps. It's as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that would make da Vinci weep. And just think, you made it yourself. You may even want to break out the Polaroid, but maybe that's going a bit too far.  The Empty Roll Dump - You're done...you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins coldly in your throat. You could use the curtains...no, someone would say ''Where are the curtains?'' Then what would you say? The rug?...too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that every ''empty roll dumper'' must face...Pull up your slacks, tighten your tush and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.  The Splash-Back Dump - You send the dump on its way, it drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you're wet and embarrassed. Tip: Blot instead of wiping.  The Aborted Dump - You are in mid-dump when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off, go for the phone, and save the rest for later. It isn't pretty, but you've gotta do what you gotta do.  The Alfresco Dump -- Everyone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the nature, and a good bush all contribute to the peaceful ambiance that our primitive forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of Brownies or a patch of poison ivy.  The Childbirth Dump -- This is a dump that is simply too big to go through the aperture provided by nature for the purpose. You sit there, thinking over your dilemma. First it hurts, and it isn't going to get any better. You wonder if you'll ever see your loved ones again. You imagine the newspaper headlines screaming ''Man dies trying to hatch monster loaf.'' You realize you'll have to resolve the crisis before you can leave the bathroom. Basically there are only three things you can do: Scream, call an Obstetrician, or just hope like hell have enough Vaseline to get you through it.  The Tijuana Trot Dump -- The phrase ''Shit Happens'' really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins. For the next 72 hours you'd be better off if you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a fetal position. Now you realize why Mexico never had a navy.  The Machine Gun Dump -- You're just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like machine gun fire. The guy in the next stall hits the floor like a combat veteran, cradling his umbrella like an M16 and shrieking something about �damn Commies.�  The Sound Effect Dump -- You feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or work mates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects: flush the toilet, sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem, or drop a handful of quarters on the floor  The Security Dump -- You have enough on your mind when you're in the bathroom without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-dump mode. So how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can't reach to do this... hum loudly.  The Cling-On Dump -- For the most part you've completed your dump, but there's one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You're getting impatient. Someone else wants to use your stall. So, you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the bowl water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently on the door has scissors.  The Houdini Dump -- You go, then you stand up to flush, and the darn thing has disappeared. Where'd it go? Did it creep down the pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it lurking out of sight? Should you wipe...maybe you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You'd better, because if you don't, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.  The Flu Dump -- You feel so bad that you don't know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your intestines like a vice so you sit down again...up down up down. Don't you wish Mom were close by?  The Porta-Pottie Dump -- Construction workers and outdoor concert goers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best description would be, �It's like taking a shit in an upright coffin.� It's claustrophobic and it smells bad... best advice... go in a paper cup.  The Proctologist Dump -- In the beginning, the Lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn't create this dump, because there is nothing biblical about it -- you run out of gas. That's right, you run out of propulsion. The dump is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You've only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you're a proctologist and go after it yourself. Not a pretty picture is it??  The Whole Roll Dump -- No matter how much you wipe, it doesn't seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times too. The whole episode is consumer waste.  The Graffiti Dump -- You flush the dump and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the dump to the porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way down. You flush again but the curlicue hangs there...love it or leave it. Its your choice.  The Encore Dump - Ahhhh, you're done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the bathroom when you feel another dump coming. You have to return for a curtain call. The world's record is seven encores.  The Born Again Dump - This is a dump that's going so badly, you say �Lord, if I live through this, I'll take up religion.� You always get through it, but seldom keep the promise you made in desperation, because a born again dump is like childbirth... you forget the pain quickly.</p>

Research scientists at Guinness suggested that men should take a look at their beer consumption after considering the results of a recent analysis, which had revealed the presence of female hormones in beer.The theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into women. To test the finding, 100 men were fed eight pints of beer each. It was then observed that 100 percent of the men gained weight, talked excessively without making sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally, argued over nothing and refused to apologize when wrong.No further testing is planned.</p>

Jack Nicholson is dressed silk PJ's and an embroidered bathrobe;  seated in a leather wing-backed chair.  Camera pans across the bookshelves, the fireplace, and the wingback chair, then zooms in on Jack's face.  He is reading the label on a Viagra Bottle which he holds in his right hand. Nicholson notes that someone is looking at him, looks up, then drops his head a little, looks directly into the camera, and rotates the bottle so the label is visable. 'Guys, WE know you still have it in ya.'He cocks his head slightly, executes 'The Nicholson Smile(tm)' and raises one eyebrow. Fade to black, superimpose Viagra Logo.</p>

Please forgive the deception, but I thought you should know what has been going on at home since your computer entered our lives TWO YEARS AGO. The children are doing well. Tommy is seven now and is a bright, handsome boy. He has developed quite an interest in the arts. He drew a family portrait for a school project, all the figures were good, and the back of your head is very realistic. You should be very proud of him. Little Jennifer turned three in September. She looks a lot like you did at that age. She is an attractive child and quite smart. She still remembers that you spent the whole afternoon with us on her birthday. What a grand day for Jenny, despite the fact that it was stormy and the electricity was out. I am doing well. I went blonde about a year ago, and discovered that it really is more fun! George, I mean, Mr. Wilson, the department head, has taken an interest in my career and has become a good friend to us all. I discovered that the household chores are much easier since I realized that you didn't mind being vacuumed but that feather dusting made you sneeze. The house is in good shape. I had the living room painted last spring; I'm sure you noticed it. I made sure that the painters cut holes in the drop sheet so you wouldn't be disturbed.Well, my dear, I must be going. Uncle George--err--Mr. Wilson, I mean, is taking us all on a ski trip and there is packing to do. I have hired a housekeeper to take care of things while we are away, she'll keep things in order, fill your coffee cup and bring your meals to your desk, just the way you like it. I hope you and the computer will have a lovely time while we are gone. Tommy, Jenny and I will think of you often. Try to remember us while your disks are booting.Love,Your Wife</p>

47397,"<p>Thor, the Viking God of Thunder, and his pal Odin were up in<br /> Valhalla, when suddenly Thor said to Odin, ""It's been a long<br /> time now. I really need to have sex.""<br />    Odin stood and pondered for a while, before replying, ""Go<br /> to Earth, O Thor, and find thyself what they call a 'lady of<br /> joy' and treat her to your manly pleasures.""<br />    And this Thor did. The next day, he came back up to see<br /> Odin, and told him of the previous night's events. ""My<br /> friend,"" he said, grinning from ear to ear, ""It was<br /> wonderful. We had passionate sex 37 times..""<br />    ""37 times!"" exclaimed Odin. ""That poor woman! Mere<br /> mortals cannot endure such treatment. You must go and<br /> apologize this instant!""<br />    So Thor went back down to earth and found the<br /> aforementioned prostitute, saying. ""I'm sorry about last<br /> night, but you see, I'm Thor...""<br />    ""You're Thor?"" shouted the girl. ""You're Thor? What about<br /> me? I'm tho thor I can hardly pith!""</p>

47401,"<p>A man is sitting at a bar one night, wearing a fancy new watch, covered with<br /> buttons and lights and dials. The woman next to him says, ""Wow, that's a really<br /> fancy watch�.<br /> Thanks, says the guy, ""It's the cutting edge of technology. I can<br /> telepathically ask this watch anything I want to know, and it'll answer me,<br /> telepathically."" </p>
<p>""Rubbish,"" says the girl. </p>
<p>""No, it's true,"" says that guy. ""Look, tell you what, I'll prove it. I'll ask<br /> it if you've got any panties on."" </p>
<p>The guy scrunches up his eyes for a moment, as if concentrating hard to talk<br /> to his watch, then opens them and says, ""Nope, it says you haven't got any<br /> panties on."" </p>
<p>""Well, it's wrong,"" says the girl, ""I do have panties on."" </p>
<p>""Damn,"" says the guy, slapping his watch, ""it's an hour fast!""</p>

47402,"<p>There were three medieval kingdoms on the shores of a lake. There was an<br /> island in the middle of the lake, which the kingdoms had been fighting over for<br /> years. Finally, the three kings decided that they would send their knights out<br /> to do battle, and the winner would take the island. The night before the battle,<br /> the knights and their squires pitched camp and readied themselves for the fight. </p>
<p>The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of<br /> whom were busily polishing armor, brushing horses, and cooking food. The second<br /> kingdom had 20 knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp<br /> was also busy preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom, there was<br /> only one knight, with his squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it from<br /> a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal, while the<br /> knight polished his own armor.<br /> When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires out to<br /> fight (this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in). The battle<br /> raged, and when the dust cleared, the only person left was the lone squire from<br /> the third kingdom, having defeated the squires from the other two kingdoms, thus<br /> proving that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the<br /> squares of the other two sides.</p>

47405,"<p>Just a few thoughts from 1999....by Steven Wright A bus station is where a bus stops.  A train  station is where a train stops.  On my desk, I  have a work station...GO FIGURE! If Fed Ex &amp; UPS were to merge, would they call it  Fed UP? If quitters never win &amp; winners never quit, what  fool came up w/""Quit while you're ahead""? Do Lipton Tea employees take coffee breaks? What hair color do they put on the driver's  licenses of bald men? I was thinking that women should put pictures of  missing husbands on beer cans. I was thinking about how people seem to read the  Bible a whole lot more as they get older, then it  dawned on me...they were cramming for their finals. Why do they put pictures of criminals up in the  Post Office?  What are we supposed to do...write to  these men?  Why don't they just put their pictures  on the postage stamps so the mailmen could look for  them while they delivered the mail? How much deeper would oceans be if sponges didn't  live there? If it's true that we are here to help others, then  what exactly are the OTHERS here for? Clones are people two. If a man says something in the woods &amp; there are no  women there, is he still wrong? Go ahead &amp; take risks....just be sure that everything  will turn out OK. If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be  vague. Ever wonder what the speed of lightning would be if it  didn't zigzag? Nostalgia isn't what it used to be. Think ""honk"" if you're telepathic. If a person w/multiple personalities threatens suicide,  is that considered a hostage situation? If a cow laughed, would milk come out her nose? I went for a walk last night &amp; my kids asked me how  long I'd be gone.  I said, ""The whole time."" We know the speed of light...so what's the speed of  dark? How come you don't ever hear about gruntled employees?  And who has been dissing them anyhow? After eating, do amphibians need to wait an hour  before getting OUT of the water? Why don't they just make mouse-flavored cat food? If you're sending someone some styrofoam, what do you  pack it in? I just got skylights put in my place.  The people who  live above me are furious. Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections? Is it true that cannibals don't eat clowns because  they taste funny? Isn't Disney World a people trap operated by a mouse? Since light travels faster than sound, isn't that why  some people appear bright until you hear them speak? How come abbreviated is such a long word? If it's zero degrees outside today &amp; it's supposed to  be twice as cold tomorrow, how cold is it going to be? Whose cruel idea was it for the word ""lisp"" to have  an ""s"" in it?</p>

47419,"<p>IMPORTANT! READ THIS BEFORE USING </p>
<p>Congratulations! </p>
<p>You have purchased an extremely fine device that would give you thousands of years of trouble-free service, except that you undoubtedly will destroy it via some typical bonehead consumer maneuver. Which is why we ask you to: </p>
<p>PLEASE FOR GOD'S SAKE READ THIS OWNER'S MANUAL CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU UNPACK THE DEVICE. YOU ALREADY UNPACKED IT, DIDN'T YOU? YOU UNPACKED IT AND PLUGGED IT IN AND TURNED IT ON AND FIDDLED WITH THE KNOBS, AND NOW YOUR CHILD, THE SAME CHILD WHO ONCE SHOVED A POLISH SAUSAGE INTO YOUR VIDEOCASSETTE RECORDER AND SET IT ON ""FAST FORWARD"", THIS CHILD ALSO IS FIDDLING WITH THE KNOBS, RIGHT? WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST BREAK THESE DEVICES RIGHT AT THE FACTORY BEFORE WE SHIP THEM OUT, YOU KNOW THAT?!?</p>
<p>We're sorry. We just get a little crazy sometimes because we're always getting back ""defective"" merchandise where it turns out that the consumer inadvertently bathed the device in acid for six days. So, in writing these instructions, we naturally tend to assume that your skull is filled with dead insects, but we mean nothing by it. OK? Now let's talk about: </p>
<p>1. UNPACKING THE DEVICE </p>
<p>The device is encased in foam to protect it from the Shipping People, who like nothing more than to jab spears into outgoing boxes. </p>
<p>PLEASE INSPECT THE CONTENTS CAREFULLY FOR GASHES OR IDA MAE BARKER'S ENGAGEMENT RING, WHICH SHE LOST LAST WEEK, AND SHE THINKS MAYBE IT WAS WHILE SHE WAS PACKING DEVICES. </p>
<p>Ida Mae really wants that ring back, because it is her only proof of engagement, and her fiancee, Stuart, is now seriously considering backing out on the whole thing in as much as he had consumed most of a bottle of Jim Beam in Quality Control when he decided to pop the question. It is not without irony that Ida Mae's last name is ""Barker"", if you get our drift. </p>
<p>WARNING: DO NOT EVER AS LONG AS YOU LIVE THROW AWAY THE BOX OR ANY OF THE PIECES OF STYROFOAM, EVEN THE LITTLE ONES SHAPED LIKE PEANUTS. </p>
<p>If you attempt to return the device to the store, and you are missing one single peanut, the store personnel will laugh in the chilling manner exhibited by Joseph Stalin just after he enslaved Eastern Europe. Besides the device, the box should contain: </p>
<p>* Eight little rectangular snippets of paper that say ""WARNING"" </p>
<p>* A little plastic packet containing four 5/17 inch pilfer grommets and two club-ended 6/93 inch boxcar prawns. </p>
<p>YOU WILL NEED TO SUPPLY: </p>
<p>a matrix wrench and 60,000 feet of tram cable. </p>
<p>IF ANYTHING IS DAMAGED OR MISSING: </p>
<p>You IMMEDIATELY should turn to your spouse and say ""Margaret, you know why this country can't make a car that can get all the way through the drive-through at Burger King without a major transmission overhaul? </p>
<p>Because nobody cares, that's why.</p>
<p>"" WARNING: This is assuming your spouse's name is Margaret. And not Pete. </p>
<p>2. PLUGGING IN THE DEVICE </p>
<p>The plug on this device represents the latest thinking of the electrical industry's Plug Mutation Group, which, in a continuing effort to prevent consumers from causing hazardous electrical current to flow through their appliances, developed the Three-Pronged Plug, then the Plug Where One Prong is Bigger Than the Other. Your device is equipped with the revolutionary new Plug Whose Prongs Consist of Six Small Religious Figurines Made of Chocolate. </p>
<p>DO NOT TRY TO PLUG IT IN! </p>
<p>Lay it gently on the floor near an outlet, but out of direct sunlight, and clean it weekly with a damp handkerchief. </p>
<p>WARNING: WHEN YOU ARE LAYING THE PLUG ON THE FLOOR, DO NOT HOLD A SHARP OBJECT IN YOUR OTHER HAND AND TRIP OVER THE CORD AND POKE YOUR EYE OUT, AS THIS COULD VOID THE WARRANTY. </p>
<p>3. OPERATION OF THE DEVICE WARNING: </p>
<p>WE MANUFACTURE ONLY THE ATTRACTIVE DESIGNER CASE. THE ACTUAL WORKING CENTRAL PARTS OF THE DEVICE ARE MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN. THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE TRANSLATED BY MRS. SHIRLEY PELTWATER OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, WHO HAS NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN TO JAPAN BUT DOES HAVE MOST OF ""SHOGUN"" ON TAPE. </p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: </p>
<p>For results that can be the finest, it is our advising that: NEVER to hold these buttons two times!! Except the battery. Next taking the (something) earth section may cause a large occurrence! However. If this is not a trouble, such rotation is a very maintainence action, as a kindly (something) virepoint from Drawing B. </p>
<p>4. WARRANTY </p>
<p>Be it hereby known that this device, together with but not excluding all those certain parts thereunto, shall be warrantied against all defects, failures and malfunctions as shall occur between now and Thursday afternoon shortly before 2, during which time the Manufacturer will, at no charge to the Owner, send the device to our Service People, who will emerge from their caves and engage in rituals designed to cleanse it of evil spirits. This warranty does not cover the attractive designer case. </p>
<p>WARNING: IT MAY BE A VIOLATION OF SOME LAW THAT MRS. SHIRLEY PELTWATER HAS ""SHOGUN"" ON TAPE</p>

47421,"<p>Advice from the Easter Bunny Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Walk softly and carry a big carrot. Everyone needs a friend who is all ears. There's no such thing as too much candy.  All work and no play can make you a basket case. A cute little tail attracts a lot of attention.  Everyone is entitled to a bad hare day. Let happy thoughts multiply like rabbits.  Some body parts should be floppy. Keep your paws off other people's jelly beans.  Good things come in small sugar-coated packages. The grass is always greener in someone else's basket.  An Easter bonnet can tame even the wildest hare. To show your true colours you have to come out of     your shell  The best things in life are still sweet and gooey.</p>

<p>""Well,"" the professor answered, ""I'll give you an example of what i mean. Do you own a weed whacker?"" </p>
<p>""Yes,"" the man replied. ""If you own a weed whacker, then you probably have a lawn,"" the professor said </p>
<p>""Yes,"" the man replied. </p>
<p>""And if you have a lawn, then you probably own a home, right?"" the professor asked. </p>
<p>""Yes,"" the man replied ""And if you own a home, then you probably are married with a family, correct?"" the professor asked. </p>
<p>""Why yes,"" the man replied </p>
<p>""And if you are married with a family, then you're in all probability heterosexual, right?"" the professor asked </p>
<p>""Yes!"" the man replied </p>
<p>The following day, the man decided to try out some of this ""logic"" at the cash clerk at the store because he was so impressed with it himself. The man askes the cash clerk, ""Do you own a weed whacker?"" </p>

' James: �No way - he's a stockbroker. ' Chris: �He's no stockbroker. A stockbroker wouldn't come in here. ' The argument repeats itself for some time until the volume of beer gets the better of Chris and he makes for the toilet. On entering the toilet, he sees that the suit is standing at a urinal. Curiosity and the several beers get the better of the builder. Chris: ' 'Scuse me.. . no offence meant, but me and my mate were wondering what you do for a living.' Suit: �No offence taken.

Do you have a goldfish at home?� Chris: 'Er. . . mmm. . . well yeah, I do as it happens. ' Suit: `Well, it's logical to assume that you keep it in a bowl or in a pond. Which is it?' Chris: 'It's in a pond' Suit: 'Well then, it's logical to suppose that you have a large garden then?' Chris: 'As it happens, yes I have got a big garden.' Suit: 'Well then, it's logical to assume that in this town if you have a large garden then you have a large house?' Chris: �As it happens I've got a five-bedroom house. . . built it myself.' Suit: 'well, given that you've built a five-bedroom house it is logical to assume that you haven't built it just for yourself and that you're probably married.' Chris: 'Yes, I am married. I live with my wife and three children.' Suit: 'Well then, it's logical to assume that you are sexually active with your wife on a regular basis.' Chris: 'Yep! Four nights a week. ' Suit: 'Well then, it is logical to suggest that you do not masturbate very often?' Chris: �Me? Never!' Suit: 'Well, there you are, that's logical science at work.' Chris: 'How's that then?' Suit: 'From finding out that you had a goldfish. I've told you about the size of the garden you have, the size of house, your family and your sex life. 'Chris: 'I ,see. That's pretty impressive... thanks mate.'Both leave the toilet and Chris returns to his mate.James: 'I see the suit was in there. Did you ask him what he does?'Chris: 'Yep! He's a logical scientist.'James: 'What's that then?'Chris: 'I'll try to explain. Do you have a goldfish?'James: 'Hope. 'Chris: 'Well then, you're a wanker.'</p>

<p>Then one night, while watching CNN, he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia. In one<br /> corner of the background, he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly<br /> incredible arm. He threw a hand grenade straight into a 15th-story window 200<br /> yards away -- ka-boom! He threw another hand grenade into a group of 10 soldiers<br /> 100 yards away -- ka-blooey! Then a car passed, going 90 mph -- bull's-eye!</p>
<p>""I've got to get this guy!"" Ross said to himself. ""He has the perfect arm!""</p>
<p>So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football,<br /> and the Lions go on to win the Super Bowl for the first time in history.</p>
<p>The young Bosnian is lionized as the Great Hero of football, and when Ross<br /> asks him what he wants, all the young man wants to do is to call his mother.</p>
<p>""Mom,"" he says into the phone, ""I just won the Super Bowl.""</p>
<p>""I don't want to talk to you,"" the old woman says. ""You deserted us. You are<br /> not my son.""</p>
<p>""I don't think you understand, Mother!"" the young man pleads. ""I just won the<br /> greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring<br /> fans.""</p>
<p>""No, let me tell you,"" the mother retorts. ""At this very moment, there<br /> are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two<br /> brothers were beaten with an inch of their lives last week, and this week your<br /> sister was raped in broad daylight.""</p>
<p>The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says:</p>
<p>""...I'll never forgive you for making us move to Detroit.""</p>

Do you have any last requests?""The Englishman spoke first.""Before I die, I want to honor my country and protest this barbaric act by singing ""God Save The Queen"" to all you men.""""That can be arranged,"" said the terrorist.The Frenchman said, ""And I want to honor my country before I die by singing ""The Marseilles"" to your men.""The Japanese said, ""Before I die, I wish to honor my country by giving the lecture I was going to present on the Mapanese style of industrial management.""The terrorist turned finally to the American.""What is your last request?""The American replied, ""I want you to kill me right now so I don't have to listen to another lecture on the Japanese style of industrial management!""</p>

<p>""Well..."", the dentist says, ""if you don�t use an aesthetic, I can knock the price down to $60."" Looking annoyed the man says, ""That's still too expensive!"" </p>
<p>""Okay"", says the dentist. ""If I save on anaesthetics and simply rip the teeth out with a pair of pliers, I can knock the price down to $20"". </p>
<p>""Nope, moans the man, ""it's still too much!"". ""Well"", says the dentist, scratching his head, ""if I let one of my students do it, I suppose I can knock the price down to $10."" </p>
<p>""Marvellous!"", says the man, ""Book my wife for next Tuesday.""</p>

47446,"<p>A blonde made several attempts to sell her old car. She was having a lot of problems finding a buyer because the car had 340,000 miles on it. She discussed her problem with a brunette that she worked with at a bar.</p>
<p>The brunette suggested, ""There may be a chance to sell that car easier, but it's not going to be legal.""</p>
<p>""That doesn't matter at all,"" replied the blonde. ""All that matters it that I am able to sell this car.""</p>
<p>""Alright,"" replied the brunette. In a quiet voice, she told the blonde: ""Here is the address of a friend of mine. He owns a car repair shop around here. Tell him I sent you, and he will turn the counter back on your car to 40,000 miles. Then it shouldn't be a problem to sell your car.""</p>
<p>The following weekend, the blonde took a trip to the mechanic on the brunette's advice.</p>
<p>About one month after that, the brunette saw the blonde and asked, ""Did you sell your car?""</p>
<p>""No!"" replied the blonde. ""Why should I? It only has 40,000 miles on it.""</p>

47449,"<p>Dear Sir,I am writing in response to your request for additional information for block number 3 of the accident reporting form.  I put ""poor planning"" as the cause of my accident.  You said in your letter that I should explain more fully and I trust the following detail will be sufficient.I am an amateur radio operator and on the day of the accident, I was working alone on the top section of my new 80 foot tower.  When I had completed my work, I discovered that I had, over the course of several trips up the tower, brought up about 300 pounds of tools and spare hardware.  Rather than carry the now un-needed tools and material down by hand, I decided to lower the items down in a small barrel by using a pulley, which fortunately was attached to the gin pole at the top of the tower.Securing the rope at ground level, I went to the top of the tower and loaded the tools and material into the barrel.  Then I went back to the ground and untied the rope, holding it tightly to insure a slow decent of the 300 pounds of tools.  You will note in block number 11 of the accident reporting form, that I weigh only 155 pounds.  Due to my surprise of being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope.  Needless to say, I proceeded at a rather rapid rate of speed up the side of the tower.  In the vicinity of the 40 foot level, I met the barrel coming down.  This explains my fractured skull and broken collarbone. Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley.  Fortunately, by this time, I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold onto the rope in spite of my pain.At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of tools hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel.  Devoid of the weight of the tools, the barrel now weighed approximately 20 pounds.  I refer you again to my weight in block number 11. As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the tower.In the vicinity of the 40 foot level, I met the barrel coming up.  This accounts for the two fractured ankles and the lacerations of my legs and lower body.  The encounter with the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell onto the pile of tools and fortunately, only three vertebrae were cracked.I am sorry to report, however, that as I lay there on the tools, in pain, unable to stand and watching the empty barrel 80 feet above me... I again lost my presence of mind. I let go of the rope.</p>

""Sure, I'd love to play,"" says George,<br /> ""but I may be about ten minutes late, so wait for me."" So Saturday rolls<br /> around. Bob, Max, and Ted arrive promptly at 9:00 and find George already<br /> waiting for them. He plays right-handed and beats them all. Quite pleased<br /> with their new fourth, they ask him if he'd like to play again the<br /> following Saturday. ""Yeah, sounds great,"" says George. ""But I may be about<br /> ten minutes late, so wait for me."" The following Saturday, again, all four<br /> golfers show up on time, but this time George plays left-handed and beats<br /> them all. As they're getting ready to leave, George says, ""See you next<br /> Saturday, but I may be about ten minutes late, so wait for me."" Every<br /> week, George is right on time and plays great with whichever hand he<br /> decides to use. And every week, he departs with the same message. After a<br /> couple months, Ted is pretty tired of this routine, so he says, ""Wait a<br /> minute, George. Every week you say you may be about ten minutes late, but<br /> you're right on time. You beat us either left-handed or right-handed.<br /> What's the story?"" ""Well,"" George says, ""I'm kind of superstitious. When I<br /> get up in the morning, I look at my wife.

47467,"<p>Do you realize that the only time in our lives when we like to get old is when we're kids? If you're less than 10 years old, you're so excited about aging that you think in fractions.

<p>That's the key. You get into your teens, now they can't hold you back. You jump to the next number. How old are you? ""I'm gonna be 16."" You could be 12, but you're gonna be 16. </p>
<p>And then the greatest day of your life happens .... you become 21. Even the words sound like a ceremony .... you BECOME 21 ... YES!!! </p>
<p>But then you turn 30 .... ooohhh what happened there? Makes you sound like bad milk .... He TURNED, we had to throw him out. There's no fun now. </p>
<p>What's wrong?? What changed?? You BECOME 21, you TURN 30, then you're PUSHING 40 ..... stay over there, it's all slipping away ........ </p>
<p>You BECOME 21, you TURN 30, you're PUSHING 40, you REACH 50 ..... and your dreams are gone. </p>
<p>Then you MAKE IT to 60 ..... you didn't think you'd make it!!!! </p>
<p>So you BECOME 21, you TURN 30, you're PUSHING 40, you REACH 50, you MAKE IT to 60 ...... then you build up so much speed you HIT 70! </p>

<p>And it doesn't end there .... into the 90's you start going backwards .... I was JUST 92 ... </p>

47484,"<p>A man and a woman had a dog. There dog slept with them, but the<br /> dog had the problem of snoring extremely loud. The woman finally<br /> got fed up and went to the vet to see if he could help.</p>
<p>The vet replied, ""Tie a ribbon around the dog's testicles. It<br /> will stop his snoring.</p>
<p>To that the woman replied, ""Ha! Yeah right!</p>
<p>That night while the woman was trying to sleep, the dog's<br /> snoring became so nerve racking, that she rummaged through her<br /> closet and finally found a red ribbon. She carefully tied it<br /> around the dog's testicles and almost immediatley, his snoring<br /> stopped.</p>
<p>Satisfied, the woman went to bed. As she began to dose off she<br /> heard her husband enter the bedroom from a night of drinking<br /> with his friends. </p>
<p>The man climbed into bed and began to snore louder than the dog<br /> had done. The, woman was thinking that maybe tying a ribbon<br /> around the man's testicles would fix his problem to.</p>
<p>Again, she rummaged through the closet until she came across a<br /> blue ribbon. She tied it around the man's testicles, and, like<br /> the dog, he stopped snoring almost immediatley. </p>

<p>The next morning the man woke up before the woman. He went to<br /> the bathroom to take an early morning wizz. When the man dropped<br /> his pants, he was shocked to see he had a blue ribbon around his<br /> testicles! Then the dog walked in and the man noticed the red<br /> ribbon around the dog's testicles.</p>

47516,"<p>Last year authorities in Montana discovered that a hermit had been living in an old Forest Service cabin, and they were concerned about his well being. They decided to send up a team of experts from different fields to analyze his living arrangements, and to make sure that he was okay.</p>
<p>First they decided on a Psychologist, to make sure that the man was mentally handling his isolation. Next, they decided on an Engineer, to make sure that the cabin is still structurally sound and safe. Finally, they decided on a Theological professor from the university, to make sure that the man's spiritual needs were being fulfilled.</p>
<p>The team made it's way up the treacherous terrain in three days, but they were truly exhausted. Finally, on the evening of the third day, they spotted the cabin. From the outside, it appeared all was well.<br /> The area around the cabin was clean, the ground almost appearing as though it had been swept often. There was smoke coming from the stove pipe chimney, and the door was slightly ajar.<br /> Cautiously, they walked inside.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin everything appeared neat and tidy. The only thing that stood out, and this immediately caught the attention of all three men, was that the stove was suspended 18 inches off of the floor by about a hundred wires attached to the ceiling. The pattern of the wires was very intricate, cutting this way and that, and it appeared to be a very sturdy arrangement.</p>
<p>At first, all three men did not know what to make of the arrangement. Finally with a loud, ""Oh yes!"" the Psychologist spoke. ""This very clearly explains this man's desire to return to the womb. He has arranged the stove so that he can crawl underneath to, once again, feel the warmth of the womb.""</p>
<p>""Nonsense!"" exclaimed the Engineer. ""This serves a very clear and definite thermodynamic purpose. He has lifted the stove so as to reduce the zone which the heat has to permeate, allowing the cold air to remain within the cabin, locking the heat in place. This man is a genius.""</p>
<p>The Theological Professor stayed quiet a moment longer, but then he too spoke. ""I hate to disappoint you both, but I believe you are both wrong. The placement of fire on raised altars has always been a significant emblem of the existence of faith and religion in cultures of the past and present. It would clearly be that this man has created an altar for whatever faith he has clung onto or, worse yet, created.""</p>
<p>At this, the three men argued until there was a loud knock at the door, and the three men turned to see that the hermit had returned to his home. Immediately the three men approached him and demanded to know the significance of the placement of the stove.</p>
<p>The hermit stared at the three men long enough to hush them up, and then he spoke.</p>
<p>""Simple...had to fix stove pipe...plenty of wire...not enough stove pipe!""</p>

<p>�No, I have not,� the man says.</p>

Your penis is burned out. You only have 30 erections left in your penis.''The man walks home, deeply depressed. His wife is waiting for him at the front door and asks him what the doctor said concerning his problem. He tells her what the doctor told him. She says, ''Oh no, only 30 times! We shouldn't waste that. We should make a list!'' He replies, ''Yes, I already made a list on the way home. Sorry, your name isn't on it.''</p>

No way could the redneck top that, they thought. The<br /> redneck calmly made his way to the microphone and recited:<br /> Me and Tim a hunting' went. Met three whores in a pop up tent. They was three,<br /> and we was two, so I bucked one, and Timbuktu.<br /> The redneck won hands down!</p>

Then I said, ""Matt, are  you sure you did not have an accident?"" ""No,"" he replied.   I just knew that he must have had, cause the smell was  getting worse.   So, I asked one more time, ""Matt, did you have an accident?""   This time, with a little smirk on his face, he jumped up,  yanked down his pants, bent over and spread his cheeks and  yelled ""See MOM, IT'S JUST GAS!!""

47586,"<p>Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed  on how to use it shortly. Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean  Southerners can. Stay home the two days of the year it  snows. If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four-wheel pick-up with a 12-pack of  beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to  help them. Just stay out of their way. This is what they  live for. You can ask Southerners for directions, but unless you  already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks,  you're better off trying to find it yourself. Remember: Y'all is singular. All y'all is plural. All y'all's  is plural possessive. Get used to hearing, ""You ain't from around here, are you?"" Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't  understand you, either. The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective ""big ol"", as in ""big  ol truck"", or ""big ol boy"".""Fixin'"", as in ""I'm fixin' to go  to the store"", is 2nd. And ""Y'all"" is 3rd.  As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph  zone directly in the middle of the road, remember: ALL  Southern folks learned to drive on a John Deere, and this  is the proper speed and lane position for that vehicle. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"",  stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he  will ever say, or worse still, that you will ever hear. Most Southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those  who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with  a Southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was  already turned on when the car was purchased. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking,  let alone eating. The wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait  until December. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even  the most minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is  required at the local grocery store. It does not matter if  you need anything from the store. It is just something you're  supposed to do. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you  purchase one, it is positioned directly in front of the house.  This is logical, bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably  more than the house and should, therefore, be prominently  displayed.</p>

<p>EXERCISE 1: </p>
<p>Open your refrigerator door and insert one breast between the door and the main box. Have one of your strongest friends slam the door shut as hard as possible and lean on the door for good measure. Hold that position for five seconds. Repeat again in case the first time wasn't effective enough. </p>
<p>EXERCISE 2: </p>
<p>Visit your garage at 3 AM when the temperature of the cement floor is just perfect. Take off all your clothes and lie comfortably on the floor with one breast wedged under the rear tire of the car. Ask a friend to slowly back the car up until your breast is sufficiently flattened and chilled. Turn over and repeat for the other breast. </p>
<p>EXERCISE 3: </p>
<p>Freeze two metal bookends overnight. Strip to the waist. Invite a stranger into the room. Press the bookends against one of your breasts. Smash the bookends together as hard as you can. Set an appointment with the stranger to meet next year and do it again. </p>

The guy on the right is hacking and hacking at the ball but just can't lift it out of the buttercups. It has become lodged in. All of a sudden, up from the ground comes Mother Nature and is she mad!""What the hell are you doing to my beautiful buttercups?"" she asks.""I'm just trying to get my golf ball out of them, lady"", replies the golfer.""Well, you are really making me mad. Just look what you've done to my buttercups. For this I must punish you. Your punishment will be an entire year without butter!!""The golfer starts laughing hysterically which by now has just about worn out Mother Nature's patience.""What in the hell do you think is so funny about no butter for a year?"" she screams at him.""I'm not laughing about that - I'm laughing about my friend over there whacking the hell out of your pussy willows!</p>

47616,"<p>Editor's Note: Although this is not a joke, it's still funny as hell and I couldn't resist posting it.  It's a review of Supernova from the Self-Made Critic at www.brunching.com, pretty much proving what I thought would be true (hope it's not too late for any of you)...----------In the name of all that is Holy, do NOT see this movie!!!There, that's really about all you need to know about the new sci-fi disaster, Supernova.The movie is so horrible, it is my civic duty to keep you away from it. So I'm going to ruin absolutely any and all of the movie that I possibly can.Here's what the movie is about, I think.  (It was sometimes hard to understand what was happening because, well, it was really stupid.) There's this big, deep-space medical rescue ship.  They pick up a distress signal from an abandoned moon.  They go to the moon, pick up a lone guy who has a weird object.  The guy starts to kill everybody.  They kill him.  The object causes a supernova.  The movie ends.  Everybody's dead except for James  Spader and Angela Bassett.  Everyone.  There isn't a single character in the movie other than those two who lives.Oh, and a supernova is heading towards Earth and will destroy it in 51 years.  Oh well, sucks to be Earth.Apparently, according to this movie, in the future, everybody is really, really dumb, and they've never seen a sci-fi movie in their lives.  How dumb can the human race really be?  How dumb could the writers have been? At one point, they specifically tell us that the ship only has 6 special 'jump pods', and then later, the computer tells us that evil bad guy has just destroyed Pod #7.  Excuse me?Rule #1 if you're ever out in deep space:  Don't go rescue the weird guy who shouldn't be out there anyway.  And definitely don't bring his mysterious cargo onboard.  I wanted to spend the movie bitch-slapping the characters.  ""His bone structure is unlike anything I've ever seen in a human.  It's  completely over-developed.  Huh.  Weird.  What's for dinner?""SLAP""Our ship has just lost 82% of its power, our captain's head fused with  plexiglass and we have an eleven minute window to escape certain death.  Let's go to bed together.""SLAP""The evil bad guy, who has demonstrated Superman-like strength, has just killed two of our crew.  Let's split up and walk aimlessly through the ship looking for him.""SLAP""I just found an unknown, odd, bizarrely pulsating alien object.  I'm gonna open it up and stick my hand in it to see what happens.""SLAP""We just picked you up from an abandoned moon in deep space and you can read my mind, which no other human being has ever been able to do.  Neat. Let's go to bed.""SLAP""We are a medical rescue ship with a crew of six with only six 'jump pods' so if we ever actually rescued anyone, we wouldn't be able to actually bring them home.""SLAPWho directed this heap?  That's another a sci-fi story all its own.Officially, Thomas Lee directed this movie.  Who's Thomas Lee?  He doesn't exist.  He's the next Alan Smithee.  The real director was Walter Hill, and he took his name off this movie faster than you can say ""Oy!  What have I done to my career!""  Then Francis Ford Coppola had a go at a final cut, but you won't find his name anywhere near this film either.The movie was scheduled to be released in the Summer of 1997.  That's not a typo.  1997.  It cost, get this, over $70 million dollars to make this movie.  Do you have any idea how many Blair Witches you could make for that kind of money?Speaking of The Blair Witch Project, this film was filmed in Blair-Witch-o-Vision, with a shaky camera that doesn't sit still for a second.  It's like the camera operator was suffering from epilepsy throughout the entire film.  $70 million and they couldn't afford a stedicam?Supernova gets 3/4 of a Babylon.  Why not 0?  Because the movie teaches us how pear brandy is made, and that educational effort is worth 3/4 of a Babylon.Other than that, save your soul, don't see this film!!! **SUPERNOVARated: PG-13 (thought it was so obviously meant to be a R that it's ridiculous.)Directed by: Thomas Lee (Walter Hill, I can't let him off the hook so easily.)Starring:  A lot of people who should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

47618,"<p>This fellow who had spent his whole life in the desert comes to visit a<br /> friend. He'd never seen a train or the tracks they run on. While standing in the<br /> middle of the RR tracks one day, he hears this whistle -- Whooee da Whoee! --<br /> but doesn't know what it is. Predictably, he's hit -- but, only a glancing blow<br /> -- and is thrown, head-over-heels, to the side of the tracks, with some minor<br /> internal injuries, a few broken bones, and some bruises. </p>
<p>After weeks in the hospital recovering, he's at his friend's house attending a<br /> party, one evening. While in the kitchen, he suddenly hears the teakettle<br /> whistling. He grabs a baseball bat from the nearby closet and proceeds to batter<br /> and bash the teakettle into an unrecognizable lump of metal. His friend, hearing<br /> the ruckus, rushes into the kitchen, sees what's happened and asks the desert<br /> man: ""Why'd you ruin my good tea kettle?""</p>

47620,"<p>Scientists created a new invention that could reduce the pain of giving birth. It gave some of the pain that the mother felt to the father. This was there first experiment:<br /> One day a woman came who was in labor. They hooked the machine up to her and the other end to her husband. As soon as she started feeling pain they started transferring it to the husband. THey gave him 10% of the pain. He didn't feel anything. They gave him 20%. He still felt fine. 30%. No pain. 40%. Pain free. 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and then 100%. THe father felt no pain whatsoever and neither did the mother. All the doctors were glad they had a pain free delivery. After the mother and father got home, they found the mailman dead on their lawn.</p>

47647,"<p>Two hikers were walking through central Pennsylvania when they came upon a 6 foot wide hole in the ground. They figured it must be the opening for a vertical air shaft from an old abandoned coal mine. Curious as to the depth of the hole, the first hiker picked up a near-by rock and tossed it into the opening.</p>
<p>They listened....and heard nothing.</p>
<p>The second hiker picked up an even larger rock and tossed it into the opening. They listened....and still heard nothing.</p>
<p>Then they both picked up an old railroad tie, dragged it to the edge of the shaft, and hurled it down. Seconds later a dog came running up between the two men and jumped straight into the hole.</p>
<p>Bewildered, the two men just looked at each other, trying to figure out why a dog would do such a thing. Soon a young boy ambled onto the scene and asked if either man had seen a dog around here. </p>
<p>The hikers told him about the dog that had just jumped into the hole. </p>

47692,"<p>There was a father and his young son who lived in a secluded village somewhere in central Australia. </p>
<p>The boy's mother had left the father under difficult circumstances, and he had had bad experiences with women ever since. </p>
<p>So he took his boy aside one day and told him, ""Listen son, don't go messing around with women, because, you know, down there, they've got teeth down there."" </p>
<p>The boy listened intently to his father's advice. </p>
<p>Years passed, the boy has grown up and his father has died, leaving him alone. </p>
<p>So, one day, the boy ventures to the closest large town, where he goes to a club in search of companionship. </p>
<p>He strikes up a conversation with a beautiful young girl. </p>
<p>Things are going well, and they end up back at her place. </p>
<p>They are about to get into bed when the boy remembers his father's advice and shies away. </p>
<p>""What's wrong?"" she asks. </p>
<p>""Well, my father told me that women have teeth down there."" replied the young man. </p>
<p>""Of course we haven't got teeth down there!! Have a look if you like."" </p>
<p>So he takes her up on the offer. He takes off her panties, and he's poking around, examining the lady's most private parts. </p>
<p>""Hmmmm. I don't see any teeth down here, but you should see the state of your gums."" </p>

47693,"<p>A knockout young lady decided she wanted to get rich quick so she proceeded to find herself a rich 73-year-old man, planning to love him to death on their wedding night. The courtship and wedding went off without any problem, in spite of the half-century age difference.The first night of her honeymoon, she got undressed, and waited for him to come out of the bathroom to come to bed. When he emerged, however, he had nothing on except a rubber to cover a twelve-inch erection, and was carrying a pair of earplugs and a pair of noseplugs.Fearing her plan had gone desperately amiss, she asked, ""What are those for?""The elderly gentleman replied, ""There are two things I can't stand: the sound of a woman screaming, and the smell of burning rubber!""</p>

<p>2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them. </p>
<p>3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church. </p>
<p>4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets. </p>
<p>5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is still considered tacky to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home. </p>
<p>DINING OUT </p>
<p>1. When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup, and pour slowly so as not to ""bruise"" the fruit of the vine. </p>
<p>2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your fingers covering the label. </p>
<p>ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME </p>
<p>1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist. </p>
<p>2. Do not allow the dog to eat from the table...no matter how good his manners are. </p>
<p>PERSONAL HYGIENE </p>
<p>1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys. </p>
<p>2. Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days. However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of good money. </p>
<p>3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods. </p>
<p>DATING (Outside the Family) </p>
<p>1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date. </p>
<p>2. Be aggressive. Let her know you're interested: ""I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago."" </p>

<p>2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot. </p>

<p>DRIVING ETIQUETTE </p>
<p>1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles; even if the gun is loaded and the deer is in sight. </p>

47725,"<p>Bush: Whiskers No Longer a Threat to U.S.</p>
<p>The search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq came to an end today as U.S. military officials found chemical, biological and nuclear weapons hidden in the scraggly beard of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>The Iraqi madman had instructed his weapons scientists to create the WMD in microscopic form so that he could carry them around on his person at all times, the officials said.</p>
<p>U.S. General Ricardo Sanchez said that the discovery of WMD nestled in Saddam's unkempt facial hair closes the book on one of Operation Iraqi Freedom's most enduring mysteries.</p>
<p>""Now we know why we never found the weapons of mass destruction,"" General Sanchez told reporters. ""We never dreamed they were tiny enough to be hidden on someone's face.""</p>
<p>The general added that Saddam was capable of launching his deadly weapons cache merely by shaking his head.</p>
<p>After he was captured, Saddam received a shave and a haircut from the Halliburton Company, who charged the former dictator the entire $750,000 he had in his possession.</p>
<p>The deadly beard was then stored in an airtight container and transferred to a U.S. military laboratory in Wiesbaden, Germany for future study.</p>
<p>At a press conference in Washington, President Bush praised the military for removing Saddam's lethal beard once and for all.</p>
<p>""Thanks to the efforts of our coalition, Saddam Hussein's whiskers will no longer harbor the world's deadliest weapons,"" Mr. Bush said.</p>
<p>Later in his press conference, the President revealed that U.S. forces found Saddam after receiving a tip from Tikrit that there was an ass in a hole in the ground.</p>

"
47727,"<p>When some people see the word 'coworker' they think it means the same as 'co-worker.'  But it doesn't.  Coworker is from the Olde English expression, 'cow orker,' as in the following sentence that is best read with a cockney accent, 'I ain't workin' with 'im!  He's a bloody cow orker!' I walked up to the counter at a chain fried chicken joint and asked the cashier-Induhvidual for a soda and a piece of chicken. 'Crispy or regular', she asked. 'I don't care.  Either will be fine,'  I replied. 'Crispy or regular', she asked again, annoyed. '...Ahh, Crispy then,' I responded. 'We are out of crispy,' she said.--------- A couple of years ago, when I worked at a large company, our 'sexual harassment training' included a company letter that stated 'Don't treat a female engineer like a secretary.'  Needless to say, the secretaries were not amused.---------I was helping a friend (yes I admit it, I have an Induhvidual for a friend) set up her new computer.  It was a desktop model, so I naturally placed it on top of her desk in the traditional setup.  A few minutes after I had installed the software, she complained that she wished she had bought a tower PC instead of the desktop computer as it took up too much space on her desk.  I promptly took the computer off the desk, flipped it on its side and placed it on the floor.  She then looked at me in amazement and asked,  'You can do that?' (Editor's Note:  An easy way to make some extra money is by offering to upgrade Induhvidual's desktop computers to tower configurations.)--------- ---------I was at the library making copies of articles for a research paper and discovered that the copy machine wasn't working (after having plugged several dimes into it).  I told the girl at the library desk the copy machine was malfunctioning, to which she replied, 'I know'. Exasperated, I asked why she hadn't put a sign on the machine indicating it was broken so people wouldn't waste their money.  Her answer was, 'We don't have a sign like that'.--------- ---------A friend was asked to be interim director of our Institute while the director was away.  The following day I noticed him looking at a form with an amused look on his face.   He was required by policy to sign a form to authorize the transfer of signing authority. Under each category indicating the amounts or the things he could sign for (i.e. vacations, overtime, etc.) it said NONE in each case. He had to sign a form which would give him the authority not to authorize anything.---------I brought my film to the 'One Hour Developing' place and asked for the one hour service.  'No problem,' said the owner, You can pick it up in two hours.' I protested, 'The sign says one hour developing. ' 'That's right,' he said, 'One hour developing takes about two hours.' [Editor's Note:  Be sure to order the double-wide prints, which are the same size as the regular ones.]DNRC Prank Report -----------------This galactic prank report comes directly from the field: I took the QuickTime panorama of the Mars Pathfinder, reworked it into my own HTML web page (neatly entitled 'Pathfinder Mission Control') and put a heading 'Pathfinder Active Camera Control' above the panorama. Soon the news travelled, from Induhvidual to Induhvidual, that I had found a way to control the camera on the Pathfinder from my computer at work.  My PC was swarmed by Induhviduals each taking their turn 'controlling the camera'. And another prank report... A friend of mine works at a large insurance company as a sysadmin.  He informed his boss that the boss's hard disk needed to be 'balanced.' My friend gave his boss a program which writes 'weight files' on carefully computed spots on the disk, so that the balanced disk will run smoother. The boss distributed the program among the employees and ordered them to regularly have their hard disks balanced.DNRC Motto ----------Visionary Dave Morse suggests this motto for the DNRC: I can please only one person per day. Today is not your day. Tomorrow isn't looking good either. Curing the Voicemail-Playing Coworker -------------------------------------I get many complaints from people about their cow-orking co-workers who use the speakerphone function to listen to their voicemail messages everyday.  This is very annoying if you are in the next cube. But I have a cure for this. From an anonymous phone, preferably a payphone or the desk phone of a dimwitted cow-orker, leave a sexually suggestive message on the offending Induhvidual's voice mail.  Do this every day until the problem abates. The messages should be naughty enough to embarrass the person who plays it aloud, but not so naughty that you'll get fired if they find out it's you.  I suggest using breathy and suggestive sentences that make oblique references to things like vegetable oil, feathers and lost wristwatches. That oughta do it.Dogbert Answers My Mail -----------------------In this section, Dogbert answers the mail that I'm too polite to answer myself.Dear Mr. Adams, After reading your 7/31/97 cartoon and sharing it with a fellow co-worker, we got into a small discussion. The issue involves the last panel of the cartoon in which a rather large person is pictured at a copy machine.  Is this large human being clearly meant to be a female?  If so, I feel this could be taken as being politically incorrect for the reason that men can also have fat rear ends.  However, it always seems that women are the ones pictured with the fat rear ends. A short reply from your side to clarify the situation would be greatly appreciated. Barb L.Dear Bulb, You make a good point.  All the male characters in the Dilbert strip are trim and good-looking.  Dilbert, Wally and the Pointy-haired boss are all Chippendale dancers on weekends. But the female characters don't get such favorable treatment.  More often than not they are depicted as gigantic creatures whose butt cheeks embrace Wally's head in an accicental embrace.  Apparently this is Mr.  Adams' idea of 'funny.' I will talk to Mr. Adams about this obvious bias and have it corrected immediately.</p>

47731,"<p>Cat fitness really can be fun. However, it is important to start any fitness program only when you feel like it. Don't let a few extra pounds intimidate you into becoming more active. The most important aspect of fitness is: when to start the program. The best time is at about 2 a.m. The house is quiet; there are no distractions. The warm-up is critical. Cats are experts at stretching, so this won't be a problem. Start with a few wind sprints, full speed, toenails clicking on the tile or linoleum floors. A few low but loud growls will help you feel charged up.</p>
<p>Now it is time to add some eye-paw coordination work. Find a marble (the big steelies work even better) and roll that down the floor as the sprints continue. See how many times you can ricochet it off the wallboards before it disappears under the fridge. Finally, work on that upper body strength. Climbing is a great exercise. Use draperies, macram� plant hangers, or clothing on hangers. You can even find some carpeting on some basement walls. Backs of chairs work well, too.</p>
<p>Now put it all together. A speed sprint to the end of the hall! A race around the living room! Leap to the back of the rocking chair! Let the rebound launch you to the top of the swinging planter! Rock that baby! Feel those muscles work. Just as the hook pulls loose from the ceiling, dash to the bedroom and dive under the covers. Establish your alibi just in time to hear the crash of the plant to the floor below.</p>

47745,"<p>About to be newlywed and still a virgin, a man asks his best of pals for help on the big night. </p>
<p>Since it would be foreseeably disasterous to merely lend advice, the men agree to have the friend stay in the next room of a suggested hotel. </p>
<p>""The walls are paper thin, we'll be able to talk when you come to the bathroom."" </p>
<p>So the big night comes, and the men are ready. </p>
<p>First entering the room, the groom excuses himself, and heads for the bathroom. </p>
<p>""Hey, you there?""  </p>
<p>""Yeah, now..."" </p>
<p>During this time, the bride had to use the bathroom something awful, but wanted to leave her husband room to do whatever it was that was taking so long. </p>
<p>Beginning to pace, she waits. </p>
<p>"" ... Now, just aim for the hole, and follow my advice, and everything should be fine. "" </p>
<p>As they chatted more, the bride couldn't hold it any longer, and dragged out a shoe box. </p>
<p>Finally making her stomach feel better, she quickly shoves the shit box back under the flimsy bed, and awaits her husband who's just walking out of the bathroom, naked and ready. </p>
<p>Hoping to be romantically daring, he jumps on the bed, which causes it to collapse. </p>
<p>The shoe box explodes and he screams, ""Oh shit!"" </p>
<p>To which the pal in the bathroom next door yells, ""Wrong hole!"" </p>

47748,"<p>A blind man walks into a restaurant and sits down.</p>
<p>The waiter, who is also the owner, walks up to the blind man and hands him a menu.</p>
<p>""I'm sorry, Sir, but I am blind and can't read the menu. Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer, I'll smell it and order from there.""</p>
<p>A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty pile and picks up a greasy fork. He returns to the blind man's table and hands it to him.</p>
<p>The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath.</p>
<p>""Ah, yes, that's what I'll have, meatloaf and mashed potatoes.""</p>
<p>Unbelievable, the owner says to himself as he walks towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>The cook happens to be the owner's wife and he tells her what had just happened. The blind man eats his meal and leaves.</p>
<p>Several days later the blind man returns and the owner mistakenly brings him a menu again.</p>
<p>""Sir, remember me? I'm the blind man.""</p>
<p>""I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'll go get you a dirty fork.""</p>
<p>The owner again retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man.</p>
<p>After another deep breath, the blind man says, ""That smells great; I'll take the macaroni and cheese with broccoli.""</p>
<p>Once again walking away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he's going to test him.</p>
<p>The blind man eats and leaves.</p>
<p>He returns the following week, but this time the owner sees him coming and runs to the kitchen.</p>
<p>He tells his wife, ""Mary, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man.""</p>
<p>Mary complies and hands her husband the fork back.</p>
<p>As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting.</p>
<p>""Good afternoon sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you.""</p>
<p>The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff and says, ""Hey, I didn't know that Mary worked here?""</p>

They're packed<br /> with nutrients."" replied the bull. The pheasant pecked at a lump<br /> of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to<br /> reach the first branch of the tree! And the very next day, after<br /> eating some more, he reached the second branch! And so on. And<br /> finally, after just a few days, there he was proudly perched at<br /> the top of the tree. Where upon, he was spotted by a farmer who<br /> dashed into the farmhouse, emerged with a shotgun, and shot the<br /> pheasant right out of the tree.</p>

47770,"<p>The 5 toughest questions women ask - and their answers</p>
<p>The five questions are:<br /> 1 - ""What are you thinking?""<br /> 2 - ""Do you love me?""<br /> 3 - ""Do I look fat?""<br /> 4 - ""Do you think she is prettier than me?""<br /> 5 - ""What would you do if I died?""</p>
<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is<br /> guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if<br /> the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly.<br /> For example:</p>
<p>1 - ""What are you thinking?"" The proper answer to this question,<br /> of course, is, ""I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just<br /> reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful,<br /> intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am<br /> to have met you.""<br /> Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what<br /> the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely<br /> one of five things:<br /> a - Baseball<br /> b - Football<br /> c - How fat you are.<br /> d - How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid<br /> question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was<br /> asked it by his wife, Peg. ""If I wanted you to know,"" Al said,<br /> ""I'd be talking instead of thinking.""</p>
<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many<br /> wrong answers:</p>
<p>2 - ""Do you love me?"" The correct answer to this question is,<br /> ""Yes."" For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you<br /> may answer, ""Yes, dear. Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I suppose so.<br /> b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes.<br /> c - That depends on what you mean by ""love"".<br /> d - Does it matter?<br /> e - Who, me?</p>
<p>3 - ""Do I look fat?"" The correct male response to this question<br /> is to confidently and emphatically state, ""No, of course not"" and<br /> then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include:<br /> a - I wouldn't call you fat, but I wouldn't call you thin either.<br /> b - Compared to what?<br /> c - A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d - I've seen fatter.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your<br /> insurance policy.</p>
<p>4 - ""Do you think she's prettier than me?"" The ""she"" in the<br /> question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were<br /> starring at so hard thay you almost cause a traffic accident or<br /> an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct<br /> response is, ""No, you are much prettier."" Wrong answers include:<br /> a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.<br /> b - I don't know how one goes about rating such things.<br /> c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.<br /> d - Only in the sense that she's younger and thinner.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your<br /> insurance policy.</p>
<p>5 - ""What would you do if I died?"" Correct answer: ""Dearest love,<br /> in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have<br /> meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front<br /> tires of the first Domino's Pizza truck that came my way."" This<br /> might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by<br /> the following stupid joke:</p>
<p>""Dear,"" said the wife. ""What would you do if I died?""<br /> ""Why, dear, I would be extremely upset,"" said the husband. ""Why<br /> do you ask such a question?""<br /> ""Would you remarry?"" persevered the wife.<br /> ""No, of couse not, dear"" said the husband.<br /> ""Don't you like being married?"" said the wife.<br /> ""Of course I do, dear"" he said.<br /> ""Then why wouldn't you remarry?""<br /> ""Alright,"" said the husband, ""I'd remarry.""<br /> ""You would?"" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt.<br /> ""Yes"" said the husband.<br /> ""Would you sleep with her in our bed?"" said the wife after a long<br /> pause.<br /> ""Well yes, I suppose I would."" replied the husband.<br /> ""I see,"" said the wife indignantly."" And would you let her wear<br /> my old clothes?""<br /> ""I suppose, if she wanted to"" said the husband.<br /> ""Really,"" said the wife icily. ""And would you take down the<br /> pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?""<br /> ""Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do.""<br /> ""Is that so?"" said the wife, leaping to her feet. ""And I suppose<br /> you'd let her play with my golf clubs, too.""<br /> ""Of course not, dear,"" said the husband. ""She is left-handed.""</p>

Suddenly one of the Indians ran up to one of the caves and yelled,<br /> WOOOOOOWOOOOOOWOOOOOOWOOOOOWOOOOOOO!<br /> There was a reply from inside the cave, WOOOOOOOOWOOOOOWOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOWOOOOO! So the Indian tore off his clothes and ran inside.<br /> The hillbilly was confused about this, so he asked the other Indian, who replied, Well during mating season, all the women hide inside these caves, and what the men have to do is go up to one of the caves and yell WOOOOWOOOOWOOOOWOOOOOWOOOO! And if the women yell WOOOOWOOOOWOOOOWOOOOWOOOO! he can then take off his clothes and go in to mate.<br /> And indeed, when they came to another cave, the Indian ran up to it and yelled WOOOOOOOWOOOOOOWOOOOOOWOOOOOOWOOOOOOO! There was another WOOOOOOWOOOOOWOOOOOWOOOOOOWOOOOOOO! from inside the cave, so the Indian tore off his clothes and ran inside to mate with the women in the cave.<br /> The hillbilly thought this was a great idea. He ran up to one really big cave, thinking, Wow, there must be lots of big beautiful women in here! So he called, WOOOOOOWOOOOOWOOOOOOWOOOOOWOOOOO!, and sure enough he heard a loud WOOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOWOOOOOOO! The hillbilly tore off his clothes and dashed inside.<br /> The next day, the front page of the local newspaper bore the headline:<br /> NAKED HILLBILLY RUN OVER BY FREIGHT TRAIN</p>

The following morning the two husbands were talking to each other on the phone. One commented, ""I think we need to start keeping a closer eye on our wives you know. I reckon they're up to no good.

47834,"<p>One day a guy got invited over to his girlfriend's parents house for dinner. He really liked the girl and was set out to impress her parents. When he arrived at the girl's house he was quickly whisked into the dinning room where they were getting reading to sit down for dinner. He sat down in his chair and the family dog curled up under him. Halfway through dinner the man felt a rumble in his tummy and noticed he had gas. He was very uncomfortable so he let a little bit out hoping no one would notice. As soon as he did, the girl's father yelled at the dog ""Rufus!"" The guy thought, hey, this is great and let out a little bit more. Once again, the girl's father yelled ""Rufus!"" They guy decided to let all the gas out since the father thought it was the dog. After he let a long fart out, the girl's father yells at the dog ""RUFUS! Get out from under that chair before that man shits on you!""</p>

47839,"<p>Two friends decided they would dodge the draft by having all of their teeth pulled. They knew the army would not take them if they were toothless. Finally, the day came where they were to report to the draft board. As they lined up they were separated by a big truck driver who had obviously not bathed in weeks. When the first friend stood before the sergeant for a physical examination he told the sergeant that he had no teeth. </p>
<p>The sergeant ran his fingers around his gums and said, ""Alright, you have no teeth -- you're 4F."" </p>
<p>Next came the big, smelly truck driver. The sergeant said to him, ""What's wrong with you?"" </p>
<p>The truck driver replied, ""I have a terrible case of piles."" </p>
<p>The sergeant inserted his fingers in the truck driver's ass, and felt around, and said, ""Yep, you've got piles. You're 4F."" </p>

They were told by their boss to put the mule in the barn.<br /> When they led the mule over to the barn, they decided that the mule's ears were to long and he would not fit into the barn. So they put their heads together and decided to get a ladder and a saw and saw the overhead of the barn out so the mule could walk right on in the barn. </p>
<p>They began their job and the boss walked over to them and asked them why they were sawing out the top of the barn. When they told him the mule's ears were too long to go into the barn, the boss said: </p>
<p>""Why don't you just get a shovel and dig the dirt out of the ground below, then the mule could walk on in"" </p>

47847,"<p>Ollie and Olga were two Norwegians in the United States who were<br /> madly in love. They decided to be married in the middle of duck<br /> hunting season and have their honeymoon in Minnesota. They could<br /> not afford to fly, so the had to take a bus from Chicago through<br /> Wisconsin with a bunch of duck hunters. The bus is driving<br /> along, and all of a sudden it breaks down in the middle of<br /> Milwaukee. So while they are waiting, the duck hunters go inside<br /> a coffee shop.

"
47848,"<p>1 star hangover * </p>
<p>No pain. No real feeling of illness.. Your sleep last night was a mere disco nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy. Be glad that you are able to function relatively well. However, you are still parched. You can drink 10 bottles of water and still feel this way. Even vegetarians are craving a Cheeseburger and a side of fries. </p>
<p>2 star hangover ** </p>
<p>Slight headache. Don't feel sick, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler. The coffee you chug to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which is craving a full English breakfast. Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels and even though you have a nice demeanour about the office, you are costing your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is aimlessly surfing the net and writing junk e-mails. </p>
<p>3 star hangover *** </p>
<p>Definite headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely a space cadet and so not productive. Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer kicked you out at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your bed with a dozen donuts and a litre of coke watching Good Morning with Richard and Judy. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 2 Sausage Rolls and a litre of diet coke - yet you haven't peed once. </p>
<p>4 star hangover **** </p>
<p>Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else you might honk. You have lost the will to live. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but that can't hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls, it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars), your teeth have sweaters, your eyes look like one big vein </p>
<p>and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the class picture of Moss side secondary school circa 1976. You would give a weeks pay for one the following: 1. Home time, 2. A duvet and somewhere to be alone, or 3. A time machine so you could go back and NOT have gone out the night before. </p>
<p>5 star hangover (aka Dante's 4th Circle of Hell) ***** </p>
<p>You have a second heartbeat in your head which is actually scaring the employee who sits next to you. Death seems pretty good right now. You can't focus as your eyes are scrunched up against the overpowering glare from your computer screen Rancid vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore, staining your shirt and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth, at least you think it's toothpaste crust. You don't give a damn either way. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva and your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body. Talking is not an option. Your boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog just died because you look so pathetic. You should have called in sick because all you can manage to do is breathe....very gently.</p>

47861,"<p>April 30th: Florida is fantastic! Just got here and love it already. Now this is a state that knows how to live! Beautiful sunny days and warm balmy evenings. What a place! Watched the sunset from a park lying on a blanket. It was beautiful. I've finally found my home. I love it here. </p>
<p>May 14th: Really heating up. Got to 89 today. Not a problem, live in an air-conditioned home, drive an air-conditioned car. What a pleasure to see the sun every day like this. I'm turning into a real sun worshipper. </p>
<p>June 5th: Had the backyard landscaped with tropical plants today. Lots of palms and rocks. What a breeze to maintain. No more mowing for me. NO MORE SHOVELING SNOW EITHER! Another scorcher today, but I love it here. </p>
<p>July 1st: The temperature hasn't been below 90 all week, not even at night. Where are those ocean breezes we heard about, still seems hot. Getting used to it will take a while, I guess. I sure miss my LP collection, though. I'll have to remember not to leave anything made out of plastic in my car. Got one of those fuzzy steering wheel covers, Cheaper than the burn ointment for my hands. I always wondered what burnt flesh smelled like. </p>
<p>July 15th: Fell asleep by the pool. (Got 3rd degree burns over 60% of my body.) Missed two days of work, what a dumb thing to do. I learned my lesson though: got to respect the ol' sun in a climate like </p>
<p>this. </p>
<p>July 20th: I miss our cat, Tabby. He snuck into the car when I left this morning. By the time I got out to the hot car for lunch, he'd swollen up to the size of a shopping bag and just as I opened the door he exploded all over $2,000 worth of leather upholstery. I told the kids he ran away. The car now smells like Kibbles and poop. No more pets in this heat! </p>
<p>July 25th: Ocean breezes, my ass. Hot is hot!! The home air conditioner is on the fritz and AC repairman charged $200 just to drive by and tell me he needed to order parts. Only hope for a break in the heat would be a hurricane. </p>
<p>July 30th: Been sleeping outside by the pool for three nights now. Swatting the swamp mosquitos that are as big as B-52's. $1,500 in darn house payments and we can't even go inside. Why did I ever come here? </p>
<p>Aug 4th: 100 degrees. Finally got the air conditioner fixed today. It cost $500 and gets the temperature down to about 90. The electric bill is almost as much as the house payment. And two old lady drivers almost ran me off the road. I hate this state. </p>
<p>Aug 8th: If another wise jerk cracks, 'Hot enough for you today?' I'm going to tear his head off. Damn heat. By the time I get to work the radiator is boiling over, my clothes are soaking wet, and I smell like roasted Garfield!! </p>
<p>Aug 10th: The weather report might as well be a damn recording: Hot and sunny. It's been too hot two #@*&amp; months and the weatherman says it might really warm up next week. And who came up with the statement 'it may be hot, but at least you don't have to shovel it' should die from heat exhaustion. Doesn't it ever rain in this God forsaken place?? </p>
<p>Aug 14th: Welcome to Hell!!! Temperature got to 102 today. Forgot to crack the window and blew the windshield out of the Mercedes. The installer came to fix it and said, 'Hot enough for you today?' My wife had to spend the $1,500 house payment to bail me out of jail. </p>
<p>Aug 30th: Worst day of the summer. I'm not leaving the house. The monsoon rains finally came and all they did is to make it muggier than hell and drove the damned roaches out of the ground. I wasn't aware they could fly! The Mercedes is now floating somewhere in the Caribbean with its new $500 windshield. </p>
<p>That does it, we're moving back to Chicago where all you have to worry about is getting mugged. I hope this state breaks in half and floats down to Cuba!</p>

47869,"<p>Three guys enter a disabled swimming contest. </p>
<p>The first has no arms. </p>
<p>The second no legs and the third has no body, just a head. </p>
<p>They all line up, the whistle blows and ""splash"" they're all in the pool.</p>
<p>The guy with no arms takes the lead instantly but the guy with no legs is closing fast. </p>
<p>The head of course sank straight to the bottom.</p>
<p>Ten lengths later and the guy with no legs finishes first. </p>
<p>He can still see bubbles coming from the bottom of the pool, so he decides he had better dive down to rescue him.</p>
<p>He picks up the head, swims back up to the surface and places the head at the side of the pool, where upon the head starts coughing and sputtering.</p>
<p>Eventually the head catches his breath and shouts, ""Three years I've spent learning to swim with my fucking ears, then two minutes before the whistle, some asshole puts a swimming cap on me!"" </p>

47874,"<p>Why did the chicken cross the road?</p>
<p>Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was threatening its<br /> dominant market position. The chicken was faced with significant<br /> challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly<br /> competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partnering relationship<br /> with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical<br /> distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry<br /> Integration Model (PIM) Andersen helped the chicken use its skills,<br /> methodologies, knowledge capital and experiences to align the chicken's<br /> people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy<br /> within a Program Management framework. Andersen Consulting convened a<br /> diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens along with<br /> Andersen consultants with deep skills in the transportation industry to<br /> engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their<br /> personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them<br /> to synergize with each other in order to achievethe implicit goals of<br /> delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an<br /> enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry<br /> cross-median processes.  The meeting was held in a park like setting<br /> enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically<br /> based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear, and unified<br /> market message and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, and core<br /> values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total business<br /> integration solution. Andersen Consulting helped the chicken change to<br /> become more successful.</p>
<p>I hope that this will finally answer the question and end all the<br /> controversy surrounding it once and for all.</p>

47883,"<p>Little Johnny applied for a salesman's job at a big department store. In fact<br /> it was the biggest store in the world - you could get anything there. </p>
<p>The boss asked him, 'Have you ever been a salesman before?' 'No, this is my<br /> first job,' said the lad, but the boss liked the cut of him and said, 'You can<br /> start tomorrow and I'll come and see you when we close up.' </p>
<p>The day was long and arduous for the young man, but finally 5 o'clock came<br /> around. The boss duly fronted up and asked, 'How many sales did you make today?'<br /> 'One,' said the young salesman. 'Only one?' blurted the boss, 'Most of my staff<br /> makes 20 or 30 sales a day. How much was the sale worth??' 'Three hundred<br /> thousand, three hundred and thirty four dollars.' said Little Johnny.</p>
<p>'How did you manage that?' asked the flabbergasted boss. 'Well,' said Little<br /> Johnny, 'this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook<br /> and finally a really large hook. Then I sold him a small fishing line, a medium<br /> one and a huge big one. I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down<br /> the coast. I said he would probably need a boat, so I took him down to the boat<br /> department and sold him that twenty foot schooner with the twin engines. Then he<br /> said his Volkswagen probably wouldn't be able to pull it, so I took him to the<br /> car department and sold him the new Deluxe Cruiser.' </p>
<p>The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, 'You sold all that to<br /> a guy who came in for a fish hook?' 'No.' answered Little Johnny, 'He came in to<br /> buy a box of Tampons for his wife so I said to him, 'Well, your weekends screwed<br /> - you might as well go fishing.' '</p>

After nearly fifteen minutes of this, the sheep still show no signs that they intend to leave, so she gets out and goes to the nearby house, knocks on the door, and says to the farmer, ""Hey! Get your sheep off the road or I'll.. I'll... I'll sue you. Yeah, that's it. I'll sue you!""</p>

The second one looks in the mirror and says, ""You dummy, it's me!"" THREE A blonde suspects her boyfriend of cheating on her, so she goes out and buys a gun. She goes to his apartment unexpectedly and when she opens the door she finds him in the arms of a redhead. Well, the blonde is really angry.

""Well, how in the world did this happen?"" the officer asked as he surveyed the wrecked car. ""Officer, it was the strangest thing!"" the blonde began. ""I was driving along this road when from out of nowhere this TREE pops up in front of me. So I swerved to the right, and there was another tree! I swerved to the left and there was ANOTHER tree! I swerved to the the right and there was another tree! I swerved to the left and there was...."" ""Uh, ma'am,"" the officer said, cutting her off, ""There isn't a tree on this road for 30 miles.

She telephoned the police at once and reported the crime. The police dispatcher broadcast the call on the channels, and a K_9 unit patrolling nearby was the first to respond. As the K_9 officer approached the house with his dog on a leash, the blonde ran out on the porch, shuddered at the sight of the cop and his dog, then sat down on the steps. Putting her face in her hands, she moaned, ""I come home to find all my possessions stolen. I call the police for help, and what do they do? They send me a BLIND policeman!""</p>

<p>The preacher rose with a red face. ""Someone in this congregation has spread a rumor that I belong to the K.K.K. This is a horrible lie and one which a Christian community cannot tolerate. I am embarrassed and do not intend to accept this. Now I want the party who did this to stand and ask forgiveness from God and this Christian family!"" </p>

"
47916,"<p>How To Tell If You're Throwing A Successful Christmas Party</p>
<p>- Festivity Level One -<br /> Your guests are sitting around chatting, nibbling the party food, sipping<br /> their drinks. They are admiring your Christmas tree ornaments and stand<br /> around the piano singing carols.</p>
<p>- Festivity Level Two -<br /> Your guests are talking loudly, occasionally to one another. They are<br /> wolfing down the food, gulping their drinks, rearranging your Christmas<br /> ornaments and sitting on the piano singing ""I Gotta Be Me.""</p>
<p>- Festivity Level Three -<br /> Your guests are holding conversations with inanimate objects, gulping<br /> other peoples' drinks, wolfing down Christmas ornaments and dancing around<br /> the piano shouting the words to ""I Can't Get No Satisfaction.""</p>
<p>- Festivity Level Four -<br /> Your guests, food smeared across their naked bodies, are capering around<br /> the burning Christmas tree in some unholy ritual. The piano is missing.</p>
<p>Unless you rent your home, or own heavy firearms, you generally don't want<br /> your parties operating above Level Three. The true test of party success,<br /> however, is whether or not the police arrive. If they do arrive, your job<br /> as host is to see that they don't arrest anyone. If they are intent on<br /> arresting someone, your job is to see that it isn't you. Following is an<br /> example of how to successfully handle this situation:</p>
<p>Police: ""We've come in response to the complaints.""</p>
<p>You: ""Complaints? It isn't about the drugs, is it?""</p>
<p>Police: ""No, sir, not drugs.""</p>
<p>You: ""The guns, then? They're complaining about the guns?""</p>
<p>Police: ""No, sir. It's about the noise.""</p>
<p>You: ""Oh that's all right then. 'Cause there sure aren't any guns or drugs<br /> here, heh heh.""</p>
<p>[An explosion sounds somewhere behind you]</p>
<p>You: ""Or fireworks either! The neighbors complained, did they?""</p>
<p>Police: ""No, sir. The neighbors all fled inland hours ago. The recent<br /> complaints have come from Iowa.""</p>
<p>[At this point a Volkswagen Bug, painted in various arcane symbols, roars<br /> out of the living room, down the hall past you and the policemen, out into<br /> the front yard and into the nearest tree. Eight naked bodies tumble out,<br /> moaning.]</p>
<p>You: ""There, you see? It's winding down already.""</p>

I'd like to provide $35,000 for my funeral.""The lawyer remarked, ""Well, for $35,000 you will be able to havea funeral that will certainly be noticed and will leave a lastingimpression on anyone who may not have taken much note of you! But tell me,"" he continued, what would you like to do with theremaining $5,000?""The spinster replied, ""As you know, I've never married, I've lived alone almost my entire life, and in fact I've never slept with a man. I'd like you to use the $5,000 to arrange for a man to sleep with me.""""This is a very unusual request,"" the lawyer said, adding, ""butI'll see what I can do to arrange it and get back to you.""That evening, the lawyer was at home telling his wife about theeccentric spinster and her weird request. After thinking abouthow much she could do around the house with $5,000, and with abit of coaxing, she got her husband to agree to provide the service himself. She said, ""I'll drive you over tomorrow morning, and wait in the car until you're finished.""The next morning, she drove him to the spinster's house and waited while he went into the house. She waited for over an hour, but her husband didn't come out. So she blew the car horn.Shortly, the upstairs bedroom window opened, the lawyer stuck hishead out and yelled, ""Pick me up tomorrow, she's going to let theCounty bury her!""</p>

47953,"<p>MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the Chicken, ""Thou shalt cross the road!""  And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.</p>
<p>AGENT MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?</p>
<p>RICHARD M. NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did NOT cross the road.</p>
<p>JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road?  I mean, why doesn't anyone ever think to ask, ""What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the place, anyway?""</p>
<p>FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.</p>
<p>BILL GATES:  I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook.</p>
<p>OLIVER STONE: The question is not, ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" Rather, it is, ""Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?""</p>
<p>DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected in such a way that they are now genetically dispositioned to cross roads.</p>
<p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you will see, represents the black man.  The chicken 'crossed' the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.</p>
<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.</p>
<p>GRANDPA: In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us that the chicken had crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.</p>
<p>MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road.  Who cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Asking this questions denies your own chicken nature.</p>

<p>He kept meticulous records, raising the clone-child in his laboratory until it was an adult. Then he made his plans to unveil his creation at a meeting of top scientists, held in the luxurious facilities of a high-rise hotel.</p>
<p>When the time for his presentation came, the scientist stepped to the podium. He presented his data -- his pictures, his charts, his graphs -- to an amazed audience. But suddenly, instead of waiting for his cue to come forward, the clone stood up where he'd been sitting, and started shouting at the scientists assembled there.</p>
<p>This clone was an imaginative clone. He used language that would make a sailor blush, accusing his creator and all of his colleagues of the most amazing feats of perversion and vice.</p>
<p>Trying to regain control, the scientist ushered the clone out of the room and up to the roof of the hotel, where he hoped the clone's shouts would go unheard.</p>
<p>The clone would not listen to reason. He attacked the scientist's parentage, his sister, his mother....</p>
<p>Finally, the scientist snapped. He could bear it no longer. He rushed forward and with a mighty shove, pushed his creation off the roof of the hotel.</p>
<p>The police arrived promptly and arrested the scientist for making an obscene clone fall.</p>

<p>12. Rather than doing 17 year olds backstage, they do themselves in public restrooms. </p>
