38000,"<p>REAL STORY:  A Cork Radio Station (in Ireland), 96 FM, was<br /> running a competition to find contestants who could come up with<br /> words that were not found in any English Dictionary, yet could<br /> still be used in a sentence that would make logical sense.  The<br /> prize was a trip to Bali for a week.</p>
<p>The DJ, Neil, had many callers; the following two standing out:</p>
<p>DJ:  96FM, what's your name<br /> Caller:  Hi, me name's Dave<br /> DJ:  Dave, what is your word<br /> Caller:  Goan.....spelt G-O-A-N, pronounced 'go-an'<br /> DJ:  We are just checking that (pause) and you are correct,<br /> Dave, 'goan' is certainly a word not found in the English<br /> Dictionary.  Now the next question, for a trip for two to Bali<br /> is:  What sentence can you use that word in that would make<br /> logical sense?<br /> Caller:  ""Goan fuck yourself""</p>
<p>At this point, the DJ cut the caller short and announced that<br /> there is no place for that sort of language on a family show.</p>
<p>After many more unsuccessful calls, the DJ took the following<br /> caller:</p>
<p>DJ:  96FM, what's your name<br /> Caller:  Hi, me name's Jeff<br /> DJ:  Jeff, what is your word<br /> Caller:  Smee.....spelt S-M-E-E, pronounced 'smee'<br /> DJ:  We are checking that (pause) and you are correct, Jeff.<br /> 'Smee' is certainly a word not found in the English Dictionary.<br /> Now the next question, for a trip for two to Bali, is:  What<br /> sentence can you use that word in that would make logical sense?<br /> Caller:  ""Smee again! Goan fuck yourself!""</p>

38043,"<p>A guy wanted to buy a gift for his new girlfriend's birthday. </p>
<p>As they had only started dating, after careful consideration, he decided a pair of gloves would strike the right note, personal, but not too personal.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the girlfriend's younger sister, he went to Dillards and bought a pair of white gloves. The sister purchased a pair of panties for herself. </p>
<p>During the wrapping, however, the clerk got the items mixed up and the sister got the gloves and the girlfriend got the panties.</p>
<p>The guy sent the package to the girlfriend with the following note:</p>
<p>I chose these because I noticed you are not in the habit of wearing any in the evening. If it had not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears the short ones that are easier to remove. </p>
<p>These are a delicate shade, but the sales clerk that helped me has a pair that she has been wearing for the past three weeks and they are hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart.</p>
<p>I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will come into contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. </p>
<p>When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. </p>
<p>Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year. I hope you will wear them for me Friday night. </p>
<p>All my love.</p>
<p>P.S. The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing. </p>

38052,"<p>A prisoner at the Edmonton Max started training a large fly to do tricks.For years, for thousands of hours, he worked with the insect. It learned to walk across a miniature high wire, ride a tiny one-wheel bike, balance on a pair of stilts and sing songs from PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. ""When you and I get out of here,"" the jailbird said to the fly. ""we're going to tour the nightspots and make a fortune."" Finally the day arrived. Fly safely tucked away in his pocket, (inside its matchbox home), the ex-con made his way to a bar to celebrate. At the bar, he brought out his trick fly. On cue, it started moonwalking. ""What about this fly, eh?"" he said to the bartender. In one swift motion, the bartender reached for his copy of the newspaper THE EDMONTON SUN, rolled it up and squished the fly with a mighty swipe. ""Glad you saw it,"" muttered the bartender. ""Blasted things are everywhere.""</p>

The man then<br /> calmly removes his false eye and bites it. The bartender grudgingly forks over a<br /> twenty. Later that night, after a few more beers, the man wanders back to the<br /> bar and says rather drunkenly, �Hey barkeep, bet you another $20 I can bite my<br /> other eye.� Wanting to win back his money and seriously doubtful that the man<br /> has two false eyes, the bartender accepts. The man calmly removes his<br /> false teeth and bites his other eye. Scowling, the bartender hands over<br /> another twenty. The man leaves and wanders around the bar as he drinks a few<br /> more beers. He strolls back over to the bar, leaning on it, again and calls the<br /> bartender, �Hey, barkeep,� he burbles, �I'll give you a chance to win year money<br /> back plus. Bet you $100 if you put a shot glass on that end of the bar, and I<br /> stood on this end, I could piss into it and not spill a drop.� The bartender<br /> eagerly accepts, knowing the feat to be impossible. The man wobbly climbs atop<br /> the bar, zips down his fly and promptly pisses all over the bar. He zips up,<br /> sits down, slaps the $100 on the bar and laughs uproariously. �What's so<br /> funny?� says the barkeep, �you just lost everything you won and more!� �Well,�<br /> giggles the man, �I just bet those guys over there $200 that I could piss all<br /> over your bar and you wouldn't get angry.�</p>

38068,"<p>CHILI CONTEST  These are notes from an inexperienced chili taster named    FRANK, who was visiting Texas from New Jersey... ""Recently I was lucky enough to be the 10,000th attendee at the State Fair in Texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili cook-off. </p>
<p>Apparently the original Judge #3 called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there when the call came in and was assured by the other two Judges (Native Texans) that it would be a fun event and a true taste of Texas hospitality.  They assured me that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy and besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted. </p>
<p>Here are the scorecards from the event.""</p>
<p>Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.<br /> FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with it took me two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy. </p>
<p>Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.<br /> FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face. </p>
<p>Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.<br /> JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.<br /> FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now.  Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest.  I'm getting shit-faced. </p>
<p>Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic<br /> JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.<br /> FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills, that 300 lb bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating. </p>
<p>Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover<br /> JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick.Very impressive.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.<br /> FRANK: My ears are ringing and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me burst into flames. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks! </p>
<p>Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety<br /> JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.<br /> JUDGE TWO: The best yet. An aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic. Superb.<br /> FRANK: My intestine�s are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulphuric flames.  No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone! </p>
<p>Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.<br /> JUDGE TWO: �Ho hum�, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.<br /> FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided too stop breathing, it's too painful.  Screw it,I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4inch hole in my stomach. </p>
<p>Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending... this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.<br /> JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself.  Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.<br /> FRANK: --------------(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable to report)</p>

<p>I'm writing this letter slow because I know you can't read fast. We don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles from your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last North Carolina family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so that they wouldn't have to change their address. This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though: last week I put a load in and pulled the chain and haven't seen them since. The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days. </p>
<p>About that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Stanley said it would be to heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. John locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out. Your sister had a baby this morning; but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you're an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother.... Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days. Three of your friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck. Ralph was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down. There isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much has happened. </p>
<p>Love, Mom </p>
<p>P.S. I was going to send you some money but the envelope was already sealed.</p>

A few miles into the trek, the<br /> blonde started coming onto him, so needless to say, he pulled<br /> over to the side of the desolate, deserted road so she could<br /> give him some oral pleasure.

Then, she robbed him of his wallet and clothes,<br /> and drove off with his car.</p>

She will not nag you, and will always be the first to admit she was wrong when you've had a disagreement.

38134,"<p>Dear Help Desk, </p>
<p>Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and<br /> noticed that the new program began making unexpected changes to<br /> the accounting modules, limiting access to flower and jewelry<br /> applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. </p>
<p>In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable<br /> programs, such as Romance 9.9 but installed undesirable programs<br /> such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. </p>
<p>Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and HouseCleaning 2.6 simply<br /> crashes the system. </p>
<p>I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no<br /> avail. </p>
<p>Please help! </p>
<p>--Desperate </p>
<p>Dear Desperate, </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment<br /> package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. </p>
<p>Try to enter the command: C:/I-THOUGHT-YOU-LOVED-ME and then<br /> install Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the<br /> applications: Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse<br /> can cause Husband 1.0 to default to GrumpySilence 2.5, HappyHour<br /> 7.0 or Beer 6.1. </p>
<p>Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create ""Snoring Loudly""<br /> WAV sound files. DO NOT install MotherInLaw 1.0 or reinstall<br /> another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications<br /> and will crash Husband 1.0. </p>
<p>In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have<br /> limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly.<br /> Consider buying additional software to improve performance. </p>
<p>I personally recommend HotFood 3.0 and Lingerie 5.3 </p>

The machine makes a loud 'hiss-pop' noise. 'The hiss is the rubber being injected into the mold,' explains the guide. 'The popping sound is the needle poking a hole in the end of the nipple.' Later, the tour reaches the part of the factory where condoms are manufactured. The machine makes a 'Hiss. Hiss. Hiss. Hiss-pop' noise. 'Wait a minute!' says the man taking the tour. 'I understand what the 'hiss, hiss,' is, but what's that 'pop' every so often?' 'Oh, it's just the same as in the baby-bottle nipple machine,' says the guide. It pokes a hole in every fourth condom.' 'Well, that can't be good for the condoms!' 'Yeah, but it's great for the baby-bottle nipple business!'</p>

38218,"<p>An eighty-five-year-old couple, married for almost sixty years,<br /> died in a car crash. They had been in good health the last ten<br /> years, mainly as a result of her interest in health food and<br /> exercise.</p>
<p>When they reached the Pearly Gates, St. Peter took them to their<br /> mansion, which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and a<br /> master bath suite with a sauna and Jacuzzi. As they ""oohed and<br /> aahed"" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to<br /> cost. ""It's free,"" Peter replied. ""This is heaven.""</p>
<p>Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course<br /> that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges<br /> every day, and each week the course would change to new one that<br /> represented one of the great golf courses on Earth. The old man<br /> asked, ""What are the green fees?"" Peter's reply: ""This is<br /> heaven; you play for free.""</p>
<p>Next they went to the clubhouse and saw the lavish buffet lunch<br /> with the cuisines of the world laid out. ""How much to eat?""<br /> asked the old man. ""Don't you understand yet? This is heaven; it<br /> is free!"" Peter replied with some exasperation. ""Well, where are<br /> the low-fat and low-cholesterol tables?"" the old man asked<br /> timidly. Peter lectured, ""That's the best part: You can eat as<br /> much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and<br /> you never get sick. This is heaven.""</p>
<p>With that, the old man threw down his hat, stomped on it, and<br /> shrieked wildly. Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down,<br /> asking him what was wrong. The old man looked at his wife and<br /> said, ""This is all your fault. If it weren't for your blasted<br /> bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!""</p>

38219,"<p>Son:""Dad, I have to do a special report for school. Can I ask you a question?"" </p>
<p>Father: ""Sure son. What's the question?"" </p>
<p>Son: ""What is politics?"" </p>
<p>Father: ""Well, let's take our home for example. I am the wage earner, so let's call me ""Capitalism"". Your mother is the administrator of money, so we'll call her ""Government"". We take care of your needs, so we'll call you ""The People"". We'll call the maid ""The Working Class"", and your baby brothe we can call ""The Future"". </p>
<p>""Do you understand, Son?"" </p>
<p>Son: ""I'm not really sure, Dad. I'll have to think about it"". </p>
<p>That night, awakened by his baby brother's crying, the boy went to see what was wrong. Discovering that the baby had seriously soiled his diaper, the boy went to his parent's room and found his mother sound asleep. He went to the maid's room, where, peeking through the keyhole, he saw his father in bed with the maid. The boy's knocking went totally unheeded by his father and the maid, so the boy returned to his room and went back to sleep. </p>
<p>The next morning he reported to his father. ""Dad, now I think I understand what politics is"". </p>
<p>Father: ""Good son! Can you explain it to me in your own words?"" </p>
<p>Son: ""Well Dad, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, Government is sound asleep, the People are being completely ignored and the Future is full of shit"".</p>

"
38221,"<p>There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long<br /> business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he<br /> thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while<br /> he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her<br /> screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys<br /> and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex<br /> doll, but that was too close to another man for him.</p>
<p>He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something<br /> special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man<br /> behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man<br /> said, ""Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the<br /> trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on,<br /> but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for<br /> weeks, except -- "" and he stopped.</p>
<p>""Except what?"" the man asked.</p>
<p>""Nothing, nothing.""</p>
<p>""C'mon, tell me! I need something!""</p>
<p>""Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the<br /> 'voodoo dick.'""</p>
<p>""So what's up with this voodoo dick?"" he asked.</p>
<p>The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old<br /> wooden box, carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there<br /> lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and<br /> said ""Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this<br /> shop!""</p>
<p>The old man replied, ""But you haven't seen what it'll do yet.""<br /> He pointed to a door and said ""Voodoo dick, the door."" The<br /> voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and<br /> started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the<br /> vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the<br /> door could split, the old man said ""Voodoo dick, get back in<br /> your box!"" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and<br /> lay there, quiescent once more.</p>
<p>""I'll take it!"" said the businessman.</p>
<p>The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally<br /> surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife,<br /> told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had<br /> to do was say ""Voodoo dick, my pussy."" He left for his trip<br /> satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.</p>
<p>After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny.<br /> She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her,<br /> but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and<br /> said ""Voodoo dick, my pussy!"" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch<br /> and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever<br /> experienced before. After three orgasms, she decided she'd had<br /> enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still<br /> thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing<br /> worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off.<br /> So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help.<br /> She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to<br /> the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the<br /> way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she<br /> was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and<br /> then asked how much she'd had to drink.</p>
<p>Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been<br /> drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and<br /> wouldn't stop screwing. The officer looked at her for a second,<br /> and then said ""Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!""</p>

So they got into an argument about who enjoyed sex more. </p>
<p>The man said, ""Men obviously enjoy sex more than women. Why do you think we're so obsessed with getting laid?"" He then went on for several hours arguing his point, even going so far as to ask other men in the bar for their opinions. The woman listened quietly until the man was finished making his point. Confident in the strength of his argument, the man awaited her response.</p>
<p>""That doesn't prove anything,"" the woman countered. ""Think about this - When your ear itches and you put your little finger in it and wiggle it around, then pull it out, which feels better- your ear or your finger?</p>

38248,"<p>This is true story from the newspaper The Cape Times (South Africa):<br /> ""For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a patient dead in the same bed every Friday morning"" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital (Free State, South Africa) told reporters. </p>
<p>""There was no apparent cause for any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues."" ""However, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths... </p>
<p>""It seems that every Friday morning a cleaning lady would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient's life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher"". </p>
<p>""We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question. Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this incident. The inquiry is now closed."" (Cape Times) </p>

<p>After the doctor stopped laughing, he says, ""Medically, no, but here's something you can try...on the wedding night, when you're getting ready for bed, take an elastic band and slide it to your upper thigh, when your husband puts it in, snap the elastic band and tell him it's your virginity  snapping.""</p>
<p>The woman loves this idea, and knows her hubby-to-be will fall for this. They have a beautiful wedding and retire to the honeymoon suite. The wife gets ready for bed in the bathroom, slips the elastic band up her leg, finishes preparing and climbs into bed with her man.</p>
<p>Things begin to progress, her hubby ""slips it in"", she snaps the elastic band, and the hubby asks, ""what the *@#% was that?     The wife explains, ""oh nothing honey, that was just my virginity snapping"".</p>
<p>The husband cries out, ""Well snap it again, it's got my balls!!!!""</p>

38263,"<p>An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his dossier and says, ""Ah, you're an engineer -- you're in the wrong place.""</p>
<p>So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After a while, they've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy.</p>
<p>One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, ""So, how's it going down there in hell?""</p>
<p>Satan replies, ""Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.""</p>
<p>God replies, ""What??? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake -- he should never have gotten down there; send him up here."" </p>
<p>Satan says, ""No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him."" </p>

<p>1. Under no circumstances use any other toilet than your own,<br /> regardless of any stomach pain that may be caused while waiting<br /> to get home. </p>
<p>2. With the toilet-brush, clean any residue left on the bowl by<br /> your boyfriend/husband. Also wipe his pubic hair off the seat<br /> with some toilet paper. </p>
<p>3. Flush the toilet before starting. Then wash your hands. </p>
<p>4. Line the toilet seat with toilet paper (as other people may<br /> have sat on the toilet since it was last bleached). </p>
<p>5. Stuff toilet paper inside the bowl to prevent splash back. </p>
<p>6. Pull panties down and sit. Some women may still prefer to<br /> squat over the seat as opposed to taking the risk of touching it<br /> with bare flesh. </p>
<p>7. Release solids, but strain to avoid making any sounds. </p>
<p>8. Rise and quickly flush before direct eye contact is made with<br /> any feces. </p>
<p>9. Take a length of toilet paper and fold it several times to<br /> positively guarantee that no residue will touch bare skin (about<br /> five or six applications per roll). </p>
<p>10. Wipe once and throw paper into the bowl. Do not look at the<br /> paper. </p>
<p>11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 at least thirty times. It may be<br /> necessary to yell for your boyfriend/husband to find some more<br /> rolls to pass through the door while promising not to open his<br /> eyes or pass any comments. It is traditional to do this while he<br /> is trying to watch sports. </p>
<p>12. Flush the toilet and replace the lid. </p>
<p>13. Wash hands at least three times with disinfectant soap. </p>
<p>14. Open all windows and spray approximately half-a-can of air<br /> freshener. </p>

38286,"<p>When I was in high school I used to be terrified of my girlfriend's father, who I believe suspected me of wanting to place my hands on his daughter's chest. He would open the door and immediately affect a good-naturedly murderous expression, holding out a handshake that, when gripped, felt like it could squeeze carbon into diamonds</p>
<p>Now, years later, it is my turn to be the dad. Remembering how unfairly persecuted I felt when I would pick up my dates, I do my best ot make my daughter's suitors feel even worse.</p>
<p>My motto: wilt them in the living room and they'll stay wilted all night.</p>
<p>""So,"" I'll call out jovially. ""I see you have your nose pierced. Is that because you're STUPID, or did you merely want to APPEAR stupid?""</p>
<p>As a dad, I have some basic rules, which I have carved into two stone tablets that I have on display in my living room.</p>
<p>Rule one: If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package, because you're sure as heck not picking anything up.</p>
<p>Rule two: You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.</p>
<p>Rule Three: I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, in order to assure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric staple gun and fasten your trousers securely in place around your waist.</p>
<p>Rule Four: I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a ""barrier method"" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I WILL kill you.</p>
<p>Rule five: In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is ""early"".</p>
<p>Rule six: I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make YOU cry.</p>
<p>Rule seven: As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process which can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?</p>
<p>Rule eight: The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter. Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wodden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight, Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater and a goose down parka zipped up to her adam's apple. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay.</p>
<p>My daughter claims it embarrasses her to come downstairs and find me attempting to get her date to recite these eight simple rules from memory. I'd be embarrassed too--there are only eight of them, for crying out loud! And, for the record, I did NOT suggest to one of these cretins that I'd have these rules tattooed on his arm if he couldn't remember them. (I checked into it and the cost is prohibitive.) I merely told him that I thought writing the rules on his arm with a ball point might be inadequate--ink washes off--and that my wood burning set was probably a better alternative.</p>
<p>One time, when my wife caught me having one of my daughter's would-be suitors practice pulling into the driveway, get out of the car, and go up to knock on the frond door (he had violated rule number one, so I figured he needed to run throught the drill a few dozen times) she asked me why I was being so hard on the boy. ""Don't you remember being that age?"" she challenged.</p>
<p>Of course I remember. Why do you think I came up with the eight simple rules?</p>

No pets are allowed in here! You'll have  to leave!""The guy begged him: ""Look, I'm desperate. We're both big fans, the TV is broken, and this is the only place around where we can see the game!""After securing a promise that the dog will behave, and warning him that he and the dog will be thrown out if there's any trouble, the bartender relented and allowed them to stay in the bar and watch the game.The big game began with the Raiders receiving the kickoff. They marched down the field, got stopped at about the 30, and kicked a field goal.With that the dog jumped up on the bar, and began walking up and down the bar giving high-fives to everyone.The bartender said, ""Wow, that is the most amazing thing I've ever seen! What does the dog do when the Raiders score a touchdown?""The owner replied, ""I don't know, I've only had him for 4 years.""</p>

38324,"<p>Tips for Managers and Bosses</p>
<p>1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 4:00 and<br /> then bring it to me. The challenge of a deadline is refreshing.</p>
<p>2. If it's really a rush job, run in and interrupt me every 10<br /> minutes to inquire how it's going. That helps. Or even better,<br /> hover behind me, advising me at every keystroke.</p>
<p>3. Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It<br /> gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where you are.</p>
<p>4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or supplies,<br /> don't open the door for me. I need to learn how to function as a<br /> paraplegic and opening doors with no arms is good training.</p>
<p>5. If you give me more than one job to do, don't tell me which<br /> is the priority. I am psychic.</p>
<p>6. Do your best to keep me late. I adore this office and really<br /> have nowhere to go or anything to do. I have no life beyond work.</p>
<p>7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. If that gets<br /> out, it could mean a promotion.</p>
<p>8. If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to<br /> be popular in conversations. I was born to be whipped.</p>
<p>9. If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them<br /> down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done. No use<br /> confusing me with useful information.</p>
<p>10. Never introduce me to the people you're with. I have no<br /> right to know anything. In the corporate food chain, I am<br /> plankton. When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions<br /> will identify them.</p>
<p>11. Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could<br /> really change your life and send you straight to manager's hell.</p>
<p>12. Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and<br /> it's nice to know someone is less fortunate. I especially like<br /> the story about having to pay so much taxes on the bonus check<br /> you received for being such a good manager.</p>
<p>13. Wait until my yearly review and THEN tell me what my goals<br /> SHOULD have been. Give me a mediocre performance rating with a<br /> cost of living increase. I'm not here for the money anyway.</p>

38345,"<p>Un tipo estaba parado a la orilla de la carretera pidiendo avent�n, en medio de una tremenda tormenta, en una oscura y tenebrosa noche.</p>
<p>Pas� un tiempo pero nadie se paraba. La tormenta era tan fuerte que apenas si se alcanzaba a ver a unos 3 metros de distancia. De pronto, ve que un extra�o carro se acerca lentamente y al final se detiene. Sin dudarlo, por lo precario de su situaci�n, se sube al auto y cierra la puerta. Voltea y se da cuenta, con asombro, de que nadie va manejando el carro.</p>
<p>El veh�culo arranca suave y pausadamente. El tipo mira hacia la carretera y ve, con horror desorbitado, que adelante est� una curva; asustado, comienza a rezar e implorar por su salvaci�n al advertir su tr�gico destino. El fulano no ha terminado de salir de su espanto cuando, justo antes de llegar a la curva, entra una mano tenebrosa por la ventana del chofer y mueve el volante, lentamente pero con firmeza.</p>
<p>Paralizado de terror y sin aliento, se aferra con toda sus fuerzas al asiento; inm�vil e impotente ve como sucede lo mismo en cada curva del tenebroso y horrible camino, mientras la tormenta aumenta su fuerza. El sujeto, sacando fuerzas de donde ya no quedaban, se baja del carro y se va corriendo hasta el pueblo m�s cercano.</p>
<p>Deambulando, todo empapado, se dirige a una cantina que se percibe a lo lejos; entra y pide dos tequilas. Temblando a�n, les empieza a contar a todos los parroquianos la pavorosa experiencia que acababa de sufrir.</p>
<p>Se hizo un pesado silencio ante el asombro de todos los presentes. El miedo asomaba por todos los rincones del lugar. Como a la media hora, llegan dos hombres todos mojados y le dice uno al otro, en tono molesto:</p>
<p>""�Mira Juan, all� est� el hijo de la chingada que se subi� al carro cuando lo ven�amos empujando!""</p>

<p>The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare. He was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his birthday. He never made much money and is famous only because of  his plays. He  wrote tragedies, comedies, and hysterectomies, all in Islamic pentameter. Romeo and Juliet are an example of a heroic couplet. Romeo's last wish was to be laid by Juliet.</p>
<p>Writing at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel Cervantes. He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton. Milton wrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained.</p>
<p>One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the English put tacks in their tea. Also, the colonists would send their parcels through the post without stamps. Finally the colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis. Delegates from the original 13 states formed the Contented Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin discovered electricity by rubbing two cats backwards and declared, ""A horse divided against itself cannot stand."" Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his own hands. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves by signing the Emasculation Proclamation. On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show. The believed assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposingly insane actor. This ruined Booth's career.</p>
<p>Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had a large number of  children. In between he practiced on an old spinster which he kept up in his attic. Bach died from 1750 to the present. Bach was the most famous composer in the world and so was Handel. Handel was half German half Italian and half English. He was very large.</p>
<p>Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in  the forest  even when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for this.</p>
<p>Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis.<br /> Charles Darwin was a naturalist who wrote the Organ of the Species.<br /> Madman Curie discovered radio.<br /> And Karl Marx became one of the Marx brothers.</p>
<p>The First World War, caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by an anahist, ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.</p>

38394,"<p>""Describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer."" One student replied:""You tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground. The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building.""This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed. The student appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case. The arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, but did not display any noticeable knowledge of physics. To resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics.For five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought. The arbiter reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use.On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:""Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground. The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared. But bad luck on the barometer.""""Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper."" ""But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sqroot (l / g).""""Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up.""""If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building.""""But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper'.""The student was Niels Bohr, the only person from Denmark to win the Nobel prize for Physics.</p>

<p>""Whiskey"", says the old man. </p>

<p>Entonces, el joven vuelve a su 4x4 y saca una Toshiba Tecra 8000 con 128 MB de RAM; se conecta a la Red de Redes; baja una base de datos de 300 MB y entra a una p�gina de la NASA v�a sat�lite. Despu�s, identifica la zona exacta en donde est� el reba�o; calcula el promedio hist�rico del tama�o de una oveja tipo Merino mediante una tabla din�mica de Excel y, con la ejecuci�n de algunas macros personalizadas en Visual Basic, logra completar el diagrama de flujo del Microsoft Project. Luego de tres horas le responde al vetusto:</p>
<p>""Usted tiene 1347 ovejas y 4 pueden estar embarazadas"".</p>
<p>El viejo asinti�, y le dijo que efectivamente as� era y que se llevara  su oveja. El joven tom� una oveja y la carg� en la camioneta. Cuando  se estaba por ir, el anciano lo detuvo y le pregunt�:</p>

38427,"<p>A tourist in Vienna is going through a graveyard and all of a sudden he hears some music. No one is around, so he starts searching for the source.</p>
<p>He finally locates the origin and finds it is coming from a grave with a headstone that reads: Ludwig van Beethoven, 1770-1827.</p>
<p>Then he realises that the music is the Ninth Symphony and it is being played backward! Puzzled, he leaves the graveyard and persuades a friend to return with him. By the time they arrive back at the grave, the music has changed.</p>
<p>This time it is the Seventh Symphony, but like the previous piece, it is being played backward. Curious, the men agree to consult a music scholar. When they return with the expert, the Fifth Symphony is playing, again backward.</p>
<p>The expert notices that the symphonies are being played in the reverse order in which they were composed, the 9th, then the 7th, then the 5th. By the next day the word has spread and a throng has gathered around the grave. They are all listening to the Second Symphony being played backward.</p>
<p>Just then the graveyard's caretaker ambles up to the group.<br /> Someone in the crowd asks him if he has an explanation for the music.</p>
<p>""Oh, it's nothing to worry about"" says the caretaker.<br /> ""He's just decomposing!""</p>

<p>The wife is touched to tears thinking that her husband is so caring and sensitive. ""Yes I do"" she replies.</p>
<p>The husband paused. The words were not coming easily. ""Do you remember when your father caught us in the back seat of my car making love?""</p>
<p>""Yes, I remember"" said the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him.</p>
<p>The husband continued... ""Do you remember when he shoved the shotgun in my face and said, 'Either you marry my daughter, or I will send you to jail for 20 years?'""</p>
<p>""I remember that too"" she replied softly.</p>
<p>He wiped another tear from his cheek and said...""I would have gotten out today."" </p>

<p>Alice asked a psychiatrist what to do about Christmas. The doctor told her to buy all the toys she could for Bob, the pessimist; and to get nothing for Bill. In fact, he told her to wrap up some manure for Bill. Christmas morning, Dave and Alice came downstairs and found the twins by the tree. </p>

Father Bob decides he'll run back for the soap.<br /> Rather than get dressed, he peeks out into the hallway, and since no one is around, he decides to make a run for it. He gets the two bars of soap and checks the hall before heading back to the showers. All was clear, so he makes a break for it. Just as he turns the corner to the showers, he spots three nuns walking towards him. With nowhere to go, and hoping that the nuns will think he is a statue, he stands perfectly still, holding the two bars of soap. </p>
<p>The nuns approach and the first nun says, ""Oh my, look at that! Isn't that the most lifelike statue you've ever seen?"" </p>
<p>She steps up for a closer look, reaches out and gives a couple of tugs on the priest's weenie. Startled, he drops the first bar of soap. </p>
<p>""Oh Heavens,"" she exclaims, ""I got a bar of soap!"" </p>
<p>The second nun is also amazed at how realistic the statue looks, so she steps in for a closer look. She takes a couple of yanks on the priest's weenie, and he drops the other bar of soap. </p>
<p>""My goodness, I got a bar of soap also!"" The nuns can't believe it. </p>
<p>The third nun, overcome by the miracle statue, walks up to it and gives a couple of tugs to the priest's weenie. </p>

38437,"<p>A woman walks into her sex therapist's office and tells her that her husband is not a very good lover, and they never have sex anymore, and asks what to do about it. The therapist tells her that she has an experimental drug that might do the trick. She tells the woman to give her husband one pill that night and come back in the morning and tell her what happened. </p>
<p>The next day, the woman comes in ecstatic telling the therapist that the pill worked and she and her husband had the best sex ever. She asks her therapist what would happen if she gave her husband two pills and the therapist says she doesn't know, but to go ahead and try it. </p>
<p>The next day, the same thing happens, the woman comes in telling the therapist that the sex was even better than the night before and what would happen if she gave him five pills. The therapist says she doesn't know, but to go ahead and try it. </p>
<p>The next day, the woman comes in limp but happy, and tells the therapist that the sex just keeps getting better and what would happen if she gave her husband the rest of the bottle. The therapist says she doesn't know; it's an experimental drug and she doesn't know what a full bottle could do to a person. Anyway, the woman leaves the therapist's office and put the rest of the bottle of pills in the husband's morning coffee. </p>

<p>The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the offer. St. Peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a HUGE room full of clocks.</p>
<p>The guy asks, ""What's up with these clocks?""</p>
<p>St. Peter explains, ""Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged.""</p>
<p>The guy thinks this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks are going faster than others. He asks why is that?</p>
<p>St. Peter explains, ""Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds his clock.""</p>
<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, ""What's the story with that clock?""</p>

<p>5.  In your opinion, the ideal pet is:<br /> A.  A cat.<br /> B.  A dog.<br /> C.  A dog that eats cats.</p>
<p>6.  You have been seeing a woman for several years. She's attractive<br /> and intelligent, and you always enjoy being with her. One<br /> leisurely Sunday afternoon the two of you are taking it easy<br /> -you're watching a football game; she's reading the papers-when<br /> she suddenly, out of the clear blue sky, tells you that she thinks she<br /> really loves you, but, she can no longer bear the uncertainty of not<br /> knowing where your relationship is going. She says she's not asking<br /> whether you want to get married; only whether you believe that you<br /> have some kind of future together. What do you say?<br /> A.  That you sincerely believe the two of you do have a future, but<br /> you don't want to rush it.<br /> B.

A real guy<br /> checks the garbage regularly in case somebody - and we are not<br /> naming names, but this would be his wife - is quietly trying to discard his<br /> underwear, which she is frankly jealous of, because the guy seems<br /> to have a more intimate relationship with it than with her.</p>

<p>As he was slipping a pair of high heels on her feet, he looked up her<br /> skirt and noticed that she wasn't wearing underwear. This made him<br /> extremely horny, and he just couldn't help himself. He said to her, ""I<br /> want to fill your pussy up with ice cream and eat it out."" </p>

38460,"<p>Elmer fud saw an ad in the newspaper for a horse, so he looked up the address and went to the home of the dude who was selling the horse.  When he got there, Elmer asked to see the horse so he could make sure he wanted it.  So , the old man who was selling it took him to the barn and showed him the horse.  ""Can I see hoer hoofs?"" asked Elmer, and the old man said sure as he lifted the right hoof.  ""Gwood!""  he said and then asked "" Can i see her gawwop?""   By this time, the old man was getting annoyed as he lifted himself on to the back of the horse and took her for a little gallop.  When he got back, the old man sighed as Elmer pleaded  ""May I see her twot?""  The old man was so furious that he picked up Elmer Fud and shuvved his face right in her but and smeared it in his face.</p>

<p>24&gt; It took that long just to remember all the lists.  You think we write this crap down?</p>
<p>23&gt; Chris was busy with his day job: translating the Harry Potter book series into Pig Latin.</p>
<p>22&gt; Prima donnas Muse and Hollister held out for a piece of the movie rights.</p>
<p>21&gt; Ecstreemly difikult to find proffreders among TopFive contributers.</p>
<p>20&gt; Chris had precious little free time because of all those extra shifts down at the 7-Eleven.</p>
<p>19&gt; Printers inexplicably kept hacking every list down to a paltry five items.</p>
<p>18&gt; Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, comes between Chris and his daily Macarenaerobics classes.</p>
<p>17&gt; Like a typical man, Chris steadfastly refused to stop and ask for directions.</p>
<p>16&gt; Hey, man, *you* try getting a million monkeys to lay off the Shakespeare-writing and poo-flinging long enough to edit a book.</p>
<p>15&gt; Friggin' hurricane list kept fouling the presses.</p>
<p>14&gt; Chris was too busy burning incense and paying tribute at the altar of Rip Taylor.</p>
<p>13&gt; Greedy bastard Rosenberg kept holding out for additional 1/238th of cent royalty per book.</p>
<p>12&gt; Courtesy delay so as not to knock Stephen King's latest from the top spot on the N.Y. Times Bestseller list.</p>
<p>11&gt; Kept holding out for one more Clinton scandal.</p>
<p>10&gt; With a little careful planning, a publisher's advance can finance a surprisingly long hookers-and-coke bender.</p>
<p> 9&gt; Technical difficulties: The TopFive deflector dish emitted a tachyon beam which tore a temporal rift in the fabric of space/time, repeatedly jettisoning the books into the future.</p>
<p> 8&gt; Took that long for Oprah to deposit the payola check.</p>
<p> 7&gt; Chris' daily Gallo binges brought the ghost of Orson Welles and his dire ""Serve no lists before their time!"" warnings.</p>
<p> 6&gt; Greedy Nobel and Pulitzer judges insisted on a full year's worth of cash, drugs and hookers.</p>
<p> 5&gt; Chris has been detained at Guantanamo Bay ever since the publication of our ""Top 15 Reasons Allah Can Kick Your Jesus' Ass Any Day of the Week"" list.</p>
<p> 4&gt; Damn tree-hugging liberal contributors insisted on a certified dolphin-friendly printer.</p>
<p> 3&gt; As a featured dancer, Chris never had the time to edit unti the Broadway show of ""Cats"" closed.</p>
<p> 2&gt; Kept waiting in hopes of including a ""Top 5 Ways to Punish Osama and Saddam Now That We've Finally Caught Them"" list.</p>

38475,"<p>Continuing the current trend of large-scale mergers and acquisitions, it was announced today at a press conference that Christmas and Hanukkah will merge. An industry source said that the deal had been in the works for about 1300 years.</p>
<p>While details were not available at press time, it is believed that the overhead cost of having twelve days of Christmas and eight days of Hanukkah was becoming prohibitive for both sides. By combining forces, we're told, the world will be able to enjoy consistently high-quality service during the Fifteen Days of Chrismukah, as the new holiday is being called.</p>
<p>Massive layoffs are expected, with lords a-leaping and maids a-milking being the hardest hit. As part of the conditions of the agreement, the letters on the dreydl, currently in Hebrew, will be replaced by Latin, thus becoming  unintelligible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Also, instead of translating to ""A great miracle happened there,"" the message on the dreydl will be the more generic ""Miraculous stuff happens."" In exchange, it is believed that Jews will be allowed to use Santa Claus and his vast merchandising resources for buying and delivering their gifts.</p>
<p>One of the sticking points holding up the agreement for at least three hundred years was the question of whether Jewish children could leave milk and cookies for Santa even after having eaten meat for dinner. A breakthrough came last year, when Oreos were finally declared to be Kosher. All sides appeared happy about this.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Christmas, Inc., declined to say whether a takeover of Kwanzaa might not be in the works as well. He merely pointed out that,  were it not for the independent existence of Kwanzaa, the merger between Christmas and Chanukah might indeed be seen as an unfair cornering of the holiday market. Fortunately for all concerned, he said, Kwanzaa will help to maintain the competitive balance. He then closed the press conference by leading all present in a rousing rendition of ""Oy Vey, All Ye Faithful.""</p>

Do it one more time!""''Ok,'' said the first guy, ''But if I do it again, when I come back you have to do it.""

<p>By this time the guy is desperate so he goes to see a doctor of holistic medicine. The doctor examines him and comes to essentially the same conclusion as the other doctors: an advanced case of V.

<p>The Lord said, ""Your request is very materialistic. Think of the logistics of that kind of undertaking. The supports required to reach the bottom of the Pacific! The concrete and steel it would take! I can do it, but it is hard for me to justify your desire for worldly things. Take a little more time and think of another wish, a wish you think would honor and glorify me."" </p>

<p>The manager said, ""I can't hire you. The sign says you have to be able to type."" The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to type out a perfect letter. He took out the page and trotted over to the manager and  gave it to him, then jumped back on the chair.</p>
<p>The manager was stunned, but then told the dog, ""The sign says you have to be good with a computer."" </p>
<p>The dog jumped down again and went to the computer, proceeded to enter and execute a perfect program, that worked flawlessly the first time.</p>
<p>By this time, the manager was totally dumb-founded! He looked at the dog and said, ""I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and have some interesting abilities. However, I still can't give you the job.""</p>
<p>The dog jumped down and went to a copy of the sign and put his paw on the sentences that told about being an Equal Opportunity Employer. The manager said, ""Yes, but the sign also says that you have to be bilingual.""</p>
<p>The dog looked at the manager calmly and said, ""Meow!"" </p>

<p>4. Major technological breakthrough! (It works OK; but looks very hi-tech!) </p>
<p>5. Customer satisfaction is believed assured. (We are so far behind schedule, that the customer will take anything.) </p>
<p>6. Preliminary operational tests were inconclusive. (The darn thing blew up when we threw the switch.)</p>
<p>7. Test results were extremely gratifying! (Unbelievable, it actually worked!) </p>
<p>8. The entire concept will have to be abandoned. (The only guy who understood the thing quit.) </p>
<p>9. It is in process. (It is so wrapped in red tape that the situation is completely hopeless.) </p>

38522,"<p>Whether the cause is a previous night of drinking or a big lunch, the outcome is the same: Farts. Seventy percent of the time, we can dispense freely. The other 30% of the time, such as at work, we have some tough decisions to make. This document is intended to help you in those decisions. Holders - The obvious choice is just plain holding it in. A popular choice among the females and an almost impossible choice for males. I am not in favor of holding, as I believe the medical community has not done enough research about the long-term damage of holding. Really, where does it go if you hold it in? So be forewarned, using this tactic is to be done at your own risk. Desk Jockey - When deciding to release right at your desk, one has many factors to consider: - Do you have your own office? Feel free to fart at will risk free. After commencing, I highly recommend locking the door and feigning you are not in the office to avoid any unwanted visitors. I also highly recommend against spraying air freshener, as the smell of the freshener is a dead giveaway. Candles are a good alternative solution for the females. - Are you seated at a cubicle or open desk? If so, one has to consider the proximity of the other workers and the density of workers in the area. If it is just you and one other person in the area, there is nowhere to place the blame. If others are fairly distant to you, the smell will dissipate by the time it reaches the others on all but the most egregious of days. There is always the chance of dispensing at higher decibels than anticipated due to the highly unstable nature of farts. In these most unfortunate situations, you will have to use cover up sounds such as scraping your heal on the floor. I recommend practicing making sounds covering a wide range of tones and pitches in anticipation of such an event. Dropping objects such as staplers, binders and tape may not produce a similar sound, but if done in rapid succession could distract others from the initial event. Meetings: - Sometimes the urge strikes at the most inopportune time. Meetings and gas really do not mix. Releasing at a meeting is by far the trickiest of all the situations one could find oneself in. Although I am against holding in general, a meeting may be the time for it. It really depends if you have established baseline farts before the meeting. This will give you a sense of the decibel and scent level of what is to be expected. Warning: Do not ever use a meeting as the place to establish a baseline. Of course none of the above applies if you are meeting with vendors. You have free reign to do whatever you like. Aisle Walker: - Releasing while walking around the office is a popular option. By the time the scent disseminates, you should be nowhere near the scene of the incident. The added benefit is that if the release is done at higher decibels than anticipated, you can break out into an all out sprint thereby fleeing the scene before others even look up to notice. Broom Closet: - One option is to find a broom closet and release inside the closet. The only drawback is explaining why you were in the broom closet if you are caught entering or leaving the closet. I found stashing stationery supplies in the closet provides a nice excuse. People will love you for informing them about the backup stationery supply cabinet. Of course, you then have to find another closet, as your original place will become too risky.And remember, if you're workplace has many open flames, you are on your own.</p>

38532,"<p>Bob Hill and his new wife Betty were vacationing in Europe, as it happens, near Transylvania. They were driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It was late, and raining very hard. Bob could barely see 20 feet in front of the car. Suddenly the car skids out of control! Bob attempts to control the car, but to no avail! The car swerves and smashes into a tree. Moments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees his wife unconscious, with her head bleeding! Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to carry her to the nearest phone. Bob carefully picks his wife up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light. He heads towards the light, which is coming from an old, large house. He approaches the door and knocks. A minute passes. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob immediately blurts, ""Hello, my name is Bob Hill, and this is my wife Betty. We've been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone??"" ""I'm sorry,"" replied the hunchback, ""but we don't have a phone. My master is a Doctor; come in and I will get him!"" Bob brings his wife in. An elegant man comes down the stairs. ""I'm afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had a basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory."" With that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. After a brief examination, Igor's master looks worried. ""Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion."" Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more. The Hills' deaths upset Igor's master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. For it is here that he has always found solace. He begins to play, and a stirring, almost haunting, melody fills the house. Meanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty's hand twitch. Stunned, he watches as Bob's arm begins to rise! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! Unable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: ""Master, Master! ... The Hills are alive with the sound of music!</p>

38536,"<p>A LETTER FROM A WEST VIRGINIA MOTHER TO HER DAUGHTER</p>
<p>Dear Louanne Ellie Mae,</p>
<p>I'm writing this letter slow because I know you can't read fast. We<br /> don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles from your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last West Virginia family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so they wouldn't have to change their address.</p>
<p>This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though; last week I put a loan in and pulled the chain and haven't seen them since. The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days.</p>
<p>About that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Stanley said it would be to heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.</p>
<p>John locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.</p>
<p>Your sister had a baby this morning; but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you are an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother.</p>
<p>Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days.</p>
<p>Three of your friends went off a bridge in a pick-up truck. Ralph was driving. He rolled down the window and swam safely. Your other two friends were in the back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down.</p>
<p>There isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much has happened.</p>
<p>Love, Mom</p>
<p>P. S.  I was going to send you some money but the envelope was already sealed.</p>

<p>33) I thought I could squeeze between two trucks when my car became squashed.</p>
<p>34) I thought my car was in reverse but I found otherwise when it lurched forward, doing injury to a parking meter. When the police arrived the meter had expired.</p>

38548,"<p>A man's daughter had asked the local minister to come and pray with her father. When the minister arrived, he found the man lying in bed with his head proppped up on two pillows. An empty chair sat beside his bed. The minister assumed that the old fellow had been informed of his visit. </p>
<p>''I guess you were expecting me,'' he said. ''No, who are you?'' said the father. the minister told him his name and then remarked, ''I see the empty chair; I figured you knew i was going to show up.'' ''Oh yea, the chair,'' said the bed ridden man. ''Would you mind closing the door?'' Puzzled, the minister shut the door. </p>
<p>''I have never told anyone this not even my daughter,'' said the man, ''but all of my life i have never known how to pray. At church I used to hear the pastor talk about prayer, but it went right over my head.'' ''I abandoned any attempt at prayer,'' the old man continuted, ''until one day about four years ago my best friend said to me 'Johnny, prayer is just a simple matter of having a conversation with Jesus. Here is what I suggest.'' </p>
<p>''Sit down in a chair; place an empty chair in front of you, and in faith see Jesus on the chair. It's not spooky, because he promised, ''I'll be with you always.'' Then just speak to him in the same way you're doing with me. right now.'' ''So, I tried it and I've liked it so much that I do it a couple of hours every day. I'm careful though, if my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair, she'd either have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm.'' </p>
<p>The minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the old man to continue on the journey. Then he prayed with him, anointed him with oil, and returned to the church. Two nights later the daughter called to tell the minister that her Daddy had died that afternoon. ''Did he die in peace?'' he asked. </p>
<p>''Yes, and when i left the house about two o'clock, he called me over to his bedside and told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek. When i got back from the store an hour later, I found him dead. But there was something strange about his death.'' ''Apparently just before daddy died he leaned over and rested his head on the chair beside the bed. What do you make of that?'' </p>
<p>The minister wiped a tear from his eye and said, ''I wish we could all go like that.''</p>

38559,"<p>Here's a way to spice up your office. Pick two or three colleagues and agree<br /> to play the Office Game which awards points as follows: </p>
<p>ONE POINT</p>
<p>Run one lap around the office at top speed. Walk sideways to the photocopier.</p>
<p>Find the vacuum and start vacuuming around your desk.</p>
<p>When they're not looking, pour most of someone's fresh cup of coffee into your<br /> mug leaving them with an inch of brew.</p>
<p>Ignore the first five people who say 'good morning' to you.</p>
<p>Phone someone in the office you barely know, leave your name and say ""Just<br /> called to say I can't talk right now. Bye.""</p>
<p>To signal the end of a conversation, clamp your hands over your ears and<br /> grimace.</p>
<p>While riding an elevator, gasp dramatically every time the doors<br /> open. </p>
<p>THREE-POINTS</p>
<p>Babble incoherently at a fellow employee then ask ""Did you get all that, I<br /> don't want to have to repeat it."" - Double points if you do this to a manager.</p>
<p>Kneel in front of the water cooler and drink directly from the nozzle.</p>
<p>Shout random numbers while someone is counting.</p>
<p>FIVE POINTS</p>
<p>At the end of a meeting, suggest that, for once, it would be nice to conclude<br /> with the singing of the national anthem (extra points if you actually launch<br /> into it yourself).</p>
<p>Walk into a very busy person's office and while they watch you with growing<br /> irritation, turn the light switch on/off 10 times.</p>
<p>For an hour, refer to everyone you speak to as 'Bob'.</p>
<p>Announce to everyone in a meeting that you ""really have to go do number two"".</p>
<p>After every sentence, say 'mon' in a really bad Jamaican accent. As in, ""the<br /> report's on your desk, mon"". Keep this up for one hour.</p>
<p>While an office mate is out, move their chair into the elevator.</p>
<p>In a meeting or crowded situation, slap your forehead repeatedly and mutter,<br /> ""Shut up, all of you just shut up!""</p>
<p>In a colleague's diary, write in 10 am: ""See how I look in tights"".</p>
<p>Carry your laptop over to your colleague and ask ""You wanna trade?""</p>
<p>Repeat the following conversation 10 times to the same person: ""Do you hear<br /> that?"" ""What?"" ""Never mind, it's gone now""</p>
<p>Come to work in army fatigues and when asked why, say, ""I can't talk about<br /> it""</p>
<p>Speak with an accent (French, German, Porky Pig, etc.) during a very<br /> important conference call.</p>
<p>Tuck one pant leg into your sock and when queried, answer, ""not now"" and walk<br /> away.</p>

"
38577,"<p>Dear Mom and Dad:<br /> It has been four months since I left for college. I have been remiss in writing and am very sorry for my thoughtlessness. I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. Don't read any further unless you are sitting down ... </p>
<p>OK? </p>
<p>Good. I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got from jumping out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire, shortly after my arrival, are pretty well healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get three headaches a day. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump were witnessed by an attendant at a nearby gas station, and he was able to call the Fire Department and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dorm, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but it is kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but I'm sure it will be before I start to show. </p>
<p>Yes, Mom and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward to being grandparents, and I know you will give the baby the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests, and I carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up, thanks tomy daily penicillin injections. I know you will welcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind, and although not well educated, he is ambitious Also, he is of a different race and religion than ours, but I know, after all your years of teaching me tolerance, that you won't mind the fact that heis somewhat darker than we are. I am sure you will love him as I do. </p>

38584,"<p>There was this preacher who was an avid golfer. Every chance he could get, he could be found on the golf course swinging away. It was an obsession. One Sunday was a picture perfect day for golfing. The sun was out, no clouds in the sky, and the temperature was just right. The preacher was in a quandary as to what to do, and shortly, the urge to play golf overcame him. He called an assistant to tell him that he was sick and could not do church, packed the car up, and drove three hours to a golf course where no one would recognize him. Happily, he began to play the course.</p>
<p>An angel up above was watching the preacher and was quite perturbed. He went to God and said, ""Look at the preacher. He should be punished for what he is doing."" God nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>The preacher teed up on the first hole. He swung at the ball, and it sailed effortlessly through the air and landed right in the cup three hundred and fifty yards away (as they say in basketball, nothing but net). A picture perfect hole-in-one. He was amazed and excited.</p>
<p>The angel was a little shocked. He turned to God and said, ""Begging Your pardon, but I thought you were going to punish him.""</p>
<p>God smiled. ""Think about it -- who can he tell?""</p>

38608,"<p>In a heroic dogfight fought over International waters off the mainland-China coast, a 60's-era American-built Lockheed Electra propeller airliner, with 24 US Navy passenger/observers aboard, chewed up one of China's finest sate-of-the-art supersonic fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>The Americans, utilizing the infrequently recorded combat tactic of straight and level flight, often accomplished by relying solely on autopilot, engaged the outmanned single-seat combat jet and knocked it out of the air using only one of its four formidable rotating air-mass propellers.</p>
<p>After the action, the crew and passenger/observers diverted to nearby China's Hainan Island Resort for some much-deserved R&amp;R as guests of the Chinese government.</p>

38609,"<p>This is actually a true story that happened to one of our readers, but it's as<br /> funny as any joke we've heard: One day on the way home from work, I stopped at<br /> the local Pharmacy and while I was checking out, I picked up some candy to take<br /> home for me and my 7-year old son. It was a bag of Gold Coins (Gold Foil-covered<br /> chocolate candy coins). There were many sizes, from dime to dollar. I took the<br /> bag home, and me and my son opened the bag and ate all of the coins, my son<br /> taking the bigger dollar-sized ones and me taking the smaller ones. The next<br /> day, my wife, my son and I stopped at the Pharmacy again to pick up a few<br /> things. While my wife and I were shopping, we noticed that my son had picked up<br /> a Gold Coin Condom. Before we could catch him, he took it up to the counter and<br /> asked the Pharmacist, ''What's this?'' The woman, looking very serious, said,<br /> ''That's a condom, son.'' To which my son replied, ''My daddy BOUGHT me some of<br /> these yesterday!'' With a disgusted look on her face, the Pharmacist replied,<br /> ''Those are NOT for children, young man.'' And finally, my son replied, ''Then<br /> I'll buy this one for my Daddy. He likes the LITTLE ones!''</p>

And sure enough, the farmer's son comes over, puts another pig's tail in his mouth, lets it hang, and then says, ""This one weighs 83 pounds.""

38658,"<p>Dear ________,<br /> I regret to inform you that you have been eliminated from further contention as Mr. Right. As you are probably aware, the competition was exceedingly tough and dozens of well-qualified candidates such as yourself also failed to make the final cut. I will, however, keep your name on file should an opening become available. So that you may find better success in your future romantic endeavors, please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were disqualified from the competition. Check those that apply... </p>
<p>___Your last name is objectionable. I can't imagine taking it, hyphenating it, or subjecting my children to it. </p>
<p>___Your first name is objectionable. It's just not something I can picture myself yelling out in a fit of passion. </p>
<p>___The fact that our dining experiences to date has left MY wallet a little lighter, and YOUR pants a little tighter! </p>
<p>___Your inadvertent admission that you ""buy condoms by the truckload"" indicates that you m! ay be interested in me for something other than my personality. </p>
<p>___You failed the 20 Question Rule, i.e., I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself. </p>
<p>___Your constant e-mailing shows me you have TOO much time on your hands! </p>
<p>___Your legs are skinnier than mine. </p>
<p>___You're too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up repeatedly at recess. </p>
<p>___You're too tall. I'm developing a chronic neck condition from trying to kiss you. </p>
<p>___I find your inability to fix my car extraordinarily unappealing. </p>
<p>___The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable. </p>
<p>___The phrase ""My Mother"" has popped up far too often in conversation. </p>
<p>___You still live with your parents. </p>
<p>___Although I do enjoy the X-Files, I find your wardrobe of Star Trek uniforms a little disconcerting. </p>
<p>___Your frequent references to your ex -girlfriend lead me to suspect that you are some sort of psychotic stalker. </p>
<p>___Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I am seeking in a long-term partner. </p>
<p>___Your height is out of proportion to your weight. If you should however, happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches, please resubmit your application. </p>
<p>___Somehow I doubt those condoms I found in your overnight bag were really necessary for a successful business trip. </p>
<p>___I am out of your league, set your sights lower next time. </p>

38663,"<p>Some classic mistakes from Dan Quayle:</p>
<p>It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the<br /> impurities in our air and water that are doing it.</p>
<p>The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. I<br /> mean in this century's history. But we all lived in this<br /> century. I didn't live in this century.</p>
<p>If we do not succeed, then we run the risk of failure.</p>
<p>Let me just tell you how thrilling it really is, and how, what a<br /> challenge it is, because in 1988 the question is whether we're<br /> going forward to tomorrow or whether we're going to go past to<br /> the--to the back!</p>
<p>What a waste it is to lose one's mind. Or not to have a mind is<br /> being very wasteful. How true that is.</p>

38676,"<p>Seems God was just about done creating the universe, but he had two things left in his bag of creations, so he decided to split them between Adam and Eve. He told the couple that one of the things he had to give away was the ability to stand up while urinating. �It�s a very handy thing� God told the couple, �and I was wondering if either one of you wanted that abilty.�Adam jumped up and blurted �Oh, give that to me! I�d love to be able to do that. It seems the sort of thing a man would do. Please give me that ability. It�d be so great. When I�m working in the garden or naming the animals, I could just stand there and let fly. It�d be sooo cool. I could write my name in the sand. Please, God, let it be me you give the gift to, let me stand to pee, oh please�.Eve just smiled and said that if Adam really wanted that so bad that he should have it. It seemed to be the sort of thing that would make Adam really happy, and she didn�t mind if Adam were the one to get this ability. Adam was happy, and proceeded to wash down the bark of the nearest tree, laughing with glee all the while.�Fine�, God said, looking back into his bag of leftovers. �What�s left here?� �Oh, yes. Multiple orgasms.�</p>

38680,"<p>Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near an abandoned gas station.They approached one of the gas pumps, and one of the aliens addressed it: 'Greetings, Earthling.  We come in peace. Take us to your leader.'    The gas pump, of course, didn't respond. The alien repeated the greeting.  There was no response. The alien, annoyed by what he perceived to be the gas pump's haughty attitude, drew his ray gun, and said impatiently:  'Greetings, Earthling.  We come in peace. How dare you ignore us in this way! Take us to you leader, or I will fire!' The other alien shouted to his comrade 'No, you mustn't anger him!' but before he finished his warning, the first alien fired. There was a huge explosion that blew both of them 200 meters into the desert, where they landed in a heap. When they finally regained consciousness, the one who fired turned to the other and said: 'What a ferocious creature. It nearly killed us! But, how did you know it was so dangerous?' The other alien answered: 'If there's one thing I've learned during travels thorough the galaxy, it's that if a guy has a penis he can wrap around himself twice and then stick into his own ear, you don't mess with him!'</p>

<p>Dear Friend:</p>
<p>We have the distinguished honor of being on the committee for raising 5<br /> million dollars for placing a statue of Bill Clinton in the hall of fame<br /> in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>This committee was in a quandary as to where to place the statue. It was<br /> not wise to place it beside George Washington who never told a lie, nor<br /> beside Jesse Jackson who never told the truth, since Bill Clinton could<br /> never tell the difference.</p>
<p>We finally decided to place it next to Christopher Columbus, the greatest<br /> democrat of all. He left not knowing where he was going, did not know<br /> where he was, he returned not knowing where he had been, and he did it all<br /> on borrowed money.</p>
<p>5,000 years ago Moses said, ""Pack up your camel, pick up your shovel, move<br /> your ass, and I will lead you to the promised land."" </p>
<p>5,000 years later FDR said, ""Lay down your shovel, sit on your ass, light<br /> up a camel for this is the promised land.""</p>
<p>This year Bill Clinton will steal your shovel, kick your ass, raise the<br /> price of camels, and mortgage the promised land. If you are one of the<br /> fortunate people who has anything left after paying taxes, we expect a<br /> generous contribution to this worthwhile project.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>

She finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in front of him. He appears to be in deep thought, just staring at the wall. She watches as he wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of his coffee. ""What's the matter, dear?"", she whispers as she steps into the room, ""Why are you down here at this time of night?"". The husband looks up from his coffee, ""Do you remember 20 years ago when we were dating, and you were only 16?"" he asks solemnly. ""Yes I do"" she replies. The husband pauses. The words are not coming easily. ""Do you remember when your father caught us in the back seat of my car having sex?"" ""Yes, I remember"" says the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him. The husband continues. ""Do you remember when he shoved the shotgun in my face and said, either you marry my daughter, or I'll send you to jail for 20 years?"" ""I remember that too"" she replies softly. He wipes another tear from his cheek and says, ""I would have gotten out today"".</p>

38733,"<p>After applying some simple algebra to some common phrases and cliches, a new understanding can be reached of the secret of wealth and success. </p>
<p>Here it goes. </p>
<p>(K)nowledge is (P)ower<br /> (T)ime is (M)oney, and as every engineer knows,<br /> (P)ower is (W)ork over (T)ime.</p>
<p>So, substituting algebraic equations for these time-worn bits of wisdom, we get:</p>
<p>K = P (1)<br /> T = M (2)<br /> P = W/T (3)</p>
<p>Now, do a few simple substitutions: </p>
<p>Put W/T in for P in equation (1), which yields: </p>
<p>K = W/T (4) </p>
<p>Put M in for T into equation (4), which yields: </p>
<p>K = W/M (5). </p>
<p>Now we've got something. Expanding back into English, we get: </p>
<p>Knowledge equals Work over Money. </p>
<p>What this MEANS is that: </p>
<p>1. The More You Know, the More Work You Do,<br /> and<br /> 2. The More You Know, the Less Money You Make.</p>
<p>Solving for Money, we get:</p>
<p>M = W/K (6)<br /> Money equals Work Over Knowledge.</p>
<p>From equation (6) we see that Money approaches infinity as Knowledge approaches 0, regardless of the Work done. </p>
<p>What THIS MEANS is: </p>
<p>The More you Make, the Less you Know. </p>
<p>Solving for Work, we get </p>
<p>W = M x K (7)<br /> Work equals Money times Knowledge </p>
<p>From equation (7) we see that Work approaches 0 as Knowledge approaches 0. </p>
<p>What THIS MEANS is: </p>
<p>The stupid rich do little or no work. </p>
<p>Working out the socioeconomic implications of this breakthrough is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

38748,"<p>It was dusk time when a man had a flat tire right in front of a mental health hospital. After unscrewing the four nuts of the flat tire, he noticed that a hospital patient is watching him from over a nearby embankment. He managed to step on the hubcap in which he had carefully placed the nuts. To his dismay, the nuts went flying into the grass on the side of the road. So he got on his hands and knees and started searching in vain for the nuts in the semi-darkness.</p>
<p>A few minutes later he heard the mental patient chuckle, so he shouted at him irritably, ""What are you laughing at?""</p>
<p>The other guy explained: ""Well, you have three other tires, each of which has four nuts... If you were to take one nut from each, you'll end up with four tires being held in place with three nuts per tire. This should be safe enough for you to drive to the next town over, where you can buy a new set of nuts.""</p>
<p>Embarrassed, the poor car driver couldn't help asking, ""How come you're so clever and you're in a mental hospital?"" </p>
<p>The patient replied, ""I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid!""</p>

38750,"<p>Hab�a una vez un granjero que ten�a un gallinero con 180 gallinas, y estaba buscando un buen gallo para producir huevos. Un buen d�a el granjero va al pueblo y se mete en la galler�a y le dice al gallero:</p>
<p>""Buenas  tardes, quisiera un buen gallo que me pise a todas mis gallinas.""</p>
<p>""�Cuantas gallinas tiene?""</p>
<p>""180.""</p>
<p>Entonces el gallero saca una jaula con un gallo enorme, fibroso, la cresta parada, ojos azules y un tatuaje en el pecho de los Rolling Stones y le dice al granjero:</p>
<p>""Toma este, el Alberto, no falla.""</p>
<p>El granjero se lo lleva y a la ma�ana  siguiente lo saca de la jaula y lo mete en el gallinero. El gallo sale corriendo, caza a la primera gallina, le echa dos polvos, sale agarra a la segunda, le echa el primero, y cuando le est� echando el segundo se queda frito.</p>
<p>El granjero lo mira y dice:</p>
<p>""Qu� me vendi� este hijo de puta, me durmi�, este gallo puto se cogi� dos gallinas y palm�.<br /> Entonces caza al gallo del cogote y se lo lleva al gallero  y le explica lo que pas�. El gallero se disculpa y le saca otro gallo negro, con la cresta  amarilla, ojos grises, y zapatillas Nike y le dice al granjero:</p>
<p>""Este es Gabriel, mir�lo y despu�s me cont�s.""</p>
<p>El granjero se va y repite la maniobra, lo suelta en el gallinero, el gallo  sale desesperado se voltea a la primera gallina de parado, agarra a la segunda y la empoma, a la tercera le hace el 69 y cuando se est� volteando a la cuarta revienta, cae muerto en el medio del gallinero.</p>
<p>El granjero envuelto en llamas caza al gallo de la pata, se lo  lleva al gallero y le dice:</p>
<p>""Escuch�me una cosa pedazo de hijo de puta, es el segundo gallo que me vend�s y revienta, m�s vale que me des un gallo como la gente o te  prendo  fuego el local.""</p>
<p>Entonces el gallero le saca un gallo de mierda, todo flaco, pelado sin plumas, ojeroso, jorobado y con zapatillas topper de lona y le dice al granjero:</p>
<p>""Mir�, es lo �nico que me queda, se llama Tito y lleg� de casualidad en un  barco que vino de Africa.""</p>
<p>Y el granjero recaliente se lo lleva igual pensando:</p>
<p>""Que mierda voy a hacer con este gallo pedorro...""</p>
<p>Llega, lo suelta en el gallinero, el gallo sale reloco y se voltea  a las 180  gallinas, pega una segunda vuelta, se las voltea a todas otra vez, sale corriendo, se voltea al ovejero alem�n y el granjero lo caza del cuello le pega dos sopapos y lo mete en la jaula.</p>
<p>""�Que fen�meno este gallo!"", piensa el granjero; y las gallinas todas copadas con Tito. ""Que Tito esto... que Tito aquello... y a vos que te hizo... y a mi me hizo tal cosa..."" Jolgorio total.</p>
<p>Al d�a siguiente lo suelta de nuevo y sale el Tito enajenado, le pega dos vueltas al gallinero abroch�ndose a todo lo que tenga plumas, sale corriendo se coge al perro, al chancho, dos vacas, el granjero lo corre y lo caza del cogote, le pega dos soplamocos para calmarlo y lo mete en la jaula.</p>
<p>""Gallo hijo de puta se me coge a toda la granja �lo voy a matar!"", dice el granjero.</p>
<p>Al d�a siguiente va a buscar al gallo y encuentra toda la jaula desarmada y sale corriendo para el gallinero y encuentra a todas las gallinas concha pa arriba, afuera ve al chancho culo pal sol, las dos vacas echadas en el piso con la cachufla colorada hablando del Tito, el perro con el culo a la miseria y dice:</p>
<p>""�Nooo, se me escap� el gallo y se va a coger al ganado del vecino y me van a matar!""</p>
<p>Entonces agarra el caballo y sale en busca de Tito. Cabalga y cabalga sin descanso siguiendo la pista dejada por el Tito (cabras empernadas, chivos matraqueados, una tortuga que del embate la sac� del caparaz�n, tres ardillas rengas, un jilguero poni�ndose crema antinflamatoria, un bambi curado de hemorroides, hasta que de repente a varios kil�metros, lo ve a Tito tirado en el piso (una escena desgarradora), mientras dos buitres le  volaban en c�rculos relami�ndose. Entonces el granjero ve a los buitres y se da cuenta de la situaci�n.</p>
<p>""�Nooooo, Titooooo! �Se me murioooo el Titooooo! �Una vez que encuentro un gallo de verdaaaaddd!""</p>
<p>Y en el medio del lamento, el Tito cuidadosamente abre un ojo, mira al granjero y, se�alando a los buitres, le  dice:</p>
<p>""�Shhhhhhhhh! quedate quieto boludo que ya los tengo...""</p>

38782,"<p>DAY 752 - My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from shredding on the occasional piece of furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant and cough it up on the carpeting.</p>

In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite chair... must try this on their bed (again).</p>
<p>DAY 762 - Slept all day so that I could annoy my captors with sleep depriving, incessant pleas for food at ungodly hours of the night.</p>
<p>DAY 765 - Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body, in<br /> attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was ...Hmmm. Not working according to plan...</p>
<p>DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. This time however it included a burning foamy chemical called ""shampoo."" What sick minds could invent such a liquid. My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth and the tiny bit of flesh under my claws.</p>
<p>DAY 771 - There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event. I overheard that my confinement was due to MY power of ""allergies."" Must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage.</p>

The bird, on the other hand, has got to be an informant. He has mastered their frightful tongue (something akin to mole speak) and speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every move.

38801,"<p>A fire started on some grassland near a farm in Indiana. The fire department<br /> from the nearby town was called to put the fire out. The fire proved to be more<br /> than the small town fire department could handle, so someone suggested that a<br /> rural volunteer fire department be called. Though there was doubt that they<br /> would be of any assistance, the call was made.<br /> The volunteer fire department arrived in a dilapidated old fire truck. They<br /> drove straight towards the fire and stopped in the middle of the flames. The<br /> volunteer firemen jumped off the truck and frantically started spraying water in<br /> all directions. Soon they had snuffed out the center of the fire, breaking the<br /> blaze into two easily controllable parts.<br /> The farmer was so impressed with the volunteer fire department's work and so<br /> grateful that his farm had been spared, that he presented the volunteer fire<br /> department with a check for $1000. A local news reporter asked the volunteer<br /> fire captain what the department planned to do with the funds.<br /> ""That should be obvious,"" he responded, ""the first thing we're gonna do is get<br /> the brakes fixed on that stupid fire truck.""</p>

38841,"<p>Historical Interpetation on how the computer and the Internet<br /> began.</p>
<p>An old, bearded shepherd with a crooked staff walked up to a<br /> stone pulpit and said, ""And lo, it came to pass that the trader<br /> by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a young wife by<br /> the name of Dot.""</p>
<p>And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of<br /> leg. Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. </p>
<p>And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why doth thou travel<br /> far, from town to town with thy goods when thou can trade<br /> without ever leaving thy tent?"" </p>
<p>And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle<br /> bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How,Dear?""</p>
<p>And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums<br /> in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and<br /> they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the<br /> sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony<br /> Stable (UPS).""</p>
<p>Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way<br /> with the drums. </p>
<p>And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. A</p>
<p>Abraham sold all the goods he had, at the top price, without<br /> ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. </p>
<p>A man named Maccabia did secret himself inside Abraham's drum,<br /> and was accused of insider trading. </p>
<p>And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the<br /> greedy horse fly take to camel dung. </p>
<p>They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican<br /> Siderites, or NERDS for short. </p>
<p>And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and<br /> the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real<br /> riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of<br /> Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. </p>
<p>And indeed did insist on making drums that would work only if<br /> you bought Brother Gates' drumsticks.</p>
<p>And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being<br /> taken over by others.""</p>
<p>And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came<br /> to be known eBay,"" he said, ""we need a name that reflects what<br /> we are,"" and Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner<br /> Operators.""

38879,"<p>Mitch, a hard-shell Southern Baptist, loved to sneak away to the race track.</p>
<p>One day he was there betting on the ponies and losing his shirt when he noticed a priest step out onto the track and bless the forehead of one of the horses lining up for the 4th race. Lo and behold, this horse -- a very long shot -- won the race.</p>
<p>Mitch was most interested to see what the priest did the next race. Sure enough, he watched the priest step out onto the track as the horses for the fifth race lined up, and placed a blessing on the forehead of one of the horses. Mitch made a beeline for the window and placed a small bet on the horse. Again, even though another long shot, the horse the priest had blessed won the race.</p>
<p>Mitch collected his winnings and anxiously waited to see which horse the priest bestowed his blessing on for the 6th race. The priest showed, blessed a horse, Mitch bet on it, and it won! Mitch was elated.</p>
<p>As the day went on, the priest continued blessing one of the horses, and it always came in first. Mitch began to pull in some serious money, and by the last race, he knew his wildest dreams were going to come true.</p>
<p>He made a quick stop at the ATM, withdrew big money and awaited the priest's blessing that would tell him which horse to bet on. rue to his pattern, the priest stepped out onto the track before the last race and blessed the forehead, eyes, ears, and hooves of one of the horses.</p>
<p>Mitch bet every cent, and watched the horse come in dead last. Mitch was dumbfounded. He made his way to the track and when he found the priest, he demanded, ""What happened, Father? All day you blessed the horses and they won. The last, you blessed a horse and he lost. Now I've lost my savings, thanks to you!!""</p>
<p>The priest nodded wisely and said, ""That's the problem with you Protestants... you can't tell the difference between a simple blessing and the Last Rites.""</p>

38880,"<p>3 dogs are sitting in the waiting room of a vet's office. One is a Poodle, one is a Schnauzer and the other is a Great Dane. The Poodle turns to the Schnauzer and asks, ""Why are you here?"" </p>
<p>The Schnauzer responds, ""I'm 17 years old. I don't see or hear very well. I've been having accidents in the house. My owner says I'm too old and sick so he brought me here to be put to sleep."" The Schnauzer asks the poodle, ""Why are you here?"" </p>
<p>The Poodle responds, ""I've not been myself lately. I've been especially high strung. I've been barking all the time, I've been snapping at people and I even bit one of the neighbor's kids. Nobody knows why this has been happening. My owner says he can't risk me biting somebody else so he brought me here to be put to sleep."" The Poodle and Schnauzer ask the Great Dane why he is here. </p>
<p>The Great Dane responds, ""My owner is this beautiful runway model. Yesterday she was walking around the house naked when she suddenly bent down to pick up something she dropped. She was bent over and naked when nature took over and the next thing I know I'm on top of her doing the doggie thing. I couldn't help myself. "" </p>
<p>The Poodle asks, ""So your owner brought you here to be put to sleep?"" </p>

Looking up I saw a<br /> mermaid sunning on a nearby rock. She swam over to me and<br /> informed me that she was a magical mermaid and could grant me 3<br /> wishes. </p>
<p>""Great, I'd like to be rescued."" She slapped the water with her<br /> tail and a ship appeared, sailing straight for my island. </p>
<p>Next I asked for a body like Charles Atlas. Another slap of her<br /> tail and here it is. </p>
<p>Then noticing how beautiful she was and all my other wished<br /> fulfilled I asked if I could make love to her. She said no, it<br /> just wouldn't work, her being half fish and all, so I said<br /> ""Well, how about a little head then?""</p>

""Then ye must get<br /> out of this pub right now!"" orders the priest.<br /> Father Murphy continues this throughout the pub until he comes to the last<br /> man.

38893,"<p>A man has been in business for many, many years and the business is going down the drain. He is seriously contemplating suicide and he doesn't know what to do. He goes to the Rabbi to seek his advice.</p>
<p>He tells the Rabbi about all of his problems in the business and asks the Rabbi what he should do.</p>
<p>The Rabbi says, ""Take a beach chair and a Bible and put them in your car and drive down to the edge of the ocean. Go to the water's edge. Take the beach chair out of the car, sit on it and take the Bible out and open it up. The wind will riffle the pages for a while and eventually the Bible will stay open at a particular page. Read the first words your eyes fall on and they will tell you what to do.""</p>

<p>- I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without<br /> hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd<br /> never expect it.</p>
<p>- To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of something<br /> when you walk around. That way, if anybody says, ""Hey, can you<br /> give me a hand?"" You can say, ""Sorry, got these sacks.""</p>
<p>- If you lived in the Dark Ages and you were a catapult<br /> operator, I bet the most common question people would ask is,<br /> ""Can't you make it shoot farther?"" ""No, I'm sorry. That's as far<br /> as it shoots.""</p>
<p>- I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not<br /> our children's children, because I don't think children should<br /> be having sex.</p>
<p>- If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the<br /> mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.</p>
<p>- To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no<br /> choreography and the dancers hit each other.</p>
<p>- Instead of having ""answers"" on a math test, they should just<br /> call them ""impressions,"" and if you got a different<br /> ""impression,"" so what, can't we all be brothers?</p>
<p>- Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than some<br /> sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.</p>
<p>- I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so<br /> bummed out that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few<br /> years, because I was thinking about doing that anyway.</p>
<p>- I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate<br /> revolver. And since he's so busy, you'd probably have to run up<br /> to him real quick and hand it to him.</p>
<p>- If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else<br /> flying forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye<br /> contact.</p>
<p>- It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money.<br /> And I guess that's what I like about it. It's easy. Just sitting<br /> there, rocking back and forth, wanting that money.</p>
<p>- Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy<br /> looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I<br /> guess that's like a regular window.</p>
<p>- If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor<br /> people, like I am now.</p>
<p>- When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was<br /> call the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it<br /> up, and started wondering who this person was, and why he had<br /> deer horns.</p>
<p>- I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and<br /> whittle all day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a<br /> larger toy boat I had. It was almost as good as the first one,<br /> except now it had bumpy whittle marks all over it. And no paint,<br /> because he had whittled off the paint.</p>
<p>- If you're a cowboy and you're dragging a guy behind your<br /> horse, I bet it would really make you mad if you looked back and<br /> he guy was reading a magazine.</p>
<p>- If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, I<br /> think it's okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the<br /> vultures, to teach him to do some tricks. But only if you're<br /> serious about adopting the vulture.</p>
<p>- Broken promises don't upset me. I just think, why did they<br /> believe me?</p>
<p>- If you ever crawl inside an old hollow log and go to sleep,<br /> and while you're in there some guys come and seal up both ends<br /> and then put it on a truck and take it to another city, boy, I<br /> don't know what to tell you.</p>
<p>- One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is,<br /> don't run with a wooden stake.</p>
<p>- For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: why<br /> not add a slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness?</p>
<p>- Somebody told me how frightening it was how much topsoil we<br /> are losing each year, but I told that story around the campfire<br /> and nobody got scared.</p>
<p>- I wish I had a dollar for every time I spent a dollar, because<br /> then, Yahoo!, I'd have all my money back.</p>
<p>- If by some occurrence you find yourself falling of the CN<br /> Tower, Just let yourself go limp. If some people see you falling<br /> they may try to catch you thinking, ""hey, free dummy!""</p>
<p>- Why is the dove the symbol for peace. Why not the pillow? It<br /> has more feathers and it doesn't have that dangerous beak!</p>
<p>- If some guy asked me the meaning of Love, I'd pin his arm up<br /> behind his back and say...""Now look who's asking the Questions!""</p>

The man then goes outside and tells the first person he sees that the bartender can't keep track of whether his customers have paid. The second man then ruses in, orders a beer and later pulls the same stunt. The barkeep replies, ""If you say you paid, I'll take your word for it."" Soon the customer goes into the street, sees an old friend, and tells him how to get free drinks. The man hurries into the bar and begins to drink high-balls when, suddenly, the bartender leans over sand says, ""You know, a funny thing happened in here tonight.  Two men were drinking beer, neither paid and both claimed that they did. The next guy who tries that is going to get punched right in the nose."" ""Don't bother me with your troubles,"" the final patron responds.""Just give me my change and I'll be on my way.""</p>

Every time he would see a lawyer walking along the road, he would swerve to hit him, and there would be a loud ""THUMP"" and then he would swerve back on the road.One day, as the truck driver was driving along he saw a priest hitch hiking. He thought he would do a good turn and pulled the truck over.He asked the priest, ""Where are you going, Father?"".""I'm going to the church 5 miles down the road!"", replied the priest.""No problem, Father! I'll give you a lift. Climb in the truck"".The happy priest climbed into the passenger seat and the truck driver continued down the road. Suddenly the truck driver saw a lawyer walking down the road and instinctively he swerved to hit him. But then he remembered there was a priest in the truck with him, so at the last minute he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the lawyer. However even though he was certain he missed the lawyer, he still heard a loud ""THUD"". Not understanding where the noise came from he glanced in his mirrors and when he didn't see anything, he turned to the priest and said, ""I'm sorry Father. I almost hit that lawyer"".""That's okay"", replied the priest.""I got him with the door!</p>

<p>On 6 October, she made Jamaica, took on 826 pounds of flour<br /> and 68,300 gallons of rum. Three weeks later, Constitution<br /> reached the Azores, where she provisioned with 550 pounds<br /> of beef and 2,300 gallons of Portuguese wine.</p>
<p>On 18 November, she set sail for England where her crew<br /> captured and scuttled 12 English merchant vessels and took<br /> aboard their rum. By this time, Constitution had run out of<br /> shot. Nevertheless, she made her way unarmed up the Firth<br /> of Clyde for a night raid. Here, her landing party captured<br /> a whiskey distillery, transferred 13,000 gallons on board<br /> and headed for home.</p>
<p>On 20 February 1780, the Constitution arrived in Boston<br /> with no cannon shot, no food, no powder, no rum, and no<br /> whiskey. She did, however, still carry her crew of 475<br /> officers and men and 18,600 gallons of water. The math is<br /> quite enlightening: Length of cruise: 181 days Booze<br /> consumption: 1.26 gallons per man per day (this does NOT<br /> include the unknown quantity of rum captured from the<br /> 12 English merchant vessels in November).</p>

38936,"<p>One day an out of work mime is visiting the zoo and attempt to earn some money as a street performer. As soon as he starts to draw a crowd, a zoo keeper grabs him and drags him into his office. The zoo keeper explains to the mime that the zoo's most popular attraction, a gorilla, has died suddenly and the keeper fears that attendance at the zoo will fall off. He offers the mime a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one. The mime accepts. </p>
<p>So the next morning the mime puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage before crowd comes. He discovers that it's a great job. He can sleep all he wants, play and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime. However, eventually the crowds tire of him and he tires of just swinging on tires. He begins to notice that the people are paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his. </p>
<p>Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbs to the top of his cage, crawls across a partition, and dangles from the top to the lion's cage. Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd loves it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction. </p>
<p>Well, this goes on for some time, the mime keeps taunting the lion, the crowds grow larger, and his salary keeps going up. Then one terrible day when he is dangling over the furious lion he slips and falls. The mime is terrified. The lion gathers itself and prepares to pounce. The mime is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind. </p>
<p>Finally, the mime starts screaming and yelling, ""Help, Help me!"", but the lion is quick and pounces. </p>
<p>The mime soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says, ""Shut up you idiot! Do you want to get us both fired?""</p>

<p>2.  Ask someone what another person's name is nearby.  Go up to<br /> that person and say ""Hey, *person's name*.  How are you?  You<br /> forgot my name, didn't you!?""<br /> (People normally look at me very confused with this one.)</p>
<p>3.  Fall down in front of strangers, and see if they try to help.<br /> (If they don't help, I yell out, ""FINE!  DON'T HELP ME THEN!"")</p>
<p>4.  Bump into someone and pretend it causes you to fall down.<br /> See if they apologize.<br /> (This is hard to do, because they normally try to avoid me when<br /> I try to bump them.)</p>
<p>5.  Walk behind someone until he/she turns around.  Then say,<br /> ""What?""<br /> (You should look very confused, so it makes them be confused<br /> also.)</p>
<p>6.  Run around and jump on things and make noises pretending to<br /> be a monkey.<br /> (It works with any animal.)</p>
<p>7.  Put water in your mouth, and pretend you are barfing when<br /> someone walks by.<br /> (It's really funny when you chew up some Snickers for this.)</p>
<p>8.  Get an ""Obsession, for men"" cologne sample spray, and go up<br /> to people asking,  ""Do you have an obsession for men?  I was<br /> just wondering because I have an obsession for me.  It's in my<br /> pants.  Do you want me to spray you with it?""  When they look at<br /> you funny, take out the cologne and say ""What? It's just my<br /> obsession for men cologne. What were you thinking of?""<br /> (It doesn't work on the people that have the cologne.)</p>
<p>9.  Walk behind someone and have an arguement with yourself.<br /> (It's even better if you talk in two different voices.)</p>
<p>10. Have a bottle of water and go up to people saying, ""Thirsty?""<br /> (I got a total of 5 people to drink from my bottle.)</p>
<p>11. Have a newspaper or a book(or something like that) and hold<br /> it out to someone and ask, ""Thirsty?""<br /> (Confusion is funny.)</p>
<p>12. Put a chunk of something sticky on your hand, and go up to<br /> people saying, ""Eh, how're you doing?"" and try to shake their<br /> hand.<br /> (Some people actually don't notice huge sticky brown things<br /> sticking to your hand.)</p>
<p>13. Jump kick a wall and look at someone and say, ""Please don't<br /> do that.""<br /> (It works with trees too.)</p>
<p>14. Go up to someone and say in a very low voice, ""Death by<br /> catapult.""<br /> (There is also, death by spatula, death by rug burn, death by<br /> malapropism, or any other weird random way of death.)</p>
<p>15. Get people to join you in your strange adventures.<br /> (Twice the people = twice the fun.)</p>

<p>Jake asked her, ""What are you up to?""</p>
<p>Alice smiled. ""I'm going hunting with you!""</p>
<p>Jake, though he had many reservations about this, reluctantly decided to take her along. Later they arrived at the hunting site. Jake set his wife safely up in the tree stand and told her, ""If you see a deer, take careful aim and I'll come running back as soon as I hear the shot.""</p>
<p>Jake walked away with a smile on his face knowing that Alice couldn't bag an elephant, much less a deer. Not 10 minutes passed when he was startled as he heard an array of gunshots.</p>
<p>Quickly, Jake ran back. As Jake got closer to her stand, he heard Alice screaming: ""Get away from my deer!""</p>
<p>Confused, Jake raced faster towards his screaming wife. And again he heard her yell: ""Get away from my deer!"" followed by another volley of gunfire!</p>
<p>Now within sight of where he had left his wife, Jake was surprised to see a guy standing there with his hands high in the air. The guy, obviously distraught, said, ""Okay, lady, okay!!!! You can have your deer!!! Just let me get my saddle off it!""</p>

38966,"<p>THINGS COMPUTERS CAN DO IN MOVIES </p>
<p>1. Word processors never display a cursor. </p>
<p>2. You never have to use the space-bar when typing long sentences. </p>
<p>3. Movie characters never make typing mistakes. </p>
<p>4. All monitors display inch-high letters. </p>
<p>5. High-tech computers, such as those used by NASA, the CIA or some such governmental institution, will have easy to understand graphical interfaces. </p>
<p>6. Those that don't have graphical interfaces will have incredibly powerful text-based command shells that can correctly understand and execute commands typed in plain English. </p>
<p>7. Note: Command line interfaces will give you access to any information you want by simply typing, ""ACCESS THE SECRET FILES"" on any near-by keyboard. </p>
<p>8. You can also infect a computer with a destructive virus by simply typing ""UPLOAD VIRUS"". (See ""Fortress"".) </p>
<p>9. All computers are connected. You can access the information on the villain's desktop computer even if it's turned off. </p>
<p>10. Powerful computers beep whenever you press a key or the screen changes. Some computers also slow down the output on the screen so that it doesn't go faster than you can read. (Really advanced computers will also emulate the sound of a dot-matrix printer.) </p>
<p>11. All computer panels operate on thousands of volts and have explosive devices underneath their surface. Malfunctions are indicated by a bright flash of light, a puff of smoke, a shower of sparks and an explosion that causes you to jump backwards. </p>
<p>12. People typing on a computer can safely turn it off without saving the data. </p>
<p>13. A hacker is always able to break into the most sensitive computer in the world by guessing the secret password in two tries. </p>
<p>14. You may bypass ""PERMISSION DENIED"" message by using the ""OVERRIDE"" function. (See ""Demolition Man"".) </p>
<p>15. Computers only take 2 seconds to boot up instead of the average 2 minutes for desktop PCs and 30 minutes or more for larger systems that can run 24 hours, 365 days a year without a reset. </p>
<p>16. Complex calculations and loading of huge amounts of data will be accomplished in under three seconds. Movie modems usually appear to transmit data at the speed of two gigabytes per second. </p>
<p>17. When the power plant/missile site/main computer overheats, all control panels will explode shortly before the entire building will. </p>
<p>18. If you display a file on the screen and someone deletes the file, it also disappears from the screen (See ""Clear and Present Danger""). </p>
<p>19. If a disk contains encrypted files, you are automatically asked for a password when you insert it. </p>
<p>20. Computers can interface with any other computer regardless of the manufacturer or galaxy where it originated. (See ""Independence Day"".) </p>
<p>21. Computer disks will work on any computer has a floppy drive and all software is usable on any platforms. </p>
<p>22. The more high-tech the equipment, the more buttons it will have. (See ""Aliens"".) </p>
<p>23. Note: You must be highly trained to operate high-tech computers because the buttons have no labels except for the ""SELF-DESTRUCT"" button. </p>
<p>24. Most computers, no matter how small, have reality-defying three-dimensional active animation, photo-realistic graphics capabilities. </p>
<p>25. Laptops always have amazing real-time video phone capabilities and performance similar to a CRAY Supercomputer. </p>
<p>26. Whenever a character looks at a monitor, the image is so bright that it projects itself onto their face. (See ""Alien"" or ""2001"".) </p>
<p>27. Searches on the internet will always return what you are looking for no matter how vague your keywords are. (See ""Mission Impossible"", Tom Cruise searches with keywords like ""file"" and ""computer"" and 3 results are returned.)</p>

<p>Push the buttons and pretend they give you a shock. Smile, and go back for more. </p>
<p>Ask if you can push the button for other people, but push the wrong ones. </p>
<p>Drop a pen and wait until someone reaches to help pick it up, then scream 'that's mine'. </p>
<p>Bring a camera and take pictures of everyone in the elevator.</p>
<p>Move your desk into the elevator and whenever someone gets on, ask if they have an appointment.</p>
<p>Leave a box in the corner and when someone gets on ask them if they hear something ticking.  </p>
<p>Pretend you are a flight attendant and review emergency procedures and exits with the passengers.  </p>
<p>Ask, 'Did you feel that?'</p>
<p>Stand really close to someone, sniffing them occasionally.</p>
<p>When the doors close, announce to the others, 'It's okay, don't panic, they open again.'  </p>

Play Pong for hours on the most powerful computer in the lab.39. Make a loud noise of hitting the same key over and over again until you see that your neighbor is noticing (You can hit the space bar so your fill isn't affected). Then look at your neighbor's keyboard. Hit his/her delete key several times, erasing an entire word. While you do this, ask: ""Does *your* delete key work?"" Shake your head, and resume hitting the space bar on your keyboard. Keep doing this until you've deleted about a page of your neighbor's document. Then, suddenly exclaim: ""Well, whaddya know? I've been hitting the space bar this whole time. No wonder it wasn't deleting! Ha!"" Print out your document and leave.40. Remove your disk from the drive and hide it. Go to the lab monitor and complain that your computer ate your disk. (For special effects, put some Elmer's Glue on or around the disk drive. Claim that the computer is drooling.)</p>

38974,"<p>Recently a ""Husband Shopping Centre"" opened in Booragoon, where women could go to choose a husband from among many men. It was laid out in five floors, with the men increasing in positive attributes as you ascended.</p>
<p>The only rule was, once you opened the door to any floor, you HAD to choose a man from that floor; If you went up a floor, you couldn't go back down except to leave the place, never to return.</p>
<p>A couple of girlfriends went to the shopping centre to find some husbands...</p>
<p>First floor. The door had a sign saying, ""These men have jobs and love kids."" The women read the sign and said, ""Well, that's better than not having a job, or not loving kids, but I wonder what's further up?"" So up they went.</p>
<p>Second floor. The sign read, ""These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking."" Hmmm, said the ladies. But, I wonder what's further up?</p>
<p>Third floor. This sign read, ""These men have high paying jobs, are extremely good looking, love kids and help with the housework."" Wow! said the women. Very tempting, BUT, there's more further up! And up they went.</p>
<p>Fourth floor. This door had a sign saying ""These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak."" ""Oh, mercy me. But just think! What must be awaiting us further on!"" So up to the fifth floor they went.</p>
<p>Fifth floor. The sign on that door said, ""This floor is empty and exists only to prove that women are impossible to please!""</p>

38975,"<p>It was spring in the old west. The cowboys rode the still snow choked trails looking for cattle that survived the winter. As one cowboy's horse went around the narrow trail, it came upon a rattlesnake warming itself in the spring sunshine. The horse reared and the cowboy drew his six-gun to shoot the snake.""Hold on there, partner,"" said the snake, ""don't shoot- I'm an enchanted rattlesnake, and if you don't shoot me, I'll give you any three wishes you want.""The cowboy decided to take a chance. He knew he was safely out of the snake's striking range. He said, ""OK, first, I'd like to have a face like Clark Gable, then, I'd like a build like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and finally, I'd like sexual equipment like this here horse I'm riding.""The rattlesnake said, ""All right, when you get back to the bunk house you'll have all three wishes.""The cowboy turned his horse around and galloped at full speed all the way to the bunk house. He dismounted on the run and went straight inside to the mirror.Staring back at him in the mirror was the face of Clark Gable. He ripped the shirt off his back and revealed bulging, rippling muscles, just like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Really excited now, he tore down his jeans, looked at his crotch and shouted, ""Oh no! I was riding the mare!""</p>

38985,"<p>1. More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread users. </p>
<p>2. Fully HALF of all children who grow up in bread-consuming households score below average on standardized tests. </p>
<p>3. In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the average life expectancy was less than 50 years; infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, yellow fever, and influenza ravaged whole nations. </p>
<p>4. More than 90 percent of violent crimes are committed within 24 hours of eating bread. </p>
<p>5. Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and given only water to eat begged for bread after as little as two days. </p>
<p>6. Bread is often a ""gateway"" food item, leading the user to ""harder"" items such as butter, jelly, peanut butter, and even cold cuts. </p>
<p>7. Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since the human body is more than 90 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead to your body being taken over by this absorptive food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey bread-pudding person. </p>

After seeing the beautiful waterfall, they turned to the little boy. ""How,"" they asked, ""how did you know to toss the kosher pickle into the river?""

<p>As the elevator started moving the gentleman struck up a<br /> conversation and asked the blonde where she was going. She said,<br /> ""I'm going to the blood bank on the 3rd floor; I donate blood<br /> once a week for $10 to supplement my income."" Then she asked the<br /> gentleman where he was going. He responded, ""I'm going to the<br /> sperm bank on the 5th floor; I donate sperm there once a week<br /> for $50 to supplement my income"". </p>
<p>The next week the same scenario happens. He stopped the elevator<br /> doors with his hand, the doors opened and the blonde was<br /> standing inside.

38995,"<p>The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the<br /> background checks, interviews, and testing were done there<br /> were three finalists � two men and one woman. For the final<br /> test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal<br /> door and handed him a gun. �We must know that you will follow your<br /> instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside this room you will find<br /> your wife sitting in a chair. You have to kill her.�<br /> The first man said.�You can�t be serious. I could never<br /> shoot my wife,�. The agent replies, �Then you�re not the right man for this<br /> job."" </p>
<p>The second man was given the same instructions. He took the<br /> gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about five<br /> minutes. Then the agent came out with tears in his eyes. �I<br /> tried, but I can�t kill my wife.� The agent replies, �You<br /> don�t have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.� </p>
<p>Finally, it was the woman�s turn. Only she was told to kill<br /> her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots<br /> were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming,<br /> crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all<br /> was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the<br /> woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, �You<br /> guys didn�t tell me the gun was loaded with blanks. So I<br /> had to beat him to death with the chair.�</p>
