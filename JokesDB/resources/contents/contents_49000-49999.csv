49028,"<p>Tired of constantly being broke, and stuck in an unhappy marriage, a young husband decided to solve both problems by taking out a large insurance policy on his wife, with himself as the beneficiary, and arranging to have her killed.</p>
<p>A 'friend of a friend' put him in touch with a nefarious underworld figure, who went by the name of Artie. Artie explained to the husband that his going price for snuffing out a spouse was 5000 quid.</p>
<p>The husband said he was willing to pay that amount but that he wouldn't have any cash on hand until he could collect his wife's insurance money.<br /> Artie insisted on being paid something up front. The man opened up his wallet, displaying the single pound coin that rested inside. Artie sighed, rolled his eyes, and reluctantly agreed to accept the quid as own-payment for the dirty deed.</p>
<p>A few days later, Artie followed the man's wife to the local Sainsbury's supermarket. There, he surprised her in the produce department and proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands.</p>
<p>As the poor unsuspecting woman drew her last breath and slumped to the floor, the manager of the produce department stumbled unexpectedly onto the scene. Unwilling to leave any witnesses behind, Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce manager as well. Unknown to Artie, the entire proceedings were captured by hidden cameras and observed by the store's security guard, who immediately called the police. Artie was caught and arrested before he could leave the store.</p>
<p>When Artie was tried and found guilty, the headlines read, 'Artie Chokes Two for a Pound at Sainsbury's!'</p>

<p>The next evening, he appeared at the brothel again, demanding to see Natalie. Natalie explained that no one had ever come back two nights in a row and that there were no discounts... the price was still $1000. Again, he took out the money and the two of them went up to a room. An hour later, he left. </p>
<p>No one could believe it when he showed up the third consecutive night. Again, he demanded to see Natalie, handed her the money and they went up to a room. After the hour had passed, Natalie questioned him. ""No one has ever used my services three nights in a row. Where are you from?"" </p>
<p>""I'm from Los Angeles,"" he replied. </p>
<p>""Really?"" Natalie said. ""I have family living there."" </p>
<p>""Yes, I know,"" the old man said. ""Your father passed away and I'm your sister's attorney. She asked me to give you $3000."" </p>

49055,"<p>BARBIE'S LETTER TO SANTA: </p>
<p>Dear Santa: </p>
<p>Listen you fat troll, I've been saving your ass every year,<br /> being the perfect Christmas Present, wearing skimpy bathing<br /> suits in December and dressing in fake Chanel at sappy tea<br /> parties. I hate to break it to ya,' Santa, but it's payback<br /> time. There had better be some changes around here, or I'm gonna<br /> call for a nationwide meltdown, and trust me, you don't wanna be<br /> around to smell it. </p>
<p>These are my demands for this Christmas:</p>
<p>1. Sweat pants and an oversized sweatshirt. I'm sick of looking<br /> like a hooker in hot pink bikinis. Do you have any idea what it<br /> feels like to have nylon and velcro up your butt? I don't<br /> suppose you do. </p>
<p>2. Real underwear that can be pulled on and off. That cheap-o<br /> molded underwear some genius at Mattel came up with looks like<br /> cellulite! </p>
<p>3. A REAL man... I don't care if you have to go to Hasbro to get<br /> him, bring me GI JOE. Hell, I'd take Tickle-Me-Elmo over that<br /> pathetic bump of a boytoy, Ken. And what was up with that<br /> earring anyway? HELLO!?! </p>
<p>4. It's about time you made us all anatomically correct. Give me<br /> arms that actually bend so I can push the aforementioned<br /> Ken-wimp away once he is anatomically correct. </p>
<p>5. Breast reduction surgery. 'Nuff said. </p>
<p>6. A jog-bra. To wear until I get the surgery. </p>
<p>7. A new career. Doctor's and Lawyer's make real money. </p>
<p>8. A new, more 90s persona. Maybe ""PMS Barbie,"" complete with a<br /> pint of cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips. </p>
<p>9. No more McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my<br /> vinyl complexion. </p>
<p>10. Mattel stock options. It's been 40 years -I think I deserve<br /> a piece of the action. </p>
<p>Considering my valuable contribution to society and Mattel, I<br /> think these demands are reasonable. If you don't like it, you<br /> can find yourself a new bitch for next Christmas. It's that<br /> simple. </p>
<p>As ever,<br /> Barbie </p>
<p>KEN'S LETTER TO SANTA: </p>
<p>Dear Santa: </p>
<p>It has come to my attention that one of my colleagues has<br /> petitioned you for changes in her contract, specifically asking<br /> for anatomical and career changes. In addition, it is my<br /> understanding that disparaging remarks were made about me, my<br /> sexuality, and some of my fashion choices. </p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of issue<br /> concerning Ms. Barbie, as well as some of my own needs and<br /> desires: First, I, along with several of my colleagues, feel Ms.<br /> Barbie DOES NOT deserve the preferential treatment she has<br /> received over the years. That bitch has everything. Neither I,<br /> nor Joe, nor The Raggedys, Ann &amp; Andy, have dream houses,<br /> Corvettes, dune buggies, evening gowns, and some of us do not<br /> even have the ability to change our hairstyle. I have had a<br /> limited wardrobe, obviously designed to complement but never<br /> upstage Ms. Barbie. My decision to accessorize with an earring<br /> was immediately squashed, which I protest, for it was my<br /> decision and reflects my lifestyle choice. I would like a change<br /> in my career to further explore my creative nature. </p>
<p>Some options which could be considered are: ""Decorator Ken,""<br /> ""Beauty Salon Ken,"" or ""Broadway Ken."" Other avenues which could<br /> be considered are: ""Impersonator Ken"" (with wigs and gowns), or<br /> ""West Hollywood Ken."" These would more accurately reflect my<br /> interests and, I believe, open up markets that have been under<br /> served. </p>
<p>As for Ms. Barbie needing bendable arms so she can ""push me<br /> away,"" I need bendable knees so I can kick the bitch to the<br /> curb. Bendable knees would also be helpful in other situations<br /> of which you are aware. </p>
<p>In closing, further concessions to the Blonde Bimbo from Hell,<br /> while the needs of others within my coalition are ignored, will<br /> result in legal action to be taken by myself and others. And<br /> kindly tell Ms. Barbie she can forget about G.I. Joe...he's<br /> mine, at least that's what he said last night. </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br /> Ken</p>

<p>Bubba and Bill started pissing together in the same toilet when<br /> out of nowhere Bill asked, ""How did you get such a big dick?!""</p>
<p>Bubba with a simple reply said, ""Well sometimes while my woman<br /> was sleeping I would get up so I beat my dick against the<br /> bedpost. After I beat my dick against the bed post it would get<br /> swelled up and, well, it would just stay that way.""</p>
<p>""Hmm...that sounds like a pretty good idea."" Clinton said. ""I<br /> think I'll try that.""</p>
<p>So later on, sometime around midnight Clinton got up while<br /> Hillary was sleeping and started to beat his dick against the<br /> bed post. Hillary soon woke up. Without even turning the light<br /> to see who it was she said, ""Bubba is that you?""</p>

49059,"<p>George and Lenny decide to cross North America in a hot air balloon. However,<br /> neither were particularly experienced balloonists, and Lenny's mind quickly<br /> drifted from navigation to thoughts of how clouds look like cuddly little bunny<br /> rabbits. Upon realizing that they were lost, George declared, ""Lenny -- we are<br /> going to have to lose some altitude so we can figure out where we are.""</p>
<p>George lets some hot air out of the balloon, which slowly descended below the<br /> clouds, but he still couldn't tell where they were. Far below, they could see a<br /> man on the ground. George lowered the balloon, to ask the man their location.</p>
<p>When they were low enough, George called down to the man, ""Hey, can you tell<br /> us where we are?"" The man on the ground yelled back, ""You're in a balloon, about<br /> 100 feet up in the air.""</p>
<p>George called down to the man, ""You must be a lawyer."" ""Gee, George,"" Lenny<br /> replied, ""How can you tell?"" George answered, ""Because the advice he gave us is<br /> 100% accurate, and is completely useless"".<br /> The man called back up to the balloon, ""You must be a client."" George yelled<br /> back, ""Why do you say that?"" ""Well,"" the man replied, ""you don't know where you<br /> are, or where you are going. You got into your predicament through a lack of<br /> planning, and could have avoided it by asking for help before you acted. You<br /> expect me to provide an instant remedy. The fact is you are in the exact same<br /> position you were in before we met, but now it is somehow my fault.""</p>

<p>The first step of the trial was to go to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. All three men went their separate ways to gather the fruit. </p>
<p>Brandon came back and said to the king, ""I brought ten apples"". </p>
<p>The king explained the trial to him, ""You have to shove the fruit up your butt without any expression on your face, or you'll be eaten."" The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out in pain, so he was killed. </p>
<p>Troy arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this should be easy. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed. </p>

49065,"<p>When I came into the office this morning, I noticed a sort of general feeling of unfriendliness, and since several of you have called me a ""dirty son of a bitch"" to my face, I knew I must have done something wrong at the office Christmas Party. </p>
<p>The Office Manager called me from the hospital today and as this is my last day, I'd like to take this way of apologizing to all of you. I would prefer speaking to everyone personally, but all of you seem to go deaf and dumb whenever I try to talk to you. </p>
<p>First, to our dear and beloved boss, I am sorry for all the things I called you Friday afternoon. I'm very much aware that your father is not a baboon, nor your mother a Chinese whore. Your wife is a delightful woman, and my story of you buying her for 50 cents in Tijuana was strictly a figment of my imagination. Your children are undoubtedly yours too. About the water cooler incident, you'll never know how badly I feel about it, and I hope you didn't hurt your head when they were trying to get the glass jug off. </p>
<p>To Mary, I express my deepest regrets. In my own defense, I must remind you that you seemed to enjoy our little escapade on the stairway as much as I did until the bannister broke and we fell eight feet to the second floor landing. In spite of the rupture you incurred when I landed on top of you, I am sure you will admit that when we landed it was one of the biggest thrills you have ever had. </p>
<p>Sam, you old cuss, you've just got to forgive me for that little prank I played on you. If I had known you were goosey, I'd have never done it. It would have been a lot worse if that lady hadn't been standing right under the window you jumped through. She really broke your fall a lot. People have been killed falling three stories. </p>
<p>Gene, I regret telling the fireman it was you who turned in the false alarm. But, of course, I had no way of knowing they would make such a bad report of it. Those fire hoses sure have a lot of pressure don't they? And boy the water is sure cold!! </p>
<p>Don, I know how you must feel about me. Opening the door to the broom closet suddenly must have startled you and Millie quite badly, and to think how hard you bumped your chin on the shelf when you bent over to pull up your pants, it makes me sick. We'll have to get together for dinner some night after the dentist finishes your plates. </p>
<p>Nancy, the only excuse I can offer for stealing all your clothes and hiding them when I found you passed out in the ladies room, is that I was drunk. Also, I want you to know I was very embarrassed when I couldn't remember where I hid them and you had to go home in that old sofa cover. Running your falsies up the flag pole was a bit too much, but like I said, I was a little drunk. </p>
<p>To all of you, I am sorry. Setting Jan's panties on fire seemed funny at the time, and it makes me sad to hear that her husband is divorcing her because of it. Urinating in everyone's drink was in bad taste, and not telling them about it until all the drinks were gone was even worse. </p>
<p>Now that I have apologized to all of you and know that I am forgiven, I will do my darndest to come to the picnic....</p>

He captures the man and<br /> pins him to the ground.  He is about to swipe his big paw on the<br /> man to kill him when the man screams out, ""Oh my God!!!!!""  Time<br /> freezes and God appears out of nowhere.  He tells the man, ""All<br /> your life, you have never believed in me and now at this time of<br /> need you call upon me.""  The man replies, ""I will never become a<br /> Christian, but if you could do one thing for me, change the bear<br /> into a Christian.""  God, being the nice man he is, agrees and<br /> disappears again.  The bear begins to slow his paw down and the<br /> man is relieved while at the same time the bear begins, ""Dear<br /> Lord.

49068,"<p>Once a very rich man and his dog were sailing at sea. Suddenly a very severe storm lashed at the boat and gale force winds tossed the fragile boat. After many days the sea dumped them both onto an uninhabited island. The boat was completely smashed . The deserted island was barren except for many bones, a freshwater lake, and some cats. </p>
<p>The man became extremely depressed as he realised that rescue from the remote island was not likely. He missed the life he had left behind. He kept remembering his grand mansion, the luxury cars, the exotic restaurants and all the partying. </p>
<p>In contrast to him, his dog was loving the life on the island. There were hundreds of bones to chew , nice cool freshwater to drink and even dozens of cats to chase. </p>
<p>The man, however, was feeling more and more down and was missing his previous fantastic life. Then after many years, just as things looked hopeless, their fortunes changed dramatically .While playing on the beach, the dog found a magic lamp and quickly took it to his master. With great joy the man vigorously rubbed the lamp and a Genie popped out. After stretching himself the Genie spoke;</p>
<p>""I was trapped for three thousand years and thanks to the two of you I am finally free. As a gesture of my gratitude , I will grant ONE wish to each of you.""</p>
<p>The Genie went to the man first;</p>
<p>""What is your one wish? Think carefully since this is the only wish I can grant you.""</p>
<p>The man, running around with joy said;</p>
<p>"" What is there to think ! Send me back to my luxury mansion. My life will be back to normal. I can already think of a good restaurant to go for dinner. After that I will....""</p>
<p>As the man was talking there was a ""POOF!"" and he disappeared back to his previous life of luxury.</p>
<p>The Genie then went to the dog;</p>
<p>""What is your one wish? Think carefully since this is the only wish I can grant you.""</p>
<p>Unlike the man, the dog thought a lot;</p>
<p>"" I really can't complain. There are plenty of bones to chew on and a lot of freshwater to drink. The cats are a joy to chase and the weather is great. I suppose the only thing is that this island is a bit lonely, specially after my master left. I wish he was here...""</p>
<p>""POOF!""</p>
<p>The man reappeared on the island and having granted the wishes, the Genie vanished.</p>

49072,"<p>This simple five question test will help determine how drunk you really are. Begin by answering each of the five questions below truthfully. Then determine your score based on question answer values provided. Lastly, compare your score to the results for a final answer.1. Think about your wife. In your mind, is she: (a) the most beautiful woman alive; (b) a beautiful woman; (c) attractive; (d) ugly as sin.2. Think about your job. In your mind, is it: (a) the best job on the planet; (b) a good job; (c) a decent job; (d) the most annoying job ever.3. Try walking. What happened? Did you: (a) find it impossible to stand up; (b) fall after standing up; (c) walk fifty feet before falling flat on your face; (d) walk one thousand feet without falling.4. How did you get to the bar? I got here in: (a) my brand new chauffer-driven limo; (b) a brand new car; (c) a used car; (d) a rented, rusted, and damaged 1950 japanese import.5. What do you think of your strength? I am: (a) invincible; (b) stronger than anyone in the bar; (c) as strong as the average man; (d) a weak and pathetic being.Question answer valuesFor every question answered with an A, add ten points.For every question answered with a B, add five points.For every question answered with a C, do not change the score.For every question answered with a D, subtract five points.For every question answered with an E, add one hundred points.ResultsFor scores ranging from fifty to 135, congratulations. You're over and above the normal drunk. Generally, at least they are able to select a valid option. An e option does not even exist on this test. You should probably check yourself into a hospital for alcohol poisoning.For scores ranging from thirty-five to fifty, you had ten too many beers. If you plan on driving home, make out a will first--that is, if you can even remember your own name. Lastly, don't even think about standing up.For scores ranging from fifteen to thirty-five, you have had one too many beers. Don't drive unless you want a higher insurance rate. Standing up will probably result in injury.For scores ranging from zero to fifteen, you may want to stop drinking now. You have probably had enough beers but don't drive unless you want a ticket. If you choose to ignore the tip to stop drinking, it is not a problem; you probably still have the ability to stand up.For scores ranging from negative twenty-five to zero, you must just be getting started! I bet you don't even have one beer in you. In terms of driving, you are probably just getting out of the car and are walking to the bar this very moment.This doucment was written by the employees at Glowport.</p>

49073,"<p>Notes from an inexperienced Chili taster named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast:</p>
<p>""Recently I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted. Here are the scorecards from the event:</p>
<p>Chilli # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.<br /> FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.</p>
<p>Chilli # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.<br /> FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.</p>
<p>Chilli # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.<br /> JUDGE TWO: A bean less chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.<br /> FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now, get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.</p>
<p>Chilli # 4: Bubba's Black Magic</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.<br /> FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it, is it possible to burn-out taste buds? Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills, that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating. Is chilli an aphrodisiac?</p>
<p>Chilli # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.<br /> FRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks!</p>
<p>Chilli # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.<br /> JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.<br /> FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally, she must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!</p>
<p>Chilli # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chilli peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.<br /> FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I<br /> wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4 inch hole in my stomach.</p>
<p>Chilli # 8:  Mount Saint Helen's Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.<br /> JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank, wonder how he would have reacted to a really hot chili?<br /> FRANK: -------------- (editor's note: Judge #3 was unable to report)</p>

The little guy fell off his bar stool and when he got up the big guy said, ''That was a karate chop from Korea.''The big guy went to the restroom and the little guy ordered himself another beer. About 20 minutes later the big guy came back and karate choped the little guy in the back again. The little guy got up and dusted himself off and the big guy told him,''That was a karate chop from China.''The little guy got up and decided he wasn't going to take any more of this, so he left the bar. About an hour later the little guy comes back to the bar and he hits the big guy in the back. The big guy is knocked out cold and he's on the floor. The little guy tells the bartender , ''Tell him that was a crowbar from Sears!''</p>

49077,"<p>It was Saturday morning as Jake, an avid hunter, woke up raring to go bag the first deer of the season. </p>
<p>He walks down to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee, and to his surprise<br /> he finds his wife, Alice, sitting there, fully dressed in camouflage.</p>
<p>Jake asks her, ""What are you up to?""</p>
<p>Alice smiles, ""I'm going hunting with you!""</p>
<p>Jake, though he had many reservations about this, reluctantly decides to take her along.</p>
<p>Three hours later they arrive at a game preserve just outside of San Marcos,Texas.</p>
<p>Jake sets his lovely wife safely up in the tree stand and tells her, ""If you see a deer, take careful aim on it and I'll come running back as soon as I hear the shot.""</p>
<p>Jake walks away with a smile on his face knowing that Alice couldn't bag an elephant -- much less a deer. </p>
<p>Not 10 minutes pass when he is startled as he hears an array of gunshots.</p>
<p>Quickly, Jake starts running back. As Jake gets closer to her stand, he hears Alice screaming, ""Get away from my deer!""</p>
<p>Confused and frightened Jake races faster towards his screaming wife. And again he hears her yell, ""Get away from my deer now!"" followed by another volley of gunfire!</p>
<p>Now within sight of where he had left his wife, Jake is surprised to see a Texas cowboy, with his hands high in the air.</p>
<p>The cowboy, obviously distraught, says, ""Okay, lady! You can<br /> have your f#@ken deer! Just let me get my saddle off it!""</p>

49078,"<p>The following are ways to detirmine whether a truck is company owned:</p>
<p>1. Company trucks travel faster in all gears.</p>
<p>2. They accelerate much faster than personal trucks, leaving tire marks on pavement. </p>
<p>3. They enjoy a much shorter braking distance, leaving more tire marks.</p>
<p>4. They can take bumps at twice the speed of private trucks.</p>
<p>5. Company trucks normally require oil changes at 100,000 mile intervals.</p>
<p>6. Their floors are shaped like ash trays, and accommodate milk cartons, coke bottles, leftover food, and paper wrappers.</p>
<p>7. They can be driven 100 miles or more with the oil pressure light flashing.</p>
<p>8. They are adapted to allow the transmission to be shifted into reverse while going forward at 20 mph.</p>
<p>9. Their tire walls are designed for bumping into and over curbs.</p>
<p>10. Unusual and alarming engine noises are easily eliminated by turning the radio volume up.</p>
<p>11. Company trucks are not designed to be washed or waxed or to retain hubcaps.</p>
<p>12. All company trucks have many dents in the body, inflicted by a mysterious person called ""not me"".</p>

She said I was too kinky in bed too.""So they start talking and they find that they have much in common so they decide to go to the woman's apartment and have kinky sex.

She comes out of the bathroom with a tight, black leather outfit with a whip, handcuffs, a strap- on cock, and a 12 inch studded dildo. Then she hurries into the kitchen and comes out with Tabasco sauce, whipped cream, and a rolling pin. Then she notices that the man is putting on his coat and is walking towards the door.""What's going on?"", she asks.""I thought you wanted to get kinky?""He turns around and says, ""I just fucked your dog and shit in your purse.

<p>        Said the feminist Yankee overtired psychology professor: ""Sherman did.""</p>
<p>        She says he was not satisfied merely to give her a speeding ticket;<br /> he made her follow him fifty miles out of her way to Nowheresburg, GA, and<br /> wait at the police station until three in the afternoon for a circuit judge<br /> to arrive so that he could explain to her why it wasn't the best idea in<br /> the world to be impolite to policemen, who were after all interested only<br /> in creating the safest possible environment for everybody including her,<br /> etc. etc.  The lecture went on for about two hours, she says, after which<br /> she was released to drive the fifty miles back to her route and resume her<br /> search for someplace to crash.</p>

"
49180,"<p>New research delivers enlightening insight into the sex life of the Scottish male.</p>
<p>Preparation<br /> Friday night is very much love night for the Scottish man. Arriving back from the pub, having partaken of the traditional Scottish aphrodisiac 12 pints of heavy, a white pudding supper and three pickled onions   his mind is set on one thing: love.<br /> His lust at fever pitch after the sensuous excitement of a hard night's dominoes, he approaches his beloved wife, enticing her with gentle words of passion, 'Any chance of na nookie?'<br /> The good lady in question, perhaps over excited by the erotic smell of stale beer or the sensuous vision of pickled onions sticking to his chin, is at first somewhat reluctant. This coy reluctance is expressed with the flirtatious reply, 'Awaity f*** ya bam.'</p>
<p>Foreplay<br /> Foreplay is very important indeed. This basically consists of the male casting off his lightly soiled Y fronts provocatively at his wife, usually landing skid mark down, as he approaches the bed and singing the ancient Gaelic fertility chant, 'Here we go, here we go, here we go.' Upon reaching the bed, he comments proudly on his rampant 8 inches. This is a classic example of alcohol induced double vision.</p>
<p>Initial problems<br /> After 12 pints, sometimes the man's Wee Willie Winkle is a trifle reluctant to extend itself (literally). Impotence is very much a blow to the man's self esteem and the wife has to be very tactful. She will offer gentle and sensitive words of encouragement such as, 'Ya useless bastard,' or possibly, 'It never happens tae ra milkman.'</p>
<p>Fellatio<br /> Oral sex is a great favorite with the Scotsman. He approaches his wife with a cheeky invitation, 'Howl ya like to put yer teeth roon this?'<br /> The woman nods willingly and points suggestively to her falsies smiling happily in a bedside tumbler. 'Go on yersel,' she says, 'list dinnae disturb me.'</p>
<p>Down to business<br /> Eventually the moment comes to consummate their tender love. Again, alcohol induced double vision is an important factor as the man decides which of his willies to use. Sometimes in his excitement, he may suffer from premature ejaculation, a phenomenon he explains to his wife using the poetic phrase, 'F*** me, I've shot ma load.'<br /> If this does occur, it is essential he makes up for disappointing his wife by uttering tender and loving compliments such as informing her she's the nicest woman he's ever come across. An imaginative lover, the Scotsman, possibly having read that women like to be spoken to dirty, says such things as, 'Shite, arsehole.'<br /> The woman is speechless. The man is now thrusting away, his mind a kaleidoscope of jumbled erotic thoughts. The woman wonders if they should repaint the ceiling. Sometimes she utters a word of encouragement such as, 'Are you sure it's in?'<br /> Given his level of sexual expertise, the Scotsman's ideal partner should be a versatile lover specializing in the faked orgasm. This takes the form of a breathless shout, 'Ooyah, ooyah, gallus big man.'<br /> Eventually it's all over. The man rolls over, wipes his dick on her nightie, falls asleep and commences snoring like a pig.<br /> There's no one in the world that performs quite like a Scotsman   a veritable prince in the kingdom of sex.</p>

49188,"<p>An Oregonian, a Californian, and a Texan were out camping.  They were lazing around the campfire when the Texan pulled out a bottle of tequila and after taking a couple of swallows, threw the bottle in the air, pulled out his six-shooter, and neatly shot the bottle.  The Californian noted that there was still some tequila left in the bottle, but the Texan replied, 'That's okay, we have plenty of tequila where I come from.'The Californian promptly brought out his bottle of White Zinfandel, took two swallows, threw it up in the air, and shot it with a Glock 9mm pistol with the 17-round magazine, stating:  'We have plenty of wine where I come from.'The Oregonian took all this in and finally opened a bottle of Henry's Blue Boar Irish Ale.  He downed the entire bottle, threw it up in the air, shot the Californian with a 12-guage Mossberg he kept around for the birds, and deftly caught the bottle.  The Texan's jaw dropped nearly to his silver belt buckle and his eyes opened nearly as wide.  The Oregonian, momentarily puzzled at the reaction, finally laughed:  'It's okay, we have plenty of Californians where I come from, BUT I can get a nickel for this bottle!'</p>

<p>7.  Your picture on her wall has darts in it.</p>
<p>6.  She reads books like ""Women are From Venus, Men Are Complete Assholes.""</p>
<p>5.  She falls asleep during sex. The oral kind. While she's giving it.</p>

""Oh that's simple,"" answers the shop<br /> owner, ""all you have to do is hold a lighter up to the bird's<br /> body and it will sing different songs.""<br /> So the man gets out his lighter and holds it up to the birds<br /> left wing and it sings ""Jingle Bells"", he is impressed.  He then<br /> holds it up to the right wing, and the bird starts to sing<br /> ""Frosty the Snowman"", when the lighter got held up to the birds<br /> stomach it started to sing ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.""<br /> Finally the man holds the lighter up under the bird's tail, and<br /> without a moments hesitation the parrot starts to sing ""Chesnuts<br /> Roasting on an Open Fire.""</p>

49273,"<p>Two guys walk into a bar and sit down at a table. The barkeep comes over to them and asks, ""What can I serve you gentlemen?""</p>
<p>One of them says to the barkeep, ""I'll bet you a pitcher of you finest beer that I can lick my eye."" The barkeep says, ""I've had guys come in here that could lick their nose but never have I ever seen one that could lick his eye. I'll take that bet.""</p>
<p>So the guy reaches up, pulls out his glass eye, licks it, and puts it back in his eye socket. The barkeep says, ""Damn, you got me."" He brings the guys a pitcher of beer and goes about tending the bar.</p>
<p>When that pitcher starts to get low the barkeep comes back and asks, ""Are you gentlemen ready for another?"" The same guy answers, ""I'll bet you another pitcher of your finest beer that I can bite my ear."" </p>
<p>The barkeep hesitates for a moment and looks at the guy's left ear, his right ear, and says, ""There's no way you've got an artificial ear. I'll take that bet.""</p>
<p>The guy reaches up, pulls out his false teeth, bites his ear with them, and puts them back in his mouth. The barkeep says, ""Damn, you got me again."" He brings the guys another pitcher of beer and goes about tending the bar.</p>
<p>A little later the betting guy is drunk, gets up and staggers over to the bar and lays a $100 bill on the bar saying, ""I'll bet you a hundred that I can pee and fill 10 shot glasses lined up on the bar with their rims touching without spilling a drop on the bar from 3 feet away."" </p>
<p>The barkeep says, ""It'll be worth $100 to see that so I bet you can't do it."" He puts his own $100 on the bar, lines up 10 shot glasses and steps back.</p>
<p>The drunk whips it out and pees all over the shot glasses, the bar, and the floor. </p>
<p>The barkeep picks up the two $100 bills, gets out his towel and starts to wipe it up. He then notices the drunk is smiling and says, ""I just made $100 so I'm smiling, you just lost $100, why are you smiling?""</p>
<p>The drunk says, you see they guy over there I've been drinking with all this time? I just bet him $1,000 that I could come over here, pee all over the bar, and that you'd wipe it up with a smile on your face.</p>

Clinton gets all upset and calls White House Security. He tells them he doesn't care what it takes but he wants to know who did this.</p>
<p>The Chief of Security returns in a couple of days to the President and tells him that he has good news, bad news, and real bad news. ""OK,"" says Clinton, ""give me the good news first, then the bad news, and then the real bad news.""</p>

<p>Clinton nods and the Chief continues: ""The bad news is the culprit is Vice President Gore.""</p>
<p>This really upsets the President, but he controls his anger and asks the Chief to tell him the real bad news.</p>
<p>The Chief of Security swallows and says, ""It's in Hilary's hand writing"".</p>

The milk rights of 6 cows are transferred via a Panamanian intermediary to a Cayman Islands company secretly owned by the majority shareholder, who sells the rights to all 7 cows' milk back to the listed company and proceeds from the sale are deferred.

<p>Tamatha Brannon of suburban Atlanta said Tuesday that she has<br /> filed an obscenity complaint against Toys'R'Us because her<br /> 11-year-old son picked up an Austin Powers doll that asked, ""Do<br /> I make you horny, baby, do I?"" Exposure to the doll forced a<br /> vocabulary word on her son ""that he otherwise would never have<br /> known to ask,"" Brannon says. McFarlane Toys, maker of the doll,<br /> says the shipping of a version of its Austin Powers toy intended<br /> for specialty stores, not mass-market retailers such as<br /> Toys'R'Us, was ""an isolated event of human error."" The version<br /> that Toys R Us carries instead asks, ""Would you fancy a shag?""<br /> Shag is British slang for sexual relations.</p>
<p>This really isn't that unusual of a story, except the part where<br /> they say what the Toys'R'Us model says. Is there really that<br /> much of a difference?!</p>

To which the dog replied, ""Oh, he's great! He throws a stick for me, scratches my belly, and I just love him!!""Needless to say, the farmer was dumfounded.

49300,"<p>A newlywed farmer and his wife were visited by her mother, who immediately demanded an inspection of the place. The farmer had genuinely tried to be friendly to his new mother-in-law, hoping that it could be a friendly, non-antagonistic relationship. All to no avail though, as she kept nagging them at every opportunity, demanding changes, offering unwanted advice, and generally making life unbearable to the farmer and his new bride.</p>

The pastor noticed that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he would nod his head yes and say something. Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, however, he would shake his head no, and mumble a reply.</p>
<p>Very curious as to this bizarre behavior, the pastor later asked the farmer what that was all about. The farmer replied, ""The women would say, 'What a terrible tragedy' and I would nod my head and say 'Yes, it was.'

<p>He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. </p>
<p>I told him everyone would enjoy having Sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the Justice of the Peace. </p>
<p>My family is barred from the church from then on.</p>
<p>When I got married and went on my honeymoon, I took the dog with me. I told the hotel clerk that I wanted a room for my wife and me, and a special room for Sex. </p>
<p>He said, ""Every room in the place is for sex."" </p>
<p>I said, ""You don't understand. Sex keeps me awake at night."" </p>
<p>The clerk said, ""Me too.""</p>
<p>One day I entered Sex in a contest, but before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. </p>
<p>I told him I had planned to have Sex in the contest. He told me that I should have sold tickets. </p>
<p>""But you don't understand,"" I said, ""I had hoped to have Sex on T.V."" </p>
<p>He called me a show-off.</p>
<p>When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, ""Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married."" </p>
<p>The judge said, ""Me too."" </p>
<p>Then I told him that after I was married, Sex left me. </p>
<p>He said, ""Me too.""</p>
<p>Last night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking around town for him. A cop came over to me and asked, ""What are you doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning?"" </p>
<p>I said, ""I'm looking for Sex.""</p>
<p>Well now I've been thrown in jail, been divorced and had more damn troubles with that dog than I ever foresaw. Why just the other day when I went for my first session with the psychiatrist, she asked me, ""What seems to be the trouble?"" </p>
<p>I replied, ""Sex has been my best friend all my life but now it has left me forever. I couldn't live any longer so lonely,"" </p>
<p>And the doctor said, ""Look mister, you should understand that sex isn't a man's best friend, so get yourself a dog.""</p>

This discouraged the husband so he went to the doctor and got some extra strength Viagra even though it was still in its trial phase. Well the doctor told him, ""only one pill a day, and I'll call you at the end of the week."" So the doctor calls at the end of the week and asks how well the pills are working. The man replies, ""Oh their great! I haven't had sex like this for 10 years!"" The doctor tells him to ""keep it up, and remember... only ONE pill a day."" The wife found out however and started slipping him an extra pill each day without him knowing. So when the doctor called and asked how everything was holding up the man replied, ""I'm addicted! I haven't had sex like this since I was 16!"" Now the doctor was kind of suspicious but just let it go and decided to call him at the end of next week. Meanwhile, the greedy wife (who was loving it) started giving him 3 doses of xtra strength viagra a day. The doctor called at the same time next week, but this time a little boy answered the phone. ""Are your parents there?"" the doctor asked. ""Well... they are but there locked in their room and won't come out."" The boy answered. ""Ok.. I'll call back in 3 hours."" The doctor promised; but when he called back the boy answered the phone again. ""You just missed them... they came down and got a drink and ran right back upstairs."" The boy informed him. ""Listen I'll be there in 5 minutes!"" The doctor by this time had a pretty good idea what was going on and rushed over there as fast as he could; but being unreliable, he got there an hour later. When he knocked on the door the little boy answered the door. In desperation the doctor asked where the boy's parents were. The boy took a deep breath and said, ""Mom's dead, sister's pregnant, my butt hurts, and dad's looking for the cat.""</p>

49366,"<p>The pet store was selling them for five cents a piece. I thought this was odd since they were normally a couple thousand. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth so I bought 200 of them. I like monkeys.</p>
<p>I took my 200 monkeys home. I have a big car. I let one of drive. His name was Sigmund. He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in the genitals. I laughed. They punched me in the genitals. I stopped laughing.</p>
<p>I herded them into my room. They didn't adapt very well to their new environment. They would screech and hurl themselves off the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall. Although humorous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into it's third hour.</p>
<p>Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive; they all died. No apparent reason. They all just sort of dropped dead. Kinda like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later. Goddamn cheap monkeys.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my room; on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase. It looked like I had 200 throw rugs. I tried to flush one down the toilet. It didn't work. It got stuck. Then I had one dead, wet monkey and one hundred ninety-nine dead, dry monkeys.</p>
<p>I tried to pretend that they were just stuffed animals. That worked for awhile, that is until they began to decompose. It started to smell real bad. I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in my toilet and I didn't want to call a plumber. I was embarrassed.</p>
<p>I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them. Unfortuantely there was only enough room for two at a time, so I had to change them every 30 seconds.  I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't go bad. I tried to burn them, but little did I know that my bed was flammable. I had to extinguish the fire.</p>
<p>Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and one hundred ninety-seven dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed,  The odor wasn't improving.</p>
<p>I became agitated at my inability to dispose of the dead monkeys and I really had to use the bathroom. So I went and severely beat one of the monkeys. I felt better.</p>
<p>I tried throwing them away but the garbage man said the city was not allowed to dispose of charred primates. I told him I had a wet one. He couldn't take it either. I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.</p>
<p>I finally arrived at a solution. I gave them out as Christmas gifts. My friends didn't quite know what to say. They pretended to like them, but I could tell they were lying. Ingrates. So I punched them in the genitals.</p>
<p>I like monkeys.</p>

"
49375,"<p>Dear Son,<br /> Just a few lines to let you know that I'm still alive. I'm<br /> writing this letter slowly because I know that you can't read<br /> fast. You won't know the house when you get home because we've<br /> moved.</p>
<p>About your father. He has a lovely new job. He has 500 men under<br /> him; he cuts the grass at the cemetery. There was a washing<br /> machine in the new house when we moved in but it hasn't been<br /> working too good. Last week I put your father's shirt in, pulled<br /> the chain and haven't seen it since.</p>
<p>Your sister Mary had a baby this morning but I don't know if it<br /> is a boy or a girl yet so I can't tell you if you are an uncle<br /> or an auntie. Your Uncle Patrick drowned last week in a vat of<br /> whiskey at the Dublin Brewery. Some of his workmates tried to<br /> save him but he fought them off bravely. They cremated him and<br /> it took 5 days to put out the fire.</p>
<p>I went to the doctor last Thursday and your father came with me.<br /> The doctor put a small glass tube in my mouth and told me not to<br /> talk for 10 minutes. Your father offered to buy it off him.</p>
<p>It rained last twice this week. First for 3 days then for 4. We<br /> got a letter from the undertaker. He said that if the last<br /> payment on your grandfathers plot isn't paid within 7 days, then<br /> up he comes.</p>
<p>-Your loving mother<br /> PS. I was going to send you 10 dollars but I had already sealed<br /> the envelope.</p>

49377,"<p>DAY 752 - My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from shredding the occasional piece of furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant and cough it up on the carpeting.<br /> DAY 761 - Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded, must try this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite chair... must try this on their bed (again). </p>
<p>DAY 762 - Slept all day so that I could annoy my captors with sleep depriving, incessant pleas for food at ungodly hours of the night. </p>
<p>DAY 765 - Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body, in attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was ... Hmmm. Not working according to plan . </p>
<p>DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. This time however it included a burning foamy chemical called ""shampoo."" What sick minds could invent such a liquid? My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth and the tiny bit of flesh under my claws. </p>
<p>DAY 771 - There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event. However, I could hear the noise and smell the foul odor of the glass tubes they call ""beer."" More importantly I overheard that my confinement was due to MY power of ""allergies."" Must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage. </p>
<p>DAY 774 - I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe snitches. The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return. He is obviously a half-wit. The Bird on the other hand has got to be an informant. He has mastered their frightful tongue (something akin to mole speak) and speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal room his safety is assured. But I can wait, it is only a matter of time.</p>

<p>""How much do you want for the mower?"" asked the preacher. </p>
<p>""I'm just trying to make enough money to buy a bicycle,"" said<br /> the little boy. </p>

<p>The boy said, ""You got a deal."" </p>
<p>The preacher took the mower and tried to crank it. He pulled on<br /> the string a few times with no response from the mower. </p>
<p>The preacher called the little boy over and said, ""I can't get<br /> this mower to start."" </p>
<p>The little boy said, ""That's 'cause you have to cuss at it to<br /> get it started."" </p>
<p>The preacher said, ""I'm a minister, and I can't cuss. It's been<br /> so long since I've been saved that I don't know if I even<br /> remember how to cuss."" </p>
<p>The little boy looked at him happily and said, ""Just keep<br /> pulling on that string. It'll come back to ya!""</p>

Then Grandpa got up, went to the TV, placed his right hand on the set and his left hand on his crotch. Grandma scowled at him and said, ""I guess you just don't get it.

There<br /> were inappropriate extramarital relationships, but you can't<br /> call it 'adultery' because I didn't have full 'sexual<br /> relations.'

Finally, he takes Bill to a tiny room in which there is a beautiful young blonde with an alluring look on her face, sitting at a table on which there is a bottle of the finest wine. To Bill's delight, he sees a PC in the corner. Without hesitation, Bill says 'I'll take this option.' 'Fine,' says Satan, allowing Bill to enter the room.

49430,"<p>A contest was held for people to submit their theories on any subject.  4th RUNNER-UP:  If an infinite number of rednecks riding in an infinite number of pickup trucks fire an infinite number of shotgun rounds at an  infinite number of highway signs, they will eventually produce all the  world's great literary works in Braille.3rd RUNNER-UP:  Why Yawning Is Contagious:  You yawn to equalize  the pressure on your eardrums.  This pressure change outside your  eardrums unbalances other people's ear pressures, so they then yawn to  even it out.2nd RUNNER-UP:  Communist China is technologically underdeveloped  because they have no alphabet and therefore cannot use acronyms to  communicate technical ideas at a faster rate.    1st RUNNER-UP:  The earth may spin faster on its axis due to  deforestation.  Just as a figure skater's rate of spin increases when the arms are brought in close to the body, the cutting of tall trees may  cause our  planet to spin dangerously fast.HONORABLE MENTION:  The quantity of consonants in the English  language is constant.  If omitted in one place, they turn up in  another.  When a Bostonian 'pahks his cah,' the lost R's migrate  southwest, causing a Texan to 'warsh' his car and invest in 'erl' wells.GRAND PRIZE WINNER:  When a cat is dropped, it always lands on its feet,  and when toast is dropped, it always lands with the buttered side facing  down. I propose to strap buttered toast to the back of a cat; the two  will hover, spinning inches above the ground.  With a giant buttered cat  array, a high-speed monorail could easily link New York with Chicago.</p>

So he asked her, What's the matter, baby?'   Pinnochio's girlfriend gave a big sigh and replied, 'You're probably the best guy I've ever met -- but every time we make love, you give me splinters.'   This remark bothered Pinnochio a great deal, so the next day he went to seek some advice form his creator, Gepetto. When Pinnochio arrived, he could tell something was bothering Pinnochio, and asked him what was the matter. As Pinnochio revealed his dilemma, Gepetto searched up and down for a solution. Eventually, he suggested that sandpaper might be able to 'smooth' out Pinnochio's relationship with his girlfriend. Pinnochio graciously thanked Gepetto and went on his way.   Gepetto had not heard from Pinnochio for a while and therefore assumed that the sandpaper had solved all of Pinnochio's problems.   A couple weeks later, Gepetto was in town to have some blades sharpened at the hardware store when he ran into Pinnochio. When he saw Pinnochio buying all the packs of sandpaper the store had in stock, Gepetto remarked, 'So Pinnochio, things must be going pretty damn good with the girls'.

""Mister, it's caused by loose living, being with cheap, wicked women, too much alcohol and a contempt for your fellow man."" ""Well I'll be."" the drunk muttered, returning to his paper. The priest, thinking about what he had said, nudged the man and apologized. ""I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to come on so strong. How long did you have arthritis?"" ""I don't have it father.

49451,"<p>Men's Rules for Women </p>
<p>* If we say something that can be interpreted in two ways, and one of those ways makes you sad or angry... we meant it the other way. </p>
<p>* Department stores and malls were purposely designed so that when you want to look at bed linens, shower curtains or handbags, speakers, tires or sporting equipment are always nearby. </p>
<p>* We don't know ANYTHING about handbags. Please, don't even ask. </p>
<p>* We DID water the plants. They died anyway. Nobody knows why... </p>
<p>* Silence does not always need to be filled with discussions about ""us"" and ""the relationship."" </p>
<p>* It is in neither your best interest or ours to take those stupid magazine quizzes together. </p>
<p>* Actually, you probably don't want to know what we're thinking. </p>
<p>* Good things for you to help us with: the Sunday crossword puzzle, yard work, the dishes, cleaning, and grocery shopping. </p>
<p>* Things you should let us do alone: figuring out where we are, watching ESPN, playing cards, and home repair. </p>
<p>* Christopher Columbus didn't need directions and neither do we. </p>
<p>* Curley is the bald one. </p>
<p>* Unless you are willing to follow the careers of Cal Ripken, Michael Jordan, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, don't expect us to know what Helen Gurley Brown, Hilary Clinton, Kathy Lee Gifford or Suzanne Summers are up to. </p>
<p>* Socks never constitute a gift. </p>
<p>* Dinner out is a pretty good birthday present. Two tickets to a ball game are even better. </p>
<p>* Two hot dogs and a drink at a baseball game do, in fact, constitute going out to dinner. </p>
<p>* Anything we said six or eight months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments become null and void after seven days. </p>
<p>* You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done - not both! </p>
<p>* Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials or time-outs. </p>
<p>* When we're turning the wheel and the car is nosing onto the off ramp, your saying ""This is our exit"" is not necessary. </p>
<p>* No, you can't have the remote control.</p>

<p>3. If they say they're John Doe from XYZ Company, ask them to spell their<br /> name. Then ask them to spell the company name.

<p>8. If the company cleans rugs, respond: ""Can you get out blood? Can you get<br /> out goat blood? How about human blood?""</p>
<p>9. After the Telemarketer gives his or her spiel, ask him or her to marry you.<br /> When they get all flustered, tell them that you can't just give your credit card<br /> number to a complete stranger.</p>
<p>10. Tell the Telemarketer that you work for the same company, and they can't<br /> sell to employees.</p>
<p>11. Answer the phone. As soon as you realize it is a Telemarketer, set the<br /> receiver down, scream, ""Oh my God!"" and then hang up.</p>
<p>12. Tell the Telemarketer you are busy at the moment and ask him/her if he/she<br /> will give you his/her home phone number so you can call him/her back. When the<br /> Telemarketer explains that telemarketers cannot give out their home numbers say,<br /> ""I guess you don't want anyone bothering you at home, right?"" The Telemarketer<br /> will agree and you say, ""Me either!"" Hang up.</p>
<p>13. Ask them to repeat everything they say, several times.</p>
<p>14. Tell them it is dinner time, but ask if they would please hold. Put them<br /> on your speaker phone while you continue to eat at your leisure. Smack your food<br /> loudly and continue with your dinner conversation.</p>
<p>15. Tell the Telemarketer you are on ""home incarceration"" and ask if they<br /> could bring you some beer.</p>
<p>16. Ask them to fax the information to you, and make up a number.</p>
<p>17. Tell the Telemarketer, ""Okay, I'll listen to you. But I should probably<br /> tell you, I'm not wearing any clothes.""</p>
<p>18. Insist that the caller is really your buddy Leon, playing a joke. ""Come<br /> on, Leon, cut it out! Seriously, Leon, how's your momma?""</p>

49465,"<p>Bill Gates tragically died in a car accident. Arriving at the pearly gates, he finds himself being sized up by St. Peter.</p>
<p>""Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell.  After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows XP.  I'm going to do something I've never done before . . .  I'm going to let you decide where you want to go.""</p>
<p>""So what's the difference between the two?"" Bill asked.  St. Peter said, ""I could let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision.""</p>
<p>""Fine!  Where should I go first?"" ""You decide."" ""Okay then,"" said Bill, ""Let's try Hell first.""</p>
<p>So Bill Gates went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of bikini-clad women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun was shining; the temperature perfect. He was very pleased.</p>
<p>""This is great!"" he told St. Peter. ""If this is Hell, I'd REALLY like to see Heaven!""</p>
<p>""Fine,"" said St. Peter, and off they went. Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was nice, but nothing like Hell. It didn't take long for Bill to reach his decision.</p>
<p>""I think I prefer Hell,"" he told St. Peter.  So Bill Gates went to Hell.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, St. Peter decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall, screaming among hot flames in a dark cave, being burned and tortured by demons.</p>
<p>""How's everything going?"" he asked Bill Gates. His voice filled with anguish and disappointment, Bill responded, ""This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the beautiful beaches, the scantily-clad women playing in the water?""</p>

49466,"<p>Birth Of A HamsterI had to take my son's hamster to the vet. Here's what happened:Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was something wrong with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room.He's just lying there looking sick he told me.Oldest trick in the book I informed him You go in to see what's wrong with the               sick one and the other one sneaks up behind you and bonks you on the head. Then they change into your clothes and escape.I'm serious, Dad.  Can you help?I put a hamster-healer expression on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking distressed. I immediately knew what to do. Honey, I called, come look at the hamster!Oh, my gosh, my wife diagnosed after a minute. She's having babies  What? my son demanded. But their names are Bert and Ernie! I was equally outraged. Hey, how can that be? I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce, I accused my wife. Well, what did you want me to do, post a sign in their cage? she inquired             sarcastically.No, but you were supposed to get two boys! I reminded her.Yeah, Bert and Ernie! my son agreed.Well, it was a little hard to tell, she informed me.By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience, I              announced. We're about to witness the miracle of birth.Gross! they shrieked.Great; what are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?              my wife wanted to know.Well, when my parents' dog had puppies, I took them up to the grocery store in a cardboard box and gave them away, I recalled.So what are you going to do, go up with a pair of tweezers so people can pick out their hamster? she asked. We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot           would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. We don't appear to be              making much progress, I noted.A breech birth, my wife whispered, horrified.Do something, Dad! my son urged.Okay, okay. Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gingerly tug. It disappeared. I tried again, with the same              results.Should I dial 911? my daughter wanted to know. Maybe they could talk us through it.Let's get Ernie to the vet, I said grimly. We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap.  Breathe, Ernie, breathe, he urged. I don't think hamsters do Lamaze, I told him.The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at  the little animal through a magnifying glass. What do you think, Doc, an epidural? I suggested              scientifically.Oh, very interesting, he murmured. Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you              privately for a moment?I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside. Is Ernie going to be okay? my wife asked.Oh, perfectly, the vet assured us. This hamster is not in labor. In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen....Ernie is a boy. What? You see, Ernie is a young male. And occasionally, as they come into maturity, male hamsters will, ah... He blushed, glancing at my wife. Well, you know what              I'm saying, Mr. Cameron.  We were silent, absorbing this. So Ernie's  just...just... Excited?   my wife offered.Exactly, the vet replied, relieved that we understood.More silence. Then my wife started to giggle. What's so funny? I demanded.Tears were now running down her face. Just...that...I'm picturing you pulling on              its...its... she gasped.That's enough, I warned.  We thanked the veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be              okay.I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad, he told me.Oh, you have no idea, my wife agreed, collapsing into laughter as I gave her a dirty look.Copyright 1999 W.

49467,"<p>A large, well established, Canadian lumber camp advertised that they were looking for a good lumberjack. The very next day, a skinny little man showed up at the camp with his axe, and knocked on the head lumberjacks' door. The head lumberjack took one look at the little man and told him to leave. ""Just give me a chance to show you what I can do,"" said the skinny man. ""Okay, see that giant redwood over there?"" said the lumberjack. ""Take your axe and go cut it down."" The skinny man headed for the tree, and in five minutes he was back knocking on the lumberjack's door. ""I cut the tree down,"" said the man. The lumberjack couldn't believe his eyes and said, ""Where did you get the skill to chop down trees like that?"" ""In the Sahara Forest,"" replied the puny man. ""You mean the Sahara Desert,"" said the lumberjack. The little man laughed and answered back, ""Oh sure, that's what they call it now!""</p>

<p>The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and complications from repeated pokes in the belly.</p>
<p>He was 71.</p>
<p>Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin.</p>
<p>Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Buttersworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch.</p>
<p>The gravesite was piled high with flours. Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded.</p>
<p>Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers.</p>
<p>He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes.</p>
<p>Despite being a little flaky at times he still, as a crusty old man, was considered a roll model for millions.</p>
<p>Doughboy is survived by his wife, Play Dough; two children, John Dough and Jane Dough; plus they had one in the oven.</p>
<p>He is also survived by his elderly dad, Pop Tart.</p>
<p>The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.</p>

The woman asked why he would put a knot, and the doctor said that it was so if her face felt a little droopy, when she twisted it to the right, it would tighten the skin on her face. The woman decided to get the surgery done.The doctor told her to come back in four months so he could check up on how she was doing.

49519,"<p>You thought you had a bad day at the office.... </p>
<p>A true story... </p>
<p>A professional scuba diver's letter to his sister... </p>
<p>April, 1998 </p>
<p>Hi Sue, Just another note from your bottom dwelling brother. Last week I had a bad day at the office. Before I can tell you what happened to me, I first must bore you with a few technicalities of my job. As you know my office lies at the bottom of the sea. I wear a suit to the office. It's a wetsuit. This time of year the water is quite cool. So what we do to keep warm is this: We have a diesel powered industrial water heater. </p>
<p>This $20,000 piece of shit sucks the water out of the sea. It heats it to a delightful temp. It then pumps it down to the diver through a garden hose which is taped to the air hose. Now this sounds like a damn good plan, and I've used it several times with no complaints. What I do, when I get to the bottom and start working, is I take the hose and stuff it down the back of my neck. This floods my whole suit with warm water. It's like working in a jacuzzi. </p>
<p>Everything was going well until all of a sudden, my ass started to itch. So, of course, I scratched it. This only made things worse. Within a few seconds my ass started to burn. I pulled the hose out from my back, but the damage was done. In agony I realized what had happened to me. </p>
<p>The hot water machine had sucked up a jellyfish and pumped it into my suit. This is even worse than the poison ivy you once had under a cast. Now I had that hose down my back. I don't have any hair on my back, so the jellyfish couldn't get stuck to my back. My ass crack was not as fortunate. </p>
<p>When I scratched what I thought was an itch, I was actually grinding the jellyfish into my ass. I informed the dive supervisor of my dilemma over the comms. His instructions were unclear due to the fact that he along with 5 other divers were laughing hysterically. Needless to say I aborted the dive. I was instructed to make 3 agonizing water stops totaling 35 minutes before I could come to the surface.</p>
<p>I got to the surface wearing nothing but my brass helmet. My suit and gear were tied to the bell. When I got on board the medic, with tears of laughter running down his face, handed me a tube of cream and told me to shove it up my ass when I get in the chamber. The cream put the fire out, but I couldn't shit for two days because my asshole was swollen shut. I later found out that this could easily have been prevented if the suction hose was placed on the leeward side of the ship. </p>
<p>Anyway, the next time you have a bad day at the office, think of me. I hope you have no bad days at the office. But if you do, I hope that thought will make it a little more tolerable. Take care, and I hope to hear from you soon. </p>
<p>Love, Brian</p>

The bartender hands him the drink, and says ""That'll be five dollars,"" to which the guy replies, ""What are you talking about? I don't owe you anything for this.""A lawyer, sitting nearby and overhearing the conversation, then says to the bartender, ""You know, he's got you there. In the original offer, which constitutes a binding contract upon acceptance, there was no stipulation of remuneration.""The bartender was not impressed, but says to the guy, ""Okay, you beat me for a drink. But don't ever let me catch you in here again.""The next day, same guy walks into the bar. Bartender says, ""What the heck are you doing in here? I can't believe you've got the audacity to come back!"" The guy says, ""What are you talking about? I've never been in this place in my life!""

Well anyways the farmer had a couple cows that he wanted to breed, and he went down to his neighbor farmer to ask to borrow a bull for a day. The neighbor farmer said yes, and the impotant farmer loaded the bull into the box of his pickup. When he got back home he put the bull in with the lady cows. The lady cows were sure interested in the bull, but the bull would not go near them for some odd reason. The impotent farmer went back to his neighbors and asked why the bull wouldn't screw his cows. The other farmer said ""Oh sorry bout dat he gets like that sometimes, what you otta do is stick your finger there in one uh yah lady cows pussy's and rub it on his nose.""The impotent farmer went home and tried it on the bull, and sure enough the bull got all three cows and went back for more about five minutes later. The impotent farmer was totally shocked. He went home that night after a hard days work in the field, and climbed into bed. His wife was asleep next to him and he got an idea. He figured if it worked on the cow it might work on him. So he pulled down his sleeping wife's panties and stuck his finger down there and rubbed it on his nose. Sure enough he was hard in an instant. The farmer was so happy about this he just had to show his wife.""Honey wake up honey, turn on the light and take a look at this.""His wife wakes up turns on the light and says ""You woke me up just to show me you had a bloody nose.""</p>

49560,"<p>New Policy on Twelve Days </p>
<p>Effective immediately, the following economizing measures are being implemented in the ''Twelve Days of Christmas'' subsidiary: </p>
<p>The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree, which never produced the cash crop forecasted, will be replaced by a plastic hanging plant, providing considerable savings in maintenance </p>
<p>Two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not cost effective. In addition, their romance during working hours could not be condoned. The positions are, therefore, eliminated </p>
<p>The three French hens will remain intact. After all, everyone loves the French </p>
<p>The four calling birds will be replaced by an automated voice mail system, with a call waiting option. An analysis is underway to determine who the birds have been calling, how often and how long they talked. </p>
<p>The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of Directors. Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could have negative implications for institutional investors. Diversification into other precious metals, as well as a mix of T-Bills and high technology stocks, appear to be in order </p>
<p>The six geese-a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer be afforded. It has long been felt that the production rate of one egg per goose per day was an example of the general decline in productivity. Three geese will be let go, and an upgrading in the selection procedure by personnel will assure management that, from now on, every goose it gets will be a good one </p>
<p>The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in better times. The function is primarily decorative. Mechanical swans are on order. The current swans will be retrained to learn some new strokes, thereby enhancing their outplacement </p>
<p>As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under heavy scrutiny by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the workforce is being sought. The more militant maids consider this a dead-end job with no upward mobility. Automation of the process may permit the maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring or a-mulching </p>
<p>Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number. This function will be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no longer do the steps </p>
<p>Ten Lords-a-leaping is overkill. The high cost of Lords, plus the expense of international air travel, prompted the Compensation Committee to suggest replacing this group with ten out-of-work congressmen.

49561,"<p>In a kingdom far far away, and a long long time ago, a party was being given.  To this party the king had invited everyone in the kingdom to his castle.  And everyone was having a grand time.  The wine was flowing, the tables were overflowing with food, and the dancing was beautiful.Suddenly, out of thin air a gnarled old man appeared out of thin air.  His hands clutched in tight fists by his body, smoke streaming from his shoulders, he walked up to the king and said, ""How dare you have a party and not invite your own court wizard!  For this insult I curse this castle with the dreaded Curse of the Fingers.   Anyone who attempts to leave here will be rendered limb from limb by huge disembodied fingers!""The wizard waved his bony arms about and shouted in a guttural foreign language.  ""There!"", he said and vanished.All at once, the people of the kingdom looked to their king. What would he do?  How could he save them.  The king pursed his lips and looked about him.  Finally, he turned to his knights and asked for a volunteer to ride to the next kingdom and plead with their wizard to remove the curse.  Of course all of the knights wished to go.  The king selected the knight with the greatest seniority and sent him on his way.The knight gathered up all his weapons, put on his best suit of armour and headed out.  As soon as his foot stepped off of the drawbridge,  gigantic yellow fingers appeared from nowhere and ripped him limb from limb.One after another, each knight attempted to ride out of the castle, each one in turn was ripped to shreds.  Finally, no knights were left.The king looked about him.  ""Is there anyone else who would brave this curse and rescue us from this horrible curse?"", he said.""I will, sir!"", said a small boy who had been serving one of the knights before he died.The small boy packed up his belongings and provisions for the journey.  Since he was a poor serving boy, and had no horse, he knew he would have to walk.  But he was determined to succeed. As soon as he crossed the drawbridge, the yellow fingers appeared and tried to rip him apart.  They couldn't!  Each time the tried to grab him, the boy wriggled free and continued on his journey!Several days later, the boy was back at the castle with the neighbouring kingdom's wizard.  The king was overjoyed to have the curse lifted and he called the boy to him.  ""How did you escape from those monstrous fingers?  All my knights couldn't get past them and they were killed.  How could you do it?""The boy looked up at the king and replied, ""Your majesty, it occurred to me as the last knight was being killed that the only way to escape this curse was to LET YOUR PAIGES DO THE WALKING THROUGH THE YELLOW FINGERS.""</p>

Upon arrival, they were brought to see him.First, President Bush went to see the Wizard and said, ""Everyone says I have no compassion or feelings, I wish to have a Heart"". So the Wizard said, ""So be it"".Second was Dan Quayle. He told the Wizard, ""People think I'm unintelligent and have no common sense whatsoever. I want a brain. The Wizard said, ""So be it"". Third to ask the Wizard was Ross Perot. ""People say I have no confidence, and I lack conviction. I wish to have some courage"". The Wizard granted this wish as well.And then Bill Clinton approached the Wizard. The Wizard looked at him and said, ""Well, what do you want?"" To which Clinton replied, ""I'm here for Dorothy!""</p>

<p>Getting married is very much like going to a restaurant with friends. You order what you want, then when you see what the other fellow has, you wish you had ordered that.</p>
<p>At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, ""Aren't you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger?"" The other replied, ""Yes I am, I married the wrong man.""</p>
<p>Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he's finished. Marriage is an institution in which a man loses his bachelor's degree and the woman gets her master's.</p>
<p>A little boy asked his father, ""Daddy, how much does it cost to get married?"" And the father replied, ""I don't know, son, I'm still paying.""</p>
<p>Young Son: Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her? Dad: That happens in every country, son.</p>
<p>Then there was a man who said, ""I never knew what real happiness was until I got married; and then it was too late.""</p>
<p>Married life is frustrating. The first year of marriage, the man speaks And the woman listens. In the second year, the woman speaks and the man listens. In the third year, they both speak and the neighbors listen.</p>
<p>After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband, ""You know, I was a fool when I married you."" The husband replied, ""Yes, dear, but I was in love and didn't notice.""</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how often a married man changes his job, he still ends Up with the same boss.</p>

<p>And for everyone that's still single, some notes on marriage...<br /> ...Marriage is a three ring circus: engagement ring, wedding ring, and suffering.<br /> ...Marriage is an institution, but who wants to live in an institution?<br /> ...Marriage is bliss. Ignorance is bliss.<br /> ...Marriage is not a word; it is a sentence.<br /> ...Marriage is the only sport in which the trapped animal has to buy the license.<br /> ...Marriage still confers one very special privilege, only a married person can get divorced!</p>

At this time we will explore a number of light bulb traditions,   including incandescent, fluorescent, three-way, long-life, and   tinted, all of which are equally valid    paths to luminescence.   Methodists: Undetermined. Whether your light bulb is bright,   dull, or completely out, you are loved. You can be a light bulb,   a turnip bulb, or a tulip bulb. Church wide lighting service is   planned for Sunday, August 19. Bring bulb of your choice and a   covered dish.   Nazarene: One woman to replace the bulb while five men   review church lighting policy.   Lutherans: None. Lutherans don't believe in change.   Amish: What's a light bulb?</p>

<p>""Easiest thing in the world, Homer"" said the doctor. ""You take your rifle out with you every day don't you? Well, when you feel like you're in the mood for some lovin', just fire a shot into the air as a signal to your wife, for her to come out to you. That way you won't lose any workin' time."" </p>
<p>Homer tried his friend's solution and it seemed to work pretty well for a while. One day though, the doctor stopped by the house to pay a visit and he noticed Homer sitting alone inside looking very somber. </p>
<p>""What's wrong?"" he asked. ""Didn't my idea work? Where's your wife?"" </p>
<p>""Oh, it worked"" says Homer. ""Whenever I got in the mood I fired off a shot like you said, and Beckie'd come runnin'. Then we'd find a secluded place and make love. Then Beckie'd go back home."" </p>
<p>""So what's the problem?"" </p>
<p>""Well I think I overdid it, Doc. I ain't seen hide nor hair of Beckie since hunting season got started...""</p>

The doctor asked<br /> her what had<br /> happened to her ears and she answered, ""I was ironing a shirt and the<br /> phone<br /> rang - but instead of picking up the phone I accidentally picked up the<br /> iron<br /> and stuck it to my ear.""<br />  ""Oh Dear!"" the doctor exclaimed in disbelief.  ""But what happened<br /> to your<br /> other ear?""<br />  ""The son of a bitch called back!""</p>

<p>Reader: My husband-to-be ,still pines for his old girlfriends. I'm afraid he will not be faithful. </p>
<p>Jim: A man's capacity to love is boundless, it has been proven to increase with the number of sexual partners. Thus, by having a few other women, your partner is really increasing his love for you. Best thing to do is to buy him a nice. expensive present, and cook him a nice meal and don't mention this aspect of has behavior.</p>
<p>Reader: My husband has too many nights out with the boys. </p>
<p>Jim: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. Far from being pleasurable, a night out with the boys is a stressful affair and to get back to you is a relief for your partner. Just look back at how emotional and happy the man is when he returns to his stable home. Best thing to do is to buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal and don't mention this aspect of his behavior.</p>
<p>Reader: My husband wants to experience three-in-a-bed-sex with me and my sister. </p>
<p>Jim: Your husband is clearly devoted to you. He cannot get enough of you, so he goes for the next best thing - your sister. Far from being an issue, this will bring all of the family together. Why not get mum involved? If you are still apprehensive, then let him go with your relatives, buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal and don't mention this aspect of his behavior.</p>
<p>Reader: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex with him. </p>
<p>Jim: Do it. Sperm is not only great tasting, but with only 10 calories a spoonful it is nutritious and helps you to keep tour figure and gives a great glow to the skin. Interestingly, a man knows this. His offer to you to perform oral sex with him is totally selfless. Oral sex is extremely painful for a man. This shows he loves you. Best thing to do is to thank him, buy him a nice, expensive present and cook him a nice meal.</p>
<p>Reader: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is. </p>
<p>Jim: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with it, do it in your own time. To help with the family budget, you may wish to video yourself while doing this and to sell it at a car boot sale. To ease your selfish guilt, buy your man a nice, expensive present and cook a delicious meal.</p>

49614,"<p>A blonde, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire herself<br /> out as a handyman-type and started canvassing a wealthy<br /> neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house and<br /> asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do. ""Well, you can<br /> paint my porch. How much will you charge?""</p>
<p>The blonde said ""How about 50 dollars?"" The man agreed and told<br /> her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the<br /> garage. The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation<br /> and said to her husband, ""Does she realize that the porch goes<br /> all the way around the house?""</p>
<p>The man replied, ""She should. She was standing on the porch.""</p>
<p>A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her<br /> money.</p>
<p>""You're finished already?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" the blonde answered,<br /> ""and I had paint left over, so I gave it two coats. ""Impressed,<br /> the man reached in his pocket for the $50. ""And by the way,"" the<br /> blonde added, ""that's not a Porch, it's a Ferrari.""</p>

"
49616,"<p>What does your profession say about you?</p>
<p>1. MARKETING - You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to<br /> avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and<br /> socializing which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least<br /> compatible with Sales.</p>
<p>2. SALES - Laziest of all signs, often referred to as ""marketing without a<br /> degree."" You are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and<br /> begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with customers so you<br /> can ""concentrate on the big picture."" You seek admiration for your golf game<br /> throughout your life.</p>
<p>3. TECHNOLOGY - Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are<br /> instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace.<br /> Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying but who the hell can tell.<br /> It is written that Geeks shall inherit the Earth.</p>
<p>4. ENGINEERING - One of only two signs that actually studied in school. It is<br /> said that ninety percent of all Personal Ads are placed by engineers. You can be<br /> happy with yourself; your office is full of all the latest ""ergo dynamic""<br /> gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your ""carpal tunnel<br /> syndrome.""</p>
<p>5. ACCOUNTING - The only other sign that studied in school. You<br /> are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the<br /> organization; combined with your extreme organizational traits, the majority of<br /> rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane.</p>
<p>6. HUMAN RESOURCES - Ironically, given your access to confidential<br /> information, you tend to be the biggest gossip within the organization. Possibly<br /> the only other person that does less work than marketing, you are unable to<br /> return any calls today because you have to get a haircut, have lunch AND then<br /> mail a letter.</p>
<p>7. MANAGEMENT/MIDDLE MANAGEMENT - Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless,<br /> you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable<br /> to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of<br /> meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other ""Middle<br /> Managers"" as everyone in you social circle is a ""Middle Manager.""</p>
<p>8. SENIOR MANAGEMENT - (See above - Same sign, different title)</p>
<p>9. CUSTOMER SERVICE - Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride<br /> from taking your own life. As children very few of you asked your parents for a<br /> little cubicle for your room and a headset so you could pretend to play<br /> ""Customer Service."" Continually passed over for promotions, your best bet is to<br /> sleep with your manager.</p>
<p>10. CONSULTANT - Lacking any specific knowledge, you use acronyms to avoid<br /> revealing your utter lack of experience. You have convinced yourself that your<br /> ""skills"" are in demand and that you could get a higher paying job with any other<br /> organization in a heartbeat. You will spend an eternity contemplating these<br /> career opportunities without ever taking direct action.</p>
<p>11. RECRUITER, ""HEADHUNTER"" - As a ""person"" that profits from the success of<br /> others, you are disdained by most people who actually work for a living. Paid on<br /> commission and susceptible to alcoholism, your ulcers and frequent heart attacks<br /> correspond directly with fluctuations in the stock market.</p>
<p>12. PARTNER, PRESIDENT, CEO - You are brilliant or lucky. Your inability to<br /> figure out complex systems such as the fax machine suggest the latter.</p>
<p>13. GOVERNMENT WORKER - Paid to take days off. Government workers are genius<br /> inventors, like the invention of new Holidays. They usually suffer from deep<br /> depression or anxiety and usually commit serious crimes while on the job... Thus<br /> the term ""GO POSTAL""</p>

49633,"<p>The exasperated help-line caller said she couldn't get her new<br /> Dell computer to turn on. John Dower, a Dell Computer Corp.<br /> technician, made sure the computer was plugged in and then asked<br /> the woman what happened when she pushed the power button. ""I've<br /> pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens,"" the<br /> woman replied. ""Foot pedal?"" the technician asked. ""Yes,"" the<br /> woman said, ""this little white foot pedal with the on switch.""<br /> The ""foot pedal,"" it turned out, was the computer's mouse, a<br /> hand-operated device that helps to control the computer's<br /> operations.</p>
<p>One woman called Dell's toll-free line to ask how to install<br /> batteries in her laptop. When told that the directions were on<br /> the first page of the manual, says Steve Smith, Dell director of<br /> technical support, the woman replied angrily, ""I just paid<br /> $2,000 for this !@#? thing, and I'm not going to read a book.""</p>
<p>Compaq's help center in Houston, Texas, is inundated by some<br /> 8,000 consumer calls a day, with inquiries like this one related<br /> by technician John Wolf: ""A frustrated customer called, who said<br /> her brand new Contura would not work. She said she had unpacked<br /> the unit, plugged it in, opened it up and sat there for 20<br /> minutes waiting for something to happen. When asked what<br /> happened when she pressed the power switch, she asked, 'What<br /> power switch?'""</p>
<p>Seemingly simple computer features baffle some users. So many<br /> people have called to ask where the ""any"" key is when ""Press Any<br /> Key"" flashes on the screen that Compaq is considering changing<br /> the command to ""Press Return Key.""</p>
<p>Some people can't figure out the mouse. Tamra Eagle, an AST<br /> technical support supervisor, says one customer complained that<br /> her mouse was hard to control with the ""dust cover"" on. The<br /> cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged<br /> in. Dell technician Wayne Zieschang says one of his customers<br /> held the mouse and pointed it at the screen, all the while<br /> clicking madly.</p>
<p>Disk drives are another bugaboo. One customer was having trouble<br /> reading word-processing files from his old diskettes. After<br /> troubleshooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the<br /> problem, Mr. Sullivan asked what else was being done with the<br /> diskette. The customer's response: ""I put a label on the<br /> diskette, roll it into the typewriter...""</p>
<p>At AST, another customer dutifully complied with a technician's<br /> request that she send in a copy of a defective floppy disk. A<br /> letter from the customer arrived a few days later, along with a<br /> Xerox copy of the floppy.</p>
<p>At Dell, a technician advised his customer to put his troubled<br /> floppy back in the drive and ""close the door."" Asking the<br /> technician to ""hold on,"" the customer put the phone down and was<br /> heard walking over to shut the door to his room.</p>
<p>The software inside the computer can be equally befuddling. A<br /> Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax<br /> anything. After 40 minutes of troubleshooting, the technician<br /> discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding<br /> it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the ""send"" key.</p>
<p>Another customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer<br /> worked. He had cleaned it, he said, filling up his tub with soap<br /> and water and soaking his keyboard for a day, and then removing<br /> all the keys and washing them individually.</p>

49642,"<p>A Duke was hunting in the forest with his men-at-arms and servants when he came across a tree. Upon it, archery targets were painted and smack in the middle of each was an arrow. </p>
<p>""Who is this incredibly fine archer?"" cried the duke. ""I must find him!"" </p>
<p>After continuing through the forest for a few miles he came across a small boy carrying a bow and arrow. Eventually the boy admitted that it was he who shot the arrows plumb in the center of all the targets. </p>
<p>""You didn't just walk up to the targets and hammer the arrows into the<br /> middle, did you?"" asked the duke worriedly. </p>

49647,"<p>There was a huge nut tree by the cemetery fence. One day, two boys filled up a<br /> bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the<br /> nuts. ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me,"" said one boy. The<br /> bucket was so full, several rolled out towards the fence.<br /> Cycling down the road by the cemetery was a third boy. As he passed, he<br /> thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate.<br /> Sure enough, he heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for<br /> you."" He knew what it was. ""Oh, my goodness!"" he shuddered, ""It's Satan  and<br /> St. Peter dividing the souls at the cemetery!""</p>
<p>He cycled down the road and found an old man with a cane, hobbling along.<br /> � Come quick!"" he said, ""You won't believe what I heard. Satan and St.Peter<br /> are down at the cemetery dividing the souls."" The old man said, ""Shoo, you brat!<br /> Can't you see I'm finding it hard to walk as it is!""</p>
<p>After several pleas, the man hobbled to the cemetery and heard, ""One for you,<br /> one for me. One for you, one..."" The old man whispered, ""Boy, you've<br /> been telling' the truth! Let's see if we can see the Devil himself.""<br /> Shivering with fear, they edged toward the fence, still unable to see<br /> anything, but they heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me. And<br /> one last one for you. That's all. Let's go get those nuts by the<br /> fence, and we'll be done.""</p>

<p>The man could see the naked outline of the gals bare legs as she continued to lie there while he relieved himself. He could feel his interest grow as he finished.

Walking alongside,  Paul is soon knee-deep in filthy water, while Jesus scoots  along on top of the sea. Ever hopeful of some help he  slogs on, and Jesus keeps walking on water... but soon  the water is up to Paul's chin.

The CEO who was stepping down met with him privately and presented him with three numbered envelopes....#1,#2,#3.""Open these if you run up against a problem you don't think you can solve,"" the departing CEO said.Well, things went along pretty smoothly, but six months later, sales took a downturn and Morris was really catching a lot of heat. About at his wit's end, he remembered the envelopes. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, ""Blame your predecessor.""Morris, the new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Satisfied with his comments, the press -- and Wall Street -- responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, ""Reorganise."" This he did, and the company quickly rebounded.After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on difficult times. Morris went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope.The message said, ""Prepare three envelopes.""</p>

49694,"<p>May 5, 1863 -- Here on the frontier, I sometimes wonder if the ancients were right. With no other friendly face within 150 miles, it seems as if I have fallen off the edge of the Earth. I spend my time now reading what books I have and cultivating my patch of cucumbers (which I brought back from the Holy Land, cf. Prince of Thieves). The ""purpose"" of this fort, to hold back the Indians, has fallen away with my civilized veneer. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>May 7, 1863 -- This morning I had an interesting and silent encounter. One of the tribe of Indians nearby watched me perform my morning tasks and then left without a word. I am excited by the prospect of contact with the natives of the area. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>May 20, 1863 -- I have finally convinced the Indians to parlay with me. I taught them the word for ""fort"", feeling that it would be simple enough for them to learn. They in turn taught me the Indian word ""titonka"", apparently a small but tough, powerfully merchandised horseless carriage of metal construction. I envy these people their simplicity. </p>

<p>June 7, 1863 -- Today I visited the Indians' village. It is on one of the many flat-topped plateaus in the area. As the decline of the buffalo proceeds, so too does this Indian tribe face decline. I will try to teach them agriculture. They have also told me their name for themselves. It is ""Anasazi""... which apparently means ""people called Anasazi"" in their language. I am called by them ""Stinchapecsal"" which means ""he who should bathe more regularly"". </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>July 8, 1863 -- A rude awakening. The Indians are fully aware of agriculture and in fact have nothing to do with the buffalo (what kind of nomadic tribe would build a village on a mesa?); unfortunately, they are suffering a drought. Knowing a remedy, I have told them to dig a ditch from the nearby stream up the mountainside to their mesa-top fields. In the meantime, I am pickling my cucumbers. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>July 20, 1863 -- The drought is desperate, but the ditch is finished and my pickles are ready. I am lining the ditch with pickles. The Anasazi are doubtful, but I have promised them results in the morning. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>July 21, 1863 -- Success! The stream has been diverted and now flows up the mountainside to the Anasazi fields. Amazed by this seeming magic, I told them that it was simply a well-known fact in my world. After all, everyone knows that ""dill waters run steep"".</p>

That night he slept the best he had<br /> slept in a long time. He came downstairs, thanked the farmer,<br /> and walked out the door.

Accompanied by the<br /> girl friend's younger sister, he went to Herrod's and bought a<br /> pair of white gloves. The sister purchased a pair of panties for<br /> herself. During the wrapping, however, the clerk got the items<br /> mixed up and the sister got the gloves and the girl friend got<br /> the panties. The guy sent the package to the girl friend with<br /> the following note:</p>
<p>I chose these because I noticed you are not in the habit of<br /> wearing any in the evening. If it had not been for your sister,<br /> I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she<br /> wears the short ones that are easier to remove. These are a<br /> delicate shade, but the sales clerk that helped me has a pair<br /> that she has been wearing for the past three weeks and they are<br /> hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and she looked<br /> really smart. I wish I was there to put them on for you the<br /> first time, as no doubt other hands will come into contact with<br /> them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them<br /> off, remember to blow in them before putting them away as they<br /> will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Just think how<br /> many times I will kiss them during the coming year. I hope you<br /> will wear them for me Friday night.</p>
<p>All my love.</p>
<p>PS: The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little<br /> fur showing.</p>

49740,"<p>1. If someone calls while you are on the phone, do not answer the call waiting<br /> signals, after all your conversation to your boyfriend's, cousin's, sister's,<br /> ex-best friend's, father-in-law's, stepson is probably too important to be<br /> interrupted.<br /> 2. Of course there is no need to record any messages on a piece of paper.<br /> a. you would have to actually walk towards the kitchen to get to the pad of<br /> paper which requires that you write down a name and check off a few boxes<br /> b. but more importantly, all roommates have mental telepathy and are aware<br /> that if you tell the party on the phone that he/she will be called back at the<br /> callee's first free moment, the callee will telepathically be aware of this<br /> 3. Don't buy anything for the apartment, use and abuse other roommate�s items<br /> until they are destroyed and wait for them to buy a new one (case example: the<br /> spatula).<br /> 4. Feel free to leave any and all dirty dishes wherever you please,<br /> certainly one of your roommates has taken classes in house-cleaning 101 and will<br /> clean up after you. Just because you are big enough to make a mess shouldn't<br /> obligate you to be big enough to clean it up.<br /> 5. If you wake up at 6:45 am and need to take a shower, be sure to lock the<br /> bathroom door! Your roommates should be able and considerate enough to drive to<br /> the nearest gas station to use the toilet. Also, make sure that you take a 40<br /> minute shower--it really stinks when a roommate leaves for work early and you<br /> have to take the bus.<br /> 6. Leave all electrical appliances, especially the lights on at all times--we<br /> are paying for the apartment, and there is no need to conserve energy--let other<br /> less important people do that.<br /> 7. If you need to use the phone late at night and it is in your roommate�s<br /> room, be sure to wake them up when you go to remove it. It's important that they<br /> know you are going to make a phone call to your dog!<br /> 8. Make sure that when you answer the phone you are as rude as possible to<br /> whoever is calling so that they won't call back and bother you again--how dare<br /> they interrupt whatever it is that you are not doing!<br /> 9. Never, ever, ever, ever empty the trash--if your roommate won't do it, just<br /> let the apartment stink. You were not born a garbage man, so why lower yourself<br /> to that level especially when you are a princess?<br /> 10. If your roommate has a car and drives to work, feel free to ride with her,<br /> but don't bother to offer her any money for gas. This is the 90's and gas is<br /> free for all Summer Interns.<br /> 11. Make sure that you leave as much hair as possible on the bathroom sinks<br /> and in the shower. Don't clean out your brush over the trash can, of course your<br /> roommates want to look at pieces of your broken hair each and every time they go<br /> to the bathroom.<br /> 12. Don't ever throw out any of your food that may be moldy because it was<br /> buried behind all the stuff that is piled in the refrigerator. Mold is a<br /> beautiful thing and everyone likes to watch it develop through its stages.<br /> 13. Feel free to eat any food that is located in the kitchen. Whether it is in<br /> your cabinet or not, it is free for the taking. Even if it�s not open, your<br /> roommates shop for the entire apartment, not themselves. Oh, and if your<br /> roommate questions you about missing food, pretend you know nothing about<br /> it--you can always blame it on the cookie monster.<br /> 14. If one of your roommates has fish, and she doesn't ask you to feed them<br /> when she leaves town--then don't bother wasting your time feeding them. They're<br /> only fish, and they probably won't need to eat anyway.<br /> 15. If you feel like listening to some music and you don't have a cd player or<br /> stereo, simply remove your roommate's from her room. She won't mind if you leave<br /> it, or any of her cd's, on the floor. After all, if it is not yours, why should<br /> you have to put it away??!!??<br /> 16. Make some soup whenever you want, and be sure to leave it in your<br /> roommates pot in the refrigerator for a week or two, if need be. She probably<br /> doesn't want to use her pot anyway.<br /> 17. If your roommate buys a 12 pack of chicken legs and you feel like cooking<br /> for someone else--you should definitely take your roommates chicken and cook it.<br /> Oh, and be sure that you tell the dinner guest that it is your food.<br /> 18. If a neighbor (of course a friendly one) comes over and wants some<br /> spaghetti sauce and you don't have any to give them, feel free to go into a<br /> roommates cabinet and give away theirs. They can always go to the grocery store<br /> and buy some more for themselves. Oh, and don't tell them that you've given it<br /> away either until the ever so friendly neighbor brings back a few drops of it<br /> and thanks you for giving it to them.<br /> 19. If your roommate is kind enough to take you to New York with her because<br /> she knows that you have never been there, be sure to do the following:<br /> a. insult your roommate's friend who shows the 2 of you around the city<br /> b. don't say thank you for anything and act as bored as possible<br /> c. be sure to tell everyone you see when you get back what a rotten time that<br /> you.</p>

49751,"<p>Then Jesus took his disciples up the mountain and, gathering them around<br /> him, he taught them, saying:</p>
<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br /> Blessed are the meek, blessed are they that mourn, blessed are the<br /> merciful, blessed are they that thirst for justice, blessed are you when<br /> persecuted, blessed are you when you suffer. Be glad and rejoice, for your<br /> reward is great in heaven.</p>

<p>He sent the following e-mail to his wife's lover:</p>
<p>Sir, It has been brought to my attention that for some time now you have been<br /> carrying on an affair with my wife. So that we may settle this matter in an<br /> intelligent fashion, please be at my office at 3 PM on Friday next.</p>

<p>     There once was a man who had a phone implanted in his hand<br /> and he walked into a biker bar. Shortly, his hand started to<br /> ring and he picked  his hand up and answered it. This procedure<br /> happened one or two more times, and finally the bartender asked<br /> what the heck he was doing, so he told him he had a cell phone<br /> implanted in his hand, and the bartender told him he better be<br /> careful because the boys at the bar did not like freaks like<br /> him. He took the advice. A few minutes later he headed for the<br /> bathroom and did not come back for ten minutes, then fifteen and<br /> fifteen turned into twenty. The bartender went in to check up on<br /> him to see if he had been hurt by a biker and sure enough, he<br /> had his pants down to his ankles and toilet paper stuffed up his<br /> butt. The bartender asked, ""I warned you about this!""<br /> And the man replied, ""No, you have the wronge idea, I am just<br /> getting a fax!""</p>

49774,"<p>Dear Employee: </p>
<p>As a result of the reduction of money budgeted for department areas, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel. </p>
<p>Under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately. </p>
<p>This program will be known as SLAP (Sever Late-Aged Personnel). Employees who are SLAPPED will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company. </p>
<p>SLAPPED employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This review phase of the program is called SCREW. </p>
<p>SCREW (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers). All employees who have been SLAPPED and SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management. </p>
<p>This appeal is called SHAFT (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination). </p>
<p>Under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be SLAPPED once, SCREWED twice, but may be SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate. </p>
<p>If an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel's Early Severance) or CLAP (Combined Lump sum Assistance Payment). </p>
<p>As HERPES and CLAP are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received HERPES or CLAP will no longer be SLAPPED or SCREWED by the company. </p>
<p>Management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our: </p>
<p>Special High Intensity Training (SHIT). We take pride in the amount of SHIT our employees receive. We have given our employees more SHIT than any company in this area. If any employee feels they do not receive enough SHIT on the job, see your immediate supervisor. </p>
<p>Your supervisor is specially trained to make sure you receive all the SHIT you can stand. </p>
<p>And, once again, thanks for all your years of service with us.</p>

49791,"<p>Microsoft Corporation has just announced a new PC keyboard designed specifically for Windows. {Sources say a Macintosh variant is in the works.} In addition to the keys found on the standard keyboard, Microsoft's new design adds several new keys which will make your Windows computing even more fun! The final specs are not yet set, so please feel free to make suggestions. The keys proposed so far are: </p>
<p>1) GPF key -- This key will instantly generate a General Protection Fault when pressed. Microsoft representatives state that the purpose of the GPF key is to save Windows users time by eliminating the need to run an application in order to produce a General Protection Fault. </p>
<p>2) $$ key -- When this key is pressed, money is transferred automatically from your bank account to Microsoft without the need for further action or third party intervention. </p>
<p>3) ZD key -- This key was developed specifically for reviewers of Microsoft products. When pressed it inserts random superlative adjectives in any text which contains the words Microsoft or Windows within the file being edited. </p>
<p>4) MS key -- This key runs a Microsoft commercial entitled ""Computing for Mindless Drones"" in a 1"" x 1"" window. </p>
<p>5) FUD key -- Some thing to do with the display ... self explanatory. </p>
<p>6) Chicago key -- Generates do nothing loops for months at a time. </p>
<p>7) IBM key -- Searches your hard disk for operating systems or applications by vendors other than Microsoft and deletes them. (Is very effective at removing Netscape). </p>
<p>8) MSN Key -- With a single keystroke you will install and setup the world's second slowest web access (AOL takes first place). And you thought it was tough deleting all of the SetupMSN files from Win 95! </p>
<p>9) RW95 Key -- Stands for Re-install Windows 95. Because it's usually a weekly ritual for most Win 95 users, why not make it easier? </p>
<p>10) FDISK Key -- Microsoft's new compression utility gives you 100% data compression guaranteed. Could stand for Format Disk, but we all know what it really stands for.</p>

While the boy and his<br /> father were watching wide-eyed, an old lady in a wheel chair rolled up to the<br /> moving walls and pressed a button.  The walls opened and the lady rolled between<br /> them and into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched<br /> small circles of light with numbers above the wall light up.  They continued to<br /> watch the circles light up in the reverse direction. The walls opened up again<br /> and a beautiful 24 year old woman stepped out. The father said to his son, ""Go<br /> get your Mother.""</p>

49798,"<p>Latkes:<br /> A pancake-like structure not to be confused with anything the<br /> House of Pancakes would put out. In a Latka, the oil is in the<br /> pancake. It is made with potatoes, onions, eggs and matzo meal.<br /> Latkas can be eaten with apple sauce but NEVER with maple syrup.<br /> There is a rumor that in the time of the Maccabees they lit a<br /> Latka by mistake and it burned for eight days. What is certain<br /> is you will have heartburn for the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Matzos:<br /> The Egyptians' revenge for leaving slavery. It consists of a<br /> simple mix of flour and water - no eggs or flavor at all. When<br /> made well, it could actually taste like cardboard. Its redeeming<br /> value is that it does fill you up and stays with you for a long<br /> time. However, it is recommended that you eat a few prunes soon<br /> after.</p>
<p>Kasha Varnishka:<br /> This is one of the little-known delicacies, which is even more<br /> difficult to pronounce than to cook. It has nothing to do with<br /> varnish, but is basically a mixture of buckwheat and bow tie<br /> macaroni (noodles). Why a bow tie? Many sages discussed this and<br /> agreed that some Jewish mother decided that, ""You can't come to<br /> the table without a tie'' or, 'Heaven forbid,' an elbow on my<br /> table?""</p>
<p>Kreplach:<br /> It sounds worse than it tastes. There is a rabbinical debate on<br /> its origins: One Rabbi claims it began when a fortune cookie<br /> fell into his chicken soup. The other claims it started in an<br /> Italian restaurant. Either way it can be soft, hard, or soggy<br /> and the amount of meat inside depends on whether it is your<br /> mother or your mother-in-law who cooked it.</p>
<p>Cholent:<br /> This combination of noxious gases had been the secret weapon of<br /> Jews for centuries. The unique combination of beans, barley,<br /> potatoes, and bones or meat is meant to stick to your ribs and<br /> anything else it comes into contact with. At a fancy Mexican<br /> restaurant (kosher, of course) I once heard this comment from a<br /> youngster who had just had his first taste of Mexican fried<br /> beans: ''What! Do they serve leftover cholent here too?"" My wife<br /> once tried something unusual for guests: She made cholent<br /> burgers for Sunday night supper. The guests never came back.</p>
<p>Gefilte Fish:<br /> A few years ago, I had problems with my filter in my fishpond<br /> and a few of them got rather stuck and mangled. My son looked at<br /> them and commented ''Is that why we call it 'Ge Filtered<br /> Fish'?'' Originally, it was a carp stuffed with a minced fish<br /> and vegetable mixture. Today it usually comprises of small fish<br /> balls eaten with horseradish which is judged on its relative<br /> strength in bringing tears to your eye at 100 paces.</p>
<p>Bagels:<br /> How can we finish without the quintessential Jewish Food, the<br /> bagel? Like most foods, there are legends surrounding the bagel<br /> although I don't know any. There have been persistent rumors<br /> that the inventors of the bagel were the Norwegians who couldn't<br /> get anyone to buy smoked lox. Think about it: Can you picture<br /> yourself eating lox on white bread? Rye? A cracker? Naaa. They<br /> looked for something hard and almost indigestible which could<br /> take the spread of cream cheese and which doesn't take up too<br /> much room on the plate.</p>

49826,"<p>A retired gentleman spent most afternoons at the local golf course. Every day<br /> he would spend about three hours out on the course, playing a round by himself.<br /> When he would return to the clubhouse, the resident pro would inquire about his<br /> score. </p>
<p>""Ed, how'd you shoot today?"" to which the man would always reply, ""Another<br /> perfect par."" </p>
<p>The golf pro (being of average intelligence) knew that there was no way the<br /> old man was shooting straight par every day. But since he was a regular<br /> customer, he didn't want to insult the man by accusing him of lying. </p>
<p>Finally, one day, the pro decided to accompany the old man on his daily round,<br /> just to see for himself. </p>
<p>On the first tee, the older gentleman sliced the ball way off into the rough.<br /> He found his ball, but his second shot was even worse. Finally, putting it into<br /> the first hole (a par 4) took him 8 swings. </p>
<p>The golf pro thought to himself, ""I knew it! This guy's been lying all this<br /> time. There is no way he is gonna shoot anywhere NEAR par."" </p>
<p>They continued on, and the old man's game stayed the same, never once getting<br /> a par on any one hole. After almost 3 hours, they teed off on the 13th hole. The<br /> old man actually hit it straight down the middle -- It was the best shot he had<br /> made all day! He promptly walked down the fairway to his ball, picked it up, and<br /> began walking back to the clubhouse. </p>
<p>The pro was confused. ""Hey, that was a great shot! Where are you going now?"" </p>
<p>""Oh, I'm done,"" the old man replied with a smile. ""That shot was number 72 . .<br /> . another perfect par!""</p>

49855,"<p>All About Scooby-Doo.</p>
<p>                         What We Remember:</p>
<p>Four teenagers and their trusted dog gallop across the country in their<br /> purple and green van solving mysteries of all sort--and in the process<br /> meet all kinds of interesting people.</p>
<p>                            The Truth:</p>
<p>Four high-school dropouts and their sentient dog ride around the<br /> country in their psychedelic love machine, earning their way by selling<br /> drugs. Oh, and they occasionally take some old guy's mask off to solve a<br /> mystery,.. but even then, it starts to become apparent that those kids<br /> always seem to 'find' trouble.</p>
<p>It may be a little hard to swallow, but just take a look at the evidence:<br /> Take Shaggy for example. Not only is he the inspiration for the current<br /> 'grunge' scene, with his sloppy dress and facial hair, but Shaggy is<br /> obviously a 'burner', i.e., he smokes marijuana. Why do you think he is<br /> constantly hungry? Shaggy can make a six foot hoagie and swallow it whole.</p>
<p>And then there is Scooby himself. While dogs do not generally smoke<br /> joints, Scooby gets his 'high' from Scooby-Snacks, which are in fact<br /> Hash-Brownies. Whenever Scooby, or Shaggy for that matter, eats a<br /> Scooby-Snack, they go ape!  It just blows their mind and they do whatever<br /> they are told, because they are so lit! Scooby is also hungry all the time.</p>
<p>The other characters do not actively take part in the stoner-fest that<br /> Shaggy and Scooby do, but they do condone the selling of it because it<br /> helps support their jaunts across the country (and the world--they<br /> drove to China once). These other characters do have their own<br /> peculiarities however...</p>
<p>Fred and Daphne are always splintering off from the group to go 'solve<br /> the case' by themselves. It's no real mystery what these two are really<br /> doing--they're getting busy in the back of the Mystery Machine.</p>
<p>Daphne with her pretty pink, well, legs and Fred are constantly bumping<br /> uglies. Fred is, by the way, pumped up on steroids. One thing that<br /> remains a mystery to me though, is why he always wore that stupid scarf<br /> around his neck.</p>
<p>And what about Velma? Everyone's least favorite of the cast, was of<br /> course, a lesbian. But, as it turned out in the later episodes, she was<br /> also into bestiality. Where do you think Scrappy-Doo came from?<br /> Scrappy, who was a dog yet spoke perfect english, was obviously a<br /> product of Velma and Scooby.</p>
<p>So the kids spent their teenage years driving around the world,<br /> slingin' dope, shooting steroids, eating hash brownies, and screwin'<br /> their dog, while all the while looking for the perfect 'hit'.</p>

49902,"<p>It seems the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a unique device for<br /> testing the strength of windshields on airplanes. The device is a gun that<br /> launches a dead chicken at a plane's windshield at approximately the speed the<br /> plane flies.</p>
<p>The theory is that if the windshield doesn't crack from the carcass impact,<br /> it'll survive a real collision with a bird during flight. It seems the British<br /> were very interested in this and wanted to test a windshield on a brand new,<br /> speedy locomotive they're developing.</p>
<p>They borrowed the FAA's chicken launcher, loaded the chicken and fired. The<br /> ballistic chicken shattered the windshield, went through the engineer's chair,<br /> broke an instrument panel and embedded itself in the back wall of the engine<br /> cab. The British were stunned and asked the FAA to recheck the test to see if<br /> everything was done correctly.</p>
<p>The FAA reviewed the test thoroughly and had one recommendation: ""Use a thawed<br /> chicken.""</p>

49903,"<p>International Marketing - Actual Accounts</p>
<p>Cracking an international market is a goal of most growing corporations. It shouldn't be that hard, yet even the big multi-nationals run into trouble because of language and cultural differences. For example... </p>
<p>The name Coca-Cola in China was first rendered as Ke-kou-ke-la. Unfortunately, the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of signs had been printed that the phrase means ""bite the wax tadpole"" or ""female horse stuffed with wax"" depending on the dialect. Coke then researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close phonetic equivalent, ""ko-kou-ko-le,"" which can be loosely translated as ""happiness in the mouth."" </p>
<p>In Taiwan, the translation of the Pepsi slogan ""Come alive with the Pepsi Generation"" came out as ""Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead."" </p>
<p>Also in Chinese, the Kentucky Fried Chicken slogan ""finger-lickin' good"" came out as ""eat your fingers off."" </p>
<p>The American slogan for Salem cigarettes, ""Salem - Feeling Free,"" got translated in the Japanese market into ""Whensmoking Salem, you feel so refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty."" </p>
<p>When General Motors introduced the Chevy Nova in South America, it was apparently unaware that ""no va"" means ""it won't go."" After the company figured out why it wasn't selling any cars, it renamed the car in its Spanish markets to the Caribe. </p>
<p>Ford had a similar problem in Brazil when the Pinto flopped. The company found out that Pinto was Brazilian slang for""tiny male genitals"". Ford pried all the nameplates off and substituted Corcel, which means horse. </p>
<p>When Parker Pen marketed a ballpoint pen in Mexico, its ads were supposed to say ""It won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you."" However, the company's mistakenly thought the spanish word ""embarazar"" meant embarrass. Instead the ads said that ""It wont leak in your pocket and make you pregnant."" </p>
<p>An American t-shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the spanish market which promoted the Pope's visit. Instead of the desired ""I Saw the Pope"" in Spanish, the shirts proclaimed ""I Saw the Potato."" </p>
<p>Chicken-man Frank Perdue's slogan, ""It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken,"" got terribly mangled in another Spanish translation. A photo of Perdue with one of his birds appeared on billboards all over Mexico with a caption that explained ""It takes a hard man to make a chicken aroused."" </p>
<p>Hunt-Wesson introduced its Big John products in French Canada as Gros Jos before finding out that the phrase, in slang, means ""big breasts."" In this case, however, the name problem did not have a noticeable effect on sales. </p>
<p>Colgate introduced a toothpaste in France called Cue, the name of a notorious porno mag. </p>
<p>In Italy, a campaign for Schweppes Tonic Water translated the name into Schweppes Toilet Water. </p>
<p>Japan's second-largest tourist agency was mystified when it entered English-speaking markets and began receiving requests for unusual sex tours. Upon finding out why, the owners of Kinki Nippon Tourist Company changed its name. </p>
<p>and finally... </p>
<p>In an effort to boost orange juice sales in predominantly continental breakfast eating England, a campaign was devised to extoll the drink's eye-opening, pick-me-up qualities. Hence, the slogan, ""Orange juice. It gets your pecker up.""</p>

<p>As Claude took to the stage, he announced, ""Unlike most stage hypnotists who invite two or three people up onto the stage to be put into a trance, I intend to hypnotize each and every member of the audience.""</p>
<p>The excitement was almost electric as Claude withdrew a beautiful antique pocket watch from his coat. ""I want you each to keep your eye on this antique watch. It's a very special watch. Its been in my family for six generations."" He began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting, ""Watch the watch, watch the watch, watch the watch....""</p>
<p>The crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, light gleaming off its polished surface. Hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch, until suddenly it slipped from the hypnotist's fingers and fell to the floor, breaking into a hundred pieces. ""Shit"" said the hypnotist.</p>

The wife replied that she didn't know how to play golf, so her husband signed her up for lessons. So the following week, she went to her first lesson. The insructor explained the way that she was supposed to stand and what position would be best for her. Then he tried to show her how to handle the club, it wasn't working out very well, so he told her to pretend that the club was her husband's manhood.

I told her to get into our second car, a prehistoric oversized gas guzzler, and use it to push my car fast enough to start it. I pointed out to her that because the VW had an automatic transmission, it needed to be pushed at least 30 mph for it to start.<br /> She said fine, hoped into her car and drove off.</p>
<p>I sat there fuming wondering what she could be doing.</p>

49925,"<p>In a certain suburban neighborhood, there were two brothers, 8 and 10 years old, who were exceedingly mischievous. Whatever went wrong in the neighborhood, it turned out they had had a hand in it. Their parents were at their wit's end trying to control them. Hearing about a priest nearby who worked with delinquent boys, the mother suggested to the father that they ask the priest to talk with the boys. The father replied, ""Sure, do that before I kill them!"" The mother went to the priest and made her request. He agreed, but said he wanted to see the younger boy first and alone. So the mother sent him to the priest. The priest sat the boy down across a huge, impressive desk he sat behind. For about five minutes they just sat and stared at each other. Finally, the priest pointed his forefinger at the boy and asked, ""Where is God?"" The boy looked under the desk, in the corners of the room, all around, but said nothing. Again, louder, the priest pointed at the boy and asked, ""Where is God?"" Again the boy looked all around but said nothing. A third time, in a louder, firmer voice, the priest leaned far across the desk and put his forefinger almost to the boy's nose, and asked, ""Where is God?""The boy panicked and ran all the way home. Finding his older brother, he dragged him upstairs to their room and into the closet, where they usually plotted their mischief. He finally said, ""We are in BIG trouble!"" The older boy asked, ""What do you mean, BIG trouble?""His brother replied, ""God is missing and they think we did it.""</p>

There was another sausage in the pond but this time it was a normal sized one, so the cat reached in.  This time he had to put his whole arm into the pond.  The cat hooked the sausage out and ate it.The next day things go basically the same and the cat again looks into the pond. There he found an enormous Cumberland sausage at the bottom for the pond. It looked so delicious but it was so deep that he had to really stretch to get it, then SPLASH - he fell in.The moral of the story is: The Bigger the Sausage, The Wetter the Pussy!</p>

49945,"<p>Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a maddening passion for baked beans. He loved then. but he always had a very embarassing and somewhat lively reaction to them. Then, one day, he met a girl and fell in love with her. When it was apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself, she is a sweet and gentle girl and will never go for this kind of carrying on. So, he made the supreme sacrafice and gave up the beans. </p>
<p>The were married thereafter. Some months later, his car broke down on the way home from work and since they lived in the country, he called her and told her that he would be late getting home because he had to walk. On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the odor of freshly baked beans was overwhelming. Since he still had several miles to walk, he figured that he would work off any effects before reaching home, so he stopped at the cafe. Before leaving, he had eaten three large orders of baked beans. </p>
<p>All the way home, he put-putted and after arriving, felt reasonably sure that he had putted his last. His wife seemed somewhat agitated and excited to see him and exclaimed: Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for dinner tonight. She then blindfolded him and led him to his chair at the head of the table. He seated himself and just as she was ready to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She made him vow that he would not touch the blindfold until she returned. Then she went to answer the phone. </p>
<p>Seizing the opportunity, he shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but as ripe as a rotten egg. He took the napkin from his lap and vigorously fanned the air around him. Things had just about returned to normal, when he felt the urge come on again, so he shifted his weight to the other leg and let go again. </p>
<p>This was a true prize winner. While keeping his ear on the phone, he went on like this for 10 minutes, until he knew the phone farewell indicated the end of his freedom. He placed the napkin in his lap and folded his hands on top of it and smiling contently to himself was the perfect picture on innocence.</p>
<p>When his wife returned she asked if he had peeked and he said no. At that point, she removed the blindfold and revealed his surprise. </p>

However, if her husband<br /> did any work or moved around much or got upset about anything, he would die. The<br /> doctor asked if she understood these conditions, and the wife assured him that<br /> she did.<br /> When the wife came out, the husband asked her, �so what is the matter with me?<br /> Am I going to die?� And the wife said, �Yes, honey, I'm afraid you're going to<br /> die.�</p>

The Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property.They argued for a while until finally the Scotsman said, ""In my family we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I punch you in the nose and note how long it takes you to recover, then you punch me in the nose and note how long it takes for me to recover, whomever recovers quicker wins the egg.""The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman held the heaviest object he could find, took a few steps back, then ran toward the Englishman and punched him as hard as he could in the nose. The Englishman fell to the ground and was howling in agony and holding his nose for thirty minutes.Eventually the Englishman stood up and said, ""Now it's my turn to punch you.""The Scotsman said, ""Keep the lousy egg.""</p>

49981,"<p>A secret agent was sent to Ireland to pick up some very sensitive information from an agent called Murphy. His instructions were to walk around town using a code phrase until he met his fellow agent. He found himself on a desolate country road and finally ran into a farmer.""Hello, said the agent, ""I'm looking for a man called Murphy.""""Well you're in luck,"" said the farmer, ""as it happens, there's a village right over the hill, where there's a butcher called Murphy, the baker is named Murphy, three widows are called Murphy. In fact my name is Murphy.""""Aha,"" thought the agent, ""here's my man."" So he whispered the secret code. ""The sun is shining...the grass is growing...the cows are ready for milking.""""Oh,"" said the farmer, ""you're looking for Murphy the spy - he's in the village over the other direction.""</p>
