10002,"<p>A man walks into a bar, sits down on a bench and orders a cold one. He swigs down the beer, looks in his pocket, cringes and orders another. He gulps down that one, looks in his pocket again, cringes and orders yet another one. This goes on for at least an hour and a half. Finally the bartender, bursting with curiousity, says, ""I know it's none of my business buddy, but I have to ask. Why the whole ""drink, look in pocket, cringe and order another one"" routine?""""Well,"" slurred the man, ""There's a picture of my wife in my pocket. When she starts to look good, then it's time for me to go home.""</p>

10007,"<p>On a Trans-Atlantic flight, a plane passes through a severe storm. The turbulence is awful, and things go from bad to worse when one wing is struck by lightning. One woman in particular loses it. Screaming,she stands up in the front of the plane. ""I'm too young to die!"" she wails. Then she yells, ""Well, if I'm going to die, I want my last minutes on earth to be memorable! No one has ever made me really feel like a woman! Well I've had it! Is there ANYONE on this plane who can make me feel like a WOMAN??"" </p>
<p>For a moment there is silence. everyone has forgotten their own peril, and they all stare, riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the plane. Then, a man stands up in the rear of the plane. ""I can make you feel like a woman,"" he says. He's gorgeous! Tall, built, with flowing black hair and jet black eyes, he starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time. No one moves. The woman is breathing heavily in anticipation as the strange man approaches. He removes his shirt. Muscles ripple across his chest as he reaches her, and extends the arm holding his shirt to the trembling woman, and whispers:<br /> ""Iron this.""</p>

A smack on the behind and a ""Nice hustle, you'll get 'em next time"" would pretty much do it. * Birth control would come in ale or lager.* You'd be expected to fill your resume with gag names of people you'd worked for, like ""The Lone Ranger.""* Each year, your raise would be pegged to the fortunes of the NFL team of your choice. * The funniest guy in the office would get to be CEO. * ""Sorry I'm late, but I was out getting wasted last night"" would be an acceptable excuse for tardiness.* At the end of the workday, a whistle would blow and you'd jump out your window and slide down the tail of a brontosaurus and right into your car like Fred Flintstone. * It'd be considered harmless fun to gather 30 friends, put on horned helmets, and go pillage a nearby town.* Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating the ""public ugliness"" ordinance.* Tanks would be far easier to rent.* Garbage would take itself out. * Instead of beer belly, you'd get ""beer biceps."" * Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could present your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said ""You're #1!"" * Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would only occur in leap years.* On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you'd get the day off to go drinking. Mother's Day, too.* St. Patrick's Day, however, would remain exactly the same.* But it would be celebrated every month!* Cops would be broadcast live, and you could phone in advice to the pursuing cops. Or to the crooks.* The victors in any athletic competition would get to eat the losers for lunch.* The only show opposite Monday Night Football would be Monday Night Football from a Different Camera Angle.* It would be perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as you returned it the following day with a full tank of gas.* Every man would get four real Get Out of Jail Free cards per year.* When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you responded with would actually reduce your fine. For example:Cop: ""You know how fast you were going?""You: ""All I know is, I was spilling my beer all over the place.""Cop: ""Nice one. That's $10 off.""* Faucets would run ""Hot,"" ""Cold,"" and ""100 proof.""* The Statue of Liberty would get a bright red, 40-foot thong.* People would never talk about how fresh they felt.* Daisy Duke shorts would never again go out of style. * Telephones would automatically cut off after 30 seconds of conversation</p>

10016,"<p>Did you know that ""verb"" is a noun? How can you look up words in a dictionary if you can't spell them? If a word is misspelled in a dictionary, how would we ever know? If two mouses are mice and two louses are lice, why aren't two houses hice? If Webster wrote the first dictionary, where did he find the words? If you wrote a letter, perhaps you bote your tongue? If you've read a book, you can reread it. But wouldn't this also mean that you would have to ""member"" somebody in order to remember them? In Chinese, why are the words for crisis and opportunity the same? Is it a coincidence that the only 15 letter word that can be spelled without repeating a letter is uncopyrightable? Is there another word for a synonym? Shouldn't there be a shorter word for ""monosyllabic""? What is another word for ""thesaurus""? Where do swear words come from? Why can't you make another word using all the letters in ""anagram""? Why do fat chance and slim chance mean the same thing? Why do overlook and oversee mean opposite things? Why do people use the word ""irregardless""? Why do some people type ""cool"" as ""kewl?"" Why do we say something is out of whack? What is a whack? Why do we say something's out of order when its broken but we never say in of order when it works? Why does ""cleave"" mean both split apart and stick together? Why does ""slow down"" and ""slow up"" mean the same thing? Why does flammable and inflammable mean the same thing? Why does the Chinese ideogram for trouble symbolize two women living under one roof? Why does X stand for a kiss and O stand for a hug? Why doesn't ""onomatopoeia"" sound like what it is? Why don't we say ""why"" instead of ""how come""? Why is ""crazy man"" an insult, while to insert a comma and say ""Crazy, man!"" is a compliment? Why are a wise man and wise guy opposites? Why is abbreviation such a long word? Why is dyslexic so hard to spell? Why is it so hard to remember how to spell MNEMONIC? Why is it that no word in the English language rhymes with month, orange, silver, or purple? Why is it that the word ""gullible"" isn't in the dictionary? Why is it that we recite at a play and play at a recital? Why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham? Why is the alphabet in that order? Is it because of that song? Why is the plural of goose-geese, and not the plural of moose-meese? Why isn't ""palindrome"" spelled the same way backwards? Why isn't phonetic spelled the way it sounds?</p>

10017,"<p>Steven Spielberg was discussing his new project--an action<br /> docudrama about famous composers starring top movie stars.<br /> Sylvester Stallone, Steven Segal, Bruce Willis, and Arnold<br /> Schwarzenegger were all present. Spielberg strongly desired the<br /> box office 'oomph' of these superstars, so he was prepared to<br /> allow them to select whatever composers they would portray, as<br /> long as they were very famous.</p>
<p>""Well,"" started Stallone, ""I've always admired Mozart. I would<br /> love to play him.""</p>
<p>""Chopin has always been my favorite, and my image would improve<br /> if people saw me playing the piano."" said Willis. ""I'll play<br /> him.""</p>
<p>""I've always been partial to Strauss and his waltzes,"" said<br /> Segal. ""I'd like to play him."" </p>
<p>Spielberg was very pleased with these choices. ""Sounds<br /> splendid."" Then, looking at Schwarzenegger, he asked, ""Who do<br /> you want to be, Arnold?"" So Arnold says, ""I'll be Bach.""</p>

10020,"<p>The animals were bored.  Finally, the lion had an idea.  ""I know a really exciting game that the humans play called football.  I've seen it on T.V.""He proceeded to describe it to the rest of the animals and they all got excited about it so they decided to play.  They went out to the field and chose up teams and were ready to begin.The lion's team received.  They were able to get two first downs and then had to punt.  The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick.  He caught the ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two rabbits.  He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to daylight, scoring six.Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0.Late in the first half the lion's team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked the extra point.  The lion's team led at halftime 7 - 6.  In the locker room, the lion gave a peptalk.""Look you guys.  We can win this game.  We've got the lead and they only have one real threat.  We've got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he's a killer. Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino.""The second half began.  Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino's team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino.  Once again, the rhino lowered his head and was off running.  First, he stomped two gazelles.  He skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way.  It looked like he was home free.  Suddenly at the twenty yard line, he dropped over dead.  There were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what had happened.  Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede.""Did you do this?"" he asked the centipede.""Yeah, I did."" the centipede replied.The lion retorted, ""Where were you during the first half?""""I was putting on my shoes.""</p>

<p>The Pakistani man replied, ""Just try them on."" Well, the husband, after much badgering from his wife, finally conceded to try them on.

"
10076,"<p>Many of you young persons out there are seriously thinking about going to college. (That is, of course, a lie. The only things you young persons think seriously about are loud music and sex. Trust me: these are closely related to college.)</p>
<p>College is basically a bunch of rooms where you sit for roughly two thousand hours and try to memorize things. The two thousand hours are spread out over four years; you spend the rest of the time sleeping and trying to get dates.</p>
<p>Basically, you learn two kinds of things in college:</p>
<p>* Things you will need to know in later life (two hours). These include how to make collect telephone calls and get beer and crepe-paper stains out of your pajamas.</p>
<p>* Things you will not need to know in later life (1,998 hours). These are the things you learn in classes whose names end in -ology, - - -osophy, -istry, -ics, and so on. The idea is, you memorize these things, then write them down in little exam books, then forget them. If you fail to forget them, you become a professor and have to stay in college for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>It's very difficult to forget everything. For example, when I was in college, I had to memorize -- don't ask me why -- the names of three metaphysical poets other than John Donne. I have managed to forget one of them, but I still remember that the other two were named Vaughan and Crashaw. Sometimes, when I'm trying to remember something important like whether my wife told me to get tuna packed in oil or tuna packed in water, Vaughan and Crashaw just pop up in my mind, right there in the supermarket. It's a terrible waste of brain cells.</p>
<p>After you've been in college for a year or so, you're supposed to choose a major, which is the subject you intend to memorize and forget the most things about. Here is a very important piece of advice: Be sure to choose a major that does not involve Known Facts and Right Answers.</p>
<p>This means you must *not* major in mathematics, physics, biology, or chemistry, because these subjects involve actual facts. If, for example, you major in mathematics, you're going to wander into class one day and the professor will say: ""Define the cosine integer of the quadrant of a rhomboid binary axis, and extrapolate your result to five significant vertices."" If you don't come up with exactly the answer the professor has in mind, you fail. The same is true of chemistry: if you write in your exam book that carbon and hydrogen combine to form oak, your professor will flunk you. He wants you to come up with the same answer he and all the other chemists have agreed on. Scientists are extremely snotty about this.</p>
<p>So you should major in subjects like English, philosophy, psychology, and sociology -- subjects in which nobody really understands what anybody else is talking about, and which involve virtually no actual facts. I attended classes in all these subjects, so I'll give you a quick overview of each:</p>
<p>ENGLISH: This involves writing papers about long books you have read little snippets of just before class. Here is a tip on how to get good grades on your English papers: Never say anything about a book that anybody with any common sense would say. For example, suppose you are studying Moby Dick. Anybody with any common sense would say that Moby Dick is a big white whale, since the characters in the book refer to it as a big white whale roughly eleven thousand times. So in your paper, you say Moby Dick is actually the Republic of Ireland. Your professor, who is sick to death of reading papers and never liked Moby-Dick anyway, will think you are enormously creative. If you can regularly come up with lunatic interpretations of simple stories, you should major in English.</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHY: Basically, this involves sitting in a room and deciding there is no such thing as reality and then going to lunch. You should major in philosophy if you plan to take a lot of drugs.</p>
<p>PSYCHOLOGY: This involves talking about rats and dreams. Psychologists are *obsessed* with rats and dreams. I once spent an entire semester training a rat to punch little buttons in a certain sequence, then training my roommate to do the same thing. The rat learned much faster. My roommate is now a doctor. If you like rats or dreams, and above all if you dream about rats, you should major in psychology.</p>
<p>SOCIOLOGY: For sheer lack of intelligibility, sociology is far and away the number one subject. I sat through hundreds of hours of sociology courses, and read gobs of sociology writing, and I never once heard or read a coherent statement. This is because sociologists want to be considered scientists, so they spend most of their time translating simple, obvious observations into  scientific-sounding code. If you plan to major in sociology, you'll have to learn to do the same thing. For example, suppose you have observed that children cry when they fall down. You should write: ""Methodological observation of the sociometrical behavior tendencies of prematurated isolates indicates that a casual relationship exists between groundward tropism and lachrimatory, or 'crying,' behavior forms."" If you can keep this up for fifty or sixty pages, you will get a large government grant.</p>

<li>At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, ""Aren't you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger?"" The other replied, ""Yes, I am, I married the wrong man."" </li>
<li>Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is finished. </li>
<li>A little boy asked his father, ""Daddy, how much does it cost to get married?"" And the father replied, ""I don't know son, I'm still paying."" </li>
<li>Young Son: Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her? Dad: That happens in every country, son.</li>
<li>Then there was a man who said, ""I never knew what real happiness was until I got married; and then it was too late."" </li>
<li>After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband, ""You know, I was a fool when I married you."" The husband replied, ""Yes, dear, but I was in love and didn't notice."" </li>
<li>A man inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds: ""Wife wanted"". Next day he received a hundred letters. They all said the same thing: ""You can have mine."" </li>
<li>When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let him keep her. -Sacha Guitry </li>
<li>Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe. - Jackie Mason </li>
<li>Marriage is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. Second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience. </li>

10088,"<p>The following is an actual excerpt from Forbes magazine:A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole is maintained or even improved by the regular culling of the weakest members.In much the same way, the human brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells through which the electrical signals pass. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that while excessive intake of alcohol kills off brain cells, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. Thus, regular consumption of beer helps eliminate the weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.The result of this in-depth study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend parties and job-related performance. It also explains why, after a few short years of leaving university and getting married, most professionals cannot keep up with the performance of the new graduates.Only those few that stick to the strict regimen of voracious alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that they achieved during their university years.So, this is a call to arms. As our country is losing its technological edge we should not shudder in our homes. Get back into the bars. Quaff that pint. Your company and country need you to be at your peak, and you shouldn't deny yourself the career that you could have. Take life by the bottle and be all that you can be.</p>

10112,"<p>Experts Warn of Threat from 100GigaBurg Bug </p>
<p>Experts warned today of a new and deadly threat to our beleaguered civilization: the 100GB Bug. As most people know, McDonald's restaurant signs show the number of hamburgers the giant chain has sold. That number now stands at 99 billion burgers, or 99 Gigaburgers (GB). </p>
<p>Within months or even weeks, that number will roll over to 100GB. McDonald's signs, however, were designed years ago, when the prospect of selling one hundred billion hamburgers seemed unthinkably remote. So the signs have only two decimal places. This means that, after the sale of the 100 billionth burger, McDonald's signs will read ""00 Billion Burgers Sold."" </p>
<p>This, experts predict, will convince the public that, in over thirty years, no McDonald's hamburgers have ever in fact been sold, causing a complete collapse of consumer confidence in McDonald's products. The ensuing catastrophic drop in sales is seen as almost certain to force the already-troubled company into bankruptcy. </p>
<p>This, in turn, will push the teetering American economy over the brink, which, finally, will complete the total devastation of the global economy, ending civilization as we know it, and forcing us all to live on beetles. </p>
<p>""The people who know -- the sign-makers -- are really scared of 100GB,"" one expert said. </p>

10117,"<p>A nurse was on duty in the emergency department, when a punk rocker entered. This young woman had purple hair styled into a mohawk, a variety of tattoos and strange clothing. It was determined that the patient had acute appendicitis and was scheduled for immediate surgery.    When she was completely disrobed on the operating table, the staff found that her pubic hair had been dyed green, and above it was a tattoo reading, ''Keep off the grass.''    After the prep and the surgery, the surgeon added a small note to the dressing which said, ''Sorry, had to mow the lawn.''</p>

10122,"<p>There were three people stranded on an island, a brunette, a redhead, and a blonde. The brunette looked over the water to the mainland and estimated about 20 miles to shore. So she announced, ""I'm going to try to swim to shore."" So she swam out five miles, and got really tired. She swam out ten miles from the island, and she was too tired to go on, so she drowned.</p>
<p>The second one, the redhead, said to herself, ""I wonder if she made it. I guess it's better to try to get to the mainland than stay here and starve."" So she attempts to swim out. The redhead had a lot more endurance than the brunette, as she swam out 10 miles before she even got tired. After 15 miles, she was too tired to go on, so she drowned. </p>
<p>So the blonde thought to herself, ""I wonder if they made it! I think I'd better try to make it, too."" So she swam out 5 miles, ten miles, 15 miles, NINETEEN miles from the island. The shore was just in sight, but she said, ""I'm too tired to go on!"" So she swam back.</p>

10127,"<p>A REALLY Bad Day</p>
<p>So you think you're having a bad day. The following is taken from a Florida newspaper:</p>
<p>A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the house in the kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle and somehow, the motorcycle slipped into gear. The man, still holding the handlebars, was dragged through a glass patio door and the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house.</p>
<p>The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room, and found her husband laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle laying next to him and the patio door shattered. The wife ran to the phone and summoned an ambulance.</p>
<p>Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of long steps to the street to direct the paramedics to her husband. After the ambulance arrived and transported the husband to the hospital, the wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas had spilled on the floor, the wife obtained some papers towels, blotted up the gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet.</p>
<p>The husband was treated at the hospital and was released to come home. After arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated.</p>
<p>The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband laying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone and called for an ambulance.</p>
<p>The same ambulance crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself. She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them tipped the stretcher and dumped the husband out. He fell down the remaining steps and broke his ankle!</p>

"
10129,"<p>At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death. Here is the story:On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide.He left a note to that effect indicating his despondency. As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned.Ordinarily, Dr. Mills continued, ""a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended"" is still defined as committing suicide. Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below at street level, but his suicide attempt probably would not have been successful because of the safety net. This caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.The room on the ninth floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus.When one intends to kill subject A, but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with the murder charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant. They both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded. The old man said it was his long standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her. Therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident, that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother.The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son was in fact Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent over both the loss of his financial support and the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth-story window. The son had actually murdered himself, so the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.</p>

"
10131,"<p>Twas the night before Christmas, </p>
<p>when all through the house </p>
<p>not a peripheral was stirring, </p>
<p>not even the mouse. </p>
<p>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, </p>
<p>in hopes that new software soon would be there. </p>
<p>The children were nestled all snug in their beds, </p>
<p>while visions of the Internet danced in their heads. </p>
<p>And Mama in her rollers, and I with a nightcap, </p>
<p>had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap. </p>
<p>When out on the Net there arose such a clatter, </p>
<p>I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. </p>
<p>Away to the monitor I flew like a flash, </p>
<p>opened the menu, and threw away hard earned cash. </p>
<p>When what to my wondering eyes should appear, </p>
<p>but an Internet website and eight links far and near. </p>
<p>With a hardware driver, so lively and quick, </p>
<p>I knew in a moment it must do the trick. </p>
<p>More rapid than eagles, the errors they came, </p>
<p>my webserver problems no longer a pain? </p>
<p>Now Egghead! Now Best Buy! Now, Shop-ko and K-Mart! </p>
<p>On Daltons! On Waldens! On, Kohls and on Wal-Mart! </p>
<p>To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! </p>
<p>Now spend your cash! Spend your cash! Spend your cash all! </p>
<p>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, </p>
<p>when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky </p>
<p>but up to my hard-drive the problems they flew, </p>
<p>with a disk full of errors and CD-Roms, too! </p>
<p>And then in a twinkling, I heard a wave file. </p>
<p>with a beep and a buzz I knew I'd be waiting awhile! </p>
<p>As I rolled up my eyes and was turning around, </p>
<p>a virtual St. Nicholas appeared with a bound. </p>
<p>Electronically dressed in fur, from head to foot, </p>
<p>his clothes were all tarnished with virtual ashes and soot. </p>
<p>A bundle of software he had flung on his back, </p>
<p>and he looked like a salesman just opening his pack. </p>
<p>His VGA eyes twinkled! His paintbrush dimples merry! </p>
<p>His pantone cheeks were like roses, his nose a cherry! </p>
<p>His downloaded mouth was drawn up like a bow, </p>
<p>and his bitmap beard was as white as the snow. </p>
<p>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, </p>
<p>and virtual smoke encircled his head like a wreath. </p>
<p>He had a GUI face and a round little belly, </p>
<p>that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. </p>
<p>He was drafted in graphics, a right jolly old elf, </p>
<p>and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself. </p>
<p>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head</p>
<p>soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. </p>
<p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, </p>
<p>and fixed all my fatal errors, then turned with a jerk. </p>
<p>And laying a finger aside of his face, </p>
<p>and giving a nod, to the hard-drive he raced. </p>
<p>He into the mist of hidden files obsessed, </p>
<p>disappeared until next year his function keys pressed. </p>
<p>But I heard him exclaim, ere he blinked out of sight, </p>
<p>Happy Christmas to all, and a web site good night!</p>

10132,"<p>Here are some basic descriptions of what may happen if airplanes had different<br /> operating systems running them.</p>
<p>DOS: Everybody pushes it till it glides, then jumps on and lets it coast till<br /> it skids, then jumps off, pushes, jumps back on, etc.</p>
<p>DOS with QEMM: Same as DOS, but with more leg room for pushing.</p>
<p>Macintosh: All the flight attendants, captains and baggage handlers look the<br /> same, act the same and talk the same. Every time you ask a question, you are<br /> told you don't need to know, don't want to know and everything will be done for<br /> you without your knowing, so just shut up.</p>
<p>OS/2: To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times<br /> by standing in 10 different lines. Then you fill out a form asking how you want<br /> your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger<br /> train or a bus. If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a<br /> wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have<br /> time to say your prayers before you crash.</p>
<p>Windows: Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to<br /> a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up<br /> without any warning whatsoever.</p>
<p>NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane<br /> uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare.<br /> Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want<br /> and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach<br /> tickets can't even get aboard.</p>
<p>Unix: Everyone brings one piece of the plane. Then they go on the runway and<br /> piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they're<br /> building.</p>
<p>CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13<br /> airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain<br /> hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don't need to know where the airplane is or who<br /> it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don't fly the airplane itself;<br /> you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don't<br /> go anywhere. But that's okay, because when the world is at your fingertips you<br /> never need to leave home.</p>

<p>The first priest says, ""I've always wanted to be an eagle, soaring above the Rocky mountains."" </p>
<p>""So be it,"" says St. Peter, and off flies the first priest. </p>
<p>The second priest mulls this over for a moment and asks, ""Will any of this week 'count', St. Peter?"" </p>
<p>""No, I told you the computer's down. There's no way we can keep track of what you're doing. The week's a freebie."" </p>
<p>""In that case,"" says the second priest, ""I've always wanted to be a stud.""</p>
<p>""So be it,"" says St. Peter, and the second priest disappears. </p>
<p>A week goes by, the computer is fixed, and the Lord tells St. Peter to recall the two priests. </p>
<p>""Will you have any trouble locating them?"" He asks. </p>
<p>""The first one should be easy,"" says St. Peter. ""He's somewhere over the Rockies, flying with the eagles. But the second one could prove to be more difficult."" </p>
<p>""Why?"" asketh the Lord. </p>
<p>St. Peter answered, ""He's on a snow tire, somewhere in North Dakota.""</p>

10154,"<p>The following are genuine snippets from essays by high school students:<br /> ""Then came the Middle Ages. King Alfred conquered the Dames, King Arthur lived in the Age of Shivery, King Harold mustered his troops before the Battle of Hastings. Joan of Arc was cannonized by Bernard Shaw, and victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. Finally, Magna Carta provided that no man should be hanged twice for the same offense."" </p>
<p>""The Renaissance was an age in which more individuals felt the value of their human being. Martin Luther was nailed to the church door at Wittenberg for selling papal indulgences. He died a horrible death, being excommunicated by a bull. It was the painter Donatello's interest in the female nude that made him the father of the Renaissance. It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Guttenberg invented the Bible. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100-foot clipper."" </p>
<p>""The government of England was a limited mockery. Henry VIII found it difficult to walk because he had an abbess on his knee. Queen Elizabeth was the ""Virgin Queen."" As a queen she was a success. When Elizabeth exposed herself before her troops they all shouted ""hurrah."" Then her navy went out and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.""</p>

They're getting bigger and more yellow!""The doctor calmly replied, ""Yes, I see. Your teeth appear a bit larger and more yellow than your last visit, but I don't think you're turning into a horse.""Getting more frustrated, the woman said, ""Well, I think I'm getting a mane! Look at all this hair on the back of my neck. It's grown 5 inches in ONE WEEK!""Becoming more concerned, the doctor said, ""You're NOT turning into a horse. We'll just shave your neck occasionally.""At this point the woman became considerably frustrated, speaking faster and louder. ""Just look at my finger and toe nails! They've become very thick and big. I'm developing HOOVES!""The doctor in amazement cried, ""Holy cow! I've never seen finger and toe nails THAT big!""Then the woman pulls up the back of her skirt and said, ""And look at this, doctor.

10172,"<p>On a farm out in the country lived a man and a woman and their three sons.</p>
<p>Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow was lying dead in the field. The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?</p>
<p>In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the husband awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.</p>
<p>Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.</p>
<p>When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank. She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and the cow to you.""</p>
<p>The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river.</p>
<p>Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river.</p>
<p>The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river.</p>
<p>The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in.</p>
<p>And there he also met the mermaid. ""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row.""</p>
<p>The young son replied, ""Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?""</p>
<p>The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, ""Why not THIRTY times in a row?""</p>
<p>Finally, she said, ""Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect health.""  Then the young son asked, ""Wait!  How do I know that thirty times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?""</p>

10179,"<p>If you are not familiar with golf, you probably won't get these. Ask your closest golf player.</p>
<p>1. Never try to keep more than 300 separate thoughts in your mind during your swing.</p>
<p>2. When your shot has to carry over a water hazard, you can either hit one more club or two more balls.</p>
<p>3. If you are afraid a full shot might reach the green while the group ahead are still putting, you have two options: you can immediately shank a lay-up, or you can wait until the green is clear and top a ball halfway there.</p>
<p>4. The less skilled the player, the more likely he is to share his ideas about the golf swing.</p>
<p>5. If it isn't broke, try changing your grip.</p>
<p>6. Golfers who claim they don't cheat also lie.</p>
<p>7. Everyone replaces his divot after a perfect approach shot.</p>
<p>8. A golf match is a test of your skill against your opponent's luck.</p>
<p>9. It's surprisingly easy to sink a 50 foot putt when you lie.</p>
<p>10. Counting on your opponent to inform you when he breaks a rule is like expecting him to make fun of his own haircut.</p>
<p>11. Nonchalant putts count the same as chalant putts.</p>
<p>12. It's not a gimme putt if you're still away.</p>
<p>13. The shortest distance between any two points on a golf course is a straight line that passes directly through the large tree.</p>
<p>14. There are two kinds of bounces: unfair bounces and bounces just the way you intended to play it.</p>
<p>15. You can hit a two-acre fairway 10% of the time and a 2-inch branch on a tree 90% of the time.</p>
<p>16. Every time a golfer makes a birdie he must subsequently make three triple bogeys to restore the fundamental equilibrium of the universe.</p>
<p>17. If you want to hit a 7-iron as far as Tiger Woods try to hit just short of a water hazard.</p>
<p>18. To calculate the speed of a player's downswing, multiply the speed of his backswing by his handicap. Example, backswing 20 miles per hour, handicap, 15, downswing 300<br /> m.p.h.</p>
<p>19. There are two things you can learn by stopping your backswing at the top and checking the position of your hands: how many hands you have, and which hand is wearing<br /> the golf glove.</p>
<p>20. Hazards attract; Fairways repel.</p>
<p>21. You can put ""draw"" on the ball, you can put ""fade"" on the ball, but no golfer can put ""straight"" on the ball.</p>
<p>22. A ball you can see in the rough from 50 yards away is not yours.</p>
<p>23. If there is a ball in the fringe and a ball in the bunker, your ball is in the bunker.</p>
<p>24. If both balls are in the sand, yours is in the footprint.</p>
<p>25. Don't buy a putter until you have had a chance to throw it.</p>
<p>26. The inevitable result of any golf lesson is the instant elimination of the one critical unconscious motion that allowed you to compensate for all your errors.</p>

<p>The next day, she went into the room, she noticed in large letters the word 'PENIS' again, this time written about halfway across the board. Again she looked around in vain for the culprit, so she proceeded with the day's lesson.</p>

<p>In order to assure the highest levels of quality work and productivity from employees, it will be our policy to keep all employees well trained, through our program of Special High Intensity Training (S.H.I.T.). </p>
<p>We are trying to give our employees more S.H.I.T. than anyone else. If you feel that you do not receive your share of S.H.I.T. on the job, please see your supervisor. You will be immediately placed at the top  of the S.H.I.T. list, and our supervisors are especially</p>
<p>skilled at seeing that you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.</p>
<p>Employees who do not take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in Departmental Employee Evaluation Program (D.E.E.P.S.H.I.T.). Those who fail to take  D.E.E.P.S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go to Employee Attitude Training (E.A.T.S.H.I.T.).</p>
<p>Since your supervisor took S.H.I.T. before they were  promoted,  they do not have to do</p>
<p>S.H.I.T. anymore, because they are full of S.H.I.T. already. If you are full of S.H.I.T. you may be interested in a job training others. We can add your name to our Basic Understanding Lecture List (B.U.L.L.S.H.I.T.). Those who are full of B.U.L.L.S.H.I.T. will get S.H.I.T. jobs, and can apply for promotion to Director of Intensity Programming (D.I.P.S.H.I.T.). </p>

10238,"<p>Let's face it - English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple.</p>
<p>English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.</p>
<p>We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.</p>
<p>And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham?</p>
<p>If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices? Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend?</p>
<p>If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it? If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship?Have noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?</p>
<p>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm goes off by going on. English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race at all). That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible.</p>

The man in the row<br /> boat told the man on the stoop to get in and he'd save him. The man on the stoop<br /> said, no, he had faith in God and would wait for God to save him. The flood<br /> waters kept rising and the man had to go to the second floor of his house. A man<br /> in a motor boat came by and told the man in the house to get in because he had<br /> come to rescue him. The man in the house said no thank you. He had perfect faith<br /> in God and would wait for God to save him. The flood waters kept rising. Pretty<br /> soon they were up to the man's roof and he got out on the roof. A helicopter<br /> then came by, lowered a rope and the pilot shouted down in the man in the house<br /> to climb up the rope because the helicopter had come to rescue him. The man in<br /> the house wouldn't get in. He told the pilot that he had faith in God and would<br /> wait for God to rescue him. The flood waters kept rising and the man in the<br /> house drowned. When he got to heaven, he asked God where he went wrong. He told<br /> God that he had perfect faith in God, but God had let him drown.<br /> ""What more do you want from me?"" asked God. ""I sent you two boats and a<br /> helicopter.""</p>

<p>Officer: There's a gun in the glove box?<br /> Driver: Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot the woman who owns this car and stuffed her in the trunk.<br /> Officer: There's a BODY in the TRUNK?!?!?<br /> Driver: Yes, sir. </p>
<p>Hearing this, the officer immediately called his captain. The car was quickly surrounded by police, and the captain approached the driver to handle the tense situation:</p>
<p>Captain: Sir, can I see your license?<br /> Driver: Sure. Here it is.  It was valid.<br /> Captain: Who's car is this?<br /> Driver: It's mine, officer. Here's the registration.</p>
<p>Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there's a gun in it?<br /> Driver: Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.<br /> Sure enough, there was nothing in the glove box.</p>
<p>Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was told you said there's a body in it.<br /> Driver: No problem. Trunk is opened; no body.</p>
<p>Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the glove-box, and that there was a body in the trunk?</p>
<p>Driver: Yeah, and I'll bet the big liar told you I was speeding too!</p>

10249,"<p>A new arrival in  Hell was brought before the devil. The devil told his demon to put the man to  work on a  rock pile with a 20-pound sledge hammer in 95 degree heat  with 95% humidity.</p>
<p>At the end  of the day, the devil went to see how the man was doing, only to find him  smiling and singing as he pounded rocks. The man explained that the heat and hard labor were very similar to those on his beloved farm back in Georgia.</p>
<p>The devil told his demon to turn up the heat to 120 degrees, with 100% humidity.  At the end of the next day, the devil again checked on the new man,and found him still happy to be sweating and straining.  The man explained that it felt like the old days, when he had to clean out his silo in the middle of August on  his beloved farm back in  Georgia.</p>
<p>At that, the devil told his demon to lower the  temperature for this man to -20 degrees with a 40 mph wind.  At the end of the next day, the devil was confident that he would find the man miserable. But, the man was instead singing louder than ever,twirling the  sledge hammer like a baton.  When the devil asked him why, he was so happy, the man answered,</p>

<p>3) Make passionate love to a dumb blonde. </p>

10253,"<p>For thirty years, Johnson had arrived at work at 9A.M. on the dot. He had never missed a day and was never late. Consequently, when on one particular day 9 A.M. passed without Johnson's arrival, it caused a sensation. All work ceased, and the boss himself, looking at his watch and muttering, came out into the corridor. Finally, precisely at ten, Johnson showed up, clothes dusty and torn, his face scratched and bruised, his glasses bent. He limped painfully to the time clock, punched in, and said, aware that all eyes were upon him, ""I tripped and rolled down two flights of stairs in the subway. Nearly killed myself."" And the boss said, ""And to roll down two flights of stairs took you a whole hour?""</p>

10257,"<p>It has become pretty obvious to us Southerners that our present<br /> astrological signs have served their purpose and that we should get rid of<br /> them.  When I'm out driving around I'll see bulls, and once in a great<br /> while I suppose I'll even see a ram.  Up the street from me there's some<br /> twins, but I don't see them much. The rest of these things are just too<br /> obscure.  You only see crabs on vacation. There are no lions or scorpions,<br /> not many archers and no damn water bearers.  Virgins? The neighborhood's<br /> not crawling with them either.  SO, what we need here is some relevance. We<br /> need things we can recognize up there in the night sky.</p>
<p>OKRA  Dec 22 - Jan 20</p>
<p>Although you appear crude, you are actually very slick on the inside. Okra<br /> have tremendous influence. An older Okra can look back over his life and<br /> see the seeds of his influence everywhere. Stay away from Moon Pies.</p>
<p>CHITLIN  Jan 21 - Feb 19</p>
<p>Chitlins often come from humble backgrounds.  Many times they're<br /> uncomfortable talking about just where they came from. A chitlin, however,<br /> can make something of himself if he's motivated and has plenty of<br /> seasoning. When it comes to dealing with Chitlins, be very careful.<br /> Chitlins can burn and then erupt like Vesuvius, and this can make for a<br /> really terrible mess. Chitlins are best with Catfish and Okra.  Remember<br /> that when marriage time rolls around.</p>
<p>BOLL WEEVIL  Feb 20 - Mar 20</p>
<p>You have an overwhelming curiosity. You're unsatisfied with the surface of<br /> things, and you feel the need to bore deep into the interior of everything.<br /> Needless to say, you are very intense and driven as if you had some inner<br /> hunger. Nobody in their right mind is going to marry you, so don't worry<br /> about it.</p>
<p>MOON PIE  Mar 21 - Apr 20</p>
<p>You're the type that spends a lot of time on the front porch. It's a cinch<br /> to recognize the physical appearance of Moon Pies. ""Big"" and ""round"" are<br /> the key words here. You should marry anybody who you can get remotely<br /> interested in the idea. It's not going to be easy.  This might be the year<br /> to think about aerobics. Maybe not.</p>
<p>POSSUM  Apr 21 - May 21</p>
<p>When confronted with life's difficulties, possums have a marked tendency to<br /> withdraw and develop a ""don't-bother-me-about-it"" attitude.  Sometimes you<br /> become so withdrawn, people actually think you're dead. This strategy is<br /> probably not psychologically healthy, but seems to work for you.  One day,<br /> however, it won't work, and you may find your problems actually running you<br /> over.</p>
<p>CRAWFISH  May 22 - Jun 21</p>
<p>Crawfish is a water sign. If you work in an office, you're always hanging<br /> around the water cooler. Crawfish prefer the beach to the mountains, the<br /> pool to the golf course, the bathtub to the livingroom. You tend not to be<br /> particularly attractive physically, but you have very, very good heads.</p>

<p>Collards have a genius for communication. They love to get in the ""melting<br /> pot"" of life and share their essence with the essences of those around<br /> them. Collards make good social workers, psychologists, and baseball<br /> managers.  As far as your personal life goes, if you are Collards, stay<br /> away from Moon  Pies. It just won't work.  Save yourself a lot of<br /> heartache.</p>
<p>CATFISH  Jul 24 - Aug 23</p>
<p>Catfish are traditionalists in matters of the heart, with one exception:<br /> Whiskers may cause problems for loved ones. You catfish are never easy<br /> people to understand.  You prefer the muddy bottoms to the clear surface of<br /> life. Above all else, Catfish should stay away from Moon Pies.</p>
<p>GRITS  Aug 24 - Sep 23</p>
<p>Your highest aim is to be with others like yourself. You like to huddle<br /> together with a big crowd of other Grits. You love to travel, though, so<br /> maybe you should think about joining a club. Where do you like to go?<br /> Anywhere they have cheese or gravy or bacon or butter or eggs. If you can<br /> go somewhere where they have all these things, that serves you well.</p>
<p>BOILED PEANUTS  Sep 24 - Oct 23</p>
<p>You have a passionate desire to help your fellow man. Unfortunately, those<br /> who know you best --your friends and loved ones-- may find that your<br /> personality is much too salty, and their criticism will probably affect you<br /> deeply because you are really much softer than you appear. You should go<br /> right ahead and marry anybody you want to because in a certain way, yours<br /> is a charmed life.  On the road of life, you can be sure that people will<br /> always pull over and stop for you.</p>
<p>BUTTER BEAN  Oct 24 - Nov 22</p>
<p>Always invite a Butter Bean because Butter Beans get along well with<br /> everybody. You, as a Butter Bean, should be proud. You've grown on the vine<br /> of life and you feel at home no matter what the setting. You can sit next<br /> to anybody. However, you, too, shouldn't have anything to do with Moon<br /> Pies.</p>
<p>ARMADILLO  Nov 23 - Dec 21</p>
<p>You have a tendency to develop a tough exterior, but you are actually quite<br /> gentle. A good evening for you? Old friends, a fire, some roots, fruit,<br /> worms and insects. You are a throwback. You're not concerned with today's<br /> fashions and trends. You're not concerned with anything about today. You're<br /> really almost prehistoric in your interests and behavior patterns. You<br /> probably want to marry another Armadillo, but Possum is another, somewhat<br /> kinky, mating possibility.</p>

While they were hiking they were attacked by 2 bears, one male and one female. The male bear dismembered and ate the Czechslovakian guy, but the lawyer managed to escape. He ran straight to the nearest Rangers station, and told them what had happened, and they sent out a group of rangers to see what was going on. Sure enough, the Rangers arrived at the place that the lawyer mentioned, and there were the female and the male bears. So one of the Rangers took his rifle and shot the female.

So she announced, ""I'm going to try to swim to shore.""  So she swam out five miles, and got really tired.  She swam out ten miles from the island, and she was too tired to go on, so she drowned. The second one, the redhead, said to herself, ""I wonder if she made it. I guess it's better to try to get to the mainland than stay here and starve."" So she attempts to swim out.  The redhead had a lot more endurance than the brunette, as she swam out 10 miles before she even got tired.  After 15 miles, she was too tired to go on, so she drowned. So the blonde thought to herself, ""I wonder if they made it!  I think I'd better try to make it, too.""  So she swam out 5 miles, ten miles, 15 miles, NINETEEN miles from the island.  The shore was just in sight, but she said, ""I'm too tired to go on!""  So she swam back.</p>

10322,"<p>Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound. Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one. Moses turned to Jesus and said, ""I hate playing with your Dad.""</p>

10333,"<p>WITH CHARITY ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE </p>
<p>1. This epistle comes to you from Philippi. Grace be to you and peace. Spiritual gifts will be delivered unto you within four days of receiving this letter--providing you in turn send it on. </p>
<p>2. This is no joke. Send copies to whomsoever among the gentiles or superstitious peoples of other denominations you would comfort in all their tribulation. Do not send material things. Charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up. </p>
<p>3. While visiting the Household of Stephanas, a Macedonian proconsul received the epistle and was greeted by his brethren by a holy kiss. But he broke the chain, and now he is become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal </p>
<p>4. Gaius bestowed all his goods to feed the poor, and gave his body to be burned, but it profited him nothing. He failed to circulate the letter. However, before his death, he received the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. </p>
<p>5. Do note the following: Crispius had the gift of prophecy, and understood all mysteries, and all knowledge, and had all faith, so that he aould remove mountains. But he forgot that the epistle had to leave his hands within 96 hours, and now he is nothing. </p>
<p>6. In A.D. 37, the epistle was received by a young Galatian woman who put it aside to copy and send out later. She was plagued by various problems: thrice she was beaten with rods, once she was stoned, and thrice suffered shipwreck. On the last day of these occasions, she spent a night and day in the deep. Finally, she copied the letter. A trumpet sounded, and she was raised incorruptible. </p>

10346,"<p>After his graduation from college, the son of a Spanish lawyer was considering his future. He went to his father and asked if he might be given a desk in the corner from which he could observe his father�s activities and be introduced to his father�s clients as a clerk. His observations would help him decide whether or not to become a lawyer. His father thought this was a great idea and immediately helped to set it up.The first client the next morning was a tenant farmer--a rough man with calloused hands who was dressed in workman�s clothing. He said,""Mr. Lawyer, I work for the Gonzales farm on the east side of town. For many years I have tended their crops and animals, including some cows. I have raised the cows, fed them and looked after them. And I was always given the understanding and the belief that I was the owner of these cows. Now Mr. Gonzales has died and his son has inherited the farm. He believes that since the cows were raised on his land and ate his hay, the cows are his. In short, we are in dispute over who owns the cows.""The lawyer said, ""Thank you. I have heard enough. I will take your case. Don't worry about the cows!""The next client to come in, a young and well-dressed young man, was obviously a landowner. He said, ""My name is Gonzales and I own a farm on the east side of town. We have a tenant farmer who has worked for my family for many years, tending crops and the animals, including some cows. I believe the cows belong to me because they were raised on my land and were fed my hay. But the tenant farmer believes they are his because he raised them and cared for them. In short, we are in dispute over who owns the cows.""The lawyer said, ""Thank you. I have heard enough. I will take your case. Don't worry about the cows!""After the client left, the lawyer�s son could not help but express his concern. ""Father, I know very little about the law, but it seems we have a very serious problem concernng these cows.""""Don�t worry about the cows!"" the lawyer said. ""The cows will be ours!""</p>

10355,"<p>Once upon a time there lived a king. The king had a beautiful daughter, the princess. But there was a problem. Everything the princess touched would melt. </p>
<p>No matter what; metal, wood,plastic - anything she touched would melt! Because of this, men were afraid of her. Nobody would dare marry her. </p>
<p>The king despaired. What could he do to help his daughter?  He consulted his wizards and magicians. One wizard told the king, ""If your daughter touches one thing that does not melt in her hands, she will be cured."" </p>
<p>The king was overjoyed. The next day, he held a competition. Any man that could bring his daughter an object that would not melt would marry her and inherit the king's wealth. Three young princes took up the challenge. </p>
<p>The first prince brought a very hard alloy of titanium. But alas, once the princess touched it, it melted. The prince went away sadly. </p>
<p>The second prince brought a huge diamond, thinking that diamond is the hardest substance in the world and will not melt. But alas, once the princess touched it, it melted. He too went away disappointed. </p>
<p>The third prince approached. He told the princess, ""Put your hand in my pocket and feel what is in there.""  The princess did as she was asked, though she turned red. She felt something hard. She held it in her hand. And it did not melt!!! </p>
<p>The king was overjoyed. Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed. And the third prince married the princess and they both lived happily ever after. </p>

10370,"<p>A dog walks into a butcher shop with a purse strapped around his neck. He walks up to the meat case and calmly sits there until it's his turn to be helped. A man, who was already in the butcher shop, finished his purchase and noticed the dog. The butcher leaned over the counter and asked the dog what it wanted today. The dog put its paw on the glass case in front of the ground beef, and the butcher said, ""How many pounds?""<br /> The dog barked twice, so the butcher made a package of two pounds ground beef. </p>

10419,"<p>Veteran Pillsbury spokesman Pop N. Fresh died yesterday of a severe yeast<br /> infection. </p>
<p>He was 71, Fresh was buried in one of the largest funeral ceremonies in<br /> recent years. Dozens of celebrities turned out including Mrs. Butterworth,<br /> the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty Crocker, and the Hostess<br /> Twinkies. The gravesite was piled high with flours as longtime friend Aunt<br /> Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who ""never knew how<br /> much he was kneaded.""</p>
<p>Fresh rose quickly in show business, but later in his life his career was<br /> filled with many turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie,<br /> wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Still, even as a crusty<br /> old man, he was a roll model for millions.</p>
<p>Fresh is survived by his second wife. They have two children and one in<br /> the oven. The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Seamus pulls a parrot out of the bag and Paddy notices that in the other hand<br /> Seamus is carrying a gun. </p>
<p>""Watch this Paddy"" he says, as he launches himself over the edge of the cliff. </p>
<p>Paddy watches as half way down Seamus takes the gun and blows the parrot''s<br /> head off. Seamus continues to plummet until he joins Sean''s mashed remains at<br /> the bottom of the cliff. </p>
<p>Paddy shakes his head and says, ""An'' oim never troyin'' that parrotshooting<br /> oider..."" </p>

<p>Dan pulls a chicken out of the bag. He puts the chicken above his head, holds<br /> its legs and launches himself off the cliff with the usual result. </p>

10465,"<p>Miss Bea was in her eighties, and much admired for her sweetness and kindness<br /> to all. The pastor came to call on her one afternoon early in the spring, and<br /> she welcomed him into her Victorian parlor. She invited him to have a seat while<br /> she prepared a little tea.<br /> As he sat facing her old pump organ, the young minister noticed a cut-glass<br /> bowl sitting on top of it, filled with water. In the water floated, of all<br /> things, a condom. Imagine his shock and surprise. Imagine his curiosity! Surely<br /> Miss Bea had flipped or something! But he certainly couldn't mention the strange<br /> sight in her parlor.<br /> When she returned with tea and cookies, they began to chat. The pastor tried<br /> to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water and its strange floater, but<br /> soon it got the better of him, and he could resist no longer. ""Miss Bea"", he<br /> said, gesturing toward the bowl,� I wonder if you would tell me about this""<br /> ""Oh, yes"", she replied, "" Isn't it wonderful? I was walking downtown last fall<br /> and I found this little package. It said to put it on the organ and keep it wet,<br /> and it would prevent disease. And you know, I think its working!

This must be a sign from God. God must have meant that we should meet<br /> and be friends and live together in peace the rest of our days.""<br /> The priest replies, ""I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from<br /> God."" The rabbi continues, �And looks at this. Here's another miracle. My car is<br /> completely demolished but this bottle of Morgan David wine didn't break. Surely<br /> God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune.""<br /> Then he hands the bottle to the priest. The priest agrees, takes a few big<br /> swigs, and hands the bottle back to the rabbi. The rabbi takes the bottle,<br /> immediately puts the cap on, and hands it back to the priest.<br /> The priest asks, ""Aren't you having any?""<br /> The rabbi replies, ""No...I think I'll wait for the police.""</p>

<p>Blonde #2 was taking a bath, and was draining the tub because it was too cold. With her hair still dry, she said to herself, ""Was I getting in the tub or out of the tub?"" She stood there, just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Blonde #3 was sitting in the living room in front of the coffee table, and she said to herself, ""Knock on wood I'm not as stupid as the other two!"" She knocked the table and sat there puzzled: ""Was that the front door or the back door?</p>

<p>Before the service starts, the townspeople sit in their pews and talk about<br /> their lives, their families, etc.</p>
<p>Suddenly, at the altar, Satan appears!! </p>
<p>Everyone starts screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each<br /> other in their determined efforts to get away from Evil Incarnate.</p>
<p>Soon, everyone is evacuated from the church except for one man, who sit calmly<br /> in his pew, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy is in his<br /> presence. </p>
<p>This confuses Satan a bit. Satan walks up to the man and says, ""Hey, don't you<br /> know who I am?""</p>
<p>The man says, ""Yep, sure do.""</p>
<p>Satan says, ""Well, aren't you afraid of me?""</p>

<p>""Sure,"" says the Saint. ""But first you have to confess your sins. What bad<br /> things have you done in your life?""</p>
<p>Clinton bites his lip and answers, ""Well, I tried marijuana, but you can't<br /> call it 'dope-smoking' because I didn't inhale. There were inappropriate<br /> extramarital relationships, but you can't call it 'adultery' because I didn't<br /> have full 'sexual relations.' And I made some statements that were misleading,<br /> but legally accurate, but you can't call it 'bearing false witness' because, as<br /> far as I know, it didn't meet the legal standard of perjury.""</p>

<p>The man waited until the woman had reached the second tee and asked if she would like to join him and they could finish the round together. To his surprise the woman agreed and they played the remaining holes. Not only was this woman beautiful, she was also a good golfer. When they completed their round, the man told the woman that he was a cordon bleu chef and wine buff. </p>
<p>He invited her back to his place for a meal and a few drinks. The woman accepted enthusiastically and off they went. Back at the house the man cooked a magnificent meal. In fact it was more than just cooking it was a performance do behold. They enjoyed good food, good wine and good conversation. The man was so taken by the beauty and skill of this woman and desired her no end. </p>
<p>He then asked if she would like to play golf the following morning, to which she agreed. Once again they enjoyed a great game of golf, a magnificent evening meal. This went on for three weeks when the lawyer finally said to the woman, ""Listen, the golf and the company have been fantastic! But, there are only so many performances a man can take.

10493,"<p>Here are some basic descriptions of what may happen if airplanes had different operating systems running them.DOS: Everybody pushes it till it glides, then jumps on and lets it coast till it skids, then jumps off, pushes, jumps back on, etc.DOS with QEMM:  Same as DOS, but with more leg room for pushing.Macintosh:  All the flight attendants, captains and baggage handlers look the same, act the same and talk the same.  Every time you ask a question, you are told you don't need to know, don't want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can't even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.  Then they go on the runway and piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they're building.CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13 airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don't need to know where the airplane is or who it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don't fly the airplane itself; you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don't go anywhere. But that's okay, because when the world is at your fingertips you never need to leave home.</p>

<p>Jim calls out to his golfing partner in excitement, ""Hey Bob, come here, I got trouble down here.""</p>
<p>Bob comes running over to the edge of the ravine and calls out, ""What's the matter Jim?""</p>
<p>Jim shouts back in a nervous voice, ""Throw me my 7-iron...<br /> You can't get out of here with an 8-iron!""</p>

10512,"<p>One day three midgets were sitting around the table drinking tea and having crumpets.<br /> The first midget says to the other two, ""You know, I think I have the smallest hands in the world.""

<p>The third midget joins in with, ""I'm going too because I think I have the smallest penis in the world. Let's go!"" </p>
<p>So the midgets set off to the offices of the Guiness Book of World Records. </p>
<p>When they arrive, the first midget is called in and is gone for awile. Finally he comes out very excited. ""I made it! They measured my hands, and sure enough they are the smallest in the world. I'm in the record book!!"" </p>
<p>The second midget is called in, and soon he comes out very excited. ""I made it too! They measured my feet and sure enough, they are the smallest in the world. I'm in the record book, too!!"" </p>

<p>Very excited to be in such a great seat for the game, Bob said to the man next to him, ""This is incredible! Who in their right mind would have a seat like this at the Super Bowl and not use it?!""</p>

<p>Her story:<br /> Well, Ed was in an odd mood when I got to the bar. I thought it might have been me because I was a bit late but he didn't say anything much about it, but the conversation was quite slow going, so I thought we should go off somewhere more intimate so we could talk more privately, so we go to this restaurant and he's still a bit funny and I'm trying to cheer him up and start to wonder whether it's me or something, so I ask him and he says no, but you know I'm not really sure, so anyway, in the cab back to his house I say that I love him and he just puts his arm around me and I don't know what the hell that means, because you know he doesn't say it back or anything, so when we get back to his place I'm wondering if he's going off me and so I try to ask him about it but he just switches on the TV and so I say I'm going to go to sleep and then after about 10 minutes he joins me and we have sex but he seemed really distracted and so afterwards I just want to leave and, I dunno, I just don't know what he thinks any more, I mean, do you think he's met someone else?</p>
<p>His story:<br /> Shit day at work. Great shag later.</p>

10519,"<p>After many years of marriage, a husband has turned into a couch potato, became<br /> completely inattentive to his wife and sat guzzling beer and watching TV all<br /> day. The wife was dismayed because no matter what she did to attract the<br /> husband's attention, he'd just shrug her off with some bored comment.</p>
<p>This went on for many months and the wife was going crazy with boredom. Then<br /> one day at a pet store, the wife saw this big, ugly, snorting bird with a hairy<br /> chest, powerful hairy forearms, beady eyes and dribble running down the side of<br /> its mouth.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper, observing her fascination with the bird, told her it was a<br /> special imported ""Goony bird"" and it had a very peculiar trait. To demonstrate,<br /> he exclaimed, ""Goony bird! The table!""</p>
<p>Immediately, the Goony bird flew off its perch and with single-minded fury<br /> attacked the table and smashed it into a hundred little pieces with its powerful<br /> forearms and claws! To demonstrate some more, the shopkeeper said, ""Goony bird!<br /> The shelf!""</p>
<p>Again the Goony bird turned to the shelf and demolished it in seconds.</p>
<p>""Wow!"" said the wife, ""If this doesn't attract my husband's attention, nothing<br /> will!"" So she bought the bird and took it home.</p>
<p>When she entered the house, the husband was, as usual, sprawled on the sofa<br /> guzzling beer and watching the game. ""Honey!"" she exclaimed, ""I've got a<br /> surprise for you! A Goony bird!""</p>
<p>The husband, in his usual bored tone replied, ""Goony Bird, my foot!""</p>

10520,"<p>Divine Press Release</p>
<p>Turmoil rocked Heaven this morning as allegations arose that God had had<br /> an affair with a former worshipper. The scandal was begun when a 21 year<br /> old woman, known only as Mary, claimed that she had given birth to God's<br /> ""only son"" last week in a barn in the hamlet of Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Sources close to Mary claim that she ""had loved God for a long time"", that<br /> she was constantly talking about her relationship with God, and that she<br /> was ""thrilled to have had his child."" In a press conference this morning,<br /> God issued a vehement denial, saying that ""No sexual relationship<br /> existed"", and that ""the facts of this story will come out in time, verily"".</p>
<p>Independent counsel Kenneth Beelzebub immediately filed a brief with the<br /> Justice department to expand his investigation to cover questions of<br /> whether any commandments may have been broken, and whether God had<br /> illegally funneled laundered money to his illegitimate child through three<br /> foreign operatives know only as the ""Wise Men"". Beelzebub has issued<br /> subpoenas to several angels who are rumored to have acted as go-betweens<br /> in the affair.</p>
<p>Critics have pointed out that these allegations have little to do with the<br /> charges that Beelzebub was originally appointed to investigate, that God<br /> had created large-scale flooding in order to cover up evidence of a failed<br /> land deal.</p>
<p>In recent months, Beelzebub's investigation has already been expanded to<br /> cover questions surrounding the large number of locusts that plagued God's<br /> political opponents in the last election, as well as to claims that the<br /> destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah was to divert attention<br /> away from a scandal involving whether the giveaway of a parcel of public<br /> land in Promised County to a Jewish special interest group was quid pro<br /> quo for political contributions.</p>
<p>If these allegations prove to be true, then this could be a huge blow to<br /> God's career, much of which has been spent crusading for stricter moral<br /> standards and harsher punishments for wrongdoers. Indeed, God recently<br /> outlined a ""tough-on-crime"" plan consisting of a series of 10<br /> ""Commandments"", which has been introduced in Congress in a bill by Rep.<br /> Moses. Critics of the bill have pointed out that it lacks any provisions<br /> for the rehabilitation of criminals, and lawyers for the ACLU are planning<br /> to fight the ""Name in Vain"" Commandment as being an unconstitutional<br /> restriction on free speech.</p>

When TV executives need a new<br /> concept, they turn on this computer; after sorting through millions of possible<br /> plot premises, it spits out, ""THREE QUIRKY BUT ATTRACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING IN<br /> AN APARTMENT,"" and the executives turn this concept into a show. The next time<br /> they need an idea, the computer spits out, ""SIX QUIRKY BUT ATTRACTIVE YOUNG<br /> PEOPLE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT."" Then the next time, it spits out, ""FOUR QUIRKY<br /> BUT ATTRACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT."" And so on. We need to<br /> locate this computer and destroy it with hammers.</p>

<p>18. The value of advertising is that it tells you the exact opposite of what<br /> the advertiser actually thinks. For example:<br /> - If the advertisement says ""This is not your father's Oldsmobile,"" the<br /> advertiser is desperately concerned that this Oldsmobile, like all other<br /> Oldsmobile�s, appeals primarily to your father.<br /> - If Coke and Pepsi spend billions of dollars to convince you that there are<br /> significant differences between these two products, both companies realize that<br /> Pepsi and Coke are virtually identical.<br /> - If an advertisement shows a group of cool, attractive youngsters getting<br /> excited and high-fiving each other because the refrigerator contains Sunny<br /> Delight, the advertiser knows that any real youngster who reacted in this way to<br /> this beverage would be considered by his peers to be the world's biggest dip.<br /> - And so on those rare occasions when advertising dares to poke fun at the<br /> product - as in the classic Volkswagen Beetle campaign - it's because the<br /> advertiser actually thinks the product is pretty good. If a politician ever ran<br /> for president under a slogan such as ""Harlan Frubert: Basically, He Wants<br /> Attention,"" I would quit my job to work for his campaign.</p>
<p>19. If there really is a God who created the entire universe with all of its<br /> glories, and He decides to deliver a message to humanity, He will not use, as<br /> His messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle.</p>

After years and years of practice they called in and asked to perform. They had to prove they were good enough so the mailed the host of MTV a video. A few days later they all found out they did make it to MTV so they rehearsed plenty of times and had everything going perfect. They were going to be the greatest performers ever. After driving for about 20 hours they were tired but still planned to be great the next day. They arrived on the set of MTV to perform. The blonde was suppose to be in charge of the drumrole when the host said to do so. He said,""Ladies and gentlemen, listen up for the new pop stars of 2002."" Then opened an envelope and said ""Could I get a drumrole please?"" So the blonde picked up the drum, roled it across the stage and hit the host and killed him therefor they were not excepted to perform anywhere else and were locked up for a cuople years.</p>

10595,"<p>A couple has a male friend who's visiting from out-of-state, when an unexpected blizzard blows in, and keeps him from traveling. Since the couple has no guest room, he states his intention to find a nearby hotel, and be on his way in the morning.""Nonsense,"" says the wife. ""Our bed is plenty big enough for all three of us, and we're all friends here."" The husband concurs, and before long they're settled in: husband in the middle, wife on his left, friend on his right.After a while, the husband begins snoring, and the wife sneaks over to the friend's side of the bed, and invites him to have sex with her. Naturally, he'd like to, but he's reluctant. ""We're in the same bed with your husband! He'll wake up, and he'll kill me.""""Don't worry about it,"" she says, ""he's such a sound sleeper, he'll never notice. If you don't believe me, just yank a hair off of his ass. He won't even wake up.""So the friend yanks a hair off the husband's butt, and sure enough, she's right. Her husband sleeps right through having a hair yanked out of his ass. So, she and the friend have sex, and then she goes back to her side of the bed.After about twenty minutes, though, she's back on his side of the bed, asking him to do it again. The same argument follows, another hair is yanked from the husband's rear end, and again they have sex.This keeps up for about half the night, until after about the sixth time, when the wife goes back to her side.Then the husband rolls over, and whispers to his friend, ""I don't mind that you're shagging my wife, but do you really have to use my ass as your scoreboard?""</p>

10597,"<p>It seems the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a unique device for testing the strength of windshields on airplanes. The device is a gun that launches a dead chicken at a plane's windshield at approximately the speed the plane flies.The theory is that if the windshield doesn't crack from the carcass impact, it'll survive a real collision with a bird during flight. It seems the British were very interested in this and wanted to test a windshield on a brand new, speedy locomotive they're developing.They borrowed the FAA's chicken launcher, loaded the chicken and fired. The ballistic chicken shattered the windshield, went through the engineer's chair, broke an instrument panel and embedded itself in the back wall of the engine cab. The British were stunned and asked the FAA to recheck the test to see if everything was done correctly.The FAA reviewed the test thoroughly and had one recommendation: ""Use a thawed chicken.""</p>

<p>The children are doing well. Tommy is seven now and is a bright, handsome boy. He has developed quite an interest in the arts. He drew a family portrait for a school project, all the figures were good, and the back of your head is very realistic. You should be very proud of him. </p>

She still remembers that you spent the whole afternoon with us on her birthday. What a grand day for Jenny, despite the fact that it was stormy and the electricity was out. </p>
<p>I am doing well. I went blonde about a year ago, and discovered that it really is more fun! George, I mean, Mr. Wilson the department head, has uh, taken an interest in my career and has become a good friend to us all. </p>
<p>I discovered that the household chores are much easier since I realized that you didn't mind being vacuumed but that feather dusting made you sneeze. The house is in good shape. I had the living room painted last spring; I'm sure you noticed it. I made sure that the painters cut holes in the drop sheet so you wouldn't be disturbed. </p>
<p>Well, my dear, I must be going. Uncle George, uh, Mr. Wilson, I mean, is taking us all on a ski trip and there is packing to do. I have hired a housekeeper to take care of things while we are away, she'll keep things in order, fill your coffee cup and bring your meals to your desk, just the way you like it. </p>
<p>I hope you and the computer will have a lovely time while we are gone. Tommy, Jenny and I will think of you often. Try to remember us while your disks are booting. </p>

<p>On the final day of his visit, the Russian ambassador said ""As your stay is coming to an end, it is time for you to play our traditional game, Russian roulette. One of the six chambers of this gun is loaded - you spin the cylinder,point the gun at your head, and pull the trigger."" </p>

10609,"<p>A timeless lesson on how consultants can make a difference for an  organization... </p>
<p>Last week, we took some friends out to a new restaurant, and  noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his  shirt pocket. </p>
<p>It seemed a little strange, but I ignored it. However, when the  busboy brought out water and utensils, I noticed he also had a  spoon in his shirt pocket, then looked around the room and saw  that all the staff had spoons in their pockets. </p>
<p>When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, ""Why the  spoon?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" he explained, ""the restaurant's owners hired Anderson  Consulting, experts in efficiency, in order to revamp all our  processes. After several months of statistical analysis, they  concluded that customers drop their spoons 73.84 percent more  often than any other utensil. This represents a drop frequency of  approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel is  prepared to deal with that contingency, we can reduce the number  of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift."" </p>
<p>As luck would have it I dropped my spoon and he was able to  replace it with his spare spoon. ""I'll get another spoon next time I  go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right  now."" I was rather impressed. </p>
<p>The waiter served our main course and I continued to look around. I  then noticed that there was a very thin string hanging out of the  waiter's fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the  same string hanging from their flies. My curiosity got the better of  me and before he walked off, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but  can you tell me why you have that string right there?"" </p>
<p>""Oh, certainly!"" he answered, lowering his voice. ""Not everyone is  as observant as you. That consulting firm I mentioned also found  out that we can save time in the restroom."" ""How so?"" ""See,"" he  continued, ""by tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can  pull it out over the urinal without touching it and that way eliminate  the need to wash the hands, shortening the time spent in the  restroom by 76.39 percent."" </p>
<p>""Okay, that makes sense, but . . . if the string helps you get it out,  how do you put it back in?"" </p>
<p>""Well,"" he whispered, lowering his voice even further, ""I don't know  about the others, but I use the spoon.""</p>

10610,"<p>In a small southern town there was a ""Nativity Scene"" that showed great skill and talent had gone into creating it. One small feature bothered me.The three wise men were wearing firemen's helmets.Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation, I left. At a ""Quik Stop"" on the edge of town, I asked the lady behind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling at me, ""You stupid Yankees never do read the Bible!"" I assured her that I did, but simply couldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible.She jerked her Bible from behind the counter and ruffled through some pages, and finally jabbed her finger at a passage. Sticking it in my face she said ""See, it says right here, 'The three wise man came from afar.'""</p>

His depression is enhanced by the fact that, from the next room he hears cries of, ""ONE, TWO, THREE...HUH!"" all night long. </p>

10626,"<p>There were two men who played golf together frequently. One was several strokes better than the other. The lesser player was very proud, and never wanted to take any strokes to even up the game.<br /> One Saturday morning, he shows up with a gorilla at the first tee. He says to his friend, ""I've been trying to beat you for so long that I'm about ready to give up. But, I heard about this golfing gorilla, and I was wondering if it would be alright if he plays for me today. In fact if you're game, I'd like to try to get back all the money I've lost to you this year. I figure comes to about a thousand bucks. Are you willing?"" </p>
<p>The other guy thought about it for a minute, and then decided to play the gorilla. ""After all, how good could a gorilla be at golf?"" he thought. </p>
<p>Well, the first hole was a straightaway par 4 of 450 yards. The guy hits a beautiful tee shot, 275 yards down the middle, leaving himself a 6 iron to the green. The gorilla takes a few powerful practice swings and then laces the ball 450 yards, right at the pin, stopping about 6 inches away from the hole. </p>
<p>The guy turns to his friend and says ""That's incredible, I would have never believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. But, you know what, I've seen enough. I've got no interest in being totally humiliated by this gorilla golfing machine. You send this frigging gorilla back to where he comes from. I need a drink; better make it a double, and I'll write you a check."" </p>
<p>After handing over the check, and well into his second double the guy asks, ""By the way, how's that gorilla's putting?"" </p>
<p>The other guy replies, ""Same as his driving."" </p>
<p>""That good, huh?"" </p>
<p>""No, I mean, he hits putts the same way - 450 yards, right down the middle!""</p>

10715,"<p>This past fall semester, at Duke University, there were two<br /> sophomores who were taking Organic Chemistry and who did pretty<br /> well on all of the quizzes and the midterms and labs, etc., such<br /> that going into the final they had a solid 'A'. These two<br /> friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend<br /> before finals week, even though the Chem final was on Monday,<br /> they decided to go up to University of Virginia and party with<br /> some friends up there. So they did this and had a great time.<br /> However, with their hangovers and everything, they overslept all<br /> day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday<br /> morning.</p>
<p>Rather than taking the final then, what they did was to find<br /> Professor Aldric after the final and explain to him why they<br /> missed the final. They told him that they went up to UVA for the<br /> weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that<br /> they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and<br /> couldn't get help for a long time and so were late getting back<br /> to campus.</p>
<p>Aldric thought this over and then agreed that they could make up<br /> the final on the following day. The two guys were elated and<br /> relieved. So, they studied that night and went in the next day<br /> at the time that Aldric had told them. He placed them in<br /> separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet and told<br /> them to begin.</p>
<p>They looked at the first problem, which was something simple<br /> about free radical formation and was worth 5 points. ""Cool"" they<br /> thought, ""this is going to be easy."" They did that problem and<br /> then turned the page. They were unprepared, however, for what<br /> they saw on the next page.</p>

<p>At 3:37 a.m. on a Sunday, I had just looked at the clock to determine my annoyance level, when I received a frantic phone call from a new user of a Macintosh Plus. She had gotten her entire family out of the house and was calling from her neighbor's. She had just received her first system error and interpreted the picture of the bomb on the screen as a warning that the computer was going to blow up. </p>

<p>Tech Support: ""I need you to right-click on the Open Desktop.""<br /> Customer: ""Ok.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Did you get a pop-up menu?""<br /> Customer: ""No.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Ok. Right click again. Do you see a pop-up menu?""<br /> Customer: ""No.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Ok, sir. Can you tell me what you have done up until this point?""<br /> Customer: ""Sure, you told me to write 'click' and I wrote 'click'.""<br /> At this point I had to put the caller on hold to tell the rest of the tech support staff what had happened. I couldn't, however, stop from giggling when I got back to the call.)<br /> Tech Support: ""Ok, did you type 'click' with the keyboard?""<br /> Customer: ""I have done something dumb, right?""</p>

<p>Customer: ""I received the software update you sent, but I am still getting the same error message.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Did you install the update?""<br /> Customer: ""No. Oh, am I supposed to install it to get it to work?"" </p>

<p>Customer: ""I'm having a problem installing your software. I've got a fairly old computer, and when I type 'INSTALL', all it says is 'Bad command or file name'.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Ok, check the directory of the A: drive-go to A:&gt;  and type 'dir'.""<br /> Customer reads off a list of file names, including 'INSTALL.EXE'.<br /> Tech Support: ""All right, the correct file is there. Type 'INSTALL' again.""<br /> Customer: ""Ok."" (pause) ""Still says 'Bad command or file name'.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Hmmm. The file's there in the correct place-it can't help but do something. Are you sure you're typing I-N-S-T-A-L-L and hitting the Enter key?""<br /> Customer: ""Yes, let me try it again."" (pause) ""Nope, still 'Bad command or file name'.""<br /> Tech Support: (now really confused) ""Are you sure you're typing I-N-S-T-A-L-L and hitting the key that says 'Enter'?""<br /> Customer: ""Well, yeah.

You sent me a bad disk, it got stuck in my drive, now it won't work at all.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Did it not install properly? What kind of error messages did you get?""<br /> Customer: ""I didn't get any error message. The disk got stuck in the drive and wouldn't come out. So I got these pliers and tried to get it out. That didn't work either.""<br /> Tech Support: ""You did what sir?""<br /> Customer: ""I got these pliers, and tried to get the disk out, but it wouldn't budge. I just ended up cracking the plastic stuff a bit.""<br /> Tech Support: ""I don't understand sir, did you push the eject button?""<br /> Customer: ""No, so then I got a stick of butter and melted it and used a turkey baster and put the butter in the drive, around the disk, and that got it loose. Then I used the pliers and it came out fine. I can't believe you would send me a disk that was broke and defective.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Let me get this clear. You put melted butter in your A: drive and used pliers to pull the disk out?""<br /> At this point, I put the call on the speaker phone and motioned at the other techs to listen in.<br /> Tech Support: ""Just so I am absolutely clear on this, can you repeat what you just said?""<br /> Customer: ""I said I put butter in my A: drive to get your crappy disk out, then I had to use pliers to pull it out.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Did you push that little button that was sticking out when the disk was in the drive, you know, the thing called the disk eject button?"" Silence.<br /> Tech Support: ""Sir?""<br /> Customer: ""Yes.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Sir, did you push the eject button?""<br /> Customer: ""No, but you people are going to fix my computer, or I am going to sue you for breaking my computer?""<br /> Tech Support: ""Let me get this straight. You are going to sue our company because you put the disk in the A: drive, didn't follow the instructions we sent you, didn't actually seek professional advice, didn't consult your user's manual on how to use your computer properly, instead proceeding to pour butter into the drive and physically rip the disk out?""<br /> Customer: ""Ummmm.""<br /> Tech Support: ""Do you really think you stand a chance, since we do record every call and have it on tape?""<br /> Customer: (now rather humbled) ""But you're supposed to help!""<br /> Tech Support: ""I am sorry sir, but there is nothing we can do for you. Have a nice day.""</p>

10756,"<p>Two blondes suddenly got into bird hunting and were eager to try it out for themselves. They had read that a birddog is a great and useful accessory in bird hunting, so they decided to go to the pet shop and buy one. They asked for a well-trained birddog, and got one. The two blondes immediately went to the woods to try it out. The dog didn't work. No matter how hard they tried, it just didn't follow their commands. They became really frustrated and one of the blondes said to her companion, �Okay, we'll give him one more try. We'll throw him in the air one more time and if he doesn't fly, we're taking him back to the store!�</p>

Yester eve, I came home from the club, and what I<br /> see in my dining room! There was that frog. Just a small female frog. I took a<br /> seat at the table, when she said in perfect English, 'If you're a gentleman,<br /> shouldn't you offer me a seat at your table?' Surprised as I was, being a<br /> gentleman, I did as she asked. I took a swig of brandy, and she said, 'No brandy<br /> for me?' Well, as a gentleman, I poured brandy for her, and the bloody frog<br /> drank it in one gulp. Then I had a slice of a pudding, and she said, 'What about<br /> me?' What would you do? Of course, as a gentleman, I shared the pudding with<br /> her. Then I undressed and went to bed. The bloody frog said, 'What about me?'<br /> So, I took her into the bed.

10777,"<p>An American soldier, serving in World War II, had just returned from several weeks of intense action on the German front lines. He had finally been granted R&amp;R and was on a train bound for London.The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog.The war weary soldier asked, ''Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?''The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ''You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fife is using that seat?''The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another'' trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.Again he asked, ''Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.''The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, ''You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!''The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, ''You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window.''</p>

10793,"<p>* A ""handicapped golfer"" is a man who plays golf with his wife.</p>
<p>* I have a nephew who's so good at golf, he's been offered a<br /> full scholarship to medical school.</p>
<p>* Then there was the golfer who was sentenced to be hanged. He<br /> asked the warden if he could take a few practice swings first.</p>
<p>* Just think guys, a golfer can spend the entire weekend with a<br /> bunch of ""hookers"" and his wife isn't the least bit concerned.</p>
<p>* Basically, golf has made more liars out of Americans than all<br /> of the income tax forms ever filed.</p>
<p>* Contrary to popular belief avid golfers do not lie all the<br /> time. Anytime one golfer calls another a ""liar"" they're probably<br /> telling the truth.</p>
<p>* Some people just have to cheat all the time when it comes to<br /> recording the number of strokes on their golf cards. I knew one<br /> fellow who got a hole-in-one and entered ""zero"" on his card.</p>
<p>* Although not condoned, it was well known within the Maryland<br /> State Highway that sometimes people would ""sneak-away"" for a<br /> game of golf during the day. I had forgotten which course my<br /> friend Dan said to meet him on and called, only to have his<br /> secretary said, ""I'm sorry he's away from his desk right now.""<br /> Knowing she'd never admit where he really was, I asked, ""Tell<br /> me, is he 10 miles way from his desk or 22 miles away?""</p>

<p>""Actually, no"" he replies. </p>
<p>""Can you get him for me - I need to speak to him?"" she asks, running her hands up beyond his beard and into his hair. </p>
<p>""I'm afraid I can't"" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. ""Is there anything I can do?"" </p>
<p>""Yes there is. I need you to give him a message"" she continues huskily, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently. ""Tell him"" she says ""that there is no toilet paper or hand soap in the ladies room.""</p>

He came in after another 5 minutes and said "" honey my hands are cold again"". So she tells him here put your hands between my thighs to warm them.

10807,"<p>When Casey stated he was getting married, his pet parrot was very upset &amp; insisted on going on the honeymoon with the couple. ""Okay, okay"", his owner agreed to the bird, ""You can come along, but I don't want you looking. You gotta promise that you'll look the other way when we're making love...and if you break your promise, you'll get nothing to eat!""</p>
<p>Not wanting to be left at home, the parrot readily agreed.</p>
<p>Before leaving on their honeymoon, Casey &amp; his new bride were packing their suitcases, the man, out of breath, says to his wife, ""I can't get it all in honey, you'll have to sit on it.""</p>
<p>She says, ""No, that won't work, I'll get on top and press down.""</p>
<p>""No that's not gonna work, why don't we both get on top?""</p>
<p>It's then that the parrot thinks to himself, ""Food or no food...this I GOTTA see!""</p>

<p>Later the second hostage was walking in his country and he saw a<br /> little girl crying and he asked ""Why are you crying little girl?""<br /> She said ""Cause a dollar fell out of the sky and gave me a paper<br /> cut.""</p>

10809,"<p>A helicopter was flying around above Seattle yesterday when an electrical malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic navigation and communications equipment. Due to the clouds and haze, the pilot could not determine the helicopter's position and course to steer to the airport. </p>
<p>The pilot saw a tall building, flew toward it, circled, drew a hand-written sign, and held it in the helicopter's window. The pilot's sign read ""WHERE AM I?"" in large letters. </p>
<p>People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a large sign, and held it in a building window. Their sign read ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER."" </p>
<p>The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the course to steer to SEATAC airport, and landed safely. </p>
<p>After they were on the ground, the copilot asked the pilot how the ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER"" sign helped determine their position. </p>
<p>The pilot responded ""I knew that had to be the MICROSOFT building because, similar to their help-lines, they gave me a technically correct but completely useless answer.""</p>

10817,"<p>Did you hear about the heavyset guy who had tried every diet in the world in an attempt to lose weight? He tried the Scarsdale diet, the Navy diet, Weight Watchers, and many more. None worked. One day, he was reading the Washington Post when he noticed a small ad which read:</p>
<p>Lose weight<br /> Only $1.00 a pound<br /> Call (202) 208-0238</p>
<p>The man decided to give it a try and called the number. A voice on the other end asked, 'How much weight do you want to lose?', to which the man responded, 'Ten pounds.'</p>
<p>The voice replied, 'Very well, give me your credit card number and we'll have a representative over to your house in the morning.'.</p>
<p>About 9:00 am the next morning the man gets a knock on the door. There stood a beautiful redheaded woman, completely naked except for a sign around her neck stating, 'If you catch me, you can have me'.</p>
<p>Well, the hefty fellow chased her upstairs, downstairs, over sofas, through the kitchen, all around the house. Finally, panting and wheezing like a dog, he did catch her. When he was through enjoying himself, she said, 'Quick, go into the bathroom and weigh yourself!'. He did just that and was amazed to find that he had lost ten pounds, right to the ounce!</p>
<p>That evening he called the number again. The voice on the other end asked, 'How much weight do you want to lose?', to which the somewhat less overweight man replied, 'Twenty pounds.'.</p>
<p>'Very well', the voice on the phone told him, 'Give me your credit card number and we'll have a representative over to your house in the morning.'</p>
<p>At about 8:00 am the next morning the man receives a knock on the door. When he opens the door he sees a beautiful blond dressed only in track shoes and a sign around her neck stating 'If you catch me, you can have me'. The chase took a good while longer this time and the man nearly passed out, but he finally did catch her. When he was through she told him, 'Quick, run into the bathroom and weigh yourself!' He ran to the bathroom and found he had lost another 20 pounds!</p>
<p>'This is fantastic!', he thought to himself. Later that evening he called the number again and the voice at the other end asked, 'How much weight do you want to lose?'. 'Fifty pounds!', the man exclaimed. 'Fifty pounds?', the voice asked. 'That's an awful lot of weight to lose at one time.'</p>
<p>The man replied, 'Listen buddy, here's my credit card number, you just have your representative over here in the morning!', and he hung up the phone.</p>
<p>About 6:00 am the next morning the man gets out of bed, splashes on some cologne and gets all ready for the next representative. At about 7:00 am he gets a knock on the door. When he opens the door, he sees this large gorilla with a sign around his neck stating,</p>
<p>'If I catch you, I'm going to screw you'</p>

"
10833,"<p>Rules For Work: (Should go over well with your boss.)<br /> Print it out and hang it over your work station...I dare ya! </p>
<p>1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 4:00 and then bring it to me. The challenge of a deadline is refreshing. </p>
<p>2. If it's really a rush job, run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to inquire how it's going. That helps. Even better, hover behind me, and advise me at every keystroke. </p>
<p>3. Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where you are. </p>
<p>4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or supplies, don't open the door for me. I need to learn how to function as a paraplegic and opening doors with no arms is good training in case I should ever be injured and lose all use of my limbs. </p>
<p>5. If you give me more than one job to do, don't tell me which is priority. I am psychic. </p>
<p>6. Do your best to keep me late. I adore this office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do. I have no life beyond work. </p>
<p>7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. If that gets out, it could mean a promotion. </p>
<p>8. If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in conversations. I was born to be whipped. </p>
<p>9. If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done. No use confusing me with useful information. </p>
<p>10. Never introduce me to the people you're with. I have no right to know anything. In the corporate food chain, I am plankton. When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them. </p>
<p>11. Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could really change your life and send you straight to manager's hell. </p>
<p>12. Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and it's nice to know someone is less fortunate. I especially like the story about having to pay so many taxes on the bonus check you received for being such a good manager. </p>
<p>13. Wait until my yearly review and THEN tell me what my goals SHOULD have been. Give me a mediocre performance rating with a cost of living increase. I'm not here for the money anyway.</p>

10834,"<p>Earlier this year, the dazed crew of a Japanese Trawler was plucked out<br /> of the Sea of Japan clinging to the wreckage of their sunken ship.</p>
<p>Their rescue, however, was followed by immediate imprisonment once<br /> authorities questioned the sailors on their ship's loss. To a man they<br /> claimed that a cow, falling out of a clear blue sky, had struck the<br /> trawler amidships, shattering it's hull and sinking the vessel within<br /> minutes.</p>
<p>They remained in prison for several weeks, until the Russian Air Force<br /> reluctantly informed Japanese authorities that the crew of one of its<br /> cargo planes had apparently stolen a cow wandering at the edge of a<br /> Siberian airfield, forced the cow into the plane's hold and hastily taken<br /> off for home.</p>
<p>Unprepared for live cargo, the Russian crew was ill-equipped to manage a<br /> now rampaging cow within its hold.  To save the aircraft and themselves,<br /> they shoved the animal out of the cargo hold as they crossed the Sea of<br /> Japan at an altitude of 30,000 feet.</p>

Right<br /> in front of him, on the White House lawn, he sees ""The President Must Go""<br /> written in urine across the snow. Well, old Bill is pretty ticked off. He storms<br /> into his security staff�s HQ, and yells ""Somebody wrote a threat in the snow on<br /> the front damn lawn! And they wrote it in urine! Son-of-a-bitch had to be<br /> standing right on the porch when he did it! Where were you guys?"" The security<br /> guys stay silent and stare ashamedly at the floor. Bill hollers ""Well dammit,<br /> don�t just sit there! Get out and FIND OUT WHO DID IT! I want an answer, and I<br /> want it TONIGHT!"" The entire staff immediately jumps up and races for the exits.<br /> Later that evening, his chief security officer approaches him and says, ""Well<br /> Mr. President, we have some bad news and we have some really bad news. Which do<br /> you want first?"" Clinton says ""Oh hell, give me the bad news first."" The officer<br /> says, ""Well, we took a sample of the urine and tested it. The results just came<br /> back, and it was Al Gore�s urine."" Clinton says ""Oh my god, I feel so... so...<br /> betrayed! My own Vice President! Damn.... Well, what�s the really bad news?""

10856,"<p>Shit may just be the most powerful word in the English language.<br /> You can be shit faced, shit out of luck, or have shit for<br /> brains. With a little effort, you can get your shit together,<br /> find a place for your shit or decide to shit or get off the pot.<br /> You can smoke shit, buy shit, sell shit, lose shit, find shit,<br /> forget shit, and tell others to eat shit and die. Some people<br /> know their shit while others can't tell the difference between<br /> shit and shineola. There are lucky shits, dumb shits, crazy<br /> shits, and sweet shits. There is bull shit, horse shit and<br /> chicken shit. You can throw shit, sling shit, catch shit, shoot<br /> shit, or duck when shit hits the fan. You can give a shit or<br /> serve shit on a shingle. You can find yourself in deep shit or<br /> be happier than a pig in shit. Some days are colder than shit,<br /> some days are hotter than shit, and some days are just plain<br /> shitty. Some music sounds like shit, things can look like shit,<br /> and there are times when you feel like shit. You can have too<br /> much shit, not enough shit, the right shit, the wrong shit or a<br /> lot of weird shit. You can carry shit, have a mountain of shit,<br /> or find yourself up shit's creek without a paddle. Sometimes<br /> everything you touch turns to shit and other times you swimming<br /> a lake of shit and come out smelling like a rose. When you stop<br /> to consider all the facts, it's the basic building block of<br /> creation. And remember, once you know your shit, you don't need<br /> to know anything else!</p>

<p>The wife agreed to this, but asked that she be given 3 days on her own there, to pack up her things.</p>
<p>While he was gone, the first day she lovingly put her personal belongings into boxes and crates and suitcases.</p>
<p>On the second day, she had the movers come and collect her things.</p>
<p>On the third day, she sat down for the last time at their candlelit dining table, soft music playing in the background, and feasted on a pound of shrimp and a bottle of Chardonnay.</p>
<p>When she had finished, she went into each room and deposited a few of the resulting shrimp shells into the hollow of the curtain rods. She then cleaned up the kitchen and left.</p>

10873,"<p>Dear Maevis,</p>
<p>I have become a little older since I saw you last and a few changes have come into my life since then. I have become quite a frivolous old gal. I am seeing five gentlemen every day.</p>
<p>Will Power helps me get out of bed. Then I go to see John. Then Charlie Horse comes along and when he is here, he takes a lot of my time and attention. When he leaves Arthur Ritis shows up and stays the rest of the day. He doesn't like to stay in one place very long, so he takes me from joint to joint. After such a busy day I'm really tired and glad to go to bed with Ben Gay. What a life!</p>
<p>The preacher came to call the other day. He said that at my age, I should be thinking of the hereafter. I told him I do all the time. No matter where I am, in the den, in the bedroom, in the kitchen or in the garage, I ask myself, ""What am I here after?""</p>
<p>Well, I guess growing old is not so bad since old folks are worth a fortune with silver in their hair, gold in their teeth, stones in their kidneys, lead in their feet, and gas in their stomachs!</p>
<p>Your good ole friend, Ethel</p>

10894,"<p>A group of Texans are driving down the road, whooping it up, drinking beer and shooting off their guns when they get into an accident with busload of nuns and orphans, killing everyone.

<p>""Well, sir, we're from Texas, and we're used to the heat,"" says one. This infuriates the Devil and he cranks the thermostat up to its highest setting. The lost souls all over hell start wailing. ""I'll check on them in the morning and see how they like THIS."" He snorts and disappears in a ball of fire.</p>
<p>The next morning, the Devil shows up at the Texans' camp site, and sure enough they are showing some signs of discomfort. They have taken off their 10 Gallon hats and are fanning themselves. One has even rolled up his sleeves. ""Well, sir,"" explains a Texan, ""when you have been on a cattle drive in Lubbock during August, this ain't hardly nothing."" The Devil is now so angry he is seeing red.</p>
<p>""Those damn Texans seem immune to heat, let 's see what happens when I turn OFF the heat,"" he says as he heads to the thermostat. ""I'll check on them tomorrow.""</p>
<p>So in the morning the Devil arrives at the Texans' campsite, and they are all whoopin' and hollerin' and drinkin' the beers from the ice chest in the back of the pick up, now that they have ice to chill them with.

<p>""Well Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for you.""</p>
<p>""What's a man, Lord?""<br /> ""Man will be a flawed creature, with many bad traits. He'll lie, cheat and be vainglorious; all in all, he'll give you a hard time.</p>
<p>But... he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things. He will look silly when he's aroused, but since you've been complaining, I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs.</p>
<p>He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and kicking a ball about. He won't be too smart, so he'll also need your advice to think properly.""</p>
<p>""Sounds great!"" says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow.<br /> What's the catch, Lord?""</p>
<p>""Well... you can have him on one condition.""</p>
<p>""What's that, Lord?""<br /> ""As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring...<br /> So you'll have to let him believe that I made him first.<br /> Just remember, it's our little secret...<br /> You know, woman to woman.""</p>

Her Majesty and His Holiness can't help but have a little rivalry -<br /> both being heads of churches and all.<br /> The Queen says to the Pope, ""Did you know that with just one little wave of my<br /> hand I can make every English person in the crowd go wild?"" He doubts it, so she<br /> shows him. Sure enough, the royal-gloved wave elicits rapture and cheering from<br /> every Englishman in the crowd.<br /> Gradually, the cheering subsides. The Pope, not wanting to be outdone by<br /> someone wearing a worse frock and hat than he, considers what he could do. So<br /> the Pope says to the Queen,� You�re Majesty that was impressive. But did you<br /> know that with one little wave of MY hand I can make every Irish person in the<br /> crowd go crazy with joy? Their joy will not be a momentary display like that of<br /> your subjects, but will go deep into their hearts, and they will speak forever<br /> of this day and rejoice - they will recount it to their grandchildren and they<br /> to their descendants.<br /> The Queen seriously doubts this, and says so. ""One little wave of your hand<br /> and all Irish people will rejoice forever? Show me."" So the Pope slapped her.</p>

There was no mark on his body but autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system. His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage(and a couple of other things). It was just the right combination of foods. It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed. Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it wouldn't have been fatal. But the man was shut, up in his, near airtight bedroom. According to the article, ""He was a big man with a huge capacity for creating ""this deadly gas."" Three of the rescuers got sick and one was hospitalized.</p>

No, no, no tienes consideraci�n, piensa en otro deseo m�s realista, por favor"".</p>
<p>Me qued� fr�o con la respuesta del genio, pero lo medit� un rato y llegu� a la conclusi�n de que era pedir demasiado, as� que me sent� a pensar en otro deseo m�s realista. Despu�s de discurrir largo tiempo le dije al genio:</p>
<p>""Mira Genio, he tenido cinco novias y siempre me reclamaban que no las ten�a en cuenta, que no les entend�a y que yo era muy insensible con ellas. As� que te pido que me hagas capaz de entender a las mujeres, saber  qu� est�n pensando cuando no me dirigen la palabra, saber por qu� lloran sin motivo aparente, y saber qu� es lo que tienen cuando te dicen que no les  pasa nada.""</p>

So its leaders sent a message to the great white hunter, to come and kill the beast.For several nights the hunter lay in wait for the lion, but it never showed up. Finally, he told the tribal chief to kill a cow and give him its hide. Draping the skin over his shoulders, he went to the pasture to wait for the lion.In the middle of the night, the villagers woke to the sound of bloodcurdling shrieks coming from the pasture. As they carefully approached, they saw the hunter lying there, groaning in pain. There was no sign of the lion.""What happened, bwana? Where is the lion? asked the chief.""Forget the damn lion !"" he howled.""Which of you Idiots let the bull loose?""</p>

10973,"<p>Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound.<br /> Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the center of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. </p>
<p>The third guy got up and sort of randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drainspout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a little stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one. </p>
<p>Moses turned to Jesus and said, ""I hate playing with your Dad.""</p>

<p>El presidente Bush recibe un llamado directo desde Brasil; como no entiende un cuerno de portugu�s, decide llamar a su int�rprete y ponerlo en conferencia en otro tel�fono, muy cerca de �l. El traductor interroga:</p>
<p>""Alo, quem fala?""</p>
<p>""Aqu�, desde Brasil. Por gentileza, fala para seu presidente que nos os brasileros fuimos quem fizerem explodir os avioes no seus predios, t� legal. OK?""</p>
<p>El int�rprete no pod�a creer lo que escuchaba y, con la voz entrecortada, se dirige a Bush:</p>
<p>""Mr. President, they... The Brazilians... They said that they were who crashed the planes into the Twin Towers...""</p>
<p>Bush no lo tom� en serio:</p>
<p>""Are you crazy? Brazil? It is not possible! It must be a mistake! Please, ask him again...""</p>
<p>Entonces el traductor vuelve a preguntar:</p>
<p>""Por gentileza, quisieran los senhores repetir para mi otra vez?""</p>
<p>""Ok. Fala para o seu presidente que NOS, OS BRASILEROS, fuimos que fizerem explodir os seus avioes en seus predios, tanto em Nova Iorque como no Washington. NOS FUIMOS, TA?""</p>
<p>El int�rprete gira su cabeza y dice:</p>
<p>""Mr. President, unfortunately he confirmed it. The Brazilians were who crashed the planes...""</p>
<p>Entonces, Bush no soporta y despotrica:</p>
<p>""FUCKING BRAZILIANS! ATTACK THEM! DESTROY THEM! Launch missiles, nuclear bombs, biological weapons, anthrax, hepatitis, gonorrhea, whatever! Start with their principal cities! Destroy their Capital City! I need to know which city is their Capital! Ask him!""</p>
<p>El int�rprete puso su mejor voz conciliadora y como si nada pasara, pregunt�:</p>
<p>""Disculpen os senhores, pero por gentileza, podriam me decir cual es a sua capital?""</p>
<p>Era la pregunta que el brasile�o estaba esperando:</p>
<p>""Seguro, tudo mundo conhece a nossa capital e... BUENOS AIRES!""</p>

10983,"<p>An Arab has spent many days crossing the desert without finding a source of<br /> water. It gets so bad that his camel dies of thirst. He's crawling through the<br /> sands, certain that he has breathed his last, when all of a sudden he sees a<br /> shiny object sticking out of the sand several yards ahead of him.<br />   He crawls to the object, pulls it out of the sand, and discovers that he has<br /> a Manischevitz wine bottle. It appears that there may be a drop or two left in<br /> the bottle, so he unscrews the top and out pops a genie. But, this is no<br /> ordinary genie. This genie appears to be a Hassidic rabbi, complete with black<br /> alpaca coat, black hat, side curls, etc.<br />  ""Well, kid,"" says the genie. ""You know how it works. You have three wishes.""<br />  ""I'm not going to trust you,"" says the Arab. ""I'm not going to trust a Jewish<br /> genie!""<br />  ""What do you have to lose? It looks like you're a goner anyway!"" The Arab<br /> thinks about this for a minute, and decides that the genie is right.  ""OK, I<br /> wish I were in a lush oasis with plentiful food and drink.""<br />  ***POOF***<br />  The Arab finds himself in the most beautiful oasis he has ever seen and he is<br /> surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies.<br />  ""OK, kid, what's your second wish."" ""My second wish is that I were rich<br /> beyond my wildest dreams. ""<br />  ***POOF***<br />  The Arab finds himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare gold<br /> coins and precious gems. ""OK, kid, you have just one more wish. Better make it<br /> a good one!"" After thinking for a few minutes, the Arab says: ""I wish I were<br /> white and surrounded by beautiful women. ""<br />  ***POOF***<br />  The Arab is turned into a Tampax.</p>
