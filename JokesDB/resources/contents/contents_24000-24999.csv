24000,"<p>A little girl takes the elevator on her way to school. The girl hasn't<br /> finished her homework, as she is stuck with one of the questions. Next to<br /> her in the elevator there is a housewife, an accoutant, and a lawyer.</p>
<p>""Excuse me"", she says, speaking to no one in particular. ""Could anyone<br /> please tell me how much is 3 times 4?""</p>
<p>""Why, twelve of course, little girl"", answers the housewife, somewhat<br /> detachedly. She steps out at the next elevator stop muttering something<br /> about laundry and cooking.</p>
<p>The girl seems no to be happy with the answer, so she looks at the<br /> accoutant expectantly. He sighs, and tries to do some mental calculations.<br /> ""I'm not sure"", he finally offers, ""might be 11.99 or 12.50. I need to run<br /> these numbers on my spreadsheet to make sure.""</p>
<p>Of course she is not happy with this answer either, so she turns to look<br /> at the lawyer. The lawyer smiles confidently at her, discretly signaling<br /> her to wait. When the accoutant finally steps out of the elevator, the<br /> lawyer kneels down to her and whispers, ""how much do you want it to be?""</p>

24005,"<p>A man was getting a haircut prior to a trip to Rome.  He mentioned the trip to the barber who responded, ""Rome?  Why would anyone want to go there?It's crowded &amp; dirty and full of Italians.  You're crazy to go to Rome.So, how are you getting there?""""We're taking TWA,"" was the reply.  ""We got a great rate!""""TWA?"" exclaimed the barber.  ""That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late.So, where are you staying in Rome?""""We'll be at the downtown International Marriott.""""That dump!  That's the worst hotel in the city. The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?""""We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.""""That's rich,"" laughed the barber.  ""You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant.  Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours.  You're going to need it.""A month later, the man again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked him about his trip to Rome.""It was wonderful,""  explained the man, ""not only were we on time in one of TWA's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class.  The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful 28 year old stewardess who waited on me hand and foot.And the hotel-it was great!  They'd just finished a $25 million  remodeling job and now it's the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!""""Well,"" muttered the barber, ""I know you didn't get to see the pope.""""Actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait the pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down as he spoke a few words to me.""""Really?"" asked the Barber.  ""What'd he say?""He said, ""Where'd you get the lousy haircut?</p>

24011,"<p>It is with deep regret, hesitation and contrition that I, the President of the United States of America offer apology to the Chinese Nation and its peoples. I apologize for the heinous act performed by our large, sluggish, propeller driven airplane when it got in the way of your highly maneuverable, supersonic, technologically superior jet aircraft. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I sincerely regret the fact that by flying in international airspace, we afforded your highly competent pilot the opportunity to fly his aircraft into our own, causing him to spiral to his death into the ocean. We regret the choice made by said pilot when he used deficient judgment in electing to attempt aerial intimidation upon our slower moving, unarmed surveillance vehicle. </p>
<p>This situation brings to mind a similar episode when I was in grade school and my face got in the way of a schoolyard bully's fist. He broke a bone in his hand and I felt compelled to apologize for that incident as I do for this one. </p>
<p>Let me summarize by stating that it is our sincere hope that you accept this heartfelt apology for the actions committed by your pilot. We are sorry that we got in the way. </p>
<p>We are sorry that we had to leave international airspace and land in Chinese Territory. We are sorry that you were forced to provide food and housing for our military personnel. Most of all we are sorry that you have in your possession, some of our most technically advanced surveillance equipment on the planet. </p>
<p>I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive us. I hope that you will soon be compelled to release our men and our property because, I really don't want to have to apologize again when we have to kick your ass. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>George W. Bush </p>
<p>President of the United States of America</p>

24014,"<p>The Americans and Russians at the height of the arms race realized that if<br /> they continued in the usual manner they were going to blow up the whole world.<br /> One day they sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog<br /> fight. They'd have five years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and<br /> which ever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. The losing<br /> side would have to lay down its arms.<br /> The Russians found the biggest meanest Doberman and Rottweiler bitches in the<br /> world and bred them with the biggest meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only<br /> the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter, killed his siblings, and gave<br /> him all the milk. They used steroids and trainers and after five years came up<br /> with the biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen.<br /> Its cage needed steel bars that were five inches thick and nobody could get<br /> near it. When the day came for the dog fight, the Americans showed up with a<br /> strange animal. It was a nine foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for the<br /> Americans because they knew there was no way that this dog could possibly last<br /> ten seconds with the Russian dog.<br /> When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of its cage and slowly<br /> waddled over towards the Russian dog. The Russian dog snarled and leaped out of<br /> its cage and charged the American dachshund. But, when it got close enough to<br /> bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed the<br /> Russian dog in one bite. There was nothing left at the entire Russian dog.<br /> The Russians came up to the Americans shaking their heads in disbelief. 'We<br /> don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working<br /> for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler bitches in the world and<br /> the biggest meanest Siberian wolves.""<br /> ""That's nothing"", an American replied. ""We had our best plastic surgeons<br /> working for five years to make an alligator look like a Dachshund.""</p>

24113,"<p>Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. </p>
<p>""The good news is I can cure your headaches... The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."" </p>
<p>Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he has anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. When he left the hospital, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. </p>
<p>He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, ""That's what I need: a new suit."" </p>
<p>He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit."" The salesman eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's see... size 44 long."" </p>
<p>Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?"" </p>
<p>""It's my job."" </p>
<p>Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about a new shirt?"" </p>
<p>Joe thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure..."" The salesman eyed Joe and said, ""Let's see... 34 sleeve and... 16 and a half neck"" </p>
<p>Joe was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?"" </p>
<p>""It's my job."" </p>
<p>Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Joe adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about new shoes?"" </p>
<p>Joe was on a roll and said, ""Sure ..."" The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, ""Let's see... 9-1/2... E.""</p>
<p>Joe was astonished, ""That's right, how did you know?"" </p>
<p>""It's my job."" </p>
<p>Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly. Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, ""How about a new hat?"" </p>
<p>Without hesitating, Joe said, ""Sure..."" The salesman eyed Joe's head and said, ""Let's see... 7-5/8."" </p>
<p>Joe was incredulous, ""That's right, how did you know?"" </p>
<p>""It's my job."" </p>
<p>The hat fit perfectly. Joe was feeling great, when the salesman asked, ""How about some new underwear?"" </p>
<p>Joe thought for a second and said, ""Sure..."" </p>
<p>The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, ""Let's see... size 36."" </p>
<p>Joe laughed, ""No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" </p>
<p>The salesman shook his head, ""You can't wear a size 34. It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.""</p>

24114,"<p>A long time ago, Britain and France were at war.<br /> During one battle, the French captured an English Major. Taking the Major to<br /> their headquarters, the French general began to question him.<br /> The French general asked, ""Why do you English officers all wear red coats?<br /> Don't you know the red material makes you easier targets for us to shoot at?""<br /> In his bland English way, the major informed the general that the reason<br /> English officers wear red coats is so that if they are shot, the blood won't<br /> show and the men they are leading won't panic.<br /> And that is why from that day to now all French Army officers wear brown<br /> pants.</p>

<p>However, not to be lured into worldly pleasures, she huffily declined. But her<br /> mother superior knew the elderly sister loved milk. So she instructed the<br /> kitchen to spike the milk three times a day. </p>
<p>Eventually, the elderly pious one approached her final hour. As several<br /> sisters gathered around her at bedside, the mother superior asked if she wanted<br /> to leave them any words of wisdom. </p>

24156,"<p>Tigers really are as big and poofy and soft as they look, and they purr like a freight train going by. You find this out by taking one for a walk. To take a tiger for a walk, you first need a tiger. Tigers fresh from the bush are not recommended for the inexperienced. What you need is one who's used to the procedure. He or she is thus liable to be merely playful, rather than actively irritated. You also need a friend, whom you really, really trust. The friend carries an apple wood cane; apple, or some other wood which will bend under stress rather than shattering. This, friend, is your backup, and the cane is his or her only tool for everything, from knocking stuff out of the way that the tiger is liable to eat, to crowd control, to hooking on and madly hanging on if things go wrong.</p>
<p>What YOU carry is a ten foot length of pass-link chain. This is your leash.</p>
<p>Pass-link chain is the stuff where the links will fit through each other. This is important. You need this so you can hook on a safety clip. The chain is looped about the tiger's neck and acks as a giant choke-chain, but the clip is there to keep a loop of some sort in case things go badly wrong. You carry the chain looped in one hand in a peculiar fashion which permits the whole length of chain to be dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with it. You practice this beforehand till you're sure you've got it right.</p>
<p>Then you go into the cage with the tiger. Your friend does not. You gauge the tiger's mood and put the leash on the tiger. There isn't a whole lot more to say about this step except to say that that is why your friend is there, OUTside the cage. On your side is the fact that the tiger knows what the leash is for by this time and presumably is largely in favor of the idea.</p>
<p>This is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy. They are also much, much larger than you had ever dreamed, when you're standing next to one.</p>
<p>Then you take the tiger for a walk. Your friend walks in front with the cane to clear the way. You walk with the tiger at your side, keeping pretty good control and letting the tiger know that you are Paying Attention, because if the tiger thinks you are not Paying Attention, it will do what housecats do, let you know that you should be Paying Attention. Unlike housecats, the tiger is big enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the situation. Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your legs out from under you is generally considered good enough by most tigers. They think this is hilarious. To this extent, tigers differ from housecats in that they seem to have a sense of humor.</p>
<p>It is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants. In this case, the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to stop it. This is generally done by wrapping the chain around something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away. This will slow it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you and grab the chain as you go bulleting across the countryside. The weight of two adult humans will generally slow a tiger down enough to make things manageable, whereas one will not.</p>
<p>It is not usual for the tiger to react to freedom by turning around and turning you into fajitas, though this would actually (at least in the short term) be an eminently practical thing for the tiger to do. They enjoy their fun but are generally not ill-tempered. If they are they don't get taken for walks.</p>
<p>They also purr like a freight train passing. Experts in the field claim that this is not purring, that it means something else, but you couldn't put it by me. Sure sounded like purring, at 16-2/3 RPM, but it sounded like purring.</p>
<p>All in all, an experience I highly recommend as a lifetime source of cocktail party conversation, but it sort of tends to leave you limp for the rest of the day.</p>

24160,"<p>Supermodel Kate Moss is serious about taking up golf<br /> Unfortunately all her supermodel friends neither have the time<br /> nor interest she does to get out and play. So poor Kate is<br /> forced to hit the links solo and play with whomever she can.<br /> Being a marginal athlete at best, Kate finds it very difficult<br /> to break a 100 in a round where ever she plays. And being a<br /> perfectionist, over time this begins to frustrate her to no end.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Kate shows up at the Prince Course in Kaui,<br /> Hawaii by herself and finds a threesome of local men to play<br /> with. From the start Kate explains her frustration to the<br /> strangers, and welcomes their suggestions and helpful hints to<br /> improve her game so that she may finally break 100. Devastated<br /> by her overwhelming beauty, the three men are more than willing<br /> to help her in any way they can, and offer up all their best<br /> advise as the day goes on. Luckily for Kate their helpful advise<br /> pays off, and as the foursome approaches the par 4 18th, Ms Moss<br /> has a 95 and only needs to par the hole to finally break 100.</p>
<p>Kate is ecstatic, and with the mens help she reaches the green<br /> in 3, and has only a 4 foot putt for par. This being the most<br /> important putt of life, and the only thing that matters to her<br /> in the whole world at that moment, she turns to the three men<br /> and says: ""whomever gives me the best advise on how to sink this<br /> putt, will be rewarded with the blowjob of lifetime from me on<br /> the spot, a hummer you will be able to tell your grand children<br /> about!""</p>
<p>After a day of getting to know Ms Moss, there was little doubt<br /> in the their minds, that she was very serious about that offer,<br /> and it was not questioned.</p>
<p>The three men stood shell shocked, barley able to speak, then<br /> one man said: ""you have a 6 inch break to the left, play that<br /> and you'll sink it."" Kate nodded her head, acknowledging the<br /> advise, and then turned to look at the second man for his input.<br /> The second man realized he not only had to think quickly, but he<br /> had to come up with a different recommendation to win this<br /> coveted prize. Just the thought of Kate Moss slurping on his hog<br /> on the 18th of the Prince Course, left him absolute brain dead<br /> and almost speechless. Kate getting impatient said: ""well, what<br /> do you think?"" Feeling rushed now, he blurted out ""straight<br /> shot, no break, nice and easy."" Kate raised her eyebrows, a<br /> little surprised and confused then turned to look at the shot<br /> again. As she studied the shot, she asked the third man for his<br /> advise. Not hearing a reply, she turned to look at the third man<br /> standing behind her. The mans shorts and underwear were already<br /> at his ankles, and his sausage was saluting her proudly. Then a<br /> with a shit eating grin on his face, the third man said: ""That's<br /> a gimme!""</p>

<p>Dogs don't cry. Dogs love it when your friends come over. Dogs don't care if you use their shampoo. Dogs think you sing great. A dog's time in the bathroom is confined to a quick drink. Dogs don't expect you to call when you are running late, and the later you are, the more excited dogs are to see you. Dogs don't care if you play with other dogs. Dogs don't notice if you call them by another dog's name. Dogs are excited by rough play. Dogs don't mind if you give their offspring away. Dogs love red meat. Dogs can appreciate excessive body hair. Anyone can get a good-looking dog. If a dog is gorgeous, other dogs don't hate it. Dogs don't shop. Dogs like it when you leave lots of things on the floor. A dog's disposition stays the same all month long. Dogs never need to examine the relationship. A dog's parents never visit. Dogs love long car trips. Dogs understand that instincts are better than asking for directions. Dogs know that all animals smaller than dogs were made to be hunted. When a dog gets old and starts to snap at you incessantly, you can shoot it. Dogs don't hate their bodies. No dog ever bought a Kenny G or Hootie &amp; the Blowfish album. No dog ever put on 100 pounds after reaching adulthood. Dogs never criticize. Dogs agree that you have to raise your voice to get your point across. Dogs never expect gifts. It's legal to keep a dog chained up at your house. Dogs don't worry about germs. Dogs don't want to know about every other dog you ever had. Dogs like to do their snooping outside as opposed to in your wallet, desk, and the back of your sock drawer. Dogs don't let magazine articles guide their lives.

24192,"<p>Dear Cat Owner,</p>
<p>Following are instructions on the best way to bathe your cat:</p>
<p>1. Thoroughly clean the toilet.</p>
<p>2. Add the required amount of shampoo to the toilet water, and<br /> have both lids lifted.</p>
<p>3. Obtain the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the<br /> bathroom.</p>
<p>4. In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close<br /> both lids (you may need to stand on the lid so that he cannot<br /> escape). CAUTION: Don't get any part of your body too close to<br /> the edge, as his paws will be reaching out to grab anything they<br /> can find. The cat will self-agitate and make ample suds. Never<br /> mind the noises that come from your toilet, the cat is actually<br /> enjoying this.</p>
<p>5. Flush the toilet 3 or 4 times. This provides a ""powerwash and<br /> rinse"" which I have found to be quite effective.</p>
<p>6. Have someone open the door to the outside and ensure that<br /> there are no people between the toilet and the outside door.</p>
<p>7. Stand behind the toilet as far as you can, and quickly lift<br /> both lids.</p>
<p>8. The now-clean cat will rocket out of the toilet and run<br /> outside where he will dry himself.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The DOG</p>

24195,"<p>A man, visiting San Francisco, noticed a musty curio shop, which seemed to be<br /> forgotten by time. It seemed very out of place in the busy city. The man's<br /> curiosity was piqued, and he entered the shop. The store didn't seem to have<br /> much traffic, and the shelves were full of dusty, but interesting items. The man<br /> found himself strangely interested in a rather ugly brass rat on a shelf behind<br /> the counter. Ugly it was, but he had never seen anything like it -- it was so<br /> incredibly detailed, and life-like. He asked the shopkeeper for a price.</p>
<p>The man was pleased to learn that he could acquire the rat for only $5, and he<br /> handed the shopkeeper the money. But, before giving the man the rat, the<br /> shopkeeper sternly warned him, ""This sale is final. If you leave the shop with<br /> the brass rat, I won't take it back under any circumstances.""</p>
<p>The man thought the warning was curious, given that the rat only cost $5. Even<br /> if he decided he hated the rat, that was hardly an amount worth worrying about.<br /> He agreed to the shopkeeper's terms, and left with the rat.</p>
<p>At first, everything seemed perfectly normal. But as he walked back toward his<br /> car, the man started to hear strange rustling noises around him. Then he saw a<br /> life rat scurry out of an alley, and start to follow him. Suddenly, rats seemed<br /> to be appearing all around him, streaming out of sewers and dumpsters, all<br /> following him and milling about his feet.</p>
<p>The man began to run, but the rats kept up in increasing numbers. The man<br /> realized that he was being chased by literally tens of thousands of rats. The<br /> ground came alive, as the rats swarmed behind him.</p>
<p>The man suddenly realized the significance of the shopkeeper's warning, and<br /> knew what he had to do. He turned toward the bay, and ran as quickly as he could<br /> toward the water. When he reached the waterfront, he threw the brass rat as far<br /> as he could into the bay. The rats raced past him, following the brass rat into<br /> the water, where they drowned.</p>
<p>The man returned to the curio shop, and upon seeing him enter the shopkeeper<br /> shouted, ""I told you, no refunds. I don't want trouble here. The sale was final,<br /> and you can't return the merchandise.""</p>
<p>The man smiled, and replied, ""Oh, I don't want to return the rat. I just want<br /> to know -- do you have a brass lawyer in stock?""</p>

24197,"<p>A Delta Airlines pilot was badly embarrassed about the a particularly rough landing. He was reluctantly fulfilling company policy that required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited.  Nevertheless he stood there and gave each person a smile, and said:  'Thanks for flying Delta.'He had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, awaiting that inevitable harsh comment on the landing, which by extension would impugn his professional skills and probably his manhood as well. There were fewer smiles than normal, but no comments.  Finally, everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane.  She said, 'Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?' 'Why no M'am,' said the pilot, 'what is it?' The little old lady said, 'Did we just land or were we shot down?'</p>

24200,"<p>Bible scholars have long wondered how old Isaac was when his father<br /> Abraham took him up to the mountain top to offer him as a sacrifice.<br /> Through careful study of the story as related in the Old Testament,<br /> based on the following facts: </p>
<ol>
<li>Issac was old enough to understand the ritual of sacrifice, </li>
<li>Issac was old enough to carry wood for the fire to the top of the<br />        mountain, </li>
<li>Issac was old enough to notice that they were not bringing an animal<br />        for the sacrifice. </li>
</ol>
<p>   Therefore Issac's age, at this time, was greater than 8 years old.<br /> Scholars  also conclude that he was younger than 12 years old as<br /> supported by the following fact: </p>
<p>       If Issac had been older than twelve, he would have been a<br />        teenager and it would not have been a sacrifice.</p>

24213,"<p>It was a few days before Christmas. The trip went reasonably well, and he was<br /> ready to go back home. The airport on the other end had turned a tacky red and<br /> green, and loudspeakers blared annoying elevator renditions of cherished<br /> Christmas carols. </p>
<p>Being someone who took Christmas very seriously, and being slightly tired, he<br /> was not in a particularly good mood. (Almost a scrooge) Going to check in his<br /> luggage (which, for some reason, had become one suitcase with entirely new<br /> clothes), he saw hanging mistletoe. Not real mistletoe, but very cheap plastic<br /> with red paint on some of the rounder parts and green paint on some of the<br /> flatter and pointer parts, that could be taken for mistletoe only in a very<br /> Picasso sort of way. </p>
<p>With a considerable degree of irritation and nowhere else to vent it, he said<br /> to the attendant, ""Even if we were married, I would not want to kiss you under<br /> such a ghastly mockery of mistletoe."" </p>
<p>""Sir, look more closely at where the mistletoe is."" </p>
<p>""Ok, I see that it's above the luggage scale which is the place you'd have to<br /> step forward for a kiss."" </p>
<p>""That's not why it's there."" </p>
<p>""Ok, I give up. Why is it there?"" </p>
<p>""It's there so you can kiss your luggage good-bye.""</p>

At precisely 5:30 Israel time on Sunday, two coordinated car bombs exploded in different cities, killing three terrorists who were transporting the bombs. It was initially believed that the devices had been detonated prematurely by klutzy amateurs. A closer look revealed the truth behind the untimely explosions.Three days before, Israel had made a premature switch from daylight savings time to standard time in order to accommodate a week of Slihot, involving pre-sunrise prayers. Palestinians refused to ""live on Zionist time."" Two weeks of scheduling havoc ensued. The bombs had been prepared in a Palestine-controlled area, and set on Daylight Savings time.  The confused drivers had already switched to standard time. As a result, the cars were still en-route when the explosives detonated, delivering to the terrorists their well-deserved demise.</p>

Because no one else in this house knows HOW to change a  light bulb.  They don't even know the bulb is BURNED OUT.   They would sit in this house in the dark for THREE DAYS  before they figured it out!  And once they figured it out  they wouldn't be able to find the light bulbs despite  the fact that they've been in the SAME CUPBOARD for  the past SEVENTEEN YEARS.  But if they did, by some  miracle, actually find the light bulbs, TWO DAYS  LATER the chair that they dragged from two rooms  over to stand on to change the STUPID light bulb  would STILL BE IN THE SAME SPOT!!  AND UNDERNEATH  IT WOULD BE THE CRUMPLED WRAPPER THE STUPID LIGHT  BULBS CAME IN! WHY?!  BECAUSE NO ONE IN THIS HOUSE  EVER CARRIES OUT THE GARBAGE!!  IT'S A WONDER WE  HAVEN'T ALL SUFFOCATED FROM PILES OF GARBAGE THAT ARE  12 FEET DEEP THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE.  THE HOUSE!!

24227,"<p>Two whales, a male and female, are swimming off the coast of<br /> Japan when the male whale looks up and sees the whaling ship<br /> that killed his father five years ago. Excited at the<br /> opportunity to avenge his father's death, the male whale says to<br /> the female, ""Let's go underneath the ship and blow air through<br /> our blow holes. That ought to knock their boat over, and make<br /> them think twice about killing innocent whales.""</p>
<p>The female whale agrees, and the plan works perfectly. Once the<br /> whaling ship has completely sunk, the male whale notices that<br /> most of the sailors are making their way back to the shore by<br /> either swimming or in lifeboats. Not willing to let them get<br /> away so easily, the male whale yells ""They're going to shore.<br /> Let's go gobble them up!"" Suddenly, the female whale becomes<br /> less cooperative. ""Hey!"", she says, ""I agreed to the blowjob,<br /> but I'm not swallowing any seamen!""</p>

'Oh', she said, 'I'm so glad you called.  I remembered saying 'yes' to someone, but I couldn't remember who it was.'</p>

You go to the post office to research your family tree. You have to check your coke can before you take a drink just in case you have mistaken it for your spit can.You have accidentally taken a drink from your spit can. Your wife asks you what you want to be when you grow up. You see a forest fire and think 'Bar-bee-Q'. You've ever strained your tea through a flyswatter. Your mother is hairier than your father. Instead of flossing you use a plunger. You take the back window out of your pickup because it's easier to chuck the empty beer cans in the back that way. When the back fills up with empty beer cans, you get another pickup and start all over again.Your grandma can bench press atruck axle.You watch ""The Dukes Of Hazzard"" and have to find someone to explain it to you.Your mom kisses you goodnight and you go to school the next day and say you've met your future wife.When your wife walks in front of you it looks like two pigs fighting in a gunny sack.Your only excuse for smelling bad is it runs in the family. Your favorite fruit is chicken.You think those yellow traffic signs that say ""Slow children at play"" means the kids in the area are not too bright.

<p>She said, ""No, what a great idea!  Thanks.""</p>
<p>I did a quick check using Excite while she used Yahoo and she was<br /> astounded at the information available about this little-known tribe.<br /> She thanked me profusely for the tip and hung up.</p>
<p>Two hours later, she called me back sounding absolutely miserable.</p>
<p>""Susan,"" I said, ""What's the matter?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" she said, ""You're not going to believe it but they have their own<br /> Web page with all the information I could ever want about the tribe.""</p>
<p>""That's great,"" I said. ""What more could you ask for?""</p>
<p>""You don't understand,"" she said. ""My article is about how isolated the<br /> tribe is and how their only path to the outside world is a little dirt<br /> trail up the side of the canyon!  On their Web page, they even have a<br /> scanned photo of the helicopter that brought the donated PC into the<br /> canyon.""</p>

24252,"<p>A woman,being very upset that her husband had just died,paid a visit to the funeral home to view the body before the funeral. Upon seeing the husband laid out in the casket in a brown suit,she remembered he always hated the color brown.She told the undertaker of this and somewhat apologized for being such a pain but would they take care of it and put on the blue suit. The undertaker agreed and she left the building. Remembering she forgot her sunglasses,she returned to the building,and upon entering was just in time to hear the undertaker yell out:<br /> ""Hey Joe, switch the heads in caskets 3 and 5 !""</p>

24253,"<p>Saddam Hussein was sitting in his office wondering who<br /> to invade next when his telephone rang.</p>
<p>""Hallo! Mr. Hussein,"" a heavily-accented voice said.<br /> ""This is Yitzhak down in Tel Aviv, Israel. I am ringing to<br /> inform you that we are officially declaring war on you!""</p>
<p>""Well, Yitzhak,"" Saddam replied, ""This is important<br /> news! Tell me, how big is your army?""</p>
<p>""At this moment in time,"" said Yitzhak after a<br /> moment's calculation, ""there is me, my cousin Saul, my next-door<br /> neighbor Shlomo, and the entire pinochle team from the deli --<br /> that makes eight!""</p>
<p>Saddam sighed. ""I must tell you, Yitzhak, that I have<br /> 1million men in my army waiting to move on my command.""</p>
<p>""Oy vey!"", said Yitzhak, ""I'll have to ring you back!""</p>
<p>Sure enough, the next day Yitzhak rang back. ""Right,<br /> Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to acquire<br /> some equipment!""</p>
<p>""And what equipment would that be, Yitzhak?"" Saddam asked.</p>
<p>""Well, we have two combine harvesters, a bulldozer and<br /> Goldberg's tractor from the kibbutz.""</p>
<p>Once more Saddam sighed. ""I must tell you, Yitzhak,<br /> that I have 16 thousand tanks, 14 thousand armored personnel<br /> carriers, and my army has increased to one and a half million<br /> since we last spoke.""</p>
<p>""Really?!"" said Yitzhak, ""I'll have to ring you back!""<br /> Sure enough, Yitzhak rang again the next day. ""Right, Mr.<br /> Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to get ourselves<br /> airborne!  We've modified Moshe's ultralight with a couple of<br /> rifles in the cockpit and the bridge team  has joined us as<br /> well!""</p>
<p>Saddam was silent for a minute, then sighed. ""I must<br /> tell you Yitzhak that I have 10 thousand bombers, 20 thousand<br /> MIG-19 attack planes, my military complex is surrounded by<br /> laser-uided surface-to-air missile sites, and since we last<br /> spoke, my army has increased to two million.""</p>
<p>""Oy gevalt!"", said Yitzhak, ""I'll have to ring you back.""</p>
<p>Sure enough, Yitzhak called again the next day.<br /> ""Right, Mr Hussein, I am sorry to tell you that we have had to<br /> call off the war.""</p>
<p>""I'm sorry to hear that"" said Saddam. ""Why the sudden change of<br /> heart?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" said Yitzhak, ""We've all had a chat, and there's no way<br /> we can feed two million prisoners.</p>

This continues through several more attempts. </p>
<p>Pretty soon, when another ape tries to climb the stairs, the other apes all try to prevent it. Now, turn off the cold water. Remove one ape from the cage and replace it with a new one. The new ape sees the banana and wants to climb the stairs. To his horror, all of the other apes attack him. After another attempt and attack, he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be assaulted. </p>
<p>Next, remove another of the original five apes and replace it with a new one. The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked. The previous newcomer takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm. Again, replace a third original ape with a new one. The new one makes it to the stairs and is attacked as well. Two of the four apes that beat him have no idea why they were not permitted to climb the stairs, or why they are participating in the beating of the newest ape. </p>
<p>After replacing the fourth and fifth original apes, all the apes, which have been sprayed with cold water, have been replaced. Nevertheless, no ape ever again approaches the stairs. Why not? Because that's the way they've always done it and that's the way it's always been around here. </p>
<p>And that's how company policy begins....</p>

<p>Sighting #1:<br /> I was at the airport, checking in at the gate, when the  airport employee asked, ""Has anyone put anything in your baggage without your knowledge?"" I said, ""If it was without my knowledge,  how would I know?"" He smiled and nodded knowingly, ""That's why we ask.""</p>
<p>Idiot Sighting #2:<br /> The stoplight on the corner buzzes when it is safe to cross the street. I was crossing with an intellectually challenged coworker of mine, when she asked if I knew what the buzzer was for. I explained that it signals to blind people when the light is red. She responded, appalled, ""What on earth are blind people doing driving!""</p>
<p>Idiot Sighting #3:<br /> At a good-bye lunch for an old and dear coworker who is  leaving the company due to ""downsizing,"" our manager spoke up and said, ""this is fun. We should have lunch like this more often,"" Not another word was spoken. We just looked at each other like deer staring into the headlights of an approaching truck.</p>
<p>Idiot Sighting #4:<br /> I worked with an Individual who plugged her power strip back into itself and for the life of her could not understand why her system would not turn on.</p>
<p>Idiot Sighting #5:<br /> When my husband and I arrived at an automobile dealership to pick up our car, we were told that the keys had been accidentally locked in it. We went to the service department and found a mechanic working feverishly to unlock the driver's side door. As I watched from the passenger's side, I instinctively tried the door handle and discovered it was open. ""Hey,"" I announced to the technician, ""it's open!"" ""I know,"" answered the young man. ""I already got that side...""</p>

24303,"<p>In The Beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void, And darkness was upon the face of the deep.</p>
<p>And the Devil said, ""It doesn't get any better than this.""</p>
<p>And so God created Man in His own image; Male and female He created them.</p>
<p>And God looked upon Man and Woman And saw that they were lean and fit. And God populated the earth With broccoli and cauliflower and spinach and green and yellow vegetables of all kinds, So Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.</p>
<p>And so the Devil created McDonald's. And McDonald's brought forth the 79-cent double cheeseburger. And the Devil said to Man, ""You want fries with that?""</p>
<p>And Man said, ""Super size them."" And Man gained five pounds.</p>
<p>And so God created the healthful yogurt, That Woman might keep her figure. But the Devil brought forth chocolate. And Woman gained five pounds.</p>
<p>And God said, ""Try my crispy fresh salad."" And the Devil brought forth Ben and Jerry's. And Woman gained 10 pounds.</p>
<p>And God said, ""Why doth thou eatest thus? I have sent thee heart-healthy vegetables And olive oil with which to cook them.""</p>
<p>But the Devil brought forth chicken fried steak So big it needed its own platter. And Man gained 10 pounds And his bad cholesterol went through the roof.</p>
<p>And so God brought forth running shoes. And Man resolved to lose those extra pounds.</p>
<p>And the Devil brought forth cable TV with remote control So Man would not have to toil to change channels between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man gained another 20 pounds.</p>
<p>And so God brought forth the potato, A vegetable naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition.</p>
<p>And the Devil peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fat fried them. And the Devil created sour cream dip.</p>
<p>And Man clutched his remote control And ate the potato chips swaddled in cholesterol.</p>
<p>And the Devil saw this and said, ""It is good.""</p>
<p>And Man went into cardiac arrest. And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.</p>
<p>And the Devil cancelled Man's health insurance.</p>
<p>So God showed Woman how to peel the skin off chicken. And cook the nourishing whole grain brown rice. And the Devil created light beer So Man could poison his body, While feeling righteous because he had to drink twice as much of the now-insipid brew to get the same buzz. And Man gained another 10 pounds.</p>
<p>And Woman ventured forth Into the land of Godiva chocolate, And upon returning asked Man, ""Do I look fat?""</p>
<p>And the Devil said, ""Always tell the truth.""</p>
<p>And Man did.</p>
<p>And Woman went out from the presence of Man And dwelt in the land of the divorce lawyer, East of the marriage counselor.</p>
<p>And the Devil said, ""It doesn't get any better than this!""</p>

24334,"<p>The animals were bored. Finally, the lion had an idea. ""I know a really<br /> exciting game that the humans play called football. I've seen it on T.V.""</p>
<p>He proceeded to describe it to the rest of the animals and they all got<br /> excited about it so they decided to play. They went out to the field and chose<br /> up teams and were ready to begin.</p>
<p>The lion's team received. They were able to get two first downs and then had<br /> to punt. The mule punted and the rhino was back deep for the kick. He caught the<br /> ball, lowered his head and charged. First, he crushed a roadrunner, then two<br /> rabbits. He gored a wildebeast, knocked over two cows, and broke through to<br /> daylight, scoring six.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they lacked a placekicker, and the score remained 6 - 0.</p>
<p>Late in the first half the lion's team scored a touchdown and the mule kicked<br /> the extra point. The lion's team led at halftime 7 - 6. In the locker room, the<br /> lion gave a peptalk.</p>
<p>""Look you guys. We can win this game. We've got the lead and they only have<br /> one real threat. We've got to keep the ball away from the rhino, he's a killer.<br /> Mule, when you kick off be sure to keep it away from the rhino.""</p>
<p>The second half began. Just as the mule was about to kick off, the rhino's<br /> team changed formation and the ball went directly to the rhino. Once again, the<br /> rhino lowered his head and was off running. First, he stomped two gazelles. He<br /> skewered a zebra, and bulldozed an elephant out of the way. It looked like he<br /> was home free. Suddenly at the twenty-yard line, he dropped over dead. There<br /> were no other animals in sight anywhere near him. The lion went over to see what<br /> had happened. Right next to the dead rhino he saw a small centipede.</p>
<p>""Did you do this?"" he asked the centipede.</p>
<p>""Yeah, I did."" the centipede replied.</p>
<p>The lion retorted, ""Where were you during the first half?""</p>
<p>""I was putting on my shoes.""</p>

The bank examiners were coming the next day, and when he confessed the whole thing to his wife, she packed her bags and left him. Totally despondent, he walked to a nearby bridge and stood at the edge of it about to jump off and end it all.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice called, ""Young man, don't do that! There is no need to end your life! I'm a witch and I can help you!"" ""I doubt it,"" he said sadly, ""I've stolen a hundred thousand dollars from the bank, for which I'll probably be arrested tomorrow, and my wife has left me.""</p>
<p>""Young man, witches can do anything,"" she said. ""I'm going to perform a witch miracle. ""She said, ""ALAKAZAM! The hundred thousand dollars has been replaced and there's another hundred thousand in your safe deposit box! ALAKAZAM! Your wife is back home again!""</p>

In the morning, as he was getting dressed and combing his hair in front of the mirror, she lay on the bed watching silently. Finally, she asked, ""Sonny, how old are you?""</p>

24348,"<p>On a farm out in the country lived a man and a woman and their<br /> three sons. Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while<br /> looking out of the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the<br /> family's only cow was lying dead in the field. The situation<br /> looked hopeless to her--how could she possibly continue to feed<br /> her family now?</p>
<p>In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the man<br /> awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to<br /> see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in<br /> the head. </p>
<p>Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the<br /> cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.<br /> When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the<br /> bank. She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your<br /> despair. But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I<br /> will restore your parents and the cow to you."" The son agreed to<br /> try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her<br /> again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river.</p>
<p>Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had<br /> happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river. The<br /> mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in<br /> a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried<br /> his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the<br /> mermaid, so she drowned him in the river.</p>
<p>The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow<br /> in the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a<br /> hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw<br /> himself in. And there he also met the mermaid.</p>
<p>""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything<br /> right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row.""<br /> The young son replied, ""Is that all? Why not twenty times in a<br /> row?"" The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then<br /> he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as<br /> she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, ""Why not<br /> THIRTY times in a row?""</p>
<p>Finally, she said, ""Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me<br /> thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to<br /> perfect health."" Then the young son asked, ""Wait! How do I know<br /> that thirty times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?""</p>

<p>"" Well I'll be tarred and feathered! How did you know that?""</p>
<p>"" I used logic. Now by diving even further, I can say that if you have a yard<br /> then you must have a house.""</p>
<p>"" By golly you're right.""</p>
<p>"" And since you have a house, I can assume that you have a wife.""</p>
<p>"" Yeah I do, you're amazing!""</p>

Once the man knew what had happened, he quickly jumped out of<br /> his car to check the scene. There, laying lifeless in the middle of the road,<br /> was the Easter bunny. </p>

<p>The woman ran back to her car. A moment later, she came back carrying a spray<br /> bottle. She ran over to the motionless bunny and sprayed it. The bunny<br /> immediately sprang up, ran into the woods, stopped, and waved back at the man<br /> and woman. Then it ran another 10 feet, stopped, and waved. It then ran another<br /> 10 feet, stopped, and waved again. It did this over and over and over again<br /> until the man and the woman could no longer see the bunny. </p>

<p>Sam had been in the hectic newspaper business for twenty-five years when he decided that he was sick of the stress and quit his job. He bought 50 acres of land in the middle of Nowhere, Vermont. His place was so isolated that the postman came only once a week and he went to the grocery store only once a month.</p>
<p>After six months of near total isolation, he hears a knock on the door. He opens the door and a big bearded Vermonter is standing there. He says, ""Names Enoch...your neighbor from four miles over the ridge. Having a party Saturday...thought you'd like to come.""</p>

<p>The old-timer came over, threw the directions away, and in a short while had<br /> the set completely assembled.</p>
<p>It's beyond me,"" said the father, ""how you got it together without even<br /> reading instructions.""</p>

The boy liftes his shirt and points at his nipples and said ""I've got two of these, how about you?""So the little girl opened her blouse and showed him her nipples. So the boy showed her his belly button. And the girl showed him hers. The little boy now getting upset, pulls dowm his drawers and points at his penis.

Soon enough she returned to the boy's house and said "" My mommy told me when I'm 15 years old, I could have has much of those as I want!""</p>

<p>El tipo, presumiendo ser experto en cuestiones sexuales, se va muy confiado a la casa de la chica. Al llegar, el sujeto le ofrece a 'La Profunda' que si tienen sexo, �l la har�a gozar por primera vez. La mujer, no muy convencida, acepta el trato.</p>
<p>El tipo se baja el pantal�n y, sin m�s, la empieza a penetrar. El hombre comienza a gemir, mientras la muchacha est� como si nada. De repente, el tipo comienza a sentir que se hunde dentro de la chica, y en el forcejeo para evitar ser tragado por ella se le va el zapato adentro de su hoyo. Entonces, para recuperar su zapato se adentra en la chica y empieza a buscarlo. Repentinamente, ve a un �rabe que estaba sentado, y le pregunta:</p>
<p>""�T� tambi�n intentaste acostarte con 'La Profunda', verdad?""</p>

24374,"<p>A magazine recently ran a ""Dilbert quotes"" contest. They were<br /> looking for people to submit quotes from their real life<br /> Dilbert-type managers. Here are some of the submissions:</p>
<p>1. As of tomorrow, employees will only be able to access the<br /> building using individual security cards. Pictures will be taken<br /> next Wednesday and employees will receive their cards in two<br /> weeks. (This was the winning quote from Fred Dales at Microsoft<br /> Corp in Redmond, WA.)</p>
<p>2. What I need is a list of specific unknown problems we will<br /> encounter. (Lykes Lines Shipping)</p>
<p>3. E-mail is not to be used to pass on information or data. It<br /> should be used only for company business. (Accounting manager,<br /> Electric Boat Company)</p>
<p>4. This project is so important, we can't let things that are<br /> more important interfere with it. (Advertising/Marketing<br /> manager, United Parcel Service)</p>
<p>5. Doing it right is no excuse for not meeting the schedule. No<br /> one will believe you solved this problem in one day! We've been<br /> working on it for months. Now, go act busy for a few weeks and<br /> I'll let you know when it's time to tell them. (R&amp;D supervisor,<br /> Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing/3M Corp.)</p>
<p>6. My Boss spent the entire weekend retyping a 25-page proposal<br /> that only needed corrections. She claims the disk I gave her was<br /> damaged and she couldn't edit it. The disk I gave her was<br /> write-protected. (CIO of Dell Computers)</p>
<p>7. Quote from the Boss: ""Teamwork is a lot of people doing what<br /> I' say.""(Marketing executive, Citrix Corporation)</p>
<p>8. ""How About Friday?"" My sister passed away and her funeral was<br /> scheduled for Monday. When I told my Boss, he said she died so<br /> that I would have to miss work on the busiest day of the year.<br /> He then asked if we could change her burial to Friday. He said,<br /> ""That would be better for me."" (Shipping executive, FTD Florists)</p>
<p>9. ""We know that communication is a problem, but the company is<br /> not going to discuss it with the employees."" (Switching<br /> supervisor, AT&amp;T Long Lines Division)</p>
<p>10. We recently received a memo from senior management saying:<br /> ""This is to inform you that a memo will be issued today<br /> regarding the subject mentioned above."" (Microsoft, Legal<br /> Affairs Division)</p>
<p>11. One day my Boss asked me to submit a status report to him<br /> concerning a project I was working on. I asked him if tomorrow<br /> would be soon enough. He said ""If I wanted it tomorrow, I would<br /> have waited until tomorrow to ask for it!"" (New business<br /> manager, Hallmark Greeting Cards.)</p>
<p>12. Speaking the Same Language: As director of communications, I<br /> was asked to prepare a memo reviewing our company's training<br /> programs and materials. In the body of the memo one of the<br /> sentences mentioned the ""pedagogical approach"" used by one of<br /> the training manuals. The day after I routed the memo to the<br /> executive committee, I was called into the HR director's office,<br /> and told that the executive vice president wanted me out of the<br /> building by lunch. When I asked why, I was told that she<br /> wouldn't stand for ""perverts"" (pedophilia?) working in her<br /> company. Finally he showed me her copy of the memo, with her<br /> demand that I be fired - and the word ""pedagogical"" circled in<br /> red. The HR manager was fairly reasonable, and once he looked<br /> the word up in his dictionary, and made a copy of the definition<br /> to send back to her, he told me not to worry. He would take care<br /> of it. Two days later a memo to the entire staff came out<br /> directing us that no words which could not be found in the local<br /> Sunday newspaper could be used in company memos. A month later,<br /> I resigned. In accordance with company policy, I created my<br /> resignation memo by pasting words together from the Sunday<br /> paper. (Taco Bell Corporation)</p>
<p>13. This gem is the closing paragraph of a nationally-circulated<br /> memo from a large communications company: ""(Company name) is<br /> endeavorily determined to promote constant attention on current<br /> procedures of transacting business focusing emphasis on<br /> innovative ways to better, if not supersede, the expectations of<br /> quality!"" (Lucent Technologies)</p>

""I'm<br /> sorry sir,"" she says, her bottom lip starting to quiver. ""I<br /> can't help you if you're going to talk to me like that."" And<br /> with that she leaves her window, walks over to the bank manager<br /> and whispers in his ear. The two return to the window and the<br /> manager asks stiffly, ""What seems to be the problem here?""</p>

The professor was very strict and told the class that any<br /> exam that was not on his desk in exactly two hours would not be accepted and the<br /> student would fail. Thirty minutes into the exam, a student came rushing in and<br /> asked for an exam booklet. ""You're not going to have time to finish this,"" the<br /> professor stated as he handed the student a booklet. </p>
<p>""Yes, I will,"" replied the student. He then took a seat and began writing.<br /> After two hours, the students filed up and handed their exams in.

<p>To:Cavemates</p>
<p>Subject:The cave</p>
<p>   Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours but we've<br /> really come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to<br /> Omar for putting up the poster that says ""There is no I in team""<br /> as well as the one that says ""Hang in there, baby."" That cat is<br /> hilarious. However, while we are fighting a jihad, we can't<br /> forget to take care of the cave. And frankly I have a few<br /> concerns.<br />    First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise<br /> missiles, we should be even more concerned about the scorpions<br /> in our cave. Hey, you don't want to be stung and neither do I,<br /> so we need to sweep the cave daily. I've posted a sign-up sheet<br /> near the main cave opening.<br />     Second, it's not often I make a video address, but when I<br /> do, I'm trying to scare the most powerful country on earth,<br /> okay? That means that while we're taping, please do not ride<br /> your razor scooter in the background. Just while we're taping.<br /> Thanks.<br />     Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by<br /> edict, we're not supposed to shave our beards. But I need<br /> everyone to just think hygiene, especially after mealtime. We're<br /> all in this together.<br />     Fourth:food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly<br /> wrote ""Osama"" on the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today,<br /> my Cheez-Its were gone. Consideration. That's all I'm saying.<br />     Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in<br /> disguise trying to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up<br /> patrols to look for them. First patrol will be Omar, Muhammed,<br /> Abdul, Akbar, and Richard.<br />     Love you lots. Osama.<br /> P.S. If it looks like I'm going to be captured, kill me. Hugs!<br /> ObL</p>

24403,"<p>Charlie was visiting an old friend and his wife for dinner. When the time came to leave, his car wouldn't start, and it was too late to call the local service station.The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house; there wasn't even a sofa. So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife.No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife taped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her.""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. ""Your husband is my best friend!""""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now.""""I can't believe that,"" Charlie said. ""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he?""Sugar, he certainly won't.  If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his asshole and see if that wakes him.""Charlie did just that. He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again.  Again he pulled a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep.  This went on eight times during the night.  Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's asshole hairs.The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke and muttered: ""Listen, Charlie, old pal, I don't mind you fucking my wife, but for Pete's sake, stop using my ass for a scoreboard!""</p>

<ul>
<li>Investigating a purse snatching, Brunswick, Georgia, detectives picked up a man who fit the thief's description and drove him back to the scene. He was told to exit the car and face the victim for an I.D. The suspect dutifully eyed the victim, and blurted, ""Yeah, that's the woman I robbed.""</li>
<li>In Nashville, they tell of Fred ""Junior"" Williams, the burglar who fell asleep on the sofa of the home he was robbing, only to be awakened by police.</li>
<li>In Thibodaux, Louisiana, a robber with a thick Cajun accent couldn't get restaurant patrons to understand his demand for money. Frustrated,he whipped out his gun, but it wouldn't fire. Grabbing the cash register, he ran -- but got only three feet before falling down. The register was still plugged into the wall. Unplugging it, he tried again, but a diner decked him and called police.</li>
<li>In Rhode Island, cops were sure they had the right guy when the suspect in a string of coin-machine thefts paid his $400 bail entirely in quarters. </li>
<li>Texas authorities, responding to a store robbery, seized a man who was fleeing naked. He said he'd stripped after the job because he figured his clothes would make him identifiable.</li>
<li>In Lawrence, Kansas, officers tracked a midnight thief who prided himself on his running speed by following the red lights on his high-tech tennis shoes. </li>
<li>In Virginia, a janitor went to great lengths to avoid I.D. in a 7-Eleven robbery, using a ski mask and rental car for the occasion. But he also wore his work uniform, which said ""Cedar Woods Apartments"" and had his name, Dwayne, stitched across the front. </li>

24423,"<p>T'was the night before finals, And all through the college, The students were praying For last minute knowledge.<br /> Most were quite sleepy, But none touched their beds, While visions of essays Danced in their heads. </p>
<p>Out in the taverns, A few were still drinking, And hoping that liquor Would get their brains thinking. </p>
<p>In my own apartment, I had been pacing, Dreading all those exams I soon would be facing. My roommate was speechless, His nose in his books, And my comments to him Drew unfriendly looks. I drained all the coffee, And brewed a new pot, No longer caring That my nerves were shot. I stared at my notes, But my thoughts were all muddy, My eyes went a'blur, I just couldn't study. ""Some pizza might help,"" I said with a shiver, But each place I called Refused to deliver. I'd pretty much concluded Life is unfair and cruel, Since our futures all depend On grades made in school. When all of a sudden, Our door opened wide, And Patron Saint Put-It-Off Ambled inside. Her spirit was careless, Her manner was mellow, She looked at the mess And started to bellow: ""Why should us students Make such a fuss, About what those teachers Toss out to us?"" ""On Cliff Notes! On Crib Notes! On Last Year's Exams! On Wingit and Slingit, And Last Minute Crams!"" Her message delivered, She vanished from sight, But we heard her laughing Outside in the night. ""Your teachers won't flunk you, So just do your best. Happy Finals to All, And to All, a good test.""</p>

There's no way we can keep track of what you're doing this time around.""""In that case,"" says the second priest,  ""I've always wanted to be a stud!""""So be it,"" said St. Peter, and the second priest disappears.A week goes by, the computer is fixed and the Lord tells St. Peter to recall the two priests.  ""Will you have any difficulty locating them?"" He asks.""The first one should be easy,"" says St. Peter.

24476,"<p>Did you here what happened 3 1/2 years ago at the University of Tennessee<br /> just before Spring Break? Well 3 days before UT got out for spring break,<br /> some of the other SEC schools let their students out for spring break and<br /> with the Interstate running through Knoxville like it does, 5 Auburn<br /> Football Players drove thru Knoxville on their way to the Smoky Mountains<br /> on I-40 in a Dodge Caravan. One of the players knew the interstate exits<br /> in Knoxville and said turn here at 17th street and had the driver drive<br /> straight up to the hill on Tennessee's campus. After parking the 5 players<br /> got out and started walking around UT's campus looking at the football<br /> facilities and 3 of them were wearing T-shirts with AUBURN in bold type<br /> across the front. UT's players were still there studying for finals and<br /> looked out, saw them, and recognized them and got mad. 15 UT players went<br /> out and circled them and said, ""We looked up that word Auburn on your<br /> shirts, in the dictionary, and it talks about the colors of Fall, but it<br /> does not say anything about a school in Alabama. What does it mean?"" The<br /> auburn players were scared being outnumbered 15 to 5 so they responded,<br /> ""In football it means Alabama Usually Beats Us Round November"". Of course<br /> Tennessee beat Auburn last year in the SEC Championship 12/6/97, which<br /> being not a full week into December is still around November, so when it<br /> comes to beating Auburn round November, UT means US TOO! We can beat<br /> Auburn around November!!!!</p>

<p>If a woman burns her thighs on the hot coffee she's holding in her lap while<br /> driving, she blames the restaurant. </p>
<p>If your teen-age son kills himself or then next door neighbors,<br /> you blame the rock 'n' roll music or musician he liked. </p>
<p>If you smoke three packs a day for 40 years and die of lung cancer,<br /> your family blames the tobacco company. </p>
<p>If your daughter gets pregnant by the football captain you blame the school<br /> for poor sex education. </p>
<p>If your neighbor crashes into a tree while driving home drunk, you blame the<br /> bartender. </p>
<p>If your cousin gets AIDS because the needle he used to shoot up with heroin<br /> was dirty, you blame the government for not providing clean ones. </p>
<p>If your grandchildren are brats without manners, you blame television.<br /> If your friend is shot by a deranged madman, you blame the gun manufacturer. </p>
<p>And if a crazed person breaks into the cockpit and tries to kill the pilots at<br /> 35,000 feet, and the passengers kill him instead, the mother of the deceased<br /> blames the airline. </p>
<p>I guess I'll just never understand the world as it is anymore...<br /> So if I die while my old, wrinkled ass is parked in front of this computer<br /> while sending you this joke - I want you to blame Bill Gates, OK?</p>

<p>Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback. However, she remembers what her boss told her; ""Don't reject the guy outright."" So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting to marry her. </p>
<p>So, after a few minutes, the woman says to the man, ""I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75 carat diamond ring, with a matching 200 carat diamond tiara."" </p>
<p>The Taiwanese man pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, ""No problem!! I buy. I buy."" </p>
<p>Realizing that her first condition was too easy, the woman says to the man, ""I want you to build me a 100 room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine county in France."" </p>
<p>The man pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone, calls some brokers in New York, then he calls some brokers in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, ""Okay, okay. I build, I build."" </p>
<p>Realizing that she has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally, she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, ""Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 12-inch penis."" </p>
<p>The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table. All the while, he's muttering something in Chinese. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the man shakes his head, looking real sad, says to the woman, ""Okay, okay. I cut. I cut!""</p>

""Dad, can you tell me the difference between potential and reality?""<br /> His father looks up, thoughtfully, and then says, ""I'll display it to you.

Then come back and tell me what you've learned."" </p>
<p>The kid is puzzled, but he decides to see if he can figure out what his father means. He asks his mother, ""Mom, if someone gave you a million dollars, would you sleep with Robert Redford?"" His mother looks around slyly, and then with a little smile on her face says, ""Don't tell your father, but yes, I would."" </p>
<p>Then he goes to his sisters room and asks her, ""Sis, if someone gave you a million dollars, would you sleep with Brad Pitt. </p>
<p>His sister looks up and says, ""Omigod! Definitely!"" </p>
<p>The kid goes back to his father and says, ""Dad, I think I've figured it out. Potentially, we are sitting on two millions bucks, but in reality, we are living with two whores.""</p>

24507,"<p>A man asked the waiter for a look at the dessert menu, which the waiter produced from a special pouch in his uniform. The man ordered a desert, and the waiter relayed the information to the kitchen via a special communications device built into his wrist watch. When desert arrived, the man was without a spoon. The waiter produced one from his breast pocket. The man was amazed. He asked the waiter how it is that the waiter is so well prepared to handle every problem without ever having to return to the kitchen. The waiter answered that the owner is an efficiency expert who wanted everything to run without a wasted moment. The man asked the purpose of the string tied to every waiters' trousers. The waiter replied that, when he uses the urinal, he avoids dirtying his hands (and therefore doesn't need to waste time washing them). He simply pulls the string, and his penis pops out. The man asked the waiter how he gets his penis back in. The waiter replied, ""That's easy.... I use the spoon.""</p>

"
24531,"<p>Buying gifts for men is not nearly as complicated as it is for women. Follow these rules and you should have no problems.<br /> Rule #1: When in doubt - buy him a cordless drill. It does not matter if he already has one. I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain. As a man, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #2: If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word ratchet or socket in it. Men love saying those two words. ""Hey George, can I borrow your ratchet?"" ""OK. Bye-the-way, are you through with my 3/8-inch socket yet?"" Again, no one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #3: If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car. A 99-cent ice scraper, a small bottle of deicer or something to hang from his rear view mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #4: Do not buy men socks. Do not buy men ties. And never buy men bathrobes. I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, he wouldn't have invented Jockey shorts.</p>
<p>Rule #5: You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn out. If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the little picture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips, and flips.</p>
<p>Rule #6: Do not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. If you do, it will sit in a cupboard for 23 years. Real men drink whiskey or beer.</p>
<p>Rule #7: Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after shave or deodorant. I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy.</p>
<p>Rule #8: Buy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a couple of weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. ""Socks. Shorts. Cups. Saucers. Door. Lock. Sink."" You get the idea. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #9: Never buy a man anything that says ""some assembly required"" on the box. It will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.</p>
<p>Rule #10: Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, Parr Lumber, Home Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire. NAPA Auto Parts and Sear's Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. It doesn't matter if he doesn't know what it is. ""From NAPA Auto, eh? Must be something I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane? Wow! Thanks."")</p>
<p>Rule #11: Men enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue. Get him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him the gas line leaks. ""Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?""</p>
<p>Rule #12: Tickets to a Red Wing/Lions/Pistons/Tigers game are a smart gift. However, he will not appreciate tickets to ""A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts."" Everyone knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #13: Men love chain saws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chain saw. If you don't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets a label maker.</p>
<p>Rule #14: It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension ladder. Never buy a real man a step ladder. It must be an extension ladder. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Rule #15: Rope. Men love rope. It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least The Boy Scouts. Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8"" manilla rope. No one knows why.</p>

24536,"<p>Cinderella was now 75 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now dead Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a cat called Alan for companionship.</p>
<p>One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother.  Cinderella said: 'Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years?'<br /> The Fairy Godmother replied: 'Well Cinderella, since you have lived a good, wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes.  Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?'</p>
<p>Cinderella is taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful consideration and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish.  'I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension.' Instantly her rocking chair was turned into solid gold.  Cinderella was stunned.</p>
<p>Cinderella said 'Oh thank you, Fairy Godmother!'  The Fairy Godmother replied 'It is the least I can do.  What is your second wish?'  Cinderella looked down at her frail body and said: 'I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again.'</p>
<p>At once, her wish having been desired, became reality, and her beautiful youthful visage had returned.  Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years and long forgotten vigour and vitality began to course through her very soul.  Then the Fairy Godmother spoke again: 'You have one more wish, what shall you have?'</p>
<p>Cinderella looked over to Alan, who was now quivering in the corner with fear. 'I wish you to transform my old cat, Alan, into a beautiful and handsome young man.'  Magically, Alan suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biologicial make up, that when he stoof before her, he was a boy, so beautiful the like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds begun to fall from the sky at his feet.</p>
<p>The Fairy Godmother said: 'Congratulations Cinderella!  Enjoy your new life.'  With a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone.</p>
<p>For a few moments, Alan and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes.  Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly perfect boy she had ever seen.  Then Alan walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his muscular arms.</p>
<p>He leant close to her ear, and into her ear breathed as much as whispered, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath, 'I bet you regret having my balls chopped off now, don't you?'</p>

<p>""Only one?"" blurted the boss, ""most of my staff makes 20 or 30 sales a day.<br /> How much was the sale worth?""</p>
<p>""Three hundred thousand dollars,"" said the young man.</p>
<p>""How did you manage that?"" asked the flabbergasted boss. </p>
<p>""Well,"" said the salesman ""this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook,<br /> then a medium hook and finally a really large hook. Then I sold him a small<br /> fishing line, a medium one and a huge big one. I asked him where he was going<br /> fishing and he said down the coast.</p>
<p>I said he would probably need a boat, so I took him down to the boat<br /> department and sold him that twenty-foot schooner with the twin engines. Then he<br /> said his Volkswagen probably wouldn't be able to pull it, so I took him to the<br /> car department and sold him the new Deluxe Cruiser.""</p>
<p>The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, ""You sold all that to<br /> a guy who came in for a fish hook?"" </p>
<p>""No,"" answered the salesman ""He came in to buy a box of Tampons for his wife<br /> and I said to him, 'Your weekend's shot, you may as well go fishing.""</p>

24556,"<p>During WW II an American soldier had been on the front lines in Europe for<br /> three months, when he was finally given a week of R &amp; R. He caught a supply boat<br /> to a supply base in the south of England, and then caught a train to London.<br /> The train was extremely crowded and he could not find a seat. He was dead on<br /> his feet and walked the length of the train looking for any place to sit down.<br /> Finally he found a compartment with seats facing each other; there was room for<br /> two people on each seat. On one side sat only a proper looking, older British<br /> lady with a small dog sitting in the empty seat beside her.<br /> Could I please sit in that seat?"" he asked. The lady was insulted. ""You bloody<br /> Americans are so rude,"" she said. ""Can't you see my dog is sitting there?"" He<br /> walked through the train once more and still could not find a seat. He found<br /> himself back at the same place.<br /> ""Lady, I love dogs - have a couple at home - so I would be glad to hold your<br /> dog if I could sit down,"" he said. The lady replied, ""You Americans are not only<br /> rude you are arrogant too.""<br /> He leaned against the wall for a time, but was so tired he finally said,<br /> ""Lady, I've been on the front lines in Europe for three months with not a decent<br /> rest for all that time. Could I please sit there and hold your dog?"" The lady<br /> replied, ""You Americans are not only rude and arrogant, you are also obnoxious!"" </p>
<p>With that comment, the soldier calmly stepped in, picked up the dog, threw it<br /> out the window, and sat down. The lady was speechless. An older, neatly dressed<br /> Englishman sitting across on the other seat spoke up.<br /> ""Young man, I do not know if all you Americans fit the lady's description of<br /> you or not. But I do know that you Americans do a lot of things wrong. You drive<br /> on the wrong side of the road, you hold your fork with the wrong hand, and now<br /> you have just thrown the wrong bitch out of the window.</p>

24557,"<p>Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual trip...but there were problems everywhere. </p>
<p>Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. </p>
<p>Then, Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed Santa even more. </p>
<p>When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. More Stress. </p>
<p>Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. </p>
<p>So, frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hidden the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the he kitchen floor. </p>
<p>He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from. </p>
<p>Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door. He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said, ""Where would you like to put this tree Santa?"" </p>
<p>And that my friends, is how the little angel came to be on top of the Christmas tree. </p>

24559,"<p>A businessman walked into a New York City bank and asked for the loan officer. He said he was going to Europe on business for two weeks and needed to borrow $5,000. The loan officer said the bank would need some security for such a loan. The business man then handed over the keys to a Rolls Royce that was parked on the street in front of the bank. Everything checked out and the loan officer accepted the car as collateral for the loan. An employee then drove the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parked it there. Two weeks later the businessman returned, repaid the $5,000 and the interest which came to $15.41. The loan officer said, 'We do appreciate your business and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a bit puzzled. While you were away we checked and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is why you would bother to borrow $5,000?' The business man replied: 'Where else in New York City can I park my car for 2 weeks for 15 bucks?'</p>

24563,"<p>Redmond, WA -- Microsoft Corporation chair, CEO and all-around babe magnet Bill Gates announced yesterday the introduction of a new product for Windows 95: Microsoft Panhandling.""The idea came to me the other day when a homeless man asked me for money,"" recalls Gates. ""I suddenly realized that we were missing a golden opportunity. Here was a chance to make a profit without any initial monetary investment. Naturally, this man then became my competition, so I had my limo driver run over him several times.""Microsoft engineers have been working around the clock to complete Gates' vision of panhandling for the 21st century.""We feel that our program designers really understand how the poor and needy situation works,"" says Microsoft Homeless product leader Bernard Liu. ""Except for the fact that they're stinking rich.""Microsoft Panhandling will be automatically installed with Windows 95. At random intervals, a dialog box pops up, asking the user if they could spare any change so that Microsoft has enough money to get a hot meal. (""This is a little lie,"" admits software engineer Adam Miller, ""since our diet consists of Coke and Twinkies, but what panhandler doesn't embellish a little?"") The user can click Yes, in which case a random amount of change between $.05 and $142.50 is transferred from the user's bank account to Microsoft's. The user can also respond No, in which case the program politely tells the user to have a nice day. The ""No"" button has not yet been implemented.""We're experiencing a little trouble programming the No button,"" Bernard Liu says, ""but we should definitely have it up and running within the next couple of years. Or at least by the time Windows 2014 comes out. Maybe."" Gates says this is just the start of an entire line of products.""Be on the lookout for products like Microsoft Mugging, which either takes $50 or erases your hard drive, and Microsoft Squeegee Guy, which will clean up your Windows for a dollar."" (When Microsoft Squeegee Guy ships, Windows 95 will no longer automatically refresh your windows.)But there are competitors on the horizon. Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corporation are introducing panhandling products of their own.""Gates is a few tacos short of a combination platter, if you get my drift,"" says Oracle Head Honcho and 3rd degree black belt Larry Ellison. ""I mean, in the future, we won't need laptop computers asking you for change. You'll have an entire network of machines asking you for money.""Gates responded with, ""I know what you are, but what am I?"" General pandemonium then ensued.</p>

Then he is to slowly reach down into her panties and play around a bit, then wipe it on his face. That would turn him on, and once he woke her up, she couldn't resist this hardon. So he waits a few days, sneaks in, and crawls into bed beside his wife. He sticks his hand down her panties, and plays around a bit, then wipes it all over his face.

It<br /> appeared that heaven was nothing more than a giant clock warehouse.<br /> Surprised at how heaven looked, the man asked St. Peter what the deal was. Why<br /> are all these clocks here in heaven? St Peter replied, the clocks keep track of<br /> things on earth. There is one clock for each person. Every time the person on<br /> earth tells a lie, his clock moves one minute. For instance, this clock is for<br /> Sam, the used car salesman. If you watch it closely, it will move. Click. The<br /> minute hand on Sam's clock moved one minute. Click. It moved another minute. Sam<br /> must be into closing a customer right now said St. Peter. The minute hand on his<br /> clock moves all day.<br /> The man and St Peter continued walking. Soon they came to a clock with cobwebs<br /> on the minute hand. Whose clock is this"" asked the man. That clock belongs to<br /> the Widow Mary. She is one of the finest, God-fearing people on earth. I bet her<br /> clock hasn't moved in a year or two.<br /> They continued walking and touring heaven. The man enjoyed watching the clocks<br /> of all of his friends. When the tour was over the man said, "" I've seen<br /> everyone's clock but President Clinton's. Where is his clock?""<br /> Saint Peter smiled, ""Just look up.

24576,"<p>HOW TO PUT AN ELEPHANT INTO A REFRIGERATOR: Analysis: 1)  Differentiate it and put into the refrig.     Then integrate it in the refrig. 2)  Redefine the measure on the referigerator (or the elephant). 3)  Apply the Banach-Tarsky theorem. Number theory: 1)  First factorize, second multiply. 2)  Use induction.  You can always squeeze a bit more in.Algebra: 1)  Step 1. Show that the parts of it can be put into the refrig.     Step 2. Show that the refrig. is closed under the addition. 2)  Take the appropriate universal refrigerator and get     a surjection from refrigerator to elephant.Topology: 1)  Have it swallow the refrig. and turn inside out. 2)  Make a refrig. with the Klein bottle. 3)  The elephant is homeomorphic to a smaller elephant. 4)  The elephant is compact, so it can be put into a finite collection     of refrigerators. That's usually good enough. 5)  The property of being inside the referigerator     is hereditary.  So, take the elephant's mother,     cremate it, and show that the ashes fit inside the refrigerator. 6)  For those who object to method 3 because it's cruel to animals.     Put the elephant's BABY in the refrigerator.Algebraic topology:     Replace the interior of the refrigerator by its     universal cover, R^3.Linear algebra: 1)  Put just its basis and span it in the refrig. 2)  Show that 1% of the elephant will fit inside the refrigerator.     By linearity, x% will fit for any x.Affine geometry:     There is an affine transformation putting the     elephant into the refrigerator.Set theory: 1)  It's very easy!     refrigerator = { elephant } 2) The elephant and the interior of the     refrigerator both have cardinality c.Geometry:     Declare the following:       Axiom 1. An elephant can be put into a refrigerator.Complex analysis:     Put the refrig. at the origin         and the elephant outside the unit circle.     Then get the image under the inversion.Numerical analysis: 1)  Put just its trunk and refer the rest to the error term. 2)  Work it out using the Pentium.Statistics: 1)  bright statistician.         Put its tail as a sample and say ""Done.""2)  dull statistician.

24578,"<p>A guy goes to his local church during the week to see the priest and confess his sins. He goes into the confessional box and says, ""Father during the week I said the F-word."" </p>
<p>The priest says, ""Well my son, say 3 Hail Mary's and your sins will be forgiven.""</p>
<p> The guy however was quite eager to explain to the priest why he had used the F-word and grudgingly the priest agreed to listen to his explanation.</p>
<p>""Well I was playing golf last Sunday instead of coming to church,"" said the guy.</p>
<p> ""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked.</p>
<p> ""No,"" the guy replied. ""I was on the first tee and I duck hooked my drive into this terrible rough.""</p>
<p> ""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked.</p>
<p> ""No,"" the guy replied getting quite annoyed with the constant interruptions to his story. ""My ball took a lucky kick out of the rough and I was left with a perfect shot to the green.""</p>
<p> ""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked.</p>
<p> ""No,"" the guy said. ""As I went to play my ball a squirrel grabbed it and took off with it.""</p>
<p> ""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked.</p>
<p> ""No,"" the guy replied. ""As the squirrel was running away with my ball an eagle swooped down on it and took off with the squirrel and my ball.""</p>
<p> ""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked.</p>
<p> ""No,"" the guy replied. ""The eagle dropped the squirrel over the green and the ball rolled out of its mouth and finished 5 inches from the hole.""</p>
<p> The priest said, ""Don't tell - me you missed the fucking putt!""</p>

<p>When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during the game,<br /> she'd appear in a little box in the corner of the screen during a time-out.</p>
<p>Breaking up would be a lot easier.  A smack to the ass and a ""Nice<br /> hustle, you'll get 'em next time"" would pretty much do it.</p>
<p>Birth control would come in ale or lager.</p>
<p>You'd be expected to fill your resume with gag names of people you'd worked for, like ""Heywood J'Blowme.""</p>

<p>Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would only<br /> occur in leap years.</p>
<p>On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you'd get the day off to go drinking. Mother's Day, too.</p>
<p>St. Patrick's Day, however, would remain exactly the same. But it would be celebrated every month.</p>
<p>COPS would be broadcast live, and you could phone in advice to the pursuing cops. Or to the crooks.</p>
<p>Two words: Ally McNaked.</p>
<p>Regis and Kathie Lee would be chained to a cement mixer and pushed off the Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative pay-per-view event in world history.</p>

<p>Every man would get four real Get Out of Jail Free cards per year.</p>
<p>When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you responded with would actually reduce your fine. As in:<br /> Cop: ""You know how fast you were going?""<br /> You: ""All I know is, I was spilling my beer all over the place.""<br /> Cop: ""Nice one. That's $10 off.""</p>
<p>Faucets would run ""Hot,"" ""Cold,"" and ""100 proof.""</p>

24593,"<p>Coach Bobby Ross had put together the perfect Lions team. The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools, but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback who could ensure a Super Bowl win.</p>
<p>Then one night, while watching CNN, he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia. In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand grenade straight into a 15th-story window 200 yards away -- ka-boom! He threw another hand grenade into a group of 10 soldiers 100 yards away -- ka-blooey! Then a car passed, going 90 mph -- bulls-eye!</p>
<p>""I've got to get this guy!"" Ross said to himself. ""He has the perfect arm!""</p>
<p>So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football, and the Lions go on to win the Super Bowl for the first time in history.</p>
<p>The young Bosnian is lionized as the Great Hero of football, and when Ross asks him what he wants, all the young man wants to do is to call his mother. ""Mom,"" he says into the phone, ""I just won the Super Bowl.""</p>
<p>""I don't want to talk to you,"" the old woman says. ""You deserted us. You are not my son.""</p>
<p>""I don't think you understand, Mother!"" the young man pleads. ""I just won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""</p>
<p>""No, let me tell you,"" the mother retorts. ""At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighbourhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and this week your sister was raped in broad daylight.""</p>
<p>The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says:</p>

As he searched for<br /> the ball he saw a leprechaun sitting down holding his head, the ball had<br /> hit him on the groin. He went over to the leprechaun and asked him if he<br /> was ok. </p>
<p>The leprechaun looked at him and said, ""Ok you've got me, I know you want<br /> wishes, what are they?""</p>
<p>The man said that he didn't want any wishes and that he just wanted to<br /> make sure that he was ok. The leprechaun said that he was okay and walked<br /> away surprised. The man picked up his ball and went about continuing his<br /> golf.</p>
<p>Later that day the leprechaun was thinking about what had happened and<br /> said to himself what a nice guy and that he would give him wishes anyway.<br /> He said to himself, ""I will give him what any man wants: lots of money, a<br /> great golf game and a great sex life.""</p>

He said sorry and the leprechaun remembered him. The<br /> leprechaun asked him if anything had changed in the past year. </p>
<p>""How are things financially?"" the leprechaun asked. ""Great,"" said the guy,<br /> ""I always seem to have lots of money.""</p>

24606,"<p>For decades, two heroic statues, one male and one female, faced each other in a city park, until one day an angel came down from heaven.</p>
<p>""You've been such exemplary statues,"" he announced to them, ""That I'm going to give you a special gift. I'm going to bring you both to life for thirty minutes, in which you can do anything you want."" And with a clap of his hands, the angel brought the statues to life.</p>
<p>The two approached each other a bit shyly, but soon dashed for the bushes, from which shortly  emerged a good deal of giggling, laughter, and shaking of branches. Fifteen minutes later, the two statues emerged from the bushes, wide grins on their faces.</p>
<p>""You still have fifteen more minutes,"" said the angel, winking at them.</p>
<p>Grinning even more widely the female statue turned to the male statue and said, ""Great! Only this time...<br /> you hold the pigeon down and I'll crap on it's head.""</p>

A little girl named Peggy held up her hand timidly and said, 'If my friend was walking across the street and a car ran over her... well, that would be a tragedy!'

About his time little Johnny held up his hand. 'Oh. Oh. I know, I know...' Johnny started. 'If you and the Vice President and all the senators and all the congressmen were having a meeting, and a bomb blew everybody up that would be a tragedy.' 'That's right!' the President exclaimed.

24652,"<p>Siga con atenci�n estos pasos si necesita darle una p�ldora a un gato:</p>
<p>1) Tome al gato y ac�nelo con su brazo izquierdo como si estuviera sosteniendo a un beb�. Con los dedos �ndice y el pulgar de su mano izquierda aplique una suave presi�n a las mejillas del animal mientras sostiene la p�ldora con la derecha. Cuando el felino abra el hocico, arroje la p�ldora dentro. Perm�tale cerrar el hocico a fin de que trague la p�ldora. </p>
<p>2) Levante la p�ldora del suelo y al minino de detr�s del sof�. Acune al micifuz en su brazo izquierdo y repita el proceso.</p>
<p>3) Traiga al micho del dormitorio y tire la p�ldora babeada a la basura.</p>
<p>4) Tome una nueva p�ldora de la caja, acune al gatito en su brazo izquierdo manteniendo las patas traseras firmemente sujetas con su mano izquierda. Fuerce la apertura de mand�bulas y empuje la p�ldora dentro del hocico con su dedo medio. Mantenga el hocico del animalito cerrado mientras cuenta hasta diez.</p>
<p>5) Saque la p�ldora de la pecera y al micho de arriba del armario. Llame a su esposa y p�dale apoyo.</p>
<p>6) Arrod�llese en el suelo con la sabandija firmemente sostenida entre sus rodillas. Mantenga las patas traseras y delanteras quietas. Ignore los gru�idos que el animal emite. P�dale a su esposa que sostenga la cabeza del gato con una mano mientras le abre el hocico con una regla de madera. Arroje la p�ldora dentro y fr�tele vigorosamente la garganta.</p>
<p>7) Baje al gato de la cortina. Traiga otra p�ldora de la caja. Recuerde comprar una nueva regla y reparar la cortina. Barra cuidadosamente los trozos de figuras de porcelana y p�ngalos aparte para pegarlos luego.</p>
<p>8) Envuelva al gato en una toalla grande y p�dale a su esposa que lo mantenga estirado, con s�lo la cabeza visible. Ponga la p�ldora en un pitillo pl�stico. Abra el hocico del morrongo con un l�piz. Ponga un extremo del pitillo en el hocico de la mascota y el otro en su boca. Sople.</p>
<p>9) Verifique la caja para asegurarse que la p�ldora no es da�ina para seres humanos. Beba un vaso de agua para eliminar el gusto medicinal. Aplique ap�sitos a los brazos de su esposa y limpie la sangre de la alfombra con agua fr�a y jab�n.</p>
<p>10) Traiga al gato del tejado del vecino. Tome otra p�ldora. Ponga a su mascota en el armario y cierre la puerta sobre su cuello, dejando �nicamente la cabeza fuera del mismo. Fuerce la apertura del hocico con una cuchara de postre. Arroje la p�ldora dentro con una bandida el�stica.</p>
<p>11) Vaya al garaje a buscar un destornillador para volver a colocar la puerta del armario en sus bisagras. Apl�quese compresas fr�as en sus mejillas y verifique cuando fue su �ltima dosis de vacuna contra el t�tanos. Arroje la franela que ten�a puesta en la lavadora y tome una limpia del dormitorio.</p>
<p>12) Llame a los bomberos para que lo ayuden a bajar al gato del �rbol de la calle de enfrente. Disc�lpese con su vecino que se estrell� contra su reja tratando de escapar del furioso animal. Tome la �ltima p�ldora de la caja.</p>
<p>13) Ate las patas delanteras del gato a las traseras con una cuerda. �telo firmemente a la pata de la mesa de la cocina. Busque guantes de trabajo pesado. Mantenga el hocico del gato abierto con una peque�a palanca. Ponga la p�ldora en el hocico seguida de un gran trozo de carne. Mantenga la cabeza vertical y vierta medio litro de agua a trav�s de la garganta del gato para que trague la p�ldora.</p>
<p>14) Haga que su esposa lo lleve a la sala de emergencias. Si�ntese tranquilamente mientras el doctor le venda dedos y frente y le saca la p�ldora del ojo. En el camino de vuelta, det�ngase en la muebler�a para comprar una nueva mesa de cocina.</p>
<p>15) Arregle con una oficina inmobiliaria para comprar una nueva casa sin gato y llame al veterinario para averiguar si tiene alg�n h�mster para vender.</p>

24656,"<p>Things came to a head last week and the name Monica Lewinsky is fast<br /> becoming a real mouthful at the White House. The latest news about<br /> President Clinton is definitely hard to swallow and seems certain to<br /> leave a nasty taste in the mouth of the current administration. It<br /> will be some time before all the stains resulting from this issue are<br /> removed from the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Monica Lewinsky has proved to be not as tight lipped as Clinton had<br /> hoped and is expected to spit out the truth to a Grand Jury tomorrow.<br /> She will surely go down in history for her orations concerning the<br /> comings and goings behind the doors of the Oval Office. Monica was<br /> apparently on her knees when she received the recent gagging order<br /> from the White House and now has to decide whether to swallow her pride<br /> and dispose of the evidence, or to succumb to the deep throated<br /> rumblings of the Washington Press Corp. and spill the issue wide open.</p>
<p>Any attempt by Lewinsky to suck up to Clinton can only be construed as<br /> lip service and Clinton would be advised to try and minimize the<br /> impact of this, the latest in a long series of blows he has received<br /> since coming to power. Despite this latest blow, job security for the<br /> President seems to be assured, as he can rely on his proven oral<br /> skills to promote a career in public speaking, being, as he has often<br /> shown, a cunning linguist. (Although Hillary Clinton may disagree with<br /> this, as she claims she is rarely on the end of a tongue lashing from<br /> Bill!)</p>
<p>Miss Lewinsky is from a naval background and her choice of Bill<br /> Clinton as a lover is somewhat surprising, given her preference for<br /> seamen. According to her lawyer, Miss Lewinsky likes to see men in<br /> power and relished the thought of taking a length of time to chew things<br /> over with the President, whenever she could fit him in. And the<br /> President was equally keen to see Miss Lewinsky, always putting on a<br /> spurt when he entered her office.</p>
<p>Miss Leweinsky has apparently been offered a PR job by Listerine, who<br /> described her as spunky enough for any job. Her name has also been<br /> associated with Big Gulp soda advertising and Kleenex.</p>

<p>Q: Officer, who provided this description?</p>

<p>The owner said, ""I might have what you are looking for!"", and took the man into the back room, where a bedraggled looking parrot sat on a perch. ""This is Chet. He is a perfect Christmas pet, because he sings Christmas songs."" </p>
<p>The owner took a Bic lighter out of his pocket, lit it, and held it under Chet's right wing just far enough away to keep from singing the parrot's feathers. Immediately Chet began to sing, ""Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way."" </p>
<p>Then the owner held the lighter under Chet's left wing, and the squawky sound of ""Silent night. Holy night"" poured out of Chet's beak. The man bought the parrot on the spot, and took him home. </p>
<p>His children were gone when he got home, so he decided to check out Chet' talent for himself, just to make sure he hadn't been tricked. He lit a match, held it under Chet's right wing, and sure enough the bird began singing ""Jingle bells."", just like before. Moving the match under Chet's left wing produced the same results as in the pet store. ""Silent Night."" </p>
<p>Being of a curious nature, the man decided to hold the match between Chet's legs to see what would happen. Immediately the parrot began to sing, ""Chet's nuts roasting on an open fire.</p>

<p>That night, he takes it out for a spin and, while doing so,<br /> stops at a red light. An old man on a moped (both looking about<br /> 90 years old) pulls up next to him. The old man looks over the<br /> sleek, shiny surface of the car and asks, ""What kind of car ya'<br /> got there, sonny?"" </p>
<p>The young man replies, ""A 1997 Porsche 911 Turbo. It cost me<br /> $100,000."" </p>
<p>""That's a lot of money,"" replies the old man. ""Why do they cost<br /> so much?"" </p>
<p>""Because this car can do up to 180 miles an hour!"" states the<br /> young man proudly. </p>
<p>The moped driver asks, ""Can I take a look inside?"" </p>
<p>""Sure,"" replies the owner. </p>
<p>So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.<br /> Leaning back on his moped, the old man says, ""That's a pretty<br /> nice car, all right!"" </p>
<p>Just then the light changes, so the young guy decides to show<br /> the old man what his car can do. He floors it, and within 10<br /> seconds the speedometer reads 120 MPH. Suddenly, he notices a<br /> dot in his rear view mirror that seems to be getting closer! He<br /> slows down to see what it could be and suddenly, whhhoooossshhh!<br /> Something whips by him, going much faster! </p>
<p>""What on earth could be going faster than my Porsche 911 Turbo?""<br /> the young man asks himself. Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot<br /> coming toward him. Whoooooosh! It goes by again, heading the<br /> opposite direction! And, it almost looked like the old man on<br /> the moped! </p>
<p>""Couldn't be,"" thinks the guy. ""How could a moped outrun a<br /> Porsche 911 Turbo?"" </p>
<p>Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whooooosh-BLAMMM!<br /> It plows into the back of his car. The young man jumps out. It<br /> is the old man! Of course, the moped and the old man are hurting<br /> for certain. He runs up to the old man and says, ""You're hurt<br /> bad! Is there anything I can do for you?"" </p>

The Lawyer thought a moment, then said, ""A week ago, I gave a quarter to a homeless person on the street."" Saint Peter asked Gabriel to check this out in the record, and after a moment Gabriel affirmed that this was true. Saint Peter said, ""Well , that's fine, but it's not really quite enough to get you into Heaven."" The Lawyer said, ""Wait Wait! There's more! Three years ago I also gave a homeless person a quarter."" Saint Peter nodded to Gabriel, who after a moment nodded back, affirming this, too, had been verified. Saint Peter then whispered to Gabriel, ""Well, what do you suggest we do with this fellow?""

24793,"<p>TRADITION(Jewish Humor)</p>
<p>During a service at an old synagogue in Eastern Europe, when the Shema prayer was said, half the congregants stood up and half remained sitting. The half that was seated started yelling at those standing to sit down, and the ones standing yelled at the ones sitting to stand up...</p>
<p>The rabbi, learned as he was in the Law and commentaries, didn't know what to do. His congregation suggested that he consult a housebound 98-year old man, who was one of the original founders of their temple. The rabbi hoped the elderly man would be able to tell him what the actual temple tradition was, so he went to the nursing home with a representative of each faction of the congregation.</p>
<p>The one whose followers stood during Shema said to the old man, ""Is the tradition to stand during this prayer?""</p>
<p>The old man answered, ""No, that is not the tradition."" The one whose followers sat asked, ""Is the tradition to sit during Shema?""</p>
<p>The old man answered, ""No, that is not the tradition.""</p>
<p>Then the rabbi said to the old man, ""The congregants fight all the time, yelling at each other about whether they should sit or stand...""</p>

<p>Dear Scumbags: </p>
<p>7-26-85 </p>
<p>I received your pathetic, ridiculous attempt at legalized extortion yesterday. Just out of curiosity, what's your cut if you collect? The first thing you need to realize is that I have no credit record to ""protect"". My credit rating is piss-poor, and I have skipped out on bills all over the United States. </p>
<p>However, I need a personal phone, so I have no intention of skipping out on this phone bill. More significantly, though, I would never, but NEVER, pay a past-due bill to you scum-sucking leeches. Which leads me to my next point: It should be clear by now that I do not have a high regard for your `arasitic profession. In fact, in my eyes, you would be doing yourselves, and society at large, a favor by closing down immediately and entering a more respectable field--like pimping or kiddie porn. You certainly have the professional ethics for it . . . </p>
<p>In sum, I have every intention of paying my phone bill and restoring my service, hopefully within sixty days. But you heaps of rancid guano will have had NOTHING to do with it. Please continue to bombard me with notices--I just bought some extra-large trash bags to handle the load. Oh, and please feel free to send a representative to my home. </p>
<p>Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to knock him down the flight of 25 steps leading to my front door. That is, if filth-balls of your ilk ever appear in daylight . . . Worst of luck and my sincerest wishes for the immediate failure of your ""business"". </p>
<p>GET A JOB!!! </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

24825,"<p>Bush Seeks Ban on Cartoon, Cereal, Vitamins</p>
<p>The ongoing campaign against alleged gay icons in animated cartoons continued today as president Bush demanded that television stations stop broadcasting ""The Flintstones"" at once.</p>
<p>Harland Devane, presidents Bush�s leader of the group Focus on the Flintstones, said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. today that his organization was issuing the demand because, ""Quite simply, everything about 'The Flintstones' is way too gay.""</p>
<p>The conservative activist distributed a memo itemizing over fifty ways in which the self-styled ""modern Stone Age family"" series promotes homosexuality, but left little doubt that most of his concerns centered on the relationship between the two main characters, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble.</p>
<p>""Their relationship is more flagrantly homosexual than anything in Oliver Stone's 'Alexander,'"" Mr. Devane said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that Fred and Barney are virtually inseparable, are never seen wearing pants, and live together in the suggestively named town of Bedrock.</p>
<p>Noting that the show's theme song exhorts viewers to have ""a gay old time,"" he added that the two men wear hard hats and construction garb while at work, an oblique reference to the construction worker in the classic disco band ""The Village People.""</p>
<p>""Do I believe they are gay icons?"" Mr. Devane said.  ""I abba-dabba-do.""</p>
<p>He added that Focus on the Flintstones' efforts will not stop at banning the cartoon series from TV, telling reporters that the group is also ""taking a close look"" at Flintstone-related consumer products such as Flintstone vitamins and cereal.</p>
<p>""We are very uncomfortable with Fruity Pebbles,"" he said</p>

24828,"<p>Little Johnny was 7 years old, and like other boys his age, rather curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about courting from other boys and he wondered what it was and how it was done.</p>
<p>One day he took his questions to his mother, and she became flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did, and the following morning Johnny described everything to his mother:</p>
<p>""Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her, I figured sis must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart,just like the doctor would. Except he's not as good as the doctor, because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart.</p>
<p>He was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been getting cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got toward the end of the couch.</p>
<p>This was when the fever started. I know it was a fever because sis told him she was really HOT.</p>
<p>Finally, I found out what was making them so sick.... a big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there about 9 inches long. HONEST!</p>
<p>Anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away.</p>
<p>When sis saw it she got really scared. Her eyes got big and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. I should tell her about the ones I saw at the lake!</p>
<p>Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by bitting its head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go... I guess it bit her back.</p>
<p>Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eels head to keep it from biting again.</p>
<p>Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on it. And he helped by laying on the top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squishing it between them.</p>
<p>After a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend sat up and sure enough they had killed the eel...</p>
<p>I knew it was dead because it just hung there limp and some of its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went on courting anyway.</p>
<p>He started hugging and kissing her again. And by golly, the eel wasn't dead after all. It jumped straight up and started to fight again.</p>
<p>I guess eels are like cats.... they have nine lives or something.</p>
<p>This time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it. After about 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the eel. I know it was dead this time because I saw sis's boyfriend peel off the skin and flush it down the toilet.""</p>

24831,"<p>Two rednecks are driving down the highway, drinking their beer, when flashing<br /> lights from a policeman appear in the driver's rear-view mirror. ''Don't<br /> worry!'' says the driver to his friend, ''Just do exactly what I tell you and<br /> everything will work out perfectly. First, we'll peel the labels off our beer<br /> bottles and we'll each stick one on our forehead. Now shove all of the bottles<br /> under the front seat! And, let me do all the talking!'' </p>

<p>''Oh no Sir,'' replies the driver. </p>
<p>''I noticed you weaving back and forth across the highway. Are you sure you<br /> haven't been drinking?'' the cop asks. </p>
<p>''Oh, no sir,'' the drunk answers. ''We haven't had a thing to drink<br /> tonight.'' </p>
<p>''Well, I've got to ask you,'' says the cop, ''What on earth are those things<br /> on your forehead?'' </p>

24832,"<p>My friend is a rather old-fashioned lady, always quite delicate<br /> and elegant, especially in her language. She and her husband<br /> were planning a week's vacation in Florida, so she wrote to a<br /> particular campground and asked for a reservation.</p>
<p>She wanted to make sure the campground was fully equipped, but<br /> didn't quite know how to ask about the toilet facilities. She<br /> just couldn't bring herself to write the word ""toilet"" in her<br /> letter. After much deliberation she finally came up with the<br /> old-fashioned term ""bathroom commode."" But when she wrote that<br /> down, she still felt that she was being too forward. So she<br /> started all over again, rewrote the entire letter, and referred<br /> to the bathroom commode merely as the B.C. ""Does the campground<br /> have its own B.C.?"" is what she finally wrote.</p>
<p>Well, the campground owner wasn't old-fashioned at all, and when<br /> he got the letter he just couldn't figure out what the woman was<br /> talking about. That B.C. business really stumped him. After<br /> worrying about it for a while, he showed the letter to several<br /> campers, but no one could imagine what the lady meant, either.<br /> So the campground owner, finally coming to the conclusion that<br /> the lady must be asking about the location of the Baptist<br /> Church, sat down and wrote the following reply:</p>
<p>Dear Madam: I regret very much the delay in answering your<br /> letter, but I now take the pleasure of informing you that a B.C.<br /> is located nine miles north of the campground, and is capable of<br /> seating 250 people at one time. I admit it is quite a distance<br /> away if you are in the habit of going regularly, but no doubt<br /> you will be pleased to learn that a great number of our people<br /> take their lunches along and make a day of it. They usually<br /> arrive early and stay late. If you don't start early, you<br /> probably will not make it in time. The last time my wife and I<br /> went was six years ago, and it was so crowded we had to stand up<br /> the whole time we were there. It may interest you to know that<br /> right now, there is a supper planned to raise money to buy more<br /> seats. They're going to hold it in the basement of the B.C. I<br /> would like to say it pains me very much not being able to go<br /> more often, but it surely is no lack of desire on my part. As we<br /> grow older, it seems to be more of an effort, particularly in<br /> cold weather. If you decide to come down to our campground,<br /> perhaps I could go with you the first time you go, sit with you,<br /> and introduce you to all the other folks. Remember, this is a<br /> friendly community!!</p>

24836,"<p>Once upon a time, God was missing for six days. Eventually, Michael, the archangel, found him, resting on the seventh day.  He inquired of God.  ""Where have you been?""</p>
<p>God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction, and proudly pointed downwards through the clouds, ""Look, Michael. Look what I've made."" Archangel Michael looked puzzled, and said, ""What is it?"" ""It's a planet,"" replied God, ""and I've put Life on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance."" </p>
<p>""Balance?"" inquired Michael, still confused. God explained, pointing to different parts of earth. ""For example, northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while southern Europe is going to be poor. Over there I've placed a continent of white people, and over there is a continent of black people.  Balance in all things,"" God continued pointing to different countries. ""This one will be extremely hot, while this one will be very cold and covered in ice."" </p>
<p>The Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to a land area and said, ""What's that one?"" ""Ah,"" said God ""That's Washington State, the most glorious place on earth.  There are beautiful mountains, rivers and streams, lakes, forests, hills, plains, and coulees. The people from Washington State are going to be handsome, modest, intelligent, and humorous, and they are going to be found traveling the world. They will be extremely sociable, hardworking, high achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as diplomats, and carriers of peace.""</p>

24849,"<p>Two Polish guys were taking their first trip to Warsaw on the train. A vendor came down the corridor selling bananas, which they'd never seen before. Each bought one.</p>
<p>The first one eagerly peeled the banana and bit into it just as the train went into a tunnel. When the train emerged from the tunnel, he looked across to his friend and said, ""I wouldn't eat that if I were you.""</p>

24852,"<p>Three turtles, Joe, Steve, and Poncho, decide to go on a picnic. So, Joe packs the picnic basket with cookies, bottled sodas, and sandwiches. The trouble is, the picnic site is, 10 miles away, so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there. By the time they do arrive, everyone's whipped .Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and says,'Alright, Steve, gimme the bottle opener.</p>
<p>""I didn't bring the bottle opener,' Steve says. 'I thought you packed it.' Joe gets worried. </p>
<p>He turns to Poncho. 'Poncho, do you have the bottle opener?' </p>
<p>Naturally, Poncho doesn't have it, so the turtles are stuck ten miles away from home without soda. Joe &amp; Steve beg Poncho to turn back home and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses, knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back. Somehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go ,swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food. </p>
<p>So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and steadily. Twenty days pass, but no Poncho. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise. Another day passes, and still no Poncho, but a promise is a promise. After three more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve starts getting restless. </p>
<p>'I NEED FOOD!' he says with a hint of dementia in his voice. 'NO!' Joe retorts. 'We promised.' Five more days pass. Joe realizes that Poncho probably skipped out to the Burger King down the road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid ,get a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat. </p>
<p>But then, right at that instant, Poncho pops out behind a rock, and says, ""Just for that, I'm not going.""</p>

24859,"<p>It was Saturday morning and Jake, an avid hunter, woke up ready   to go bag the first deer of the season.  He walks down to the   kitchen to get a cup of coffee, and to his surprise he finds   his wife, Alice, sitting there, fully dressed in camouflage.     Jake asks her, �What are you up to?�     Alice smiles, �I'm going hunting with you!�   Jake, though he has many reservations, reluctantly   decides to take her along. They arrive at the hunting   site. Jake sets his wife safely up in the tree stand and tells   her: �If you see a deer, take careful aim on it and I'll come   running back as soon as I hear the shot.�     Jake walks away with a smile on his face knowing that Alice   couldn't bag an elephant -- much less a deer. But not 10 minutes   pass when he is startled as he hears an array of gunshots.     Quickly, Jake starts running back. As Jake gets closer to her   stand, he hears Alice screaming, �Get away from my deer!�   Confused, Jake races faster towards his screaming wife. And   again he hears her yell, �Get away from my deer!� followed by   another volley of gunfire.    Now within sight of where he had left his wife, Jake is   surprised to see a cowboy, with his hands high in the air.      The cowboy, obviously distraught, says, �Okay, lady, okay!You can have your deer! Just let me get my saddle off it!�</p>

24895,"<p>SICKNESS AND RELATED LEAVE:<br /> We will no longer accept a doctor statement as proof of sickness. If you are<br /> able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work. </p>
<p>SURGERY:<br /> Operations are now banned. As long as you are an employee here, you need all<br /> your organs. You should not consider removing anything. We hired you intact. To<br /> have something removed constitutes a breach of employment. </p>
<p>BEREAVEMENT LEAVE:<br /> This is no excuse for missing work. There is nothing you can do for dead<br /> friends, relatives or coworkers. Every effort should be made to have<br /> non-employees attend to the arrangements. In rare cases, where employee<br /> involvement is necessary, the funeral should be scheduled in the late afternoon.<br /> We will be glad to allow you to work through your lunch hour and subsequently<br /> leave one hour early, provided you share of the work is done enough to keep the<br /> job going in your absence. </p>

For instance, those whose<br /> names begin with 'A' will go from 8:00 to 8:10, employees whose names begin with<br /> 'B' will go from 8:10 to 8:20 and so on. If you're unable to go at your time, it<br /> will be necessary to wait until the next day when your time comes again. In<br /> extreme emergencies employees may swap their time with a coworker. In writing,<br /> both employees' supervisors must approve this exchange. In addition, there is<br /> now a strict 3-minute time limit in the stalls. At the end of three minutes, an<br /> alarm bell will sound, the toilet paper roll will retract, and the stall door<br /> will open. </p>

<p>The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of alternating<br /> visits with the German woman. </p>
<p>The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman<br /> is cleaning and cooking for them. </p>
<p>The two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to<br /> the English woman. </p>
<p>The two Bulgarian men took one long look at the endless ocean,<br /> another long look at the Bulgarian woman, and started swimming. </p>
<p>The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are awaiting instructions. </p>
<p>The two Chinese men have set up a pharmacy, a liquor store, a<br /> restaurant, and a laundry, and have got the woman pregnant in<br /> order to supply employees for the store. </p>
<p>The two American men are contemplating the virtues of suicide<br /> because the American woman keeps endlessly complaining about her body,the<br /> true nature of feminism, how she can do everything they can do, the<br /> necessity of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how sand<br /> and palm trees make her look fat, how her last boyfriend respected her<br /> opinion and treated her nicer than they do, how her relationship with her<br /> mother is improving, and at least the taxes are low and it isn't raining. </p>
<p>The two Irish men have divided the island into North and South and<br /> set up a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture<br /> because it gets sort of foggy after the first few liters of coconut<br /> whiskey.<br /> But they're satisfied because at least the English aren't having any fun.</p>

24919,"<p>A helicopter was flying around Seattle yesterday when an electrical<br /> malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic navigation and<br /> communications equipment. Due to the clouds and haze, the pilot could not<br /> determine the helicopter's position and course to steer to the airport.</p>
<p>The pilot saw a tall building, flew toward it, circled, drew a handwritten<br /> sign, and held it in the helicopter's window. The pilot's sign said ""WHERE<br /> AM I?"" in large letters.</p>
<p>People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a<br /> large sign, and held in a building window. Their sign said ""YOU ARE IN A<br /> HELICOPTER."" The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the<br /> course to steer to SEATAC airport, and landed safely.</p>
<p>After they were on the ground, the co-pilot asked the pilot how the ""YOU<br /> ARE IN A HELICOPTER"" sign helped determine their position. The pilot<br /> responded ""I knew that had to be the MICROSOFT building because, similar<br /> to their help-lines, they gave me a technically correct but completely<br /> useless answer.""</p>

"
24936,"<p>On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of<br /> quarters at a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for<br /> dinner with her husband in the hotel dining room. But first she<br /> wanted to stash the quarters in her room. ""I'll be right back<br /> and we'll go to eat,"" she told her husband and she carried the<br /> coin-laden bucket to the elevator. </p>
<p>As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men<br /> already aboard. Both were black. One of them was big...very<br /> big...an intimidating figure. The woman froze. Her first thought<br /> was: These two are going to rob me. Her next thought was: Don't<br /> be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice gentlemen. But racial<br /> stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her. </p>
<p>She stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious,<br /> flustered, ashamed. She hoped they didn't read her mind, but<br /> knew they surely did; her hesitation about joining them on the<br /> elevator was all too obvious. Her face was flushed. She couldn't<br /> just stand there, so with a mighty effort of will she picked up<br /> one foot and stepped forward and followed with the other foot<br /> and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye contact, she turned around<br /> stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed. A second<br /> passed, and then another second, and then another. Her fear<br /> increased! The elevator didn't move. Panic consumed her. ""My<br /> God"", she thought, ""I'm trapped and about to be robbed!"" Her<br /> heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore. </p>
<p>Then...one of the men said, ""Hit the floor."" Instinct told her:<br /> Do what they tell you. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as<br /> she threw out her arms and collapsed on the elevator carpet. A<br /> shower of coins rained down on her. ""Take my money and spare<br /> me"", she prayed. </p>
<p>More seconds passed. She heard one of the men say politely,<br /> ""Ma'am, if you'll just tell us what floor you're going to, we'll<br /> push the button."" The one who said it had a little trouble<br /> getting the words out. He was trying mightily to hold in a belly<br /> laugh. She lifted her head and looked up at the two men. They<br /> reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her<br /> feet. </p>
<p>""When I told my man here to hit the floor,"" said the average<br /> sized one, ""I meant that he should hit the elevator button for<br /> our floor. I didn't mean for you to hit the floor, ma'am."" He<br /> spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious he was having a<br /> hard time not laughing. </p>
<p>She thought: ""My God, what a spectacle I've made of myself."" She<br /> was too humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology,<br /> but words failed her. How do you apologize to two perfectly<br /> respectable gentlemen for behaving as though they were going to<br /> rob you? She didn't know what to say. </p>
<p>The 3 of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her<br /> bucket. When the elevator arrived at her floor they insisted on<br /> walking her to her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her<br /> feet, and they were afraid she might not make it down the<br /> corridor. At her door they bid her a good evening. </p>
<p>As she slipped into her room she could hear them roaring with<br /> laughter while they walked back to the elevator. The woman<br /> brushed herself off. She pulled herself together and went<br /> downstairs for dinner with her husband. </p>
<p>The next morning flowers were delivered to her room--a dozen<br /> roses. Attached to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar<br /> bill. The card said: ""Thanks for the best laugh we've had in<br /> years."" It was signed, Eddie Murphy &amp; Michael Jordan</p>

<p>The first question was, ""Without using numbers, represent the number 9.""</p>
<p>Tony says, ""Dat's easy"" and proceeds to draw three trees.</p>
<p>The boss says, ""What in the world is that?""</p>
<p>Tony says, ""Tree 'n tree 'n tree makes nine.""</p>
<p>""Fair enough"" says the boss. ""Second questions, same rules, but represent 99"".</p>
<p>Tony stares into space for a while, then makes a smudge on each tree.</p>
<p>""Der ya go sir,"" he says.</p>
<p>The boss scratches his head and asks, ""How on earth do you get that to represent 99?""</p>
<p>Tony answers, ""Each tree is dirty now, so it's - dirty tree 'n dirtytree 'n dirty tree - dat 99.""</p>
<p>The boss is getting worried he's going to have to hire Tony so he says, ""All right, question number 3. Same rules again, but this time represent the number 100.""</p>
<p>Tony stares into space again, then he shouts, ""I got it!"" He makes a little mark at the base of each tree and says, ""Der ya go sir - 100.""</p>

<p>He then tells Tony, ""Go on Tony, you must be crazy if you think that represents a 100.""</p>
<p>Tony leans forward and points to the little marks at the tree bases and says, ""A little dog comes along and craps by each tree"", so now ya got dirty tree an' a turd, dirty tree an' a turd, and dirty tree an 'a turd, which makes 100.</p>

24974,"<p>Ancient History Explained...</p>
<p>A team of archaeologists found a slab of rock with 5 figures carved on it, in order:</p>
<p>A Woman, A Donkey, A Shovel, A Fish, A Star of David. </p>
<p>After months of study, the leader took the rock and went on a lecture tour. He said the carvings were thousands of years old but even so, they revealed a lot about the people of that time.</p>
<p>The woman being placed first in the line of figures showed that women were held in very high esteem - most likely a family oriented culture.</p>
<p>They probably used the donkey to till the fields.<br /> The shovel shows they were highly intelligent as they knew how to make tools.<br /> The fish shows they knew how to augment the crops they raised by also reaping from the sea.<br /> The Star of David of course indicates they were a very religious group of people.</p>
<p>A little old man in the front row finally got the attention of the speaker.</p>
<p>When acknowledged he said, ""I'm sorry to blow your conclusions but you were reading it left to right. In Hebrew we read from right to left.</p>
<p>That way it reads, ""Holy Mackerel, Dig the Ass on that Chick!""</p>

The<br /> elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the doctor<br /> said, ""your hearing is perfect.  Your family must be really pleased you<br /> can hear again.""</p>

24978,"<p>An old farmer decided it was time to get a new rooster for his hens. The current rooster was still doing an okay job, but he was getting on in years. And the farmer figured getting a new rooster couldn't hurt anything. So he buys a young cock from the local rooster emporium, and turns him loose in the barnyard.<br /> Well, the old rooster sees the young one strutting around and he gets a little worried. 'So, they're trying to replace me, thinks the old rooster. I've got to do something about this.' He walks up to the new bird and says, ""So you're the new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff, don't you? Well, I'm not ready for the chopping block yet. I'll bet I'm still the better bird. And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around that hen house over there. We'll run around it ten times and whoever finish's first gets to have all the hens for himself."" </p>
<p>Well, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he definitely thought he was more than a match for the old guy. ""You're on,"" said the young rooster. ""And since I know I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of half a lap. I'll still win easy,"" said the young rooster. </p>
<p>So the two roosters go over to the hen house to start the race with all the hens gathering around to watch. The race begins and all the hens start cheering the roosters on. After the first lap, the old rooster is still maintaining his lead. After the second lap, the old guy's lead has slipped a little but he's still hanging in there. Unfortunately the old rooster's lead continues to slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he's just barely in front of the young rooster. </p>
<p>By now the farmer has heard all the commotion. He runs into the house, gets his shotgun, and runs out to the barnyard figuring a fox or something is after his chickens. When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the hen house, with the old rooster still slightly in the lead. He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires, and blows the young rooster away. </p>
<p>As he walks away slowly, he says to himself . . . ""Damn, that's the third gay rooster I've bought this month.""</p>

She gestures alluringly to the barman who comes over immediately.When he arrives, she seductively signals that he should bring his face close to hers. When he does so, she begins to gently caress his beard, which is full and bushy.'Are you the manager?' she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands.'Actually, no,' he replies.'Can you get him for me? I need to speak to him,' she says, running her hands up beyond his beard and into his hair. 'I'm afraid I can't,' breathes the barman, clearly aroused. 'Is there anything I can do?' �Yes there is. I need you to give him a message,' she continues huskily, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them. 'Tell him,' she says, 'that there is no toilet paper or hand soap in the ladies' toilet.'</p>

24989,"<p>A man decided to have a face lift for his birthday. He spends<br /> $5,000 and feels really great about the result. </p>
<p>On his way home he stops at a news stand and buys a paper.<br /> Before leaving he says to the sales clerk, ""I hope you don't<br /> mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?"" ""About 35,"" was<br /> the reply. ""I'm actually 47,"" the man says, feeling really happy.</p>
<p>After that he goes into McDonalds for lunch, and asks the order<br /> taker the same question, to which the reply is, ""Oh you look<br /> about 29"". ""I am actually 47!"" This makes him feel really good.</p>
<p>While standing at the bus stop he asks an old woman the same<br /> question. She replies, ""I am 85 years old and my eyesight is<br /> going.

24992,"<p>I was on my way to the post office to pick up my case of free M&amp;M's (sent to me because I forwarded an e-mail to five other people, celebrating the fact that the year 2000 is ""MM"" in Roman numerals), when I ran into a friend whose neighbor, a young man, was home recovering from having been served a rat in his bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken (which is predictable, since as everyone knows, there's no actual chicken in Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is why the government made them change their name to KFC).</p>
<p>Anyway, one day this guy went to sleep and when he awoke he was in his bathtub and it was full of ice and he was sore all over and when he got out of the tub he realized that HIS KIDNEY HAD BEEN STOLEN. He saw a note on his mirror that said ""Call 911!"" but he was afraid to use his phone because it was connected to his computer, and there was a virus on his computer that would destroy his hard drive if he opened an email entitled ""Join the crew!"" He knew it wasn't a hoax because he himself was a computer programmer who was working on software to prevent a global disaster in which all the computers get together and distribute the $250.00 Neiman-Marcus cookie recipe under the leadership of Bill Gates. (It's true - I read it all last week in a mass e-mail from BILL GATES HIMSELF, who was also promising me a free Disney World vacation and $5,000 if I would forward the e-mail to everyone I know.)</p>
<p>The poor man then tried to call 911 from a pay phone to report his missing kidneys, but a voice on the line first asked him to press #90, which unwittingly gave the bandit full access to the phone line at the guy's expense.</p>
<p>Then reaching into the coin-return slot he got jabbed with an HIV-infected needle around which was wrapped a note that said, ""Welcome to the world of AIDS."" Luckily he was only a few blocks from the hospital - the one where that little boy who is dying of cancer is, the one whose last wish is for everyone in the world to send him an e-mail and the American Cancer Society has agreed to pay him a nickel for every e-mail he receives.</p>
<p>I sent him two e-mails and one of them was a bunch of x's and o's in the shape of an angel (if you get it and forward it to more than 10 people, you will have good luck but for 10 people only you will only have OK luck and if you send it to fewer than10 people you will have BAD LUCK FOR SEVEN YEARS).</p>
<p>So anyway the poor guy tried to drive himself to the hospital, but on the way he noticed another car driving without its lights on. To be helpful, he flashed his lights at him and was promptly shot as part of a gang initiation.</p>
<p>Send THIS to all the friends who send you their junk mail and you will receive 4 green M&amp;Ms -- if you don't, the owner of Proctor and Gamble will report you to his Satanist friends and you will have more bad luck: you will get sick from the Sodium Laureth Sulfate in your shampoo, your spouse/mate will develop a skin rash from using the antiperspirant which clogs the pores under your arms, and the U.S. government will put a tax on your e-mails forever.</p>
<p>I know this is all true because I read it on the Internet! </p>
