25000,"<p>Managed Friendship Plan</p>
<p>Welcome to Managed Friendship, a whole new way of thinking about<br /> friends and relationships.  The Managed Friendship Plan (MFP) combines<br /> all the advantages of a traditional friendship network with important<br /> cost-saving features.</p>
<p>How Does It Work?</p>
<p>Under the Plan, you choose your friends from a network of pre-screened<br /> accredited Friendship Providers (FPs).  All your friendship needs are<br /> met by members of your Managed Friendship Staff.</p>
<p>What's Wrong with my Current Friends?</p>
<p>If you're like most people, you are receiving friendship services from<br /> a network of providers haphazardly patched together from your old<br /> neighborhoods, jobs, and schools.  The result is often costly<br /> duplication, inefficiency, and conflict.  Many of your current friends<br /> may not meet national standards, responding to your needs with<br /> inappropriate, outmoded,or even experimental acts of friendship.<br /> Under Managed Friendship, your friendship needs are coordinated by<br /> your designated Best Friend, who will ensure the quality and goodness<br /> of fit of all your friendly relationships.</p>
<p>How Do I Know That the Plan's Panel of Friends Is Not Made Up of a Bunch<br /> of Losers Who Can't Make Friends on Their Own?</p>
<p>Many of today's most dedicated and highly trained Friendship Providers<br /> are as concerned as we are about delivering Quality Friendship in a<br /> cost-effective manner.  They have joined our network because they want<br /> to focus on acting like a friend rather than doing the paperwork and<br /> paying the high bad-friendship premiums that have caused the cost of<br /> traditional friendship to skyrocket.  Our Friendship Providers have<br /> met our rigorous standards of companionship and loyalty.</p>
<p>What If I Need a Special Friend, Say, for Poker or Fishing?</p>
<p>Special Friends are responsible for most of the unnecessary and<br /> expensive activities that burden already costly relationships.  Under<br /> the Managed Friendship Plan, your Best Friend is qualified to<br /> pre-approve your referral to a Special Friend within the Managed<br /> Friendship Network should your needs fall outside of the scope of<br /> his/her friendship.</p>
<p>Suppose I Want to See Friends Outside the Managed Friendship Network?</p>
<p>You may make friends outside of the Managed Friendship Network only in<br /> the event of a Friendship Emergency.</p>
<p>What is a Friendship Emergency?</p>
<p>The Managed Friendship Plan covers your friendship needs 24 hours a<br /> day, 365 days a year, even if you need a friend out of town, after<br /> regular business hours, or when your Best Friend is with someone else.<br /> You might be on a business trip, for instance, and suddenly find that<br /> you feel lonely. In such cases, you may make a New Friend, and all<br /> approved friendly activities will be covered under the Plan, provided<br /> you notify the Managed Friendship Office (or 24-hour Friendship<br /> Hotline) within two business days.</p>
<p>What Friendly Activities Are Covered Under the Plan?</p>
<p>Friendly Activities that are typically covered include:<br /> * Agreeing with you<br /> * Appearing sympathetic<br /> * Chewing the fat<br /> * Dropping by<br /> * Feeling your pain<br /> * Gossiping<br /> * Hanging out<br /> * Holding your hand (up to 5 minutes per activity)*<br /> * Joshing<br /> * Kidding around<br /> * Listening to you whine<br /> * Partying<br /> * Passing the time<br /> * Patting your back<br /> * Ribbing<br /> * Sharing a meal<br /> * Shooting the breeze<br /> * Slinging the bull<br /> * Teasing (up to 15 minutes under the Premium Gold Friendship Plan)</p>
<p>What Friendly Activities Are Not Covered Under the Plan?</p>
<p>Activities that would not be pre-approved include (but are not limited to):<br /> * Bar hopping<br /> * Bending over backwards<br /> * Drinking to excess<br /> * Giving a hoot<br /> * Going the extra mile<br /> * Lending money<br /> * Real empathy<br /> * Truly caring<br /> * Using illicit drugs</p>
<p>How Can I Find Out More About the Managed Friendship Plan?</p>
<p>A simple call is all it takes.  If you need a friend, just call our<br /> toll-free number.  Or visit our web site.  Sign up for the Managed<br /> Friendship Plan and rest easier that all of your appropriate<br /> friendship needs will be met.</p>

25040,"<p>As a crowded airliner is about to take off, the peace is shattered by a<br /> 5-year-old boy who picks that moment to throw a wild temper tantrum. No matter<br /> what his frustrated, embarrassed mother does to try to calm him down, the boy<br /> continues to scream furiously and kick the seats around him. </p>
<p>Suddenly, from the rear of the plane, an elderly man in the uniform of an Air<br /> Force General is seen slowly walking forward up the aisle. Stopping the<br /> flustered mother with an upraised hand, the white-haired, courtly, soft-spoken<br /> General leans down and, motioning toward his chest, whispers something into the<br /> boy's ear. </p>
<p>Instantly, the boy calms down, gently takes his mother's hand, and quietly<br /> fastens his seat belt. All the other passengers burst into spontaneous applause. </p>
<p>As the General slowly makes his way back to his seat, one of the cabin<br /> attendants touches his sleeve. ""Excuse me, General,"" she asks quietly, ""but<br /> could I ask you what magic words you used on that little boy?"" </p>
<p>The old man smiles serenely and gently confides, ""I showed him my pilot's<br /> wings, service stars, and battle ribbons, and explained that they entitle me to<br /> throw one passenger out the plane door on any flight I choose.""</p>

As<br /> soon as you finish bathing throw open all the windows and stand in the draft.""<br /> ""But doc,"" protested the patient, ""if I do that, I'll get pneumonia.""<br /> ""I know,"" said the doctor, ""I can cure pneumonia.""</p>

25046,"<p>One night, the Potato family sat down to dinner--Mother Potato and her three daughters. Midway through the meal, the eldest daughter spoke up. ""Mother Potato?"" she said. ""I have an announcement to make."" ""And what might that be?"" said Mother, seeing the obvious excitement in her eldest daughter's eyes. ""Well,"" replied the daughter, with a proud but sheepish grin, ""I'm getting married!"" The other daughters squealed with surprise as Mother Potato exclaimed, ""Married! That's wonderful! And who are you marrying, Eldest daughter?"" ""I'm marrying a Russet!"" ""A Russet!"" replied Mother Potato with pride. ""Oh, a Russet is a fine tater, a fine tater indeed!"" As the family shared in the eldest daughter's joy, the middle daughter spoke up. ""Mother? I, too, have an announcement."" ""And what might that be?"" encouraged Mother Potato. Not knowing quite how to begin, the middle daughter paused, then said with conviction, ""I, too, am getting married!"" ""You, too!"" Mother Potato said with joy. ""That's wonderful! Twice the good news in one evening! And who are you marrying, Middle Daughter?"" ""I'm marrying an Idaho!"" beamed the middle daughter. ""An Idaho!"" said Mother Potato with joy. ""Oh, an Idaho is a fine tater, a fine tater indeed!"" Once again, the room came alive with laughter and excited plan for the future, when the youngest Potato daughter interrupted. ""Mother? Mother Potato? Um, I, too, have an announcement to make."" ""Yes?"" said Mother Potato with great anticipation. ""Well,"" began the youngest Potato daughter with the same sheepish grin as her eldest sister before her, ""I hope this doesn't come as a shock to you, but I am getting married, as well!"" ""Really?"" said Mother Potato with sincere excitement. ""All of my lovely daughters married! What wonderful news! And who, pray tell, are you marrying, Youngest Daughter?"" ""I'm marrying Peter Jennings!"" ""Peter Jennings?!"" Mother Potato scowled suddenly. ""But he's just a common tater!""</p>

25050,"<p>An Illinois man who left the snowballed streets of Chicago for a vacation in<br /> Florida. His wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet him there the<br /> next day. When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick e-mail. </p>
<p>Unable to find the scrap of paper on which he had written her e-mail<br /> address, he did his best to type it in from memory. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, he missed one letter and his note was directed instead to an<br /> elderly preacher's wife, whose husband had passed away only the day before. When<br /> the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, let out<br /> a piercing scream, and fell to the floor dead. </p>
<p>At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen: </p>
<p>Dearest Wife,<br /> Just got checked in. Everything prepared for your arrival tomorrow. You�re<br /> Loving Husband. </p>

"
25051,"<p>Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the ""in-flight safety lecture"" and their other anouncements a bit more entertaining. Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:</p>
<p>There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane...""</p>
<p>After landing: ""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.""</p>
<p>As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice came over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella. WHOA!""</p>
<p>After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: ""Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted.""</p>
<p>From a Southwest Airlines employee.... ""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seatbelt, and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised.</p>
<p>In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face.</p>
<p>If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two or more small children, decide now which one you love more.</p>
<p>Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, we'll but try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest Airlines.""</p>
<p>""Your seat cushions can be used for flotation, and in the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments.""</p>
<p>Once on a Southwest flight, the pilot said, ""We've reached our cruising altitude now, and I'm turning off the seat belt sign. I'm switching to autopilot, too, so I can come back there and visit with all of you for the rest of the flight.""</p>
<p>""Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting children or adults acting like children.""</p>
<p>""As you exit the plane, make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.""</p>
<p>""Last one off the plane must clean it.""</p>
<p>And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry... Unfortunately, none of them are on this flight...!""</p>
<p>Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City: The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, ""That was quite a bump and I know what ya'll are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendants' fault...it was the asphalt!""</p>
<p>Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach the Captain was really having to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA and announced, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate!""</p>
<p>Another flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal.""</p>
<p>An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile, and give them a ""Thanks for flying XYZ airline."" He said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally evryone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane. She said, ""Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?"" ""Why no Ma'am,"" said the pilot, ""what is it?"" The little old lady said, ""Did we land or were we shot down?""</p>
<p>After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant came on with, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Capt. Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal.""</p>
<p>Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go zipping through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of us here at US Airways.""</p>

The Queen said to the Pope out of the side of her mouth, 'I bet you a tenner that I can make every English person in the crowd go wild with just a wave of my hand.' The Pope replied, 'No way! You can't do that.' The Queen said, 'Watch this!' So, the Queen waved her hand and every English person in the crowd went crazy, waving their little plastic Union Jacks on sticks and cheering like mad. The Pope was standing there thinking, 'Oh no, what am I going to do? I never thought she'd be able to do it.' He thought to himself for a minute, and then turned to her and said, 'I bet you I can make every Irish person in the crowd go wild. Not just now, but for the rest of the week, with just one nod of my head.' The Queen replied, 'No way, it can't be done.' So, the Pope head-butted her.</p>

25070,"<p>This is a bricklayer's accident report that was printed in the newsletter of the English equivalent of the Workers' Compensation Board. So here, thanks to John Sedgwick, is this Bricklayer's report.</p>
<p>Dear Sir;</p>
<p>I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block #3 of the accident reporting form. I put ""Poor Planning"" as the cause of my accident. You asked for a more complete explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient. </p>
<p>I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I found I had some bricks left over which, when weighed later, were found to weigh 240 lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building at the sixth floor. </p>
<p>Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out, and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240 lbs of bricks. You will note on the accident reporting form that my weight is 135 lbs. </p>
<p>Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. </p>
<p>In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the fractured skull, minor abrasions, and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3, accident reporting form. </p>
<p>Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley which I mentioned in Paragraph 2 of this correspondence. Fortunately, by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience. </p>
<p>At approximately the same time however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, the barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. </p>
<p>I refer you again to my weight. As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body. </p>
<p>Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. </p>
<p>I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope.</p>

25072,"<p>A dietician was once addressing a large audience in Chicago. 'The material we put into our stomachs is enough to have killed most of us sitting here, years ago. Red meat is awful. Vegetables can be disastrous, and none of us realizes the germs in our drinking water. But, there is something that is perhaps more dangerous than anything else.' The dietician peered into the crowd and asked, 'Can anyone here tell me what lethal product I'm referring to?' </p>
<p>A handful of people in the audience raised their hands with possible answers.</p>
<p>'Yes, you, sir, in the first row,' said the dietician. 'Please give us your idea.'</p>

25077,"<p>To All Employees: It has come to our attention recently that many of you have been turning in timecards that specify large amounts of ""Miscellaneous Unproductive Time"" (Code 5309). Note that unproductive time isn't a problem.</p>
<p>What is a problem, however, is not knowing exactly what you are doing during your unproductive time. Attached below is a sheet specifying a tentative extended job code list based on our observations of employee activities.</p>
<p>The list will allow you to specify with a fair amount of precision what you are doing during your unproductive time. Please begin using this job code list immediately and let us know about any difficulties you encounter. Thank you, Accounting. Attached: Extended Job Code List</p>

One of the men was modest and one of them was greedy.<br /> Upon arriving at the river, the modest man prayed<br />  ""Oh great god, I wish to have one of my eyes removed for all<br /> the sins I have committed.""<br />  Then the greedy man approached the river, and thought that the<br /> modest one had asked for something special. So to get the better<br /> of the modest one, he said,<br />  ""God, could I have twice whatever he's having.""</p>

""And what would your wish be?"" asked the genie.""I want them both back after lunch"" replied the project manager.</p>

25090,"<p>Late one night, a burglar broke into a house that he thought was<br /> empty. He tiptoed through the living room but suddenly he froze<br /> in his tracks when he heard a loud voice say: ""Jesus is watching<br /> you!"" </p>
<p>Silence returned to the house, so the burglar crept forward<br /> again. ""Jesus is watching you,"" the voice boomed again. </p>
<p>The burglar stopped dead again. He was frightened.<br /> Frantically,he looked all around. In a dark corner, he spotted a<br /> bird cage and in the cage was a parrot. </p>
<p>He asked the parrot, ""Was that you who said Jesus is watching<br /> me?"" </p>
<p>""Yes"", said the parrot. </p>
<p>The burglar breathed a sigh of relief, then asked the parrot,<br /> ""What's your name?"" </p>
<p>""Clarence,"" said the bird. </p>
<p>""That's a dumb name for a parrot"", sneered the burglar. ""What<br /> idiot named you Clarence?"" </p>

25091,"<p>When we were dating, my husband used to always tell me those three magic words, ""I love you"". Now that we are married, those three magic words have become, ""What's for dinner?""</p>
<p>When we were dating, my husband would gently rub me with hot oil while he affectionately called me lovely nicknames. Now that we are married, he gently rubs his car with hot wax, which now has its own pet nickname.</p>
<p>When we were dating, my husband would always love to watch me undress. Now that we are married, he loves to watch championship wrestling.</p>
<p>When we were dating, my husband read poetry to me as he caressed me in his arms late into the night. Now that we are married, he quotes me sports statistics and stock prices during breakfast.</p>
<p>When we were dating, my husband would passionately motivate and urge me on in whatever I did, whether it was at my job or during sex. Now that we are married, the only thing he passionately urges on is his favorite football team.</p>
<p>When we were dating, my husband would make love to me on his waterbed like a sex-starved wild beast who would go on and on. So we called the bed our ""Ocean Of Motion Love Potion"". Now that we are married, the bed has been renamed ""The Dead Sea"".</p>

"
25100,"<p>Men are a misunderstood lot, which all in all is probably for the best. Women are better off not knowing that we eat with our hands the minute they leave the room or that we use their nail clippers to trim our nose hair. Better for them, better for us. Still, it's annoying that women spend more time and money trying to understand the minds of cats than they do wondering about what makes men tick. Which is why they'll never understand... </p>
<p>1. Our consuming need to own the biggest and most expensive version of just about everything.</p>
<p>Our compulsive desire to drive off-road vehicles in cities and use corkscrews that resemble off-shore drilling equipment is well documented. As marketing targets, men are suckers for terms like ""professional"" or ""industrial strength"", because inside every man is the germ of every profession he ever imagined himself one day excelling at. Most of these purchases are harmless, little more than childish wish fulfillment played out at a higher testosterone level. But occasionally we go too far. The guy upstairs from me once boasted that he had a filter which filled his flat with ""operating theatre quality air"". I kept him away from my surgical steel steak knives. </p>
<p>2. Why we are so bad at shopping. </p>
<p>We've never been trained to do it the right way. Supermarkets are like giant booby traps for males - which is why if you send a man out to but eggs, sugar and bread you should not be surprised if he returns home with a case of wine, a pair of jeans and a tree. </p>
<p>3. The reason why we don't like to discuss The Relationship. </p>
<p>Most of us will find any excuse to dodge those conversations that start with questions like ""Are you really happy?"" and ""Where do you see us going?"" A relationship is a delicate thing, like an antique clock, and we know what will happen if we start picking it apart. Often our reticence will result in a lengthy conversation about why we have trouble talking about The Relationship.</p>
<p>4. Why we think we can fix things.</p>
<p>Almost all men believe they can repair virtually anything with a little patience. In reality, we're only half right. Men are extremely good at taking things apart: whether it's a dishwasher or an antique clock, a man can break it down to its most basic components in no time. Unfortunately, this is where our expertise usually leaves off, and we're mostly satisfied with leaving bits and pieces spread all over newspaper on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>5. Men and video games.</p>
<p>Women cannot understand how grown men can waste huge chunks of their lives zapping things off a screen. When a man repeatedly rings his girlfriend to say he has to work late and routinely comes home at two in the morning all glassy eyed, she will usually take this as evidence of an affair - when it's more likely that a pirated copy of Streetfighter II is making the rounds at the office. </p>
<p>6. That sometimes we really are ill.</p>
<p>When men get ill, women are generally united in their belief that we are faking it. This is based on a tired old axiom stating that men will never fully understand the agony of childbirth so deserve no sympathy regarding matters of pain, fear or incapacitation. For the record, it should be noted that all men are in a constant state of feeling slightly under the weather just from being men. It's only a misplaced sense of machismo that forces us from our beds every day to go into work and then down to the pub for a couple of schooners of the only thing that ever makes us feel any better. </p>
<p>7. The way we watch television.</p>
<p>Men don't just watch the TV, they plug right in. Once we're on the right wavelength, we can watch almost anything, including commercials, with a slack-jawed intensity which probably drives you crazy. Unfortunately for women, men cannot achieve this higher state without a firm grasp on the remote.</p>
<p>8. Our sense of humor. </p>
<p>When women say that what they most want from a man is a sense of humor, they tend to mean something different from what we mean. Women never understand the comic genius of their mate who makes beer come out of his nose. </p>
<p>9. Why we're so boring. </p>
<p>Male conversation generally relies heavily on petty obsession, technical jargon, numbing detail and presumed expertise. Topics that women only feel the need to mention in passing become Test-Match length debates among men. True, some of us are able to combine a scintillating wit with a flair for story telling and a nose for gossip, but we tend to reserve these talents for conversations with women. Between ourselves, the drive to talk at length about tire pressure or ""Star Trek"" episodes is too alluring. Even if your local pool team boasted Socrates, Einstein and Oscar Wilde as members, you'd still probably have to discuss the fastest way to get to the freeway. </p>
<p>10. The male menopause. </p>
<p>Midlife crisis, the seven year itch, whatever you like to call it - women don't understand the seriousness of this condition, instead seeing it only as an excuse for a man to resign from his job, buy a Harley Davidson and start a relationship with a woman a third of his age. Like there has to be more to it than that.</p>

25103,"<p>A golfer is in a competitive match with a friend, who is ahead by a couple of<br /> strokes. </p>

<p>A stranger walks up to him and whispers, ""Would you give up a fourth of your<br /> sex life?"" </p>
<p>The golfer thinks the man is crazy and that his answer will be meaningless,<br /> but also that perhaps this is a good omen, so he says, ""Okay,"" and sinks the<br /> putt. </p>
<p>Two holes later he mumbles to himself, ""Boy, if I could only get an eagle on<br /> this hole."" </p>
<p>The same stranger moves to his side and says, ""Would it be worth another<br /> fourth of your sex life?"" </p>
<p>The golfer shrugs and says, ""Sure."" </p>
<p>He makes an eagle.</p>
<p>On the final hole, the golfer needs yet another eagle to win.</p>
<p>Though he says nothing, the stranger moves to his side and says, ""Would you be<br /> willing to give up the rest of your sex life to win this match?"" </p>
<p>The golfer says, ""Certainly!"" He makes the eagle.</p>
<p>As the golfer walks to the club house, the stranger walks alongside and says,<br /> ""You know, I've really not been fair with you because you don't know who I am.<br /> I'm the devil, and from now on you will have no sex life."" </p>
<p>""Nice to meet you,"" says the golfer. ""My name's Father O'Malley.""</p>

25111,"<p>* Emergency Rooms will tell you one of the most common injury suffered in falling out of bed for a guy is a broken dick. Although the penis does not have a ""bone"" it is full of erectile tissue that can be bent too far to the point of snapping. This type of injury requires surgery to correct. Often it can result in massive hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>* The man who accidentally sent a knee into his lovers face in the dark as he climbed up to *** ***k her. Broke her nose, blackened both her eyes and knocked out three teeth, one of which had to be dug out of his kneecap. It had dug down to the bone and stuck there.</p>
<p>* Getting nailed in the nuts is no joke either, a friend of mine got an unintended knee in the groin when he and his girl were changing positions and the impact ruptured a vein. His ball sack filled with blood. It swelled to a diameter of seven inches and turned black on the way to the hospital. The good folks at the Emergency Room had to lance it upon arrival and it burst like a balloon. They then had to cut it open and fix the blood vessel. He was bed ridden for almost two months. (He married the girl and they have been together now for over ten years.)</p>
<p>* The guy who couldn't wait and jumped into bed at the sight of his naked and beckoning lover. His action sent a wave across the waterbed so big it threw her out of bed. She took out the nightstand and the lamp, the room was plunged into darkness. She was knocked out cold as her head hit the wall. To top it off, when she fell out of bed, she landed on her sleeping cat killing it with her plummeting body.</p>
<p>* The woman who slipped in the shower while she was stroking her lovers erection, her fall was averted but she twisted him so hard that another trip to the emergency room was needed.</p>
<p>* The couple who fell through the glass shower door and needed stitches.</p>
<p>* The girl who got a slipped disk in an unusual sexual position and could not straighten up. (The Emergency Room got a real chuckle over that one.)</p>
<p>* The man who served breakfast in bed to his girl and she was so taken by it that they started to make love again, with the tray still on the bed. The coffee spilled and shorted the electric blanket which set fire to the bed.</p>
<p>* The woman who lost her dentures in the middle of a blowjob on a guy she had just met. When the teeth came loose they cut him so bad he had to have stitches.</p>

25128,"<p>The US Standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? Because that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were built by English expatriates. Why did the English people build them like that? Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used.</p>
<p>Why did ""they"" use that gauge then? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. Okay! Why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on some of the old, long distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts.</p>
<p>So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in Europe were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their legions. The roads have been used ever since. And the ruts? The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. Since the chariots were made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing.</p>
<p>Thus, we have the answer to the original questions. The United State standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original specification for an Imperial Roman army war chariot.</p>
<p>Specs and Bureaucracies live forever. So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's ass came up with it, you may be exactly right. Because the Imperial Roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two war horses.</p>

25137,"<p>On a farm out in the country lived a man and a woman and their three sons. Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of the window onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow was lying dead in the field. The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she possibly continue to feed her family now?<br /> In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the man awoke to find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in he head. </p>
<p>Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the cow!), and he decided to go down to the river and drown himself. When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the bank. She said, ""I've seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you will have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and the cow to you."" The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to satisfy her again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river. </p>
<p>Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had happened, he too decided to throw himself into the river. The mermaid said to him, ""If you will have sex with me ten times in a row, I will make everything right."" And while the son tried his best (seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she drowned him in the river. </p>
<p>The youngest son, woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless prospect, and he went down to the river to throw himself in. </p>
<p>And there he also met the Mermaid. ""I have seen all that has happened, and I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen times in a row."" </p>
<p>The young son replied, ""Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?"" </p>
<p>The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said, ""Hell, why not twenty-five times in a row?"" And even as she was reluctantly agreeing to his request, he said, ""Why not THIRTY timesin arow?"" </p>
<p>Finally, she said, ""Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with methirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect health."" </p>
<p>Then the young fellow asked, ""Wait! How do I know that thirty times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?""</p>

<p>""Sometimes, if the offer's really good, he'll go out to the alley with some guy and make love with him for money.""</p>

The manufacturer will not be responsible for any damages or inconveniences that may result.READ THIS BEFORE OPENING PACKAGE: According to certain suggested versions of the Grand Unified Theory, the primary particles constituting this product may decay to nothingness within the next four hundred million years.THIS IS A 100% MATTER PRODUCT: In the unlikely event that this merchandise should contact antimatter in any form, a catastrophic explosion will result.PUBLIC NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY LAW: Any use of this product, in any manner whatsoever, will increase the amount of disorder in the universe. Although no liability is implied herein, the consumer is warned that this process will ultimately lead to the heat death of the universe.NOTE: The most fundamental particles in this product are held together by a ""gluing"" force about which little is currently known and whose adhesive power can therefore not be permanently guaranteed.ATTENTION: Despite any other listing of product contents found hereon, the consumer is advised that, in actuality, this product consists of 99.9999999999% empty space.NEW GRAND UNIFIED THEORY DISCLAIMER: The manufacturer may technically be entitled to claim that this product is ten-dimensional. However, the consumer is reminded that this confers no legal rights above and beyond those applicable to three-dimensional objects, since the seven new dimensions are ""rolled up"" into such a small ""area"" that they cannot be detected.PLEASE NOTE: Some quantum physics theories suggest that when the consumer is not directly observing this product, it may cease to exist or will exist only in a vague and undetermined state.COMPONENT EQUIVALENCY NOTICE: The subatomic particles (electrons, protons, etc.) comprising this product are exactly the same in every measurable respect as those used in the products of other manufacturers, and no claim to the contrary may legitimately be expressed or implied.HEALTH WARNING: Care should be taken when lifting this product, since its mass, and thus its weight, is dependent on its velocity relative to the user.IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PURCHASERS: The entire physical universe, including this product, may one day collapse back into an infinitesimally small space. Should another universe subsequently re-emerge, the existence of this product in that universe cannot be guaranteed.</p>

25234,"<p>OK, so there's this blonde driving down the road in her brand new, candy-apple red, $125,000 Lamborghini. She's cruisin' about 95, radio blaring, having a great time. She comes up on this trucker who is carrying a double-wide home and is taking up both lanes. To her disliking, he is only going about 45. To get the point across that she wants to get past, she decides to tailgate him. So, she gets to within a foot of his rear bumper. The trucker looks back and sees her on his ass, and motions for her to get off of it, but to her it looks like a wave and she waves back. Since her first attempt was futile, she decided to get a little closer and begin flashing her headlights, hopefully making herself more visible in the process. Once again the trucker sees her on his ass, and this time motions for her to pull over to the side of the road. </p>
<p>The trucker steps out of his vehicle with a chunk of chalk and draws a circle three feet in diameter in the middle of the road. He instructs her not to move until he tells her to. Naive as she was, she agrees to it and steps inside it. </p>
<p>The trucker goes back to his truck and pulls out a 50-ounce Louisville Slugger. He walks over to the Lamborghini and beats it, and beats it, and beats it again. When he is done, all that is left is a brand new, candy-apple red, $125,000 pile of metal. Satisfied, he throws the bat in his truck and walks over to the blonde. When he gets there, to his astonishment, she is rolling around on the street laughing hysterically. He asks her, ""Why are you laughing? I just beat the crap out of your car!!"" She is laughing too hard to respond, but between giggles he can make out, ""While you weren't looking I stepped out of the circle!""</p>

25250,"<p>The kindergarten class had a homework assignment to find out about<br /> something exciting and relate it to the class the next day. When the time<br /> came for the little kids to give their reports, the teacher was calling on<br /> them one at a time. She was reluctant to call upon little Johnnie, knowing<br /> that he sometimes could be a bit crude. But eventually his turn came.<br /> Little Johnnie walked up to the front of the class, and with a piece of<br /> chalk, made a small white dot on the blackboard, then sat back down. Well,<br /> the teacher couldn't figure out what Johnnie had in mind for his report,<br /> so she asked him just what that was. ""It's a period,"" reported Johnnie.<br /> ""Well I can see that,"" she said, ""but what is so exciting about a period.""<br /> ""Damned if I know,"" said Johnnie, ""but this morning my sister said she<br /> missed one. Then Daddy had a heart attack, Mommy fainted and the man next<br /> door shot himself.""</p>

25255,"<p>Did you hear about the gay Polak? </p>
<p>He slept with women.</p>
"
25256,"<p>This guy lives in Westchester, NY and goes to school at Ithaca College. For two years, he has wanted to ask a certain girl (who is also from Westchester and also goes to Ithaca) out on a date, but has never had the courage. Finally, one day over the summer, he sees her at home and musters up the courage to ask her out. She accepts, and they make dinner plans for Saturday night. Friday night, this guy goes out with all of his buddies, and drinks like Prohibition is coming back. Saturday, he is in such bad shape that he can't make it through 20 minutes without either throwing up or using the bathroom.<br /> After several hours of this, he is able to stop throwing up, but he is still running to the toilet every 20 minutes. He doesn't want to cancel the date, because he's afraid he won't ever talk to her again. So they meet in Westchester, and take the train to New York City (about a 30 minute ride). They get to the restaurant, and he excuses himself during the appetizers to use the bathroom. They enjoy the rest of the appetizers without interruption, but he has to go back again during the entrees. They decide to get dessert. </p>
<p>During dessert, our hero feels another rumbling, but doesn't want to look like complete bathroom freak, so he holds it. After a few minutes, the rumbling subsides, but he still has a bit of gas stored up. He decides to let this little bit of gas fly right there at the table (discreetly, of course). Unfortunately, this little bit of gas came with another little surprise. ""Oh crap,"" he thinks (and feels). Instead of running to the bathroom right away, our hero immediately leans on the arms of his chair to keep from sitting on this surprise. </p>
<p>He maintains this yoga position for the rest of dessert, trying to figure out what to do before his tan pants (a) start to smell, or (b) start to show stains on the outside. He quickly pays for dinner and they leave the restaurant. Oh, by the way,he is walking like a cowboy. On the way to the train station, they pass the Gap. ""Do you mind if I run in and buy a sweater that I was looking at last week?"" he asks. ""No problem, I'd like to look around too,"" she replies. </p>
<p>They go into the Gap. Fortunately, at the Gap, men's fashions are on the right, women's fashions are on the left. They split up. Our hero grabs the first sweater within reach, and hurries back to the khakis. After selecting a pair that most closely resemble his current outfit, he brings both items to the register. His eyes are on his date (still on the other side of the store) to make sure that she doesn't see him buying the pants. He doesn't even want the sweater, so he says through clenched teeth (just in case his date can read lips from 40 feet away) ""Just the pants."" ""What?"" asks the Gap girl. ""Just the pants!"" (Eyes still trained on his date.) Gap girl: ""Oh, OK."" He pays for the pants and walks over to his date, then they leave the store. </p>
<p>They board the train just before it leaves the station and find two seats in the middle of the car. Without sitting down, our hero excuses himself and walks to the bathroom in the back of the car. He gets to the bathroom as the train departs, and quickly rips off his pants and boxer shorts. He rolls them into a ball and throws them out the window. After cleaning himself off, he opens the Gap bag and pulls out... just the sweater.</p>

25257,"<p>Little Johnny, on a day when he was being particularly reckless,<br /> was playing in the backyard one morning. Soon, some honeybees<br /> started swirling around, annoying Little Johnny. He began<br /> stomping on them in his temper. His father caught him trampling<br /> the honeybees, and after a brief moment of thought said, ""That's<br /> it! No honey for you for one month!""</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, Johnny pondered upon some butterflies, and<br /> soon started catching them and crushing them under his feet. His<br /> father again caught him, and after a brief moment of thought,<br /> said, ""No butter for you for one month!""</p>
<p>Early that evening, Johnny's mother was cooking dinner, and got<br /> jumpy when cockroaches started scurrying around the kitchen<br /> floor. She began stomping on them one by one until all the<br /> cockroaches were dead. Johnny's mother looked up to find Johnny<br /> and his father standing there watching her, to which Johnny<br /> said, ""Are you going to tell her, daddy, or do you want me to?""</p>

<p>""Well that is probably a bit excessive,"" says the doctor. ""Yes, but that's not all. Twice a day I have sex with a prostitute, TWICE a day,"" says the man.</p>
<p>""Well, that's definitely too much,"" says the doctor. ""You've got to learn to take yourself in hand.""<br /> ""I do,"" says the man. ""Twice a day!""</p>

"
25263,"<p>1. Your stationery is more cluttered than Warren Beatty's address book. The letterhead lists a fax number, e-mail addresses for two on-line services, and your Internet address, which spreads across the breadth of the letterhead and continues to the back. In essence, you have conceded that the first page of any letter you write *is* letterhead.</p>
<p>2. You have never sat through an entire movie without having at least one device on your body beep or buzz.</p>
<p>3. You need to fill out a form that must be typewritten, but you can't because there isn't one typewriter in your house -- only computers with laser printers.</p>
<p>4. You think of the gadgets in your office as ""friends,"" but you forget to send your father a birthday card.</p>
<p>5. You disdain people who use low baud rates.</p>
<p>6. When you go into a computer store, you eavesdrop on a salesperson talking with customers -- and you butt in to correct him and spend the next twenty minutes answering the customers' questions, while the salesperson stands by silently, nodding his head.</p>
<p>7. You use the phrase ""digital compression"" in a conversation without thinking how strange your mouth feels when you say it.</p>
<p>8. You constantly find yourself in groups of people to whom you say the phrase ""digital compression."" Everyone understands what you mean, and you are not surprised or disappointed that you don't have to explain it.</p>
<p>9. You know Bill Gates' e-mail address, but you have to look up your own social security number.</p>
<p>10. You stop saying ""phone number"" and replace it with ""voice number,"" since we all know the majority of phone lines in any house are plugged into contraptions that talk to other contraptions.</p>
<p>11. You sign Christmas cards by putting :-) next to your signature. </p>
<p>12. Off the top of your head, you can think of nineteen keystroke symbols that are far more clever than :-)</p>
<p>13. You back up your data every day.</p>
<p>14. Your wife asks you to pick up some minipads for her at the store and you return with a rest for your mouse.</p>
<p>15. You think jokes about being unable to program a VCR are stupid.</p>
<p>16. On vacation, you are reading a computer manual and turning the pages faster than everyone else who is reading John Grisham novels.</p>
<p>17. The thought that a CD could refer to finance or music rarely enters your mind.</p>
<p>18. You are able to argue persuasively the Ross Perot's phrase ""electronic town hall"" makes more sense than the term ""information superhighway,"" but you don't because, after all, the man still uses hand-drawn pie charts.</p>
<p>19. You go to computer trade shows and map out your path of the exhibit hall in advance. But you cannot give someone directions to your house without looking up the street names.</p>
<p>20. You would rather get more dots per inch than miles per gallon.</p>
<p>21. You become upset when a person calls you on the phone to sell you something, but you think it's okay for a computer to call and demand that you start pushing buttons on your telephone to receive more information about the product it is selling.</p>
<p>22. You know without a doubt that disks come in five-and-a- quarter-and three-and-a-half-inch sizes.</p>
<p>23. Al Gore strikes you as an ""intriguing"" fellow.</p>
<p>24. You own a set of itty-bitty screw-drivers and you actually know where they are.</p>
<p>25. While contemporaries swap stories about their recent hernia surgeries, you compare mouse-induced index-finger strain with a nine year-old.</p>
<p>26. You are so knowledgeable about technology that you feel secure enough to say ""I don't know"" when someone asks you a technology question instead of feeling compelled to make something up.</p>
<p>27. You rotate your screen savers more frequently than your automobile tires.</p>
<p>28. You have a functioning home copier machine, but every toaster you own turns bread into charcoal.</p>
<p>29. You have ended friendships because of irreconcilably different opinions about which is better -- the track ball or the track *pad*.</p>
<p>30. You understand all the jokes in this message. If so, my friend, technology has taken over your life. We suggest, for your own good, that you go lie under a tree and write a haiku. And don't use a laptop.</p>

Every time I used her, her hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy.</p>
<p>I guess what finally finished her off was when I rented her to these four guys looking for a good time. I warned them that she wasn't very good, but they wanted to use her anyhow. The fools tried to get in her all at once and she split right up the middle. 'The old lady fainted.</p>

25316,"<p>The gender of computers </p>
<p>An inquisitive researcher, who enjoyed sailing, was aware that ships are addressed as 'she' and 'her'. He often wondered in what gender computers should be addressed.. To answer that question, he set up two groups of computer experts. The first was comprised of women, and the second of men. </p>
<p>Each group was asked to recommend whether computers should be referred to in the feminine gender, or the masculine gender. They were asked to give 4 reasons for their recommendation. </p>
<p>The group of women reported that the computers should be referred to in the masculine gender because: </p>
<p>1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br /> 2. They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.<br /> 3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they are the problem.<br /> 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer you could have had a better model. </p>
<p>The men, on the other hand, concluded that Computers should be referred to in the feminine gender because: </p>
<p>1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.<br /> 2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br /> 3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br /> 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.</p>

25322,"<p>This farmer has about 200 hens but no rooster, and he wants chicks. So he goes down the road to the next farmer and asks if he has a rooster. The other farmer says, ""Yeah, I've got this great rooster named Randy; he'll service every chicken you got, no problem."" </p>
<p>Well, Randy the rooster costs a lot of money, but the farmer decides he'd be worth it , and buys Randy. The farmer takes Randy home and sets him down in the barnyard, giving the rooster a pep talk, ""Randy, I want you to pace yourself now. You've got a lot of chickens to service here, and you cost me a lot of money, and I need you to do a good job. So, take your time and have some fun,"" the farmer said with a chuckle. </p>
<p>Randy seemed to understand so the farmer points toward the henhouse and Randy took off like a shot. Wham! He nails every hen in there three or four times, and the farmer is just shocked. Randy runs out of the henhouse and sees a flock of geese down by the lake, Wham! He gets all the geese. Randy's now up in the pigpen, then he does it with the cows. </p>

"
25356,"<p>1. Introduction: Why Do We Need Humans?</p>
<p>So you've decided to get yourself a human being. In doing so, you've joined the millions of other cats who have acquired these strange and often frustrating creatures. There will be any number of times, during the course of your association with humans, when you will wonder why you have bothered to grace them with your presence. What's so great about humans, anyway? Why not just hang around with other cats? Our greatest philosophers have struggled with this question for centuries, but the answer is actually rather simple:</p>
<p>THEY HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS.</p>
<p>Which makes them the perfect tools for such tasks as opening doors, getting the lids off of cat food cans, changing television stations and other activities that we, despite our other obvious advantages, find difficult to do ourselves.</p>
<p>True, chimps, orangutans and lemurs also have opposable thumbs, but they are nowhere as easy to train.</p>
<p>2. How And When to Get Your Human's Attention</p>
<p>Humans often erroneously assume that there are other, more important activities than taking care of your immediate needs, such as conducting business, spending time with their families or even sleeping.</p>
<p>Though this is dreadfully inconvenient, you can make this work to your advantage by pestering your human at the moment it is the busiest. It is usually so flustered that it will do whatever you want it to do, just to get you out of its hair. Not coincidentally, human teenagers follow this same practice.</p>
<p>Here are some tried and true methods of getting your human to do what you want: Sitting on paper: An oldie but a goodie. If a human has paper in front of it, chances are good it's something they assume is more important than you. They will often offer you a snack to lure you away. Establish your supremacy over this wood pulp product at every opportunity. This practice also works well with computer keyboards, remote controls, car keys and small children.</p>
<p>Waking your human at odd hours: A cat's ""golden time"" is between 3:30 and 4:30 in the morning. If you paw at your human's sleeping face during this time, you have a better than even chance that it will get up and, in an incoherent haze, do exactly what you want. You may actually have to scratch deep sleepers to get their attention; remember to vary the scratch site to keep the human from getting suspicious.</p>
<p>3. Punishing Your Human Being</p>
<p>Sometimes, despite your best training efforts, your human will stubbornly resist bending to your whim. In these extreme circumstances, you may have to punish your human. Obvious punishments, such as scratching furniture or eating household plants, are likely to backfire; the unsophisticated humans are likely to misinterpret the activities and then try to discipline YOU.</p>
<p>Instead, we offer these subtle but nonetheless effective alternatives: * Use the cat box during an important formal dinner. </p>
<p>* Stare impassively at your human while it is attempting a romantic interlude. </p>
<p>* Stand over an important piece of electronic equipment and feign a hairball attack. </p>
<p>* After your human has watched a particularly disturbing horror film, stand by the hall closet and then slowly back away, hissing and yowling. </p>
<p>* While your human is sleeping, lie on its face.</p>
<p>4. Rewarding Your Human: Should Your Gift Still Be Alive?</p>
<p>The cat world is divided over the etiquette of presenting humans with the thoughtful gift of a recently disemboweled animal. Some believe that humans prefer these gifts already dead, while others maintain that humans enjoy a slowly expiring cricket or rodent just as much as we do, given their jumpy and playful movements in picking the creatures up after they've been presented.</p>
<p>After much consideration of the human psyche, we recommend the following: cold blooded animals (large insects, frogs, lizards, garden snakes and the occasional earthworm) should be presented dead, while warm blooded animals (birds, rodents, your neighbor's Pomeranian) are better still living. When you see the expression on your human's face, you'll know it's worth it.</p>
<p>5. How Long Should You Keep Your Human?</p>
<p>You are only obligated to your human for one of your lives. The other eight are up to you. We recommend mixing and matching, though in the end, most humans (at least the ones that are worth living with) are pretty much the same. But what do you expect? They're humans, after all. Opposable thumbs will only take you so far.</p>

25361,"<p>Two hunters went moose hunting every winter without success.</p>
<p>Finally, they came up with a foolproof plan.</p>
<p>They got a very authentic female moose costume and learned the mating call of a female moose. </p>
<p>The plan was to hide in the costume, lure the bull, then come out of the costume and shoot the bull.</p>
<p>They set themselves up on the edge of a clearing, donned their costume and began to give the moose love call.</p>
<p>Before long, their call was answered as a bull came crashing out of the forest and into the clearing. </p>
<p>When the bull was close enough, the guy in front said, ""Okay, let's get out and get him.""</p>
<p>After a moment that seemed like an eternity, the guy in the back shouted, ""The zipper is stuck! What are we going to do?""</p>

<p>""Congratulations! Welcome to the church,"" said the priest. </p>
<p>The priest then went to the newlywed couple and asked, ""Well, were you able to<br /> abstain from sex for two weeks?"" </p>

James Heard had a 0.26 blood-alcohol level on his trial day in Milwaukee, and John Newbury registered 0.22 at his LaCrosse trial both more than double the 0.10 legal maximum. </p>
<p>1992 -- A jury in Tavares, Fla., convicted Leal Fleming, 45, of drunk driving in November despite his insistence that the reason he slurred his words to a police officer, and couldn't breathe into a machine,was that he had just been bitten on the tongue by a rat snake and was on his way to a hospital to get treatment for the swelling. Said Fleming after the trial, ""After the verdict came in,I had some second thoughts [about not taking an offered plea bargain], but I still think there was a point to our defense."" </p>
<p>1992 -- THE DIMINISHING VALUE OF LIFE In Miami in August, Levon Howard lost a shootout with his roommate Edwin Heyliger, who was charged with murder. Howard had broken into Heyliger's room,angry that someone had drunk his Kool-Aid, and in the ensuing argument, both scrambled for guns. </p>
<p>1991 -- In Romford, England, Philip Pyne, 51,off work last summer and intending to do some heavy drinking but worried that he might fall off his bar stool if he got too drunk, attempted to tack his legs onto the stool with nails but abandoned the idea in pain and called an ambulance.</p>
<p>1992 -- A pedestrian recently won a $600,000 judgment against Metro (the Washington, D.C., transportation authority) after being hit by a bus, despite the fact that he was drunk at the time and partying on a public street in a Batman costume. For the entire duration of the trial, the man's lawyer was able to suppress from the jurors' ears another fact about his client: At the time of the collision, for some reason, he was wearing a condom. </p>
<p>1991 -- St. Louis juror Frederick Pinkins was sentenced to three days in jail and a $700 fine for contempt of court in April after he missed final deliberations in a murder trial. He told the judge that the jury's discussion (in a lover's triangle case) depressed him so much that he got drunk and overslept. </p>
<p>1995 -- In May, over the opposition of state Sen. Joe Neal, the Nevada Senate passed a bill to prohibit people from carrying guns while drunk. Neal argued that the bill would hurt activities of gun clubs, some of which permit drinking during target-shooting socials. </p>
<p>1994 -- In February, William James Silva, 44,was arrested in San Jose, Calif., when he allegedly robbed a police decoy posing as a street corner drunk. It was the 550th time Silva had been arrested, and his record reaches 127 feet of computer paper. (According to police, before robbing the decoy, Silva had argued with a friend about whether the man was a police officer, with Silva insisting he wasn't.)</p>

25406,"<p>A duck hunter is out one day having no luck. He hunts the whole morning and couldn't get a single kill. On the way home he comes up to a farm house and flying over the barnyard is a big flock of fat mallards.<br /> Seeing his last chance for success, he takes aim at what looked like the biggest duck in the flock and gave it both barrels. The duck fell from the sky and landed in the middle of a barnyard. </p>
<p>As the hunter nears the barnyard and the dead duck, he sees he's got himself a beauty. But when he is a mere 20 paces from the duck, a farmer steps out of the barn, picks up the duck and heads for the house. </p>
<p>""Hey!"" said the hunter, ""Come back with my duck!"" </p>
<p>""Your duck?"" says the farmer, ""It was lying dead in my barnyard; it's MY duck."" </p>
<p>""No! No! You don't understand!, shouts the hunter, ""I shot it and it just happened to fall here. It's mine!"" </p>
<p>""Okay, city fella. We'll settle this the country way,"" says the farmer. </p>
<p>""Country way? What's that?"" says the hunter. </p>
<p>""We take turns hitting each other as hard as we can,"" says the farmer. ""Last man standing wins the duck.... That is, unless you're Yella."" </p>
<p>""Of course I'm not yellow,"" says the hunter. </p>
<p>""Fine. Country way it is,"" says the farmer. ""Since we're on my property, I'll go first."" </p>
<p>With that, the farmer takes a half step back, steadies himself, and kicks the hunter square in the groin as hard as he can. The hunter gasps, screams like an animal, falls on the ground, curls up in a knot, turns 3 shades of purple, and nearly pass out. </p>
<p>After a full half hour and with considerable difficulty, the hunter straightens up, gasps again, and in a high strained voice says, ""Now... my... turn! </p>
<p>The farmer reply: ""Nah, I give up. Here's your duck.""</p>

<p>Matthew David Hubal, 22, was pronounced dead at Centinela Mammoth Hospital. The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the Mono County Sheriff's Department said.</p>
<p>Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run called Stump Alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from the lift towers, said Lieutenant Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are used to protect skiers who might hit the towers.  The group apparently used the pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It has since been investigated that the tower he hit was the one with its pad removed.</p>

<p>[UPI, Portland, OR] Doctors at Portland's University Hospital said Wednesday an Oregon man shot through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive, and will be released soon from the hospital.</p>
<p>Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous, in Grants Pass, Ore. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow entered Roberts' right eye. Doctors said had the arrow gone 1 millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have cut and Roberts would have died instantly.</p>
<p>Neurosurgeon Dr. Johnny Delashaw at the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches of brain, with the tip protruding at the rear of his skill, yet somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said had Robert tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself.</p>
<p>Roberts admitted afterwards he and his friends had been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts, ""I feel so dumb about this.""</p>
<p>No charges have been filed but the Josephine County district attorney's office said the initiation stunt is under investigation.</p>

25435,"<p>At a seminar called ""Stress and Disease"" by Dr. Nickolas Hall, an expert in psychobiology, gave an example of a coping skill for job stress which I would like to share with you.When you have had one of those 'Take This Job And Shove It' days, try this:On your way home after work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the section where they have thermometers.  You will need to purchase a rectal thermometer made by ""Q-tip"".  Be sure that you get this brand.  When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes, and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during your therapy.Change to very comfortable clothing, such as a sweat suit and lie down on your bed.  Open the package containing the thermometer, remove the thermometer, and carefully place it on the bedside table so that it will not become chipped or broken.Take the written material that accompanies the thermometer and as you read it you will notice in small print the statement that says ""every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is PERSONALLY tested.Now close your eyes and say out loud five times, ""I am so glad that I do not work in quality control at the Q-tip company.""</p>

25444,"<p>What's new?  Most of my wife.</p>
"
25445,"<p>Some people have the misconception that cats never have to be<br /> bathed, that somehow they ""lick"" themselves clean. Contrary to<br /> this popular belief, cats do NOT have some enzyme in their<br /> saliva that resembles Tide (with or without bleach).</p>
<p>Cats, like their nemesis, the dog, do get dirty and have a<br /> variety of odors, from smelling like the outhouse where you<br /> camped last year to the same odor as your dog's breath.<br /> (Remember, your dog will try to eat anything.) Now we all know<br /> that cats HATE water. And we know that giving the cat a sedative<br /> to ease this process of a bath is out of the question.</p>
<p>So, the best approach is both sneaky and direct. Remember now,<br /> this is not the dumb dog who can be led to tub with lies and a<br /> trail of Kibbles and Bits.</p>
<p>Although your cat has the advantage of smarts, quickness and<br /> total lack of concern for you, you have the advantage of size,<br /> strength, and the ability to wear protective garments.</p>
<p>1. First, dress for the occasion. A 4-ply rubber wet suit is<br /> suggested, along with a helmet, face mask and welders gloves.</p>
<p>2. A Bathtub with a glass enclosure is preferred to the one with<br /> a shower curtain. A frenzied cat can shred one of these in about<br /> 3.5 seconds.</p>
<p>3. Have the Kitty Bubbles and towel in the enclosed bathtub area<br /> before hand. No, blow drying the cat after the bath is not<br /> suggested.</p>
<p>4. Draw the water, making it a little warmer than needed as you<br /> still need to find the cat. Position everything strategically in<br /> the shower, so you can reach it even if you are face down or<br /> prone in the tub.</p>
<p>5. Find your cat. Use the element of surprise. Pick the cat up,<br /> nonchalantly as if you were simply carrying him/her to the<br /> supper dish. No need to worry about the cat noticing your<br /> strange attire, the cat barely notices you anyway.</p>
<p>6. Once you and the cat are inside the bathroom, speed is<br /> essential. In one single liquid motion, shut the door to the<br /> bathroom, step into the shower, close the sliding doors, and<br /> drop the cat into the water. While the cat is still in a state<br /> of shock, locate the Kitty Bubbles and squirt whatever part of<br /> him is above the water line. You have just begun the wildest 45<br /> seconds of your life. Remember that cats have no handles and add<br /> the fact that he now has soapy fur. His state of shock has worn<br /> off and he's madder than a wet hornet.</p>
<p>7. As best, you can, wearing welder's gloves, try to field his<br /> body as he catapults through the air toward the ceiling. If<br /> possible, give another squirt of Kitty Bubbles with his body now<br /> fully exposed.</p>
<p>8. During the 5 seconds you are able to hold onto him, rub<br /> vigorously. No need to worry about rinsing. As he slide down the<br /> glass enclosure into the tub, he will fall back into the water,<br /> rinsing himself in the process.</p>
<p>9. Only attempt the lather and rinse process about 3 times. The<br /> cat will realize the lack of traction on the glass by then and<br /> will use the next attempt on the first available part of you.</p>
<p>10. Next, the cat must be dried. No, this is NOT the easiest<br /> part. By this stage, you are worn out and the cat has just<br /> become semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. We suggest<br /> here that you drain the tub and in full view of your cat, reach<br /> for the bottle of Kitty Bubbles.</p>
<p>11. If you have done step 10 correctly, the cat will be off your<br /> leg and hanging precariously from your helmet. Although this<br /> view of the cat is most disgusting, he will be in a much better<br /> position for wrapping the towel around him.</p>
<p>12. Be sure cat is firmly wrapped in towel before opening tub<br /> enclosure. Open bathroom door, put towel wrapped cat on floor<br /> and step back quickly. Into tub, if possible, and do not open<br /> enclosure until all you can see is the shredded towel.</p>
<p>13. In about 2 hours, it will be safe to exit the bathroom. Your<br /> cat will be sitting out there somewhere looking like a small<br /> hedgehog while plotting revenge.</p>

25447,"<p>It seems that historical religious leaders (between moments of dispensing wisdom) had also learned software programming.<br /> One day, a great contest was held to test their skills. </p>
<p>After days and days of fierce competition, only two leaders remained for the last day's event: Jesus and Mohammed. </p>
<p>The judge described the software application required for the final test, and gave the signal to start writing code. </p>
<p>The two contestants feverishly typed away on their keyboards. Routines, classes, applets and applications flew on their screens at incredible speeds. Windows, dialogs, and other intricate graphics began forming on their monitors. The clock showed that the contest would soon be finished. </p>
<p>Suddenly, a bolt of lightening flashed and the power went out. </p>
<p>After a moment it came back on - just in time for the clock to indicate that the last competition was over. </p>
<p>The judge asked the two contestants to reveal their finished software. Mohammed angrily said that he'd lost it all in the power outage. The judge turned to the other competitor. Jesus smiled, clicked a mouse and a dazzling application appeared on his screen. </p>
<p>After just a few moments, the judge was clearly impressed and declared Jesus the victor. </p>
<p>When asked why the decision was made, the judge pointed out the unique characteristic that set the winner apart from all the other leaders: </p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>
<p>You must be surprised that I'm writing to you today, the 26th of December. Well I would very much like to clear up certain things that have occurred since the beginning of the month, when, filled with illusion, I wrote you my letter.</p>
<p>I asked for a bicycle, an electric train set, a pair of roller blades, and a football uniform. I destroyed my brain studying the whole year. Not only was I the first in my class, but I had the best grades in the whole school.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie to you, there was no one in my entire neighborhood that behaved better than me, with my parents, my brothers, my friends, and with my neighbors. I would go on errands, and even help the elderly cross the street. There was virtually nothing within reach that I would not do for humanity.</p>
<p>What balls do you have leaving me a fucking yo-yo, a stupid whistle, and a pair of socks? What the fuck were you thinking you fat son of a bitch?!</p>
<p>That you have taken me for a sucker the whole fucking year to come out with some shit like this under the tree. As if you hadn't fucked me enough, you gave that little faggot across the street so many toys that he can't even walk into his house.</p>
<p>Don't let me see you trying to fit your big ass down my chimney next year. I'll fuck you up. I'll throw rocks at those stupid reindeer and scare them away so you'll have to walk back to the fucking North Pole, just like what I have to do now since you didn't get me that fucking bike.</p>
<p>FUCK YOU SANTA. Next year you'll find out how bad I can be, you FAT-SON-OF-A-BITCH!</p>

For this you can both have one wish each"" The wife wished to be a pro-golfer - the Genie said ""In the morning you will be better than Tiger Woods"" The husband wished for a Million dollars - the Genie said ""In the morning you will be a Million dollars richer."" The Genie then said ""But, in order for the wishes to come true, I will have to make love to your wife"". They decided (as being a pro-golfer and million dollars richer) it was a reasonable price to pay for the wish to come true.. The Genie took the wife to the room and started really screwing her with passion and speed. But suddenly, halfway through he stopped.""How old is your husband"", the genie asked the wife.""46"" the wife replied.""And he still believes in Genies.....??""</p>

25477,"<p>One day, the teacher walks into her classroom and announces to the class that on each Friday, she will ask a question to the class and anyone who answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday. </p>
<p>On the first Friday, the teacher asks, ""How many grains of sand are in the beach?"" Needless to say, no one could answer. </p>

25479,"<p>Many years ago, a tiny island nation in the South Pacific was home to some of the finest woodworkers who ever lived. Unfortunately, no one ever found about these legendary artisans since the only pieces they ever produced were thrones for the king of the island. It was a tradition that every year, on the first day of summer, the old throne would be burned in a massive bonfire and the woodworkers would present the king with their newest masterpiece, an ornate and beautiful throne they spent all year carving and shaping. The king would rule from the new royal seat and then destroy it at the next year's summer festival. One year, a new king ascended to the throne and spoke to his council of elders. ""It's a foolish thing to take these beautiful pieces of art and destroy them every year! Someone should save them for future generations to enjoy."" But one of his ministers quickly pointed out, ""Sire, this is a small island, and much of the land has been taken. We have no room to build a museum."" Thinking quickly, the king proposed a solution. ""I have the answer. We will build a second story onto the royal hut, and we shall store the thrones there."" The king's plan worked beautifully for a few years. Every year, he would summon the strongest men on the island to carry the thrones up into the second floor of the royal hut and add them to the collection. But on the fifth year, the floor finally could take no more, and the royal hut collapsed, killing the king and his whole family. The moral of the story? People who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.</p>

25498,"<p>A certain zoo had acquired a very rare species of gorilla. Within a few weeks, the female gorilla became very ornery, and difficult to handle. Upon examination, the zoo veterinarian determined the problem. The gorilla was in heat. To make matters worse, there were no male gorilla species available. While reflecting on their problem, the zoo administrators noticed Mike, an employee responsible for cleaning the animals' cages. Mike, it was rumored, possessed ample ability to satisfy any female, but he wasn't very bright. So, the zoo administrators thought they might have a solution. Mike was approached with a proposition: would he be willing to screw the gorilla for five hundred bucks? Mike showed some interest, but said he would have to think the matter over carefully. The following day, Mike announced that he would accept their offer, but only under three conditions. 'First,' he said, 'I don't want to have to kiss her. Secondly, I want nothing to do with any offspring that may result from this union.' The zoo administration quickly agreed to these conditions, so they asked what was his third condition. 'Well,' said Mike, 'you've gotta give me another week to come up with the five hundred bucks.'</p>

<p>Howe two rite gud<br /> Frank L. Visco<br /> Vice-president and Senior Copywriter at US Advertising.<br /> My several years in the word game have learnt me several rules:</p>
<p>Avoid alliteration. Always.<br /> Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.<br /> Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat.)<br /> Employ the vernacular.<br /> Eschew ampersands &amp; abbreviations, etc.<br /> Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.<br /> It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.<br /> Contractions aren't necessary.<br /> Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.<br /> One should never generalize.<br /> Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: ``I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.''<br /> Comparisons are as bad as cliches.<br /> Don't be redundant; don't more use words than necessary; it's highly superfluous.<br /> Profanity sucks dick.<br /> Be more or less specific.<br /> Understatement is always best.<br /> Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.<br /> One-word sentences? Never.<br /> Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.<br /> The passive voice is to be avoided.<br /> Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.<br /> Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.<br /> Who needs rhetorical questions?<br /> Be careful to use apostrophe's correctly.<br /> Do not use them pronouns as modifiers.<br /> And never start a sentence with a conjunction.</p>

25572,"<p>Bible scholars have long wondered how old Isaac was when his father<br /> Abraham took him up to the mountain top to offer him as a sacrifice.<br /> Through careful study of the story as related in the Old Testament,<br /> based on the following facts: </p>
<ol>
<li>Issac was old enough to understand the ritual of sacrifice, </li>
<li>Issac was old enough to carry wood for the fire to the top of the<br />        mountain, </li>
<li>Issac was old enough to notice that they were not bringing an animal<br />        for the sacrifice. </li>
</ol>
<p>   Therefore Issac's age, at this time, was greater than 8 years old.<br /> Scholars  also conclude that he was younger than 12 years old as<br /> supported by the following fact: </p>
<p>       If Issac had been older than twelve, he would have been a<br />        teenager and it would not have been a sacrifice.</p>

25573,"<p>One fine day in Ireland, a guy is out golfing and gets up to the 16th hole. He<br /> tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the<br /> fairway.<br /> He goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge<br /> knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. ""Goodness,"" says the<br /> golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy. </p>
<p>Upon awaking, the little guy says, ""Well, you caught me fair and square. I am<br /> a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes."" </p>
<p>The man says, ""I can''t take anything from you, I''m just glad I didn''t hurt<br /> you too badly,"" and walks away. </p>
<p>Watching the golfer depart, the leprechaun thinks, ""Well, he was a nice enough<br /> guy, and he did catch me, so I have to do something for him. I''ll give him the<br /> three things that I would want. I''ll give him unlimited money, a great golf<br /> game, and a great love life."" </p>
<p>Well, a year goes past and the same golfer is out golfing on the same course<br /> at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits one into the same woods and goes off<br /> looking for his ball. When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and<br /> asks how he is doing. </p>
<p>The leprechaun says, ""I''m fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?"" </p>
<p>The golfer says, ""It''s great! I hit under par every time."" </p>
<p>The leprechaun says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is<br /> holding out?"" </p>
<p>The golfer says, ""Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in<br /> my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note."" </p>
<p>The leprechaun smiles and says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your<br /> love life is?"" The leprechaun says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how<br /> your money is holding out?"" </p>
<p>The golfer says, ""Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in<br /> my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note."" </p>

<p>The leprechaun is floored and stammers, ""Only once or twice a week?!"" </p>

25600,"<p>A church had to hire a new pastor. Over the protests of one vocal male member,<br /> a woman was hired as the new senior pastor.<br /> After the new pastor had been there a few weeks, a member of the congregation<br /> offered to take the new pastor fishing. The vocal objector reluctantly agreed to<br /> allow them to use his boat and to go along.<br /> The trio got into the boat and motored out on the lake. When they got ready to<br /> fish, they realized that all their tackle had been left on the dock. One of the<br /> men commented that he guessed they would just have to go back and get it.<br /> The lady pastor said, ""That won't be necessary,"" as she got out of the boat<br /> and started walking across the water toward the dock.<br /> The old grouch said, ""See I told you we never should have hired that woman!<br /> She can't even swim!!""</p>

25602,"<p>=============================================================This item is being widely propagated over the net today. Preliminary reports indicate that it is NOT a joke, however A LOT of further research is indicated. =============================================================Had the most interesting conversation with the top sales weasel at our company today.  She came into my office and noticed I had a box of Altoids on my desk. (Have you had them?  They are these obnoxiously strong peppermints made in England.)As soon as she saw them, she burst into laughter.Turns out she had recently had an affair with a guy who called her and left her an incredibly steamy voice mail message after an encounter.  He went on and on about what a blow job goddess she was, how amazing she was, how he'd never be the same, etc.  She was kind of puzzled, thinking: what did I do to this guy that was so different from my regular technique?  She finally figured it out: she's a smoker, and before getting intimate with him, she had gone to the bathroom to 'freshen up.' Not having a toothbrush, she crunched on about four Altoids and then got busy.  Apparently things went amazingly. So she passed this little tidbit on to another female sales weasel, who immediately tried it out on -her- fiance. Apparently this guy has never, ever been into oral sex, but liked the mint sensation so much that he asked her to stop and chew another Altoid mid-blow job.  He is now a fellatio gourmand. This news has been going around our office.  Having a box of Altoids on your desk is now like being part of the Secret Blowjob Goddess Society.  It's the equivalent of having the hottest car or coolest computer. News spread like crazy among the females, in the office who all went out at lunch to Walgreens to buy a box of Altoids (about $2 for 100 or so), and their partners across the city tonight are getting one hell of a corporate blow job.As far as company-wide morale boosting events, it doesn't get much better.  Some of the men found out, too -- they went out after work to buy them for their wives.  They strategized on how to get their wives to eat them. And people wonder why I work in technology. (For what it's worth -- it really does work!  It leaves a lasting tingle that is apparently quite exquisite.)</p>

After a moment of thought the woman replies;""I would go to Mars."" ""And why would you like to go there?"" ""I find it very interesting and would like to see if  there really is life there.""  The Nasa men are most impressed with this and promise to call her back and let her know their results. The next woman is a redhead with a very nice suit on. They ask her the same question to which she replies; ""I would like to go to Saturn, so that I could see for myself what the rings look like."" The Nasa guys are happy with this answer and promise to call her back. The next is a blonde woman wearing a very short skirt and VERY revealing top. They ask her the same question and she gives it a lot of thought and replies; ""I would like to go to the sun."" ""But don't you know you would burn to death if you went to the sun?"" ""Oh don't be silly, I'd go at night.""</p>

25682,"<p>Rules For Work: (Should go over well with your boss.)<br /> Print it out and hang it over your work station...I dare ya!</p>
<p>1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 4:00 and then bring it to me. The challenge of a deadline is refreshing.</p>
<p>2. If it's really a rush job, run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to inquire how it's going. That helps. Even better, hover behind me, and advise me at every keystroke.</p>
<p>3. Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where you are.</p>
<p>4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books, or supplies, don't open the door for me. I need to learn how to function as a paraplegic and opening doors with no arms is good training in case I should ever be injured and lose all use of my limbs.</p>
<p>5. If you give me more than one job to do, don't tell me which is priority. I am psychic.</p>
<p>6. Do your best to keep me late. I adore this office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do. I have no life beyond work.</p>
<p>7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. If that gets out, it could mean a promotion.</p>
<p>8. If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in conversations. I was born to be whipped.</p>
<p>9. If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done. No use confusing me with useful information.</p>
<p>10. Never introduce me to the people you're with. I have no right to know anything. In the corporate food chain, I am plankton. When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them.</p>
<p>11. Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could really change your life and send you straight to manager's hell.</p>
<p>12. Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and it's nice to know someone is less fortunate. I especially like the story about having to pay so many taxes on the bonus check you received for being such a good manager.</p>
<p>13. Wait until my yearly review and THEN tell me what my goals SHOULD have been. Give me a mediocre performance rating with a cost of living increase. I'm not here for the money anyway.</p>

"
25714,"<p>There has been an alarming increase in the number of things you know nothing about.</p>
"
25715,"<p>1. Make brown-bag lunches for your roommate every morning. Give<br /> them to him/her before he/she goes to class.</p>
<p>2. Every time you enter the room, sit in a chair, lean back too<br /> far, and fall over backwards. Laugh hysterically for about ten<br /> minutes. Then, one day, repeat the falling-over exercise, but<br /> instead of laughing, get up, look at the chair sternly, and say,<br /> ""It's not funny anymore.""</p>
<p>3. Read with a flashlight when the lights are on. Pretend to<br /> read without one when the lights are out, remarking every so<br /> often how great the book is.</p>
<p>4. Get a surfboard. Put it on your bed. Stand on it, and pretend<br /> to surf for about fifteen minutes. Then, pretend to ""wipe out,""<br /> and fall off the bed onto the floor. Pretend you are drowning<br /> until your roommate comes over to ""rescue"" you.</p>
<p>5. Keep a hamster as a pet. Buy a blender, and make milkshakes<br /> every day. Then, one day, get rid of the hamster. Make a shake<br /> using a lot of ketchup. When your roommate comes in, look at the<br /> shake, look at the empty cage, and tell your roommate, ""I was<br /> curious.""</p>
<p>6. Make toast for breakfast every morning, but don't plug the<br /> toaster in. Eat the plain bread, looking at the toaster angrily,<br /> and complain that the toaster doesn't know what it's doing. If<br /> your roommate suggests plugging it in, go on a tangent about<br /> fire-safety hazards.</p>
<p>7. Pack up all of your things and tell your roommate that you're<br /> going away to ""find yourself."" Leave, and come back in about ten<br /> minutes. If your roommate asks, explain that you're not a hard<br /> man to find.</p>
<p>8. Never speak to your roommate directly. If you need to ask or<br /> tell him/her something, go to another room and call him/her on<br /> the phone.</p>
<p>9. Every night, before you go to bed, beg your roommate for a<br /> glass of water. When he/she brings it, dump it on the floor and<br /> immediately go to sleep. If he/she ever refuses to bring you a<br /> glass of water, lie on the bed and pretend to be dying of<br /> dehydration, making annoying gagging sounds, until he/she does<br /> so.</p>
<p>10. Every time the phone rings, turn on the stereo at full<br /> volume and begin to violently slam-dance with your roommate. If<br /> he/she asks about it, say, ""Oh, that damn hypnotist....""</p>
<p>11. Hang a picture of your roommate on the wall. Throw darts at<br /> it. Smile at your roommate often, saying things like, ""How nice<br /> to see you again.""</p>
<p>12. Get a can of beans. Label them, ""Jumping beans."" Eat them,<br /> and then jump around the room. Get another can of beans. Label<br /> them, ""Dancing beans."" Eat them, and then dance around the room.<br /> Get another can of beans. Label them, ""Kill Your Roommate<br /> beans."" Eat them, smiling at your roommate.</p>
<p>13. Every time your roommate falls asleep, wait ten minutes, and<br /> then wake him/her up and say, ""It's time to go to bed now.""</p>
<p>14. Insist that your roommate recite the ""Pledge Of Allegiance""<br /> with you every morning.</p>
<p>15. Recite ""Dr. Seuss"" books, all the time. Eventually, think up<br /> melodies for the words and sing them, loudly, directly to your<br /> roommate. If he/she tells you to stop, act offended and spend<br /> the day in bed.</p>
<p>16. Put up traffic signs around the room. If your roommate<br /> doesn't obey them, give him/her tickets. Confiscate something<br /> your roommate owns until he/she pays the tickets.</p>
<p>17. Walk, talk, and dress like a cowboy at all times. If your<br /> roommate inquires, tell him/her, ""Don't worry little buckaroo.<br /> You'll be safe with me.""</p>
<p>18. Complain that your elbows, knees, and other joints have been<br /> bothering you. Get a screwdriver, and pretend to ""fix"" them.</p>
<p>19. Paint abstract paintings, and title them things like,<br /> ""Roommate Dying in a Car Crash,"" and ""Roommate Getting Whacked<br /> in the Head with a Shovel."" Comment often about how much you<br /> love the paintings.</p>
<p>20. Wear glasses, and complain that you can never see anything.<br /> Bump into walls and doors. Put your clothes on backwards. Say,<br /> ""Who's that?"" every time your roommate enters the room. When<br /> you're not wearing the glasses, act like you can see fine.</p>
<p>21. Buy a lava lamp. Stare at it for hours, imitating its<br /> movements with your face. Explain to your roommate that you have<br /> established a connection with the spirit world through the lava<br /> lamp. Tell your roommate that ""Grandma said hi.""</p>
<p>22. Keep empty jars on the shelf. Tell your roommate that this<br /> is your collection of ""inert gases."" Look at them often. One<br /> day, act surprised and angered, and accuse your roommate of<br /> having released one of the gases. Cover your nose and mouth and<br /> run out of the room.</p>
<p>23. Wear scary Halloween masks. Look in the mirror and scream<br /> hysterically for about five minutes every time you put one on.</p>
<p>24. Roller-skate up and down the hallway. Every time you see<br /> your roommate, crash into him/her and knock him/her down.<br /> Apologize, and say that he/she looked like ""the enemy.""</p>
<p>25. Put headphones on your roommate while he/she is sleeping,<br /> and subliminally teach him/her to speak Spanish, play the<br /> trombone, and memorize all the major imports and exports of each<br /> African nation.</p>

25718,"<p>The following are actual stories told by travel agents (and you wonder why US citizens generally score less than the rest of the world on geography)...- I had someone who wanted to stay at the Bob Newhart   Inn in Connecticut. When I explained that the inn was   fictional, the customer became very irate and   insisted 'I know it is real, I see people check in   every week!'- Also, I really did have someone ask for an aisle seat   so that their hair wouldn't get messed up by being   near the window.- A client called in inquiring about a package to   Hawaii. After going over all the cost info, she   asked, 'would it be cheaper to fly to California and   then take the train to Hawaii?'- I got a call from a woman who wanted to go to   Capetown. I started to explain the length of the   flight and the passport information when she   interrupted me with 'I'm not trying to make you look   stupid, but Capetown is in Massachusetts.' Without   trying to make her look like the stupid one, I calmly   explained, 'Capecod is in Massachusetts, Capetown is   in Africa.' her response....click.- A secretary called in looking for hotel in Los   Angeles. She gave me various names off a list, none   of which I could find. I finally had her fax me the   list. To my surprise, it was a list of hotels in New   Orleans, Louisiana. She thought the LA stood for Los   Angeles, and that New Orleans was a suburb of L.A.   Worst of all, when I called her back, she was not   even embarrassed.- A man called, furious about a Florida package we did.   I asked what was wrong with the vacation in Orlando.   He said he was expecting an ocean-view room. I tried   to explain that is not possible, since Orlando is in   the middle of the state. He replied, 'Don't lie to   me. I looked on the map and Florida is a very thin   state.'- I got a call from a man who asked, 'is it possible to   see England from Canada?' I said, 'No.' He said 'but   they look so close on the map.'- Another man called and asked if he could rent a car   in Dallas. When I pulled up the reservation, I   noticed he had a 1-hour lay- over in Dallas. When I   asked him why he wanted to rent a car, he said, 'I   heard Dallas was a big airport, and I need a car to   drive between the gates to save time.'- A nice lady just called. She needed to know how it   was possible that her flight from Detroit left at 8:   20am and got into Chicago at 8:33am.I tried to   explain that Michigan was an hour ahead of Illinois,   but she could not understand the concept of time   zones. Finally I told her the plane went very fast,   and she bought that!- A woman called and asked, 'Do airlines put your   physical description on your bag so they know who's   luggage belongs to who?' I said, 'No, why do you   ask?' She replied, 'Well, when I checked in with the   airline, they put a tag on my luggage that said FAT,   and I'm overweight, is there any connection?' After   putting her on hold for a minute while I 'looked into   it' ( I was actually laughing) I came back and   explained the city code for Fresno is FAT, and that   the airline was just putting a destination tag on her   luggage.- I just got off the phone with a man who asked, 'How   do I know which plane to get on?' I asked him what   exactly he meant, which he replied, 'I was told my   flight number is 823, but none of these darn planes   have numbers on them.'- A woman called and said, ' I need to fly to   Pepsi-cola on one of those computer planes.' I asked   if she meant to fly to Pensacola on a commuter plane.   She said, 'Yea, whatever.'- A business man called and had a question about the   documents he needed in order to fly to China. After a   lengthy discussion about passports, I reminded him he   needed a visa. 'Oh no I don't, I've been to China   many times and never had to have one of those.' I   double checked, and sure enough, his stay required a   visa. When I told him this he said, 'Look, I've been   to China 4 times and every time they have accepted my   American Express.'- A woman called to make reservations, 'I want to go   from Chicago to Hippopotamus, New York' The agent was   at a loss for words. Finally, the agent: 'Are you   sure that's the name of the town?' 'Yes, what flights   do you have?' replied the customer. After some   searching, the agent came back with, 'I'm sorry,   ma'am, I've looked up every airport code in the   country and can't find a Hippopotamus anywhere.' The   customer retorted, 'Oh don't be silly. Everyone knows   where it is. Check your map!' The agent scoured a map   of the state of New York and finally offered, 'You   don't mean Buffalo, do you?' 'That's it! I knew it   was a big animal!'</p>

25738,"<p>""Actual question given for a mid-term chemistry exam at the University of Washington:""</p>
<p>Is Hell exothermic (radiates heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?  Support your answer with a proof.</p>
<p>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas<br /> cools when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant.</p>
<p>One student, however, wrote the following:</p>
<p>First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.</p>
<p>As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different<br /> religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell.</p>
<p>With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.</p>
<p>Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in<br /> Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.</p>
<p>This gives two possibilities:</p>
<p>(1) If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until<br /> all Hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>(2) Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of<br /> souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell<br /> freezes over.</p>
<p>So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you', and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and so Hell is exothermic.</p>
<p>""That student got the only A in his term...""</p>
"
25739,"<p><em>From a newspaper contest where entrants were asked to imitate Saturday Night Live's ""Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey""</em> </p>
<p>HONORABLE MENTIONS: </p>
<p>My young son asked me what happens after we die. I told him we get buried under a bunch of dirt and worms eat our bodies. I guess I should have told him the truth--that most of us go to Hell and burn eternally--but I didn't want to upset him. </p>
<p>It sure would be nice if we got a day off for the president's birthday, like they do for the queen. Of course, then we would have a lot of people voting for a candidate born on July 3 or December 26, just for the long weekends. </p>
<p>Democracy is a beautiful thing, except for that part about letting just any old yokel vote. </p>
<p>Home is where the house is. </p>
<p>Often, when I am reading a good book, I stop and thank my teacher. That is, I used to, until she got an unlisted number. </p>
<p>As you make your way through this hectic world of ours, set aside a few minutes each day. At the end of the year, you'll have a couple of days saved up. </p>
<p>It would be terrible if the Red Cross Bloodmobile got into an accident. No, wait. That would be good because if anyone needed it, the blood would be right there. </p>
<p>Give me the strength to change the things I can, the grace to accept the things I cannot, and a great big bag of money. </p>
<p>The people who think Tiny Tim is strange are the same ones who think it odd that I drive without pants.</p>
<p>For centuries, people thought the moon was made of green cheese. Then the astronauts found that the moon is really a big hard rock. That's what happens to cheese when you leave it out. </p>
<p>Think of the biggest number you can. Now add five. Then, imagine if you had that many Twinkies. Wow, that's five more than the biggest number you could come up with! </p>
<p>I bet living in a nudist colony takes all the fun out of Halloween. </p>
<p>The only stupid question is the one that is never asked, except maybe ""Don't you think it is about time you audited my return?"" or ""Isn't is morally wrong to give me a warning when, in fact, I was speeding?""</p>
<p>Once, I wept for I had no shoes. Then I came upon a man who had no feet. So I took his shoes. I mean, it's not like he really needed them, right? </p>
<p>When I go to heaven, I want to see my grandpa again. But he better have lost the nose hair and the old-man smell. </p>
<p>I believe you should live each day as if it is your last, which is why I don't have any clean laundry because, come on, who wants to wash clothes on the last day of their life? </p>
<p>I often wonder how come John Tesh isn't as popular a singer as some people think he should be. Then, I remember it's because he sucks. </p>
<p>Whenever I start getting sad about where I am in my life, I think about the last words of my favorite uncle: ""A truck!"" </p>
<p>If you really want to impress people with your computer literacy, add the words ""dot com"" to the end of everything you say, dot com. </p>
<p>I like to go down to the dog pound and pretend that I've found my dog. Then I tell them to kill it anyway because I already gave away all of his stuff. Dog people sure don't have a sense of humor. </p>
<p>THIRD RUNNER UP </p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I enjoy watching paint dry. I imagine that the wet paint is a big freshwater lake that is the only source of water for some tiny cities by the lake. As the lake gets drier, the population gets more desperate, and sometimes there are water riots. Once there was a big fire and everyone died. </p>
<p>SECOND RUNNER UP </p>
<p>I once heard the voice of God. It said ""Vrrrrmmmmm."" Unless it was just a lawn mower. </p>
<p>FIRST RUNNER UP </p>
<p>I gaze at the brilliant full moon. The same one, I think to myself, at which Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato gazed. Suddenly, I imagine they appear beside me. I tell Socrates about the national debate over one's right to die and wonder at the constancy of the human condition. I tell Plato that I live in the country that has come the closest to Utopia, and I show him a copy of the Constitution. I tell Aristotle that we have found many more than four basic elements and I show him a periodic table. I get a box of kitchen matches and strike one. They gasp with wonder. We spend the rest of the night lighting farts. </p>

She rubs the lamp, and out pops a magical genie!! The genie notices her anger and lets her vent her troubles to him. As a consolation, the genie informs her that he will give her three wishes. But, he cautions her that because he does not believe in divorce, he will give her ex-husband ten times the amount of whatever she wishes. </p>
<p>The woman is steaming mad, thinking that this is hardly fair, but she makes her first wish. The first wish was for a billion dollars. The genie grants her wish and she finds herself sitting in pile of one billion one-dollar bills. The genie then reminds her that her husband is now the recipient of 10 billion dollars.</p>
<p>The woman can barely contain her anger when she makes her second wish. The second wish was for a beautiful mansion on the shore of her own private beach. In an instant it was granted, but the genie then reminds again that her ex-husband now owns ten of what she wished for, and points out at the beach to a small development of ten such mansions. </p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the woman takes her time to contemplate her last wish. Just as the genie was about to give up on her, the woman informs the genie that she wants to make the last wish. But, before she can do this, the genie again warns her that her ex-husband will get ten times what she wishes for. </p>

25797,"<p>There were three Eskimos in Alaska, and one time while they were at their local bar, they got to talking about how cold it was outside, and how cold their igloos were. They could agree on everything but whose igloo was the coldest, so they decided to determine who, indeed, had the coldest igloo.They went to the first Eskimo's igloo, where he said ""Watch this!"" and poured a cup of water into the air. Well, the water froze in mid-air and fell onto the floor solid. ""Not bad"" said the other Eskimos, but each maintained their igloo was colder still.So they went to the second Eskimo's igloo, and he said ""Watch this!"" and took a big breath and exhaled, whereupon his breath froze into a big lump and fell to the floor.""Wow, that's colder than mine!""said the first Eskimo.But the third Eskimo exclaimed his was colder still. So they ended up at the third Eskimo's igloo. He said ""Watch this!"" and went into the bedroom, threw back the thick furs, and retrieved one of several small balls of ice there. He took it, put it in a spoon, and held a match under it. When it heated up enough, it went ""FFFAAAARRRRTTT"".</p>

<p>Got a call from a woman said that her laser printer was having problems: the bottom half of her printed sheets were coming out blurry. It seemed strange that the printer was smearing only the bottom half. I walked her through the basics, then came over and printed out a test sheet. It printed fine. I asked her to print a sheet, so she sent a job to the printer. </p>
<p>As the paper started coming out, she yanked it out and showed it to me. I told her to WAIT until the paper came out on its own. Problem solved. </p>

<p>I had been doing Tech Support for Hewlett-Packard's DeskJet division for about a month when I had a customer call with a problem I just couldn't solve. She could not print yellow. All the other colors would print fine, which truly baffled me because the only true colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. For instance, green is a combination of cyan and yellow, but green printed fine. Every color of the rainbow printed fine except for yellow. </p>
<p>I had the customer change ink cartridges. I had the customer delete and reinstall the drivers. Nothing worked. I asked my co-workers for help; they offered no new ideas. After over two hours of troubleshooting, I was about to tell the customer to send the printer in to us for repair when she asked quietly, ""Should I try printing on a piece of white paper instead of this yellow construction paper?""</p>

But after all, it's the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, a parliament or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.<br /> -- Hermann Goering, Nazi Reichsmarshal and Luftwaffe chief, at the Nuremberg trials</p>

<p>She lies down on the bed... just then, and elevated train passes by very close to the window and shakes the room so hard she's thrown out of the bed. </p>

25836,"<p>Three nuns died and went to Heaven.  St. Peter told them that they had been<br /> saintly and holy nuns but would each have to answer a question in order to<br /> enter Heaven.</p>
<p>He asked the first nun, Sister Angelica, ""Who was the first man on earth?""</p>
<p>""Oh"", she replied.  ""That was Adam.""</p>
<p>Trumpets blared, angels sang, St. Peter gave her a white robe and welcomed<br /> Sister Angelica to Heaven.</p>
<p>He asked the second nun, Sister Carmela, ""Who was the first woman on earth?""</p>
<p>""Oh"", she replied.  ""That would be Eve.""</p>
<p>Trumpets blared, angels sang, St. Peter gave her a white robe and welcomed<br /> Sister Carmela to Heaven.</p>
<p>The third nun, Sister Maria, was getting a bit nervous because the first<br /> questions had been so easy.  St. Peter turned to her and asked ""What was the<br /> first thing Eve said to Adam?""</p>
<p>""Oh"", she replied.  ""That's very hard.""</p>
<p>Trumpets blared, angels sang, St. Peter gave her a white robe and welcomed<br /> Sister Maria to Heaven.</p>

25838,"<p>A tourist wanders into a back-alley antique shop in  San Francisco's Chinatown. Picking through the objects on display he discovers a  detailed bronze sculpture of a rat.</p>
<p>The sculpture is so interesting and unique that he picks it up and asks the shop owner the price. ""Twelve dollars for the rat, sir,"" says the shop owner, ""and an extra&nbsp;thousand dollars more for the story behind it.""</p>
<p>""You can keep the story, old man,"" he replies, ""but, I'll take the rat.""</p>
<p>The transaction complete, the tourist leaves the store with the bronze rat under his arm. As he crosses the street in front of the store, two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall into step behind him.</p>
<p>Nervously looking over his shoulder, he begins to walk faster, but every time he passes another sewer drain, more rats come out and follow him. By the time he's walked two blocks, at least a hundred rats are at his heels, and people begin to point and shout. He walks even faster, and soon breaks into a trot as multitudes of rats swarm from sewers, basements, vacant lots, and abandoned cars....following him.</p>
<p>Rats by the thousands are at his heels, and as he sees the waterfront at the bottom of the hill, he panics and starts to run full tilt.</p>
<p>No matter how fast he runs, the&nbsp; rats keep up, squealing hideously now not just thousands but&nbsp;millions, so that by the time he comes racing to the water's edge a trail of&nbsp;rats twelve city blocks long is behind him.</p>
<p>Making a mighty leap, he&nbsp;jumps up onto a light post, grasping it with with one arm,&nbsp;while he hurls the&nbsp; bronze rat into San Francisco Bay  with the other, as far as he can throw&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Pulling his legs up and clinging to the light post, he watches in amazement as the seething tide of rats surges over the breakwater  into the sea, where they drown.</p>
<p>Shaken and mumbling, he makes his way back to the antique shop.</p>
<p>""Ah sir, you've come back for the rest of the story,""&nbsp; says&nbsp; the owner.</p>
<p>""No,"" says the tourist, ""I was just hoping you had a bronze sculpture of a lawyer!""</p>

25839,"<p>The day finally arrived: Forest Gump dies and goes to Heaven. He<br /> is met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself. The gates are<br /> closed, however, and Forest approaches the gatekeeper.</p>
<p>Saint Peter says, ""Well, Forest, it's certainly good to see you.<br /> We have heard a lot about you. I must inform you that the place<br /> is filling up fast, and we've been administering an entrance<br /> examination for everyone. The tests are fairly short, but you<br /> need to pass before you can get into Heaven.""</p>
<p>Forest responds, ""It shore is good to be here St. Peter. I was<br /> looking forward to this. Nobody ever told me about any entrance<br /> exams. Sure hope the test ain't too hard; life was a big enough<br /> test as it was.""</p>
<p>St. Peter goes on, ""Yes, I know Forest. But the test I have for<br /> you is only three questions. Here is the first: What days of the<br /> week begin with the letter 'T'? Second, how many seconds are<br /> there in a year? Third, what is God's first name?""</p>
<p>Forest goes away to think the questions over. He returns the<br /> next day and goes up to St. Peter to try to answer the exam<br /> questions. St. Peter waves him up and asks, ""Now that you have<br /> had a chance to think the questions over, tell me your answers.""</p>
<p>Forest says, ""Well, the first one, how many days of the week<br /> begin with the letter 'T'? Shucks, that one's easy; that'd be<br /> Today and Tomorrow!""</p>
<p>The saint's eyes open wide and he exclaims, ""Forest! That's not<br /> what I was thinking, but...you do have a point though, and I<br /> guess I didn't specify, so I give you credit for that answer.""</p>
<p>""How about the next one"" says St. Peter, ""how many seconds in a<br /> year?""</p>
<p>""Now that one's harder,"" says Forest. ""But, I thunk and thunk<br /> about that, and I guess the only answer can be twelve.""</p>
<p>Astounded, St. Peter says, ""Twelve! Twelve! Forest, how in<br /> Heaven's name could you come up with twelve seconds in a year?""</p>
<p>Forest says, ""Shucks, there gotta be twelve: January second,<br /> February second, March second ....""</p>
<p>""Hold it,"" interrupts St. Peter. ""I see where you're going with<br /> it. And I guess I see your point, though that wasn't quite what<br /> I had in mind, but I'll give you credit for that one too.""</p>
<p>""Let's go on with the next and final question,"" says St. Peter,<br /> ""Can you tell me God's first name?""</p>
<p>Forest says, ""Well shore, I know God's first name. Everbody<br /> probably knows it. It's Howard.""</p>
<p>""Howard?"" asks St. Peter. ""What makes you think it's 'Howard'?""</p>
<p>Forest answers, ""It's in the prayer.""</p>
<p>""The prayer?"" asks St. Peter, ""Which prayer?""</p>
<p>""The Lord's Prayer,"" responds Forest: ""Our Father, who art in<br /> heaven, Howard be thy name ....""</p>

25854,"<p>Item in Berwickshire Gazette - November 11th 1998A report has revealed that two traffic patrol officers from North Berwick were involved in an unusual incident whilst checking for speeding motorists on the A1 road between Oldhamstocks and Grantshouse.Last May, they were using a hand-held radar device to trap unwary motorists on the Edinburgh to London trunk road. One of the unnamed officers used the device to check the speed of an approaching vehicle, and was surprised to find that his target had registered a speed in excess of 300 miles per hour.The #5000 machine then seized up and could not be reset by the bemused PC's. The radar had in fact latched on to a NATO Tornado aircraft in the North Sea, which was taking part in a simulated low-flying exercise over the Borders and Southern Scotland.Following a complaint by Sir William Sutherland, Chief Constable of the Lothian &amp; Borders Police force to the RAF liaison office, it was revealed that the officers had a lucky escape - the tactical computer on board the aircraft not only detected and jammed the ""hostile"" radar equipment, but had automatically armed a Maverick air-to-ground missile ready to neutralise the perceived threat. Luckily the Dutch pilot was alerted to the missile status and was able to override the automatic protection system before the missile launched.</p>

25855,"<p>A young boy was in grade four and was having a terrible time with his math.<br /> His parents worked with him night after night but there was no improvement. </p>
<p>His math marks were dismal. His parents in desperation decided to transfer their son to a new school. They decided to try the Catholic school system but not until after they had given the matter serious consideration as both parents were not religious. </p>
<p>They checked around and the school seemed to have a good academic record. They reluctantly enrolled their son in the Catholic school. Immediately the boy's math marks soared. He went from a failing grade to become an A student. </p>
<p>His parents were surprised at the change and over dinner one night they asked their son about his improvement. ""Was it better teaching"" they asked and the boy said ""No the teachers are about the same"". ""Was it a different text book?"" Again the boy said ""No it is the same text book"" </p>
<p>Finally they asked their son why he thought he had made such a dramatic improvement. </p>
<p>The boy said ""the first day I went to school I knew they took their math seriously and that I had better do well or there would be serious consequences."" </p>
<p>Their parents asked what made him realize the school took math so seriously. </p>
<p>The boy answered ""the first thing I saw when I went into the classroom was a statue of some guy nailed to a plus sign.""</p>

25865,"<p>TWELVE THINGS YOU'LL NEVER HEAR AN EMPLOYEE TELL HIS/HER BOSS </p>
<p>1. Never give me work in the morning. Always wait until 5:00 and then bring it<br /> to me. The challenge of a deadline is always refreshing. </p>
<p>2. If it's really a ""rush job,"" run in and interrupt me every 10 minutes to<br /> inquire how it's going. That greatly aids my efficiency. </p>
<p>3. Always leave without telling anyone where you're going. It gives me a<br /> chance to be creative when someone asks where you are. </p>
<p>4. If my arms are full of papers, boxes, books or supplies, don't open the<br /> door for me. I might need to learn how to function as a paraplegic in future and<br /> opening doors is good training. </p>
<p>5. If you give me more than one job to do, don't tell me which is the<br /> priority. Let me guess. </p>
<p>6. Do your best to keep me late. I like the office and really have nowhere to<br /> go or anything to do. </p>
<p>7. If a job I do pleases you, keep it a secret. Leaks like that could get me a<br /> promotion. </p>
<p>8. If you don't like my work, tell everyone. I like my name to be popular in<br /> conversations. </p>
<p>9. If you have special instructions for a job, don't write them down. If fact,<br /> save them until the job is almost done. </p>
<p>10. Never introduce me to the people you're with. When you refer to them<br /> later, my shrewd deductions will identify them. </p>
<p>11. Be nice to me only when the job I'm doing for you could really change your<br /> life. </p>
<p>12. Tell me all your little problems. No one else has any and it's nice to<br /> know someone is less fortunate.</p>

"
25875,"<p>The following comments are those of Bill Hall who is a syndicated humor columnist for the Lewiston Morning Tribune in Lewiston, Idaho.</p>
<p>Consider bathing, for instance. As a general rule, middle-aged women take baths at night. The men shower each morning. The men like to go to bed dirty and go to work clean. Women prefer to go to bed clean and to work dirty. That's why men usually take their coffee breaks with other men.</p>
<p>Women read more boring magazines than men. They read silly, pedestrian magazines filled with articles on making quilts, turning bleach bottles into stunning centerpieces, the use of orange eyeshadow and how to get men to shower before going to bed instead of before going to work.</p>
<p>Men read sensible, intellectual journals on how to catch fish and kill little animals.</p>
<p>When a man cooks, he keeps his knives sharp. Most female cooks don't. Indeed, most female cooks don't even own a decent kitchen knife, let alone a sharp one.</p>
<p>Female cooks offer the excuse that they would cut themselves if they had a sharp knife. And anyone with knives that lousy probably would.</p>
<p>There is another difference between male and female cooks. Female cooks generally cook better with dull knives than male cooks do with sharp knives. That's how infuriating female cooks can be.</p>
<p>Most women in my age group wear dresses occasionally. Only a few of my male friends do and then only in the privacy of their own homes.</p>
<p>The women hobble around on high-heeled shoes. Most men would never do anything that silly. In fact, there is a name for the kind of men who wear high heels. They are called cowboys.</p>
<p>Women laugh at men for wearing neckties and coats on 100-degree summer days. They snicker at men for wearing more clothes than necessary in hot weather. However, the women who do that are sweating in their pantyhose.</p>
<p>Most women in my age group wear make-up. Very few of the men do.  There is a name for men who wear make-up. They are called weird cowboys.</p>
<p>Women are far more likely to be lousy tippers in restaurants, and to complain thereafter that men always get better service than they do.</p>
<p>Women fold their underwear. Most men merely stuff their underwear into the drawer. Men use the time they save to catch fish and kill little animals.</p>
<p>Most women, when lost, will stop and ask directions. Most men in my age group believe admitting you're lost will cast doubt on your manhood. That's why so many macho men are lost. Smarter men prove their manhood by stopping and asking women for directions, even when they aren't lost.</p>
<p>There is another big difference between men and women in my age group. A competent man tends to rise through the ranks so easily that he eventually reaches a level where he is incompetent. Dr. Laurence J. Peter has dubbed this process the Peter Principle.</p>
<p>Women in my age group tend to be held below the level of their competence, making them embarrassing to work with because they tend to outshine male colleagues at the same level.</p>
<p>This is known as the Pain-in-the-Neck Principle. Incompetent men who have been subjected to that humiliation retaliate by refusing to promote women. And rightly so. You don't want people in the board room who don't shower each morning.</p>

25890,"<p>THE WORKLOAD ""There are 2 billion children in the world, but since Santa doesn't appear to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces his work- load to 15 percent of the total, or 300 million.At an average rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 85.7 million homes. Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the Earth, assuming he travels east to west. This works out to 767.9 visits per second.So for each Christian household with good children, Santa has about 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the presents, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, into the sleigh and move on to the next house. TIME/DISTANCE ""Assuming that these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the Earth, we're talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75.5 million miles SPEED""This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, or 3,000 times the speed of sound. THE PAYLOADAssuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium- size Lego set (2 lbs.), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as 'heavy.' On land, normal reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds, and even granting that flying reindeer could pull 10 times the normal amount, Santa's going to need 214,200 reindeer to pull his sleigh. This increases the payload to 353,430 tons, or four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth.CONCLUSION ""353,000 tons, traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance. This will heat the reindeer up like a spacecraft reentering Earth's atmosphere.� Translation: Santa Is Toast!!!</p>

25906,"<p>Dear Diary:</p>
<p>Aug. 1 - Moved to our new house in Maine. It is so beautiful here. The city is so picturesque. Can hardly wait to see it covered with snow. I LOVE IT HERE.</p>
<p>Oct. 14 - New England is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all different colors. I love the shades of red and orange. Went for a ride through the hills and saw some deer. They are so graceful. Certainly they are the most peaceful animals on earth. This must be paradise. I LOVE IT HERE.</p>
<p>Nov. 11 - Deer season will open soon. I can't imagine anyone wanting to kill such an elegant creature. The very symbol of peace and tranquility. Hope it will snow soon. I LOVE IT HERE.</p>
<p>Dec. 2 - It snowed last night. Woke up to find everything blanketed in white. It looked like a postcard. Went outside and cleaned snow off the steps and shoveled the driveway. We had a snowball fight today (I won). When the snowplow came by we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. Mother Nature in perfect harmony. I LOVE IT HERE.</p>
<p>Dec. 12 - More snow last night. I love it. The snowplow guy did his trick again (that rascal). A winter wonderland. I LOVE IT HERE.</p>
<p>Dec. 19 - Snowed again last night. Couldn't get out of the driveway to get to work on time. I'm exhausted from shoveling. DAMN SNOWPLOW!</p>
<p>Dec. 22 - More of that white shit fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snowplow hides around the corner and waits until I'm done shoveling. THAT ASSHOLE!!!</p>
<p>Dec. 25 - ""White Christmas"" my busted ass. More friggin' snow. If I ever get my hands on that son-of-a-bitch who drives that snowplow, I swear I will castrate the dumb bastard. Don't know why they don't use more salt on this shitty ice. DAMN ICE!</p>
<p>Dec. 28 - More of the same crap last night. Been inside since Christmas Day except for when ""Snowplow Harry"" comes by. Can't go anywhere. The car is buried in a mountain of white shit. The weatherman says expect another 10 inches of this shit tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow 10 inches is? ONE HELL OF ALOT!</p>
<p>Jan. 1 - Happy Friggin' New Year. The weatherman was wrong (AGAIN). We got 24 miserable inches of snow this time. At this rate it won't melt until the 4th of July. The snowplow got stuck down the road and that shit-for-brains had the balls to come to the door and ask to borrow my shovel. I told him I broke 6 shovels already, shoveling out the shit he plowed into my driveway. I broke the 7th shovel over the asshole's head. DAMN, ANOTHER SHOVEL WASTED! Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get food and on the way back a deer ran out in front of the car and I hit the filthy creature. Did about $3,000 damage to the car. Wish those hunters would have killed them all last November. DAMN HUNTERS!</p>
<p>May 3 - Took the car to the garage in town today. Would you believe the body is rotting away from all the friggin' salt they keep dumping all over the roads? It really looks like a piece of rusting shit. DAMN SALT!</p>
<p>May 10 - Moved to Florida today. I can't imagine why anyone in their right friggin' mind would want to live in the God forsaken State of Maine. I LOVE IT HERE. Damn! Something just bit me....</p>

'Let's see yer fishin' license, Boy!' the Warden gasped. With that, the boy pulled out his wallet and gave the Game Warden a valid fishing license. 'Well, son,' said the Game Warden, 'you must be about as dumb as a box of rocks! You don't have to run from me if you have a valid license!' 'Yes, sir,' replied the young guy, 'but my friend back there, well, he don't have one.'</p>

25931,"<p>These are notes from an inexperienced chili taster named FRANK,<br /> who was visiting Texas from New Jersey and fell into it:<br /> ""Recently I was lucky enough to be the 10,000th attendee at the<br /> State Fair in Texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a<br /> chili cook-off. Apparently the original judge #3 called in sick<br /> at the last moment and I happened to be standing there when the<br /> call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native<br /> Texans) that it would be a fun event and a true taste of Texas<br /> hospitality. They assured me that the chili wouldn't be all that<br /> spicy and besides they told me I could have free beer during the<br /> tasting, so I accepted.</p>
<p>Here are the scorecards from the event:</p>
<p>Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.<br /> FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove<br /> dried paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to put<br /> the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are<br /> crazy.</p>
<p>Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken<br /> seriously.<br /> FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I<br /> am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off 3 people<br /> who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to<br /> walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face.</p>
<p>Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more<br /> beans.<br /> JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red<br /> peppers.<br /> FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels<br /> like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by<br /> now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the<br /> front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced.</p>
<p>Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic<br /> JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for<br /> fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.<br /> FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was<br /> unable to taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me<br /> with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT,<br /> just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating.</p>
<p>Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover<br /> JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground,<br /> adding considerable kick. Very impressive.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato.<br /> Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.<br /> FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I<br /> farted and 4 people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant<br /> seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me<br /> brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring<br /> beer directly on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that<br /> the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those<br /> rednecks!</p>
<p>Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety<br /> JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance<br /> of spice and peppers.<br /> JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and<br /> garlic. Superb.<br /> FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with<br /> gaseous, sulfuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind<br /> me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow<br /> cone!</p>
<p>Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned<br /> peppers.<br /> JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a<br /> can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am<br /> worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of<br /> distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.<br /> FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, I<br /> wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, &amp;<br /> the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is<br /> covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My<br /> pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At<br /> least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've<br /> decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not<br /> getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in<br /> through the 4 inch hole in my stomach.</p>
<p>Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili<br /> JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe<br /> for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.<br /> JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither<br /> mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge<br /> Number 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of<br /> himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.<br /> FRANK: --------------</p>

Unrelenting, Bill forced yet a third mighty blow, and when it came forth, Bill did order his trumpets to blow, and his chorus to sing, and, his criers to cry, until the din could be heard throughout the land; and when he looked upon this third version of Windows, he saw it was not all that great, but like hotcakes did it sell. </p>
<p>And thus did Bill gloat, for the world proclaimed he had matched the lowly Macintosh, and his praises were sung throughout the land. And so he ordered another, mightier, more magnificent version made, and his henchmen and henchwomen did labor hard. </p>
<p>Still it was not forthcoming in the year promised, nor the year promised next, and rumors did abound, and magazines did overflow with secret peeks, and columnists did heap their scorn upon it. And came the minions of the Justice Department, bent upon proving Bill monopolous, yet before his wrath did they quail, and proclaim him innocent, mostly. </p>
<p>And that which was once called Chicago became known as Windows 95, and the suspense built throughout the land, and Bill, remembering what had gone before, set about building a great Hype. </p>
<p>Into his Hype he put the greatest mouths of the land, and scattered the fruits of his profits so heavily that he bought hosts of angels to sing, and Rolling Stones songs, and trumpets and horns and drums without number. </p>
<p>As the time of birthing grew nigh, he purchased television time without end, and appeared thereon himself, and bought entire editions of newspapers to give away unto the faithful, and traveling circuses to visit each great city. </p>
<p>And so when Windows 95 was born did hysteria rule the land, as the choirs sang and the trumpets and horns did blare and the televisions and the newspapers charge their followers to go forth and buy.</p>
<p>Heeding this, the populace did rush to the marketplace at the stroke of midnight, when even the cock doth sleep, and did push and shove and come even to blows the better to secure their own copies lest they be thought ignorant, or uncool, or hamsters in the eyes of Bill. </p>
<p>And Bill looked upon what he had wrought, and he giggled, and rubbeth his hands together, and even in the moment of his triumph, began to think of Next Time.</p>

25977,"<p>The cost for all the presents in ''The Twelve Days of Christmas'' has taken an unprecedented swan dive this year. A 50 percent fall in the price tag for seven swans a swimming'' helped cut this year's bill for the items in the famous Christmas carol by $3,462.55 from 1996, PNC Bank calculated in an index released Monday. </p>
<p>The total cost for giving one's true love everything from 12 drummers drumming to a partridge in a pear tree this year is $12,481.65, down 21.7 percent from $15,964.20 in 1996 and the lowest level since 1986. This is the first time since researchers at PNC Bank began compiling the annual index in 1984 that the price of Christmas has fallen significantly, although it took a 0.6 percent dip in 1988. The decline reflects inflation trends in the economy at large, as well as progress in reviving the trumpeter swan population. The price for the swans dropped due to a fluctuation of supply and demand,'' PNC said. </p>
<p>The general flatness in the cost of most of the items in the song reflect the low inflation rate.'' The price for seven swimming trumpeter swans, as quoted by the Philadelphia Zoo, dropped from $7,000 last year to $3,500. The North American population of the swans has risen from 73 in 1935 to more than 14,000 now, driving down the price and bringing the government close to removing the birds from the endangered species list, PNC said. </p>
<p>In general, prices for consumer goods such as five gold rings were steady or lower. But services such as leaping lords were steady or higher. The price of five gold rings fell to $325 from $450 last year, while the price of a pear tree fell to $12.50 from $19.99, because the nursery PNC uses was having a sale. </p>
<p>The cost of eight minimum-wage milkmaids was unchanged at $34 for one hour's service, while unionized pipers piping and drummers drumming commanded the same fees as the year before, for the first time. Those fees were $1,109.16 for the 11 pipers and $1,201.59 for the 12 drummers. But the bill for 10 lords a leaping climbed 5.6 percent, to $3,182.57, the only increase on the list.</p>
