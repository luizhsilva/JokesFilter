5002,"<p>A man was walking along the beach at Malibu when he found a<br /> bottle. He looked around and didn't see anyone so he opened it.</p>
<p>A genie appeared and thanked the man for letting him out. The<br /> genie said, ""For your kindness I will grant you one wish, but<br /> only one..""</p>
<p>The man thought for a minute and said, ""I have always wanted to<br /> go to Hawaii but have never been able to because I'm afraid of<br /> flying and ships make me claustrophobic and ill. So, I wish for<br /> a bridge to be built from here to Hawaii.""</p>
<p>The genie thought for a few minutes and said, ""No, I don't think<br /> I can do that. Just think of all the work involved with the<br /> pilings needed to hold up the highway and how deep they would<br /> have to be to reach the bottom of the ocean. Think of all the<br /> pavement that would be needed.</p>
<p>No, that is just too much to ask.""</p>
<p>The man thought for a minute and then told the genie, ""There is<br /> one other thing that I have always wanted. I would like to be<br /> able to understand women. What makes them laugh and cry, why are<br /> they temperamental, why are they so difficult to get along with?<br /> Basically, what makes them tick?""</p>
<p>The genie considered for a few minutes and said, ""So, do you<br /> want two lanes or four?</p>

When he finally reached him, he leaned over to the American and spoke softly into his ear...""I thought I told you yesterday to get the f**k out of here.""</p>

They do disgusting things with their mouths and then try to give you a  kiss.   Conclusion:    They are little men in fur coats</p>

5057,"<p>While sports fishing off the Florida coast, a tourist capsized his boat. He could swim, but his fear of alligators kept him clinging to the overturned craft. Spotting and old beachcomber standing on the shore, the tourist shouted, ""Are there any gators around here?!""</p>
<p>""Naw,"" the man hollered back, ""they ain't been around for years!""</p>
<p>""Feeling safe, the tourist started swimming leisurely toward the shore.</p>
<p>About halfway there he asked the guy, ""How'd you get rid of the gators?""</p>
<p>""We didn't do nothin',"" the beachcomber said. ""The sharks got 'em.""</p>

5066,"<p>(100 ways to keep your Testosterone flowing)</p>
<p>1. Don't call, ever. </p>
<p>2. If you don't like a girl, don't tell her. It's more fun to let her figure it out by herself. </p>
<p>3. Lie. </p>
<p>4. Name your penis. Be sure it is something narcissistic and unoriginal, such as ""spike"". </p>
<p>5. If you lose something that belongs to someone else, tell them you mailed it to them. </p>
<p>6. Here's a good pickup line,: ""My girlfriend's pregnant, will you go out with me? </p>
<p>7. Drink Vernors. </p>
<p>8. Play with yourself. Talk about it. </p>
<p>9. Be as ambiguous as possible. If you don't want to answer, a nice grunt will do. </p>
<p>10. Always remember: you are a man. Therefore, no matter what, it isn't your fault.</p>
<p>11. Lie. </p>
<p>12. Never ask for help. Even if you really, really need help - don't ask. People will think you have no penis.</p>
<p>13. Women like it when you ignore them. It arouses them. </p>
<p>14. Vanity is the most important trait for a man to have. Whenever you pass a reflective surface, check your hair, clothing, etc.</p>
<p>15. If you don't like a girl but can't think of a good enough reason why, just come up with trite, meaningless explanations like: ""I don't know. I just don't like her personality."" </p>
<p>16. Girls find it attractive if a man has had more women than baths. </p>
<p>17. If, GOD FOrbiD, you have to talk to a girl on the phone, use only monosyllabic words and noises. Bodily noises are permissible. </p>
<p>18. TWO WORDS: Hack and spit. </p>
<p>19. Everyone finds a man more attractive if he can write his name in urine. </p>
<p>20. One sure way to make a girl like you is to go after her best friend. She will then see what she's missing and love you for not giving up on her. </p>
<p>21. Tell her you will call, then refer back to Rule 1. </p>
<p>22. Say things like ""Wha...?"" </p>
<p>23. Don't wear matching clothes. People will think your girlfriend picked them out, and it will cramp your style on picking up chicks. </p>
<p>24. Lie. </p>
<p>25. Deny everything. Everything. </p>
<p>26. Good break up line: ""it's not you, it's me."" </p>
<p>27. If you like a girl, tell all your female friends about her because if any of your female friends like you, they'll really want to know. </p>
<p>28. Don't have a clue. </p>
<p>29. If you get a clue, pretend you didn't and disregard it. </p>
<p>30. No means yes. </p>
<p>31. Yes means no. </p>
<p>32. If you don't get sex whenever you want, your balls will shrivel. Enforce this rule at all times. </p>
<p>33. If anyone asks, you have had sex in all possible positions and locations. Improvise. </p>
<p>34. Much like an orgasm signifies the end of a sexual peak, sex often signifies the end of a relationship. </p>
<p>35. Feelings? What feelings? </p>
<p>36. Tell this to your girl before you have sex: ""don't worry. If you don't have an orgasm, you won't get pregnant."" </p>
<p>37. Life is one big competition. If someone is better than you at anything, either pretend it's not true or kick some ass. </p>
<p>38. Gays are an unacceptable part of our society. Take it upon yourself to eradicate all of them from the planet. </p>
<p>39. DO NOT make decisions about relationships. If you are backed into a corner and must make a decision, stall. If you still must come up with an answer, leave yourself a loophole for escape. Example: question: ""Honey, will you take me out for a romantic dinner?"" Answer: ""Yes, if you can guess how many sperm I produce each day."" </p>
<p>40. Every sentence that anyone says can be contorted to have sexual meaning. Do so. </p>
<p>41. At any given opportunity, point out how things look like various genitalia. If, by chance, you have Play-Doh, make sure you make an exact replica of your penis. Measure to make sure it's right. </p>
<p>42. Lie. </p>
<p>43. ""Love"" is not in your vocabulary. Don't even think about saying it. </p>
<p>44. A general rule: if whatever you're doing does not satisfy you completely in 5 minutes, it's really not worth it. </p>
<p>45. Diss your girlfriend. Beg and plead until you get her back. Diss her again. Repeat cycle. </p>
<p>46. Lie. </p>
<p>47. ALWAYS apologize. NEVER mean it.</p>
<p>48. If you hurt someone, pretend you care. Don't. </p>
<p>49. Try to have a good memory but it's OK if you forget trivial things. You know, like your girlfriend's birthday and eye colour. </p>
<p>50. Ignorance solves problems. If you can't see them, they can't see you. </p>
<p>51. It is never your duty to take responsibility for your actions. </p>
<p>52. Create new words and phrases to describe genitalia, sex, semen, etc. </p>
<p>53. Complain about not getting any mail. When people FINALLY feel sorry for you and send you mail, ignore it and continue complaining. </p>
<p>54. Lie.</p>
<p>55. Play with your food only if you are in a public place with people you don't know. </p>
<p>56. Play with your penis only if you are in a public place with people you don't know. </p>
<p>57. If people express extreme disgust at whatever you are doing, DON'T STOP! This is the desired reaction. </p>
<p>58. You are NOT a virgin, ever. Males are born without virginity. </p>
<p>59. You are male, therefore you are superior. </p>
<p>60. Agenda for a boring evening: get beer, drink beer, play with yourself, have sex, drink more beer, pass out. </p>
<p>61. Females do not care what you do to them as long as they get to please you. </p>
<p>62. Don't ever notice anything. </p>
<p>63. If you're going out with someone but you love someone else, don't say anything. Wait until the girl you are going out with falls in love with YOU, and then tell her. </p>
<p>64. Basic fundamental rule of dating: quantity, not quality. </p>
<p>65. Basic fundamental rule of sex: quantity IS quality. </p>
<p>66. Lie. </p>
<p>67. If you cheat on a girl but no one finds out, then technically you've done nothing wrong. </p>
<p>68. Crying is not manly. Then again, if you are a man, what do you have to cry about anyway? </p>
<p>69. If the question begins with ""why"", the answer is ""I don't know."" </p>
<p>70. Women are your napkins. Use them and throw them away. </p>
<p>71. Remember: every virgin girl is saving herself for YOU. </p>
<p>72. If you ever find yourself in a position where you have been proven wrong, blame others. Come up with creative and believable excuses why they are at fault - not you. </p>
<p>73. Don't ever let anyone say ""I told you so"". If you hear this phrase and it didn't come out of your mouth, go ballistic. </p>
<p>74. If your woman makes you go shopping with her, drive around until a parking spot right near the door opens up. If this takes hours, so be it. You will have the coveted ""door spot"" and others will worship your skills. </p>
<p>75. Keep track of how many seconds in your life you have thought about sex. Compare with others. </p>
<p>76. Other people's pain is strictly for your amusement. Laugh long and loud. </p>
<p>77. Lie. </p>
<p>78. General Rule: different is BAD. </p>
<p>79. If anyone asks you for a favour:- (a) make a big deal about how hard it is for you to do it; (b) remind them of this huge favour you've done for them at least every 5 minutes for the rest of their life. </p>
<p>80. Each penny you save will be worth at least a dollar in the long run. </p>
<p>81. If you do something really mean to a girl and she doesn't want to talk to you, pretend nothing happened. If she still doesn't talk to you, casually ask: ""is something wrong?"" </p>
<p>82. Three words: ""let's be friends"". Translation: ""I never want to speak to you again but it's bad for my nice-guy image if you are mad at me, so I'll pretend I want to be your friend."" </p>
<p>83. Lie. </p>
<p>84. If you're on a date and there is a lull in the conversation, tell the girl how many different dorms you've been laid in. </p>
<p>85. When you tell a girl about your past, it's good to say: ""God, I was such a pimp back then."" </p>
<p>86. Here's a good trick. Tell a girl that you're going to leave and when you come back, you want her naked, sprawled on the bed. Leave and go into her dad's room and tell him he should go check on his daughter. Then drive like hell (true story). </p>
<p>87. If a girl breaks up with you because you're in love with someone else, she has no right to be upset because, you know, SHE's the one who wanted to end the relationship. </p>
<p>88. The best sex position is you, lying face up... and twenty girls on top. </p>
<p>89. Practice your blank stare. </p>
<p>90. Spend your spare time thinking of excuses and shove them up your ass. Then, whenever you need one, you can pull it out of your ass. </p>
<p>91. If you're ever forced to show emotion, just pick random emotions like rage and lust and insanity and display them at random, inconvenient times. You won't be asked to do it again. </p>
<p>92. If you are asked to do something you REALLY DON'T want to do, first try your manly best to get out of it. If that doesn't work, go ahead and do what you were asked to do but complain that you don't know how to do it and continuously ask questions on how to do each little part. If no one rushes in to do it for you YET, finish the job in the most half-assed way you possibly can and then say: ""SEE? I TOLD you I couldn't do it."" Eventually, people will stop asking you to do things. </p>
<p>93. Work out day and night to make your body even more beautiful than it already is. When people ask if you've been working out, say things like: ""no, Baby, I was BORN like this!"" </p>
<p>94. Do not listen to ""pussy music"" such as Erasure, Color Me Badd or Oldies. </p>
<p>95. Beer, Then more beer. </p>
<p>96. Scratch your balls. See if you can embarrass people. </p>
<p>97. One word: FOOTBALL! </p>
<p>98. Real men beat up others who are inferior. I mean, we don't want the inferior of the species to get to reproduce ever, do we? </p>
<p>99. Diss your girl friends for an occasional night or 5 out with ""The Gang"". </p>
<p>100. Lie.</p>

5073,"<p>Herman and Martha were happily married for nearly forty years.  The<br /> only friction in their marriage was caused by the husband's habit of breaking<br /> wind nearly every morning as he awoke.  The noise would always wake up Martha<br /> and the smell would cause her eyes to water as she would choke and gasp for<br /> air.  Nearly every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping one in<br /> the morning.  Herman told her that he couldn't help it.  She begged him to<br /> visit a doctor to see if anything could be done, but the husband wouldn't<br /> hear of it.  He told her that it was just a natural bodily function, and then<br /> he would laugh in her face as she tried to wave the fumes away with her<br /> hands.  She told him that there was nothing natural about it and if he didn't<br /> stop, he was one day going to ""fart his guts out."" </p>
<p> The years went by and Martha continued to suffer and Herman continued<br /> to ignore her warnings about ""farting his guts out"" until one Christmas<br /> morning.  Before dawn, Martha went downstairs to prepare the family feast.<br /> She fixed Christmas pudding, mashed potatoes, gravy and of course a turkey.<br /> While she was taking out the turkeys innards, a thought occurred to the wife<br /> as to how she might solve her husband's problem.  With a devilish grin on her<br /> face, she placed the turkey guts into a bowl and quietly walked upstairs<br /> hours before her flatulent husband would awake.  While he was still soundly<br /> asleep, she pulled back the covers and then gently pulled back her husband's<br /> jockey shorts.  She then placed all of the turkey guts into her husband's<br /> underwear, pulled them up, replaced the covers and tiptoed back downstairs to<br /> finish preparing the family meal. </p>
<p> Several hours later she heard Herman awake with his normal loud ass<br /> trumpeting.  This was soon followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound<br /> of frantic footsteps as her husband ran to the upstairs bathroom.  Martha<br /> could not control herself and her eyes began to tear up as she rolled on the<br /> floor laughing.  After years of putting up with him she had finally gotten<br /> even.  About twenty minutes later, Herman came downstairs in his blood<br /> stained underpants with a look of horror in his eyes.  She bit her lip to<br /> keep from laughing and she asked him what was the matter.</p>
<p> ""Honey,"" he said.  ""You were right - all those years you warned me<br /> and I didn't listen to you."" </p>
<p> ""What do you mean?"" asked Martha. </p>
<p> ""Well, you always told me that I would end up farting my guts out one<br /> of these days and today it finally happened.  But by the grace of God and<br /> these two fingers, I think I got 'em all back in.""</p>

But the worst is this new obsession with oral sex. According to my survey, 88% of the population is doing it. Even four out of five dentists recommend it. I'm afraid it has reached epidemic proportions."" </p>
<p>""Hmmm,"" God said thoughtfully, ""Do you have any recommendations as to what should be done to put an end to this sexual perversion?"" </p>
<p>""I think we should send a message to everyone on Earth who engages in oral sex. The contents of that message should tell them exactly what will happen to them on judgment day if they do not stop this type of activity."" replied St. Peter. </p>
<p>""That is an effective solution,"" God stated, ""but I think that instead of punishing those who practice oral sex, we should reward those who = refrain from it. Let's send a letter that's personally signed by me to each one of these good people."" And so they did. Do you know what the letter said? </p>

The frrst guy looks at him again and has to ask and he says, ""What the hell would you do that for?!?!?"" And the other man replies, ""So when you walk up to them you could say, hey i know you"" while you poke them in the shoulder.(when youi tell this joke.......comes in handy in getting the point across by poking the other person in the shoulder while you say, ""Hey, I know you!"")</p>

5087,"<p>A beautiful, well-dressed blonde seats herself in the first class cabin on a<br /> cross-country flight, and settles her in for the trip, smiling prettily at<br /> admiring passengers seated around her. </p>
<p>Underway, a flight attendant soon approaches the blonde and says, 'Miss, I'm<br /> sorry, but I see that your ticket is for coach, and you're seated in first<br /> class; I'm afraid you'll have to move.'<br /> The blonde replies, 'I'm blonde, and I'm beautiful, and I'm going to New York<br /> to be a model.'</p>
<p>Slightly incredulous, the attendant alerts the senior flight attendant. </p>
<p>The senior attendant approaches the blonde and says, politely,'I'm sorry,<br /> Miss, but since your ticket is for coach, you'll have to move back.'</p>
<p>The blonde replies, sweetly, 'I'm Blonde, and I'm beautiful, and I'm going to<br /> New York to be a model' -- and shows no signs of moving.<br /> Frustrated, the senior attendant informs the captain, and he says he'll deal<br /> with the problem. He turns over flight control, walks to the rear, and observes<br /> the blonde seated comfortably in first class. </p>
<p>Approaching her with a smile, the captain leans over and speaks quietly into<br /> the blonde's ear. Almost immediately, the blonde gathers her things, gets up,<br /> and moves quickly to the coach compartment. </p>
<p>Amazed, the senior flight attendant asks the captain, 'Captain, I'm impressed<br /> ... what did you say to her?'<br /> The captain grinned slyly and said, 'I just told her that the first class<br /> cabin doesn't go to New York.'</p>

5108,"<p>A drunk walked into a tavern, sat down at the bar. He placed a small cardboard<br /> box on the bar, and ordered a beer. When the beer came, he opened the box,<br /> pulled out a tiny piano and bench and set them on the bar, then ordered another<br /> beer. </p>
<p>When the beer came, he reached into the box, pulled out a frog, sat him on the<br /> piano bench and said, ""PLAY"". </p>
<p>The frog immediately began to play the piano. It played all the favorites, and<br /> some classical and then launched into contemporary jazz. </p>
<p>The man ordered another beer, and when it came he reached into the cardboard<br /> box and pulled out a little white mouse. </p>
<p>He set this mouse on top of the piano and said, ""SING"". </p>
<p>The frog began to play the piano and the mouse began to sing, first some<br /> 'oldies but goodies', then all of the current favorites.</p>
<p>A man at the bar who was watching all of this approached the man and offered<br /> to buy this little outfit that the man had. </p>
<p>After a bit of negotiating, the man drunk agreed to sell it to the man for<br /> $500. The man gathered everything into the little cardboard box and ran out the<br /> door before the drunk could change his mind.</p>
<p>The bartender had been watching all of this goings on and said to the drunk<br /> ""You damned old fool! You just sold that little outfit you had for $500 and you<br /> could have made millions off of it!"" </p>
<p>The drunk laughed heartily and replied, ""I am not the fool, the guy who bought<br /> it is. Do you really think I would have sold that if that mouse could really<br /> sing?""</p>
<p>The bartender responded ""What do you mean, I stood right here and<br /> listened to that mouse sing!"" ""The joke is on you and the guy who bought that<br /> outfit my friend "", chuckled the drunk. � That mouse can't sing. The frog is a<br /> ventriloquist!""</p>

5135,"<p>In World War II, an English reporter who had heard so much about the<br /> bravery and elan of the Gurkhas visited a camp just in front of the<br /> enemy lines (Germans).  During the course of his reporting, he had<br /> occasion to observe a mission being conducted.</p>
<p>The mission was to airdrop a bunch of soldiers behind enemy lines to<br /> conduct some relatively light action.  He watched the commander of the<br /> Gurkhas (a British soldier) pitch the mission and then ask for<br /> volunteers.  To his surprise, only about half the Gurkhas volunteered<br /> and were sent off.</p>
<p>Throughly disillusioned with the legends of Gurkha bravery, the<br /> reporter went back home.  After the war, he happened to run into a<br /> Gurkha who had been there, and asked him why half the troops had failed<br /> to volunteer.  It turned out that none of the squad, both those who<br /> volunteered and those who did not, were aware that they would get a<br /> parachute for the drop.  Hence the low turnout.</p>

5147,"<p>A nun and a priest were traveling across the desert and realized halfway across that the camel they were using for transportation was about to die. They set up a make-shift camp, hoping someone would come to their rescue, but to no avail. Soon the camel died.After several days of not being rescued, they agreed that they were not going to be rescued. They prayed a lot (of course), and they discussed their predicament in great depth. Finally the priest said to the nun, ""you know sister, I am about to die, and there's always been one thing I've wanted here on earth--to see a woman naked. Would you mind taking off your clothes so I can look at you?""The nun thought about his request for several seconds and then agreed to take off her clothes. As she was doing so, she remarked, ""well, Father, now that I think about it, I've never seen a man naked, either. Would you mind taking off your clothes, too?""With little hesitation, the priest also stripped. Suddenly the nun exclaimed, ""Father! What is that little thing hanging between your legs?""The priest patiently answered, ""That, my child, is a gift from God. If I put it in you, it creates a new life.""""Well,"" responded the nun, ""forget about me. Stick it in the camel!""</p>

5155,"<p>Two buddies Bob and Earl were two of the biggest baseball fans in America. For their entire adult lives, Bob and Earl discussed baseball history in the winter and they pored over every box score during the season. They went to 60 games a year. They even agreed that whoever died first would try to come back and tell the other if there was baseball in heaven. One summer night, Bob passed away in his sleep after watching the Yankee victory earlier in the evening. He died happy. A few nights later, his buddy Earl awoke to the sound of Bob's voice from beyond. 'Bob is that you?' Earl asked. 'Of course it me,' Bob replied. 'This is unbelievable!' Earl exclaimed. 'So tell me, is there baseball in heaven?' 'Well I have some good news and some bad news for you. Which do you want to hear first?' 'Tell me the good news first.' 'Well, the good news is that, yes, there is baseball in heaven, Earl.' 'Oh, that is wonderful! So what could possibly be the bad news?' 'You're pitching tomorrow night.'</p>

5157,"<p>The Truth about Relationships - a man's view</p>
<p>Before she moves in, she wears teddies and suspenders, and you hold your<br /> farts in until she leaves the room; she's a gorgeous sex kitten and you tell<br /> her so; you're so sweet and adorable, and blowjobs follow ambient dinners<br /> like a fine port.</p>
<p>After she moves in, she farts in her grungy trackie bottoms while hypnotized<br /> by Loving; you scratch your nuts unashamedly and bitch about work; oral sex<br /> is strictly quid pro quo and the new girl in the office really does have a<br /> great ass.</p>
<p>Six key indicators of when the honeymoon period has finished.</p>
<p>1. Addictions</p>
<p>Before: You tell her you don't mind the occasional cold beer on a hot day<br /> with your mates, and that you've taken recreational drugs but those days are<br /> well and truly over.</p>
<p>After: For the fifth night in a row you stagger in blotto, dig out your stash<br /> and mull up, pass out in the lounge in your underpants and expect her to<br /> accept that you're just being you.</p>
<p>2. Bodily functions</p>
<p>Before: You spray aerosol after a crap; piss on the side of the bowl to<br /> reduce noise and never, ever fart in her presence.</p>
<p>After: You fart in front of her with impunity and obvious pride, commenting<br /> on the food intake for the day and speculating on the resultant odor.<br /> Despite repeated pleas to the contrary, you fart in bed and hold her head<br /> under the covers.  You think it's hilarious.</p>
<p>3. Relations/Friends</p>
<p>Before: Her aunty Jane is a real character with a lively personality and<br /> interesting views about politics, and her unemployed 'girl'- friend Amanda is<br /> a genuine, charming supportive friend who you think is really nice.</p>
<p>After: Aunty Jane is a loudmouthed, pain-in-the-ass fascist with all the<br /> personality of a cold sore.  Amanda is a manipulative loser, but you wouldn't<br /> mind doing her if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>4. Sex</p>
<p>Before: Sex is a sweat-soaked, gymnastic romp that lasts for hours.  You fuck<br /> to impress, using all your tricks -- your renowned tit grope, marathon oral<br /> sex sessions, and jackhammer-like screwing.  Sex four times a day is not<br /> uncommon.</p>
<p>After: A wank is often preferable to the effort of sex.  When you do have<br /> sex, you think about Amanda.</p>
<p>5. Attention span</p>
<p>Before: Her words are hypnotic; her wit is incisive; her anecdotes about her<br /> life pre-you are spellbinding.  Over candlelight and coffee you listen with<br /> interest and politely chortle as she recounts stories of her childhood.</p>
<p>After: Your eyes glaze over as soon as she mentions anything that doesn't<br /> involve you.  What's more, you develop the uncanny ability to be able to<br /> concentrate on the T.V and listen to her at the same time.  The phrase, ""Are<br /> you listening to me?"" becomes an evening mantra.</p>
<p> 6. Overall evaluation</p>
<p>Before: She thinks you are witty, disciplined, a sexual athlete, attentive,<br /> loving, faithful and devoid of all crass male habits which have plagued her<br /> previous relationships ..... but she suspects that you're full of shit.</p>
<p>After: She knows you're full of shit!</p>

5197,"<p>'Good morning.  As we leave Dallas, it's warm, the sun is shining, and the birds are singing.  We are going to Charlotte, where it's dark, windy and raining.  Why in the world y'all wanna go there I really don't know.' Pilot - 'Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off.  Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land...it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern.' Pilot - 'Folks, if you were with us last week, we never got around to mentioning that it was National Procrastination day.  If you get a chance this week, please try to celebrate it.  If you can't get to it, then maybe try to do it at the weekend, but no big rush.  Have a nice day.' And, after landing: 'Thank you for flying Delta Business Express.  We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.' An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard.  The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, give a smile, and a, 'Thanks for flying XYZ airline.'  He said that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment.  Finally, everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking with a cane.  She said, 'Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?'  'Why no M'am,' said the pilot, 'what is it?'

"
5203,"<p>Every once in a while each of us experiences a perfect crap. It's rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects. You sit down expecting the worst, but what you get is the smooth-sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. </p>
<p>But that's not the end of it. You use some toilet paper only to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it. </p>
<p>On the other hand (so to speak) there is:</p>
<p>The Beer Crap<br /> Talk about nasty craps. Depending on the crapper's tolerance, the beer crap is the result of too many beers. It could have been two or 22, it doesn't matter.<br /> What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy crap accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.</p>
<p>The Chilli Crap<br /> Hot when it goes in and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chilli crap stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a heat shield.</p>
<p>The Cable Crap<br /> Long, curly and perfectly formed like two feet of telephone coaxial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. You wonder admiringly, 'Did I do that? Where did it come from?' You leave the toilet pleased with yourself.</p>
<p>The Latrine Crap<br /> In case you didn't know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it - where soldiers, boy scouts and flies go to crap. Tip: don't ever look down the hole.</p>
<p>The Mona Lisa Crap<br /> This is the masterpiece of craps. It's as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that would make Da Vinci weep. And just think, you made it yourself. You may even want to break out the Polaroid camera, but maybe that's going too far.</p>
<p>The Empty Roll Crap<br /> You're done... you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins coldly in your throat. You could use the curtains... no, someone would say, 'Where are the curtains?' Then what would you say. The rug? Too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that every 'empty roll crapper' must face... pull up your daks, tighten your arse and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.</p>
<p>A mate about to run the London Marathon lined up outside the dozens of portaloos on Blackheath to unload a nervous one and discovered when the business was done and he was ready to run a world record race, there was no paper. Panic. The only thing available was a pound note - the last he possessed because they were being replaced by the coin - and he used that, being careful not to use the side with the Queen's head, of course!</p>
<p>The Splash Back Crap<br /> You send the crap on its way; it drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you're wet and embarrassed. Tip: blot instead of wipe.</p>
<p>The Aborted Crap<br /> You are in mid-crap when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off; go for the phone and save the rest for later. It isn't pretty, but you've gotta do what you've gotta do.</p>
<p>The Caesarean Crap<br /> Pain, that's what this crap and childbirth have in common. It's simply a case of too much crap trying to go through too small a hole and there's no obstetrician to help.</p>
<p>The Alfresco Crap<br /> Everyone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the nature, and a good bush all contribute to the peaceful ambience that our primitive forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of Brownies or a patch of poison ivy.</p>
<p>The Tijuana Trot Crap (also known as Delhi Belly, Rabat Runs, Seskatchewan Squits, Balsall Heath Balti Bypass)<br /> The phrase 'shit happens' really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins. For the next 72 hours you'd be better off if you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a fetal position.</p>
<p>The Machine Gun Crap<br /> You're just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like machinegun fire. The guy in the next stall hits the floor like a combat veteran - cradling his umbrella like an AK47.</p>
<p>The Sound Effect Crap<br /> You feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or workmates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects:<br /> 1. Flush the toilet.<br /> 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem.<br /> 3. Drop a handful of change on the floor.</p>
<p>The Security Crap<br /> You have enough on your mind when you're in the toilet without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-crap mode. So how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can't reach to do this... hum loudly.</p>
<p>The Cling-On Crap<br /> For the most part you've completed your crap, but there's one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You're getting impatient. Someone else wants to use the toilet. So you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently on the door has scissors.</p>
<p>The Houdini Crap<br /> You go, then you stand up to flush and the damn thing has disappeared. Where'd it go? Did it creep down the pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it lurking out of sight? Should you wipe... maybe you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You'd better, because if you don't, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.</p>
<p>The Hangover Crap<br /> You feel so bad that you don't know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your intestines like a vice so you sit down again... up down, up down. Don't you wish Mum was close by.</p>
<p>The Porta-Pottie Dump<br /> Construction workers and outdoor concertgoers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best description would be, 'It's like taking a shit in an upright coffin.' It's claustrophobic and it smells bad. Best advice: go in a paper cup.</p>
<p>The Proctologist Crap<br /> In the beginning, the Lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn't create this dump because there is nothing biblical about it. You run out of gas. That's right, you run out of propulsion. The crap is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You've only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you're a proctologist and go after it yourself. Not a pretty picture is it?</p>
<p>The Whole Roll Crap<br /> No matter how much you wipe, it doesn't seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times too. The whole episode is consumer waste.</p>
<p>The Graffiti Crap<br /> You flush the crap and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the crap to the porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way down. You flush again but the curly-Q hangs there... love it or leave it, it's your choice.</p>
<p>The Encore Crap<br /> 'Ahhh!' You're done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the toilet when you feel another crap on its way. You have to return for a curtain call.</p>
<p>The Born Again Crap<br /> This is a dump that's going badly. You say, 'Lord, if I live through this, I'll take up religion.' You always get through it, but seldom keep the promises you made in desperation, because a born-again crap is like childbirth - you forget the pain quickly.</p>

<p>Since we have only one ""little person"" living here it turns out that he won't have to pay anything for the only house we built, the subsidy covers everything. </p>

5229,"<p>In the first book of the Bible, Guinness's, God got tired of creating the<br /> world, so He took the Sabbath off. Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree.<br /> Noah's wife was called Joan of Ark. Lot's wife was a pillar of salt by day, but<br /> a ball of fire by night. </p>
<p>Moses led the Hebrews to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which<br /> is bread made without any ingredients. Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the<br /> Ten Amendments. The First Commandment was when Eve told Adam to eat the apple.<br /> The Fifth Commandment is to humour thy father and mother. The Seventh<br /> Commandment is thou shalt not admit adultery. </p>
<p>Moses died before he ever reached Canada. Then Joshua led the Hebrews in the<br /> battle of Geritol. The greatest miracle in the Bible is when Joshua told his son<br /> to stand still and he obeyed him. </p>
<p>David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar. He fought with the<br /> Finklesteins, a race of people who lived in Biblical times. Solomon, one of<br /> David's sons, had 300 wives and 700 porcupines. </p>
<p>Jesus enunciated the Golden Rule, which says to do one to others before they<br /> do one to you. He also explained, ""Man doth not live by sweat alone."" </p>
<p>The people who followed the Lord were called the 12 decibels. The epistles<br /> were the wives of the apostles. One of the opossums was St. Matthew, who was by<br /> profession a taximan. </p>

5231,"<p>An old guy walks into a bar and asks for a bottle of forty-year old Scotch.<br /> The bartender, not wanting to give up the good liquor, pours a shot of ten-year<br /> Scotch and figures that the guy won't be able to tell the difference. The guy<br /> downs the Scotch and says: ""This Scotch is only ten years old! I specifically<br /> asked for forty-year old Scotch."" </p>
<p>Amazed, the bartender reaches into a locked cabinet underneath the bar, pulls<br /> out a bottle of twenty-year old Scotch, and pours the man a shot. The guy drinks<br /> it down and says, ""That was twenty-year old Scotch. I asked for forty-year old<br /> Scotch."" </p>
<p>So the bartender goes into the back room, brings out a bottle of thirty-year<br /> old Scotch, and pours the guy a drink. By now a small crowd has gathered around<br /> the man and is watching anxiously as he downs the latest drink. Once again the<br /> guy states the true age of the Scotch and repeats his original request for<br /> forty-year old Scotch. </p>
<p>The bartender can hold off no longer and disappears into the cellar to get a<br /> bottle of prime forty-year old Scotch. Soon, the bartender returns with the<br /> bottle and pours a shot. The guy downs the Scotch and says; ""Now this is<br /> forty-year old Scotch!"" The crowd applauds his discriminating palate. </p>
<p>An old drunk, who had been watching the proceedings with interest, raises a<br /> full shot glass of his own and says, ""Here, take a swig of this�. </p>
<p>The guy takes the glass and downs the drink in one swallow. Immediately, he<br /> chokes and spits out the liquid on the barroom floor. ""My God! That tastes like<br /> piss,"" he yells. </p>

5239,"<p>One day, little jonny asked his mom what sex was.</p>
<p>""Tonight, go into your sister's room, hide behind the curtain, and watch what she and her boyfriend do.</p>
<p>The following morning, jonny's mom asked what happened.</p>
<p>Little jonny explained ""well at first, they were just kinda talking and laughing, but after a while they started kissing and hugging, sister got a fever, cuz she said she was feeling hot. </p>
<p>So sister's boyfriend put his hand under her shirt to find her heart, just like the doctor would. </p>
<p>Except he's not so smart because both of them got sick and they started panting and getting all out of breath. </p>
<p>His other hand must have been cold because he put it under her skirt. </p>
<p>About this time sis got worse and began to moan and sigh, and squirm around and slide to the end of her bed. then i finally found out what was making them sick - a big eel had gotten inside her boyfriend's pants somehow. </p>
<p>It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long! anyways he grapped it in one hand to keep it from getting away. </p>
<p>When sis saw it, she got really scared - her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open, and she started calling to God and stuff like that. </p>
<p>She said it was the biggest one she had ever seen, I should tell her about the ones by the lake, anyway sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off.</p>
<p>All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and tried to keep it from biting again. </p>
<p>Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it, and the boyfriend helped by lying on top of the eel. </p>
<p>The eel put on a heck of a fight. Sis started moaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squishing it between them. </p>
<p>After a while, they both stopped moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough they had killed the eel! </p>
<p>I knew because it just hung there and also because some of its insides were dripping out. </p>
<p>Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back to the bed anyway! </p>
<p>He started hugging and kissing her again! by golly, the eel wasn't dead!It jumped straight up and started to fight again. </p>
<p>I guess eels are like cats-they have nine lives or something like that. this time, sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it. </p>
<p>After a 35 minute struggle they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead because I saw sis boyfriend peel it's skin off and flush it down the toilet!""</p>
<p>Little jonny's mom fainted</p>

5241,"<p>Employee: Boss can I have the day off tommorow?</p>
<p>Boss: So you want a day off. Let's take a look at what you are<br /> asking for. There are 365 days per year available for work.<br /> There are 52 weeks per year in which you already have 2 days off<br /> per week, leaving 261 days available for work. Since you spend<br /> 16 hours each day away fron work, you have used up 170 days,<br /> leaving only 91 days available. You spend 30 minutes each day on<br /> coffee break which counts for 23 days each year, leaving only 68<br /> days available. With a 1 hour lunch each day, you used up<br /> another 46 days, leaving only 22 days available for work. You<br /> normally spend 2 days per year on sick leave. This leaves you<br /> only 20 days per year available for work. We are off 5 holidays<br /> per year, so your available working time is down to 15 days. We<br /> generously give 14 days vacation per year which leaves only 1<br /> day available for work and I'll be damned if you are going to<br /> take that day off!</p>

"
5249,"<p>Relationships: When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled 'All Men Are Idiots.' Then she will get on with her life. A mail has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3 am on a Sunday morning, he will call and say, 'I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I'll never forgive you, and hate you, and you're a total floozy. But I want you to know that there's always a chance for us.' This is known as the 'I Hate You, I Love You' drunken phone call and 99 percent of all men have made it at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need.Sex: Women prefer 30 to 40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30 to 40 seconds of foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.Maturity: Women mature much faster than men do. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.Magazines: Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women's magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman's body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.Bathrooms: A man has five items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.Groceries: A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes out to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampetts' car on The Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10?items?or?less lane.Cats: Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.Offspring: Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.Dressing Up: A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for weddings and funerals.Laundry: Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a van and take his mountain of clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by reruns of old American sitcoms.Eating Out: When the bill comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it's only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their bill, out come the pocket calculators.Mirrors: Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror. Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any, shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, bald boyfriend's/father's heads.Menopause: When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, biological Changes. Nature provokes a uniform reaction in men. He buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.Richard Gere: Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because lie reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.Madonna: Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.Toys: Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical. Examples of men's toys: little miniature TVs. Cell phones. Complicated juicers and blenders. Graphic equalizers. Small robots that serve cocktails on command. Video games. Anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least six big batteries to operate.Locker Rooms: In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about one thing in the locker room: sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.Movies: Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man. Men will only show their arse, because arse size doesn't really matter.Jewelry: Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that's it. Any more than that and he will look like a lounge singer named Ramone.Time: When a woman says she'll be ready to go out in five more minutes, she's using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football game just has five minutes left. Neither of them is counting time outs, commercials, or replays.Friends: Women on a 'girls' night out' talk the whole time. Men on a 'boys' night out' say about 20 words all night, most of which are 'Pass the chips' or 'Got am more beer?'Toilets: Men use toilets for purely biological reasons. Women use toilets as social lounges. Men in toilets will never speak a word to each other. Women who've never met will leave a toilet giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, 'Hey Tom, I, was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?'</p>

5250,"<p>The boy who liked Jell-O</p>
<p>There once was a boy named Joe who loved to eat green Jell-O. On his 18th birthday his cake was made totally out of green Jell-O. His friend Billy Bob told Joe that if he ate the whole cake he would become a super-hero. Joe did this in hopes he could be like the power-puff-girls. When the cake was all gone Joe didn�t feel to good. Billy Bob told him if he jumped off a cliff his stomach wouldn�t hurt and since he was now a super-hero he could just fly around for a while. Joe thought this was really a sensible idea and wondered why he hadn�t thought of it himself.<br /> Joe found a cliff and jumped off. To his surprise he couldn�t fly, he flapped his arms and everything else he�d seen birds do, but nothing seemed to work. Now he was terrified and he put his hands into prayer position and began to pray, �Our father who does art in heaven, Howard be your name�.� And on it went like that until he came to a thump.<br /> He had landed in a lake, and in the lake where flying fish. Now Joe had a great idea, he would put a flying fish in each hand and have them fly him to the top of the cliff. He grabbed two fish and yelled, �Up, up, and away.� The fish wouldn�t fly, puzzled why the fish were lying there, gasping for air; he put the fish back in the water. Now he had to find a new way to the top.<br /> When he had walked for about an hour he met a man selling donkeys. �Donkeys for only 1699.00 pesos!� Yelled the man. Joe was depressed they were so much, but he needed to get to the top of the cliff. �I only have $4000.00 in American money is that enough?� asked Joe. The man leaped for joy, handed Joe the donkey and ran away singing.<br /> Now Joe had a donkey he jumped on it and kicked it�s sides. The donkey jumped and started running up the cliff. Now Joe had made another mistake and jumped on the donkey backwards and couldn�t see a tree branch sticking out of the side of the cliff. He was hit by the branch and fell to the ground unconscious.<br /> When he awoke he heard his name being screamed. He stood up and yelled back, �I�m alright!� A man came running towards him, it was Billy Bob. �Joe, Joe are you O.K? Why didn�t you come back up to your party?� asked Billy Bob. �Well,� answered Joe, �I was stuck down here and couldn�t get back up.� At this point Billy Bob was rolling on the ground, laughing so hard. �You only fell 5feet! You also got caught on a branch and we heard you praying! It�s a good thing you went to a catholic school for 13 years!� Billy Bob laughed.</p>

The flight attendant explained that there<br /> would be another 45-minute delay, and if we wanted to get off the aircraft, we<br /> would re board in thirty minutes.</p>
<p>Everybody got off the plane except one gentleman who was blind. I noticed him<br /> as I walked by and could tell he had flown before because his Seeing Eye dog lay<br /> quietly underneath the seats in front of him throughout the entire flight. I<br /> could also tell he had flown this very flight before because the pilot<br /> approached him and, calling him by name, said, ""Keith, we're in Sacramento for<br /> almost an hour. Would you like to get off and stretch your legs?""</p>

<p>The Queensland, Australia man, 63, and his female companion, 64, were<br />  driving along the Newell Highway near Moree, in Northwestern New<br />  South Wales, on Wednesday night, police said.</p>
<p> Their car crashed into the side of a fully laden, 600 metre long<br />  train at a level crossing.  (I guess that would be harder to miss<br />  than the side of a barn!) The vehicle became wedged between the<br />  second last and last carriages and was dragged sideways beside the<br />  track as the train continued towards Moree, a police spokeswoman<br />  said.</p>
<p> After being carried more than a kilometre and a half they approached<br />  an unfenced bridge with a 10 metre drop, the spokeswoman said.<br />  Moments before they reached the precipice, the car was struck by a<br />  pylon, dislodged from the train and spun several times. When it came<br />  to rest, the pair managed to free themselves from the wreck (I wonder<br />  if it was a Volvo?) with minor bruising and the man set off along the<br />  railway line for help.  But he slipped on the bridge and fell to his<br />  death, the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback.  However, she remembers what her boss told her; ""Don't reject the guy outright.""  So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting to marry her.</p>
<p>So, after a few minutes, the woman says to the man, ""I will only marry you under three conditions.  First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75 carat diamond ring, with a matching 200 carat diamond tiara.""</p>
<p>The Taiwanese man pauses for awhile.  Then, he nods his head and says, ""No problem!! I buy. I buy.""</p>

<p>The man pauses for awhile.  He whips out his cellular phone, calls some brokers in New York, then he calls some brokers in France.  He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, ""Okay, okay.  I build, I build.""</p>
<p>Realizing that she has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one.  She takes her time to think and finally, she gets an idea.  A sure-to-work condition.  She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, ""Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 12-inch penis.""</p>
<p>The man seems a bit disturbed.  He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table.  All the while, he's muttering something in Chinese.  Finally, after what seemed like forever, the man shakes his head, looking real sad, says to the woman, ""Okay, okay. I cut. I cut!""</p>

5298,"<p>Last year, my friend upgraded his GirlFriend 3.1 to GirlFriendPlus1.0<br /> (marketing name: Fiancee1.0). </p>
<p>Recently he upgraded Fiancee1.0 to Wife1.0 and it's a memory hogger, has taken<br /> all his space; and Wife1.0 must be running before he can do anything. Although<br /> he didn't ask for them, Wife1.0 came with Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw and<br /> BrotherInLaw. </p>
<p>Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend4.0.<br /> - A ""Don't remind me again"" button<br /> - Minimize button<br /> - Shutdown feature - An install shield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be<br /> completely uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache and other objects) </p>
<p>I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still installed, they<br /> tried using the same I/O port and conflicted.

5300,"<p>Out far away in the himalayas there was a small village that was constantly terrified by this terrible monster named the medecrin.The medicrin would come down to the village once a week and eat one of the villagers. Now, as you would guess, the population of the village decreased greatly after a few months of this, so, the chief of the village called forth the greatest hunter he could get and told him to hunt down and kill the medicrin.So, after much talk, the hunter finally agreed to kill the medicrine. But the hunter, being smart, decided he would have to trap the monster to kill it, figuring he would get eaten if he faced it head on.So he looked in his himalayan monster field book and found out that medicrins like sugar, so he ordered all the villagers to dig a deep hole and fill it with all the sugar in the village.Later that week, the medicrine came down to the village. When it went after it`s usual meal, it saw the pit of sugar, looked at it a moment, and then went after another villager.After the medicrin left, the chief called up the great hunter, and scolded the hunter for failing, but the hunter convinced the chief to give him another chance, and the chief agreed.The next day, the hunter looked back to his himalayan monster field book and found that medicrins like loons even more than sugar.So the great hunter went out, caught a loon, and placed it in the pit with the sugar. Now, it turns out that loons like sugar even more than medicrins, so the loon ate up all the sugar. So, a few days later the medicrine returned on time for it`s villager feast.But, as it was heading for the village, the medicrin saw the pit with the loon. The medicrin imediatly became hungry for loon, so it climbed down into the pit and at the loon. But, as soon as it finished the loon off, it fell over, deader than a doornail.The moral of the story? A loon full of sugar helps the medecrin go down.</p>

5322,"<p>Veteran Pillsbury spokesman, Pop N. Fresh, died yesterday of a severe yeast infection. He was 71. Known to friends as ""Brown-n-Serve,"" Fresh was an avid gardener and tennis player.</p>
<p>Fresh was buried in one of the largest funeral ceremonies in recent years. Dozens of celebrities turned out including Mrs. Butterworth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Aunt Jemima, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Skippy.</p>
<p>The graveside was piled high with flours as longtime friend, Aunt Jemima, delivered the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who ""never knew how much he was kneaded.""</p>
<p>Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with many turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes -- conned by those who buttered him up.</p>
<p>Still, even as a crusty old man, he was a roll model for millions. He  enjoyed being prodded by his many friends who invariably poked fun at him.</p>
<p>Fresh is survived by his second wife. They have two children and another bun in the oven.</p>
<p>The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.</p>

5325,"<p>One day, John's tennis elbow was acting up and he decided to stop in and see a doctor. When he got to the doctor's office the nurse told him he could see the doctor in 15 minutes but, first he'd have to give a urine sample. John said that this was absurd but, the nurse insisted and John complied. 15 minutes later, John was ushered in to see the doctor.</p>
<p>""So that tennis elbow is really acting up, huh?"" the doctor said.</p>
<p>""The nurse must have told you,"" said John, wondering how the Doctor knew.</p>
<p>""No. It was in your urinalysis."" and the doctor continued to say that he had just purchased this new machine that could diagnose every physical condition with total accuracy based on the urine contents.  John didn't believe a word of this but he did agree to provide another urine sample on check-up visit.</p>
<p>Two days later, John was sitting at the kitchen table with his wife and his teenage daughter. He was telling them about this ridiculous machine. When John decided to have a little fun with the doctor. John pissed in the bottle as did his wife and teenage daughter. Then while walking to his garage he had a brainstorm. John put a few drops of oil from his crankcase in the jar and finally beat off and put a few drops of semen in the jar. He drove to the doctors office, shook the bottle, then handed it to the nurse. This time his urinalysis took half an hour. Finally, John was ushered in to see the doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor looked at him and said, ""I've got some bad news, smartass. Your daughter is pregnant, your wife's got V. D., your car is about to throw a rod, and if you don't stop beating off, that tennis elbow is never gonna heal!""</p>

5330,"<p>Dear Friend, </p>
<p>It is with the saddest heart that I pass on the following news. Please join me in remembering a great icon - the veteran Pillsbury Spokesman. The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and complications from repeated pokes in the belly. He was 71. </p>
<p>Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies and Captain Crunch. The gravesite was piled high with flours. </p>
<p>Long time friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very ""smart"" cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he still, as a crusty old man, was considered a roll model for millions. Toward the end it was thought he would rise again, but alas, he was no tart. </p>
<p>Doughboy is survived by his wife, Play Dough, two children, John Dough and Jane Dough, plus one in the oven. He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart. </p>
<p>The funeral was held at 3:50 for about twenty minutes.</p>

The guy said, 'Can I borrow your eyebrow pencil?' Cindy looked at him a little funny, but said, 'Sure, you can borrow my eyebrow pencil.' The guy then said, 'Do you mind if I use the eyebrow pencil to draw a moustache on you?' Cindy is getting a little worried, but says, 'Okay.' Then the guy said, 'Can you wear some of my guy clothing, I need for you to look more like a man.' Cindy is getting a little disappointed at this point, but says, 'Well I guess so.' Then the guy says to Cindy, 'Do you mind if I call you Fred?' Cindy, very dejected, says, 'I guess not.' So, the guy reaches out and grabs Cindy by the arms and says, 'Fred, you won't believe who I've been sleeping with these past four months!'</p>

5362,"<p>Fresh off of the Associated Press Wire...<br /> AP - Monica Lewinsky, in a statement released today, countered President<br /> Clinton's firm denial:<br /> ""I have had enough. This whole experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth,<br /> and I can't stomach any more. I feel as if I am getting the shaft, that this<br /> ugly matter has come to a head and blown up in my face.<br /> ""This may be a load to handle, but when things are hard, that is when I am at<br /> my best. I have faced hard things in the past, and I know what is coming. I will<br /> meet this challenge the only way I know how: head on.<br /> ""I have licked bigger things than this before, and I will again. No one will<br /> ever be able to say that Monica Lewinsky isn't a finisher, that she quit before<br /> the job was done. I will work non-stop and fight this, blow by blow, until I am<br /> wiped clean of this dirty affair. I will not be stained by it.<br /> ""Thank you.""<br /> Monica Lewinsky.</p>

La leona, que era la madrota, se burla de la boa diciendo que estaba muy maltratada en comparaci�n con sus putitas como la loba, la pantera, la avestruz, etc. Fue tanto el rogar de la boa que la leona le dio trabajo, y le dijo que se enredara en un �rbol para ver si ca�a alg�n desesperado.</p>
<p>Pasada la media noche, lleg� el conejo dici�ndole a la leona que quer�a echar pata. La leona le aclar� que todas estaban ocupadas pero que ten�a una nueva, que la probara y que luego le dijera que tal hab�a estado.</p>
<p>El conejo se fue corriendo a buscar a la boa. Cuando la boa lo ve venir, de un solo bocado se lo traga, ya que estaba fam�lica. Entonces, se queda pensando un rato y decide escupirlo ya que si se lo tragaba, la leona la iba a matar.</p>

"
5390,"<p>Why are men such jerks?<br /> It's a testosterone thing. Much similar to your PMS thing, we men suffer from testosterone poisoning. Why do you think the average lifespan of a male is typically 10 years shorter (and it's not just from all the bitching and nagging we have to endure)? Hormone modifies behavior. We're just misunderstood. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men always have to ogle at other women?<br /> Again, this is a testosterone thing. Do you honestly think that all the testosterone just fell out of our bodies the moment we met you? Besides, women do it as well. Women are just much better at not getting caught. I'm fairly certain it's some sort of photographic memory deal. Women take one quick look and memorize it for later reference. Since men lack this ability, we try to burn it into our memory by staring as much as we can. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men always touch themselves, especially in public?<br /> We occasionally need to adjust our little friend and make him happy. It's much like adjusting your bra. Being in public is just an added bonus. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men always say such stupid things?<br /> We like to. It's actually a whole lot of fun to see our partner frustrated by a few simple (and well chosen) words. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why are men so uncommunicative?<br /> You'd learn to keep your big mouth shut too if every time you open it you get into trouble with your partner. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men have to act like such retards?<br /> Well, we don't actually have to; we do it because we enjoy it. It's the old fashioned pride in a job well done that's missing in so much of the world nowadays. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why can't men just share their feelings?<br /> Do we look like women to you? Why is it so hard to understand that men and women are different? How are we supposed to share how we feel when we have no idea how we feel? Unless we're experiencing some extreme emotion like rage, hatred, disgust, or a brick on our foot, we have no idea how we feel. Personally, I get a headache whenever I try to figure out how I feel. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why can't men cuddle more (i.e. lie down and hug)?<br /> Please... How many hours do you think there is in a day? We oblige you as much as we can, but who the heck (besides women) can stand lying around for hours on end? We men... Men hunters... Need go roam... Starve in cave... Must go find wildebeest... Now sitting on our asses for hours on end on the other hand is a whole other story. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> How can men sit on their asses all day without moving?<br /> Men have very powerful sets of sitting muscles developed by evolution that enable us to sit for extended periods of time without getting tired. In prehistoric times, it was often necessary to sit in one spot for extended periods of time while hunting for prey. The more successful hunters were able to sit very still for very extended periods of time thereby passing on this ability to their progeny. The figgidy types were all gobbled up by saber toothed tigers etcetera. The end result is that almost all modern men are born with this innate ability. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why can't men just say ""I love you?""<br /> Men are taught from a tender young age to be self- sufficient. To say that we love you is equivalent to saying that we need you. Most men consider that a character fault. It's not easy to admit to one's own character faults. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why do men say ""I love you"" when they hardly know me?<br /> Ho, Ho, Ho... Aren't you special? Well, some men think it's a sure fire way to get into your pants. Surprisingly, it actually still works quite well. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> What does it mean when men say ""I Love You?""<br /> 1 Pleas 2 I'm sorry for whatever i 3 I forgot to get you a gift; this 4 Huh? I'm sorry; I w 5 What did I forget? This should buy m 6 7 What do I have to do to get a beer around here? </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Why doesn't my partner ever answer me?<br /> We just simply don't have the energy to answer every single one of your questions. If we think we do not have the answer, or that you will not like the answer, we simply remain quiet and save the energy for other things.</p>

5413,"<p>Everyday I give thanks to God,        I have two mounds upon my bod.         I shave my legs,     sit down to pee,         I can justify any shopping spree.   Don't go to a barber,       but a beauty salon,         Can get a massage, without a hard-on.         Can balance the checkbook,     can pump my own gas,         Can talk to my friends about the size of my ass.     My beauty's a masterpiece, and yes,     it takes long,         At least I can admit to others when I'm wrong.         I don't drive in circles at any cost,         And I don't have a problem admitting I'm lost.         Don't act like I'm in a timed marathon,         Every time I have to go to the john.         I don't brag about the size of my ""cup"",         Hey, put the seat down,     'cause I won't leave it up!     I never forget an important date,         You just gotta deal,      I'm usually late.         I don't watch movies with lots of gore,         Don't need instant replay to remember the score.         I won't lose my hair,         I don't get jock itch.         And just cause I'm assertive,     Don't call me a bitch.         I don't wear the same underwear everyday,     The food in my fridge has no sign of decay.     Don't burp, don't belch and I certainly don't fart,         Ballet, not football, is what I consider an art.     Don't say to your friends,     ""Oh yeah, I can get her"",         In your dreams, my dear, I can do better!     Flowers are okay,     but jewelry's best,        Would you look at my face,     not at my chest!       I don't have a problem expressing my feelings,         I know when you're lying,         you look at the ceiling.     Don't call me a girl,         a babe or a chick,         I am a WOMAN, get it,         you prick?     Let me tell all you men,     Listen to me boys,        Those things in your pants,         That you treat as toys     You love them more then we ever will         We would rather suck on a cold pickled dill.       I know all you men         Think that you're ""IT"",         But compared to a woman,         You just ain't SHIT!</p>

5414,"<p>Bill Gates dies in a car accident. He finds himself in purgatory, being sized up by St. Peter. ""Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before in your case; I'm going to let you decide where you want to go.""Bill replied, ""well, what's the difference between the two?"" St. Peter said, ""I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision.""""Fine, but where should I go first?""""I'll leave that up to you.""""Okay then,"" said Bill, Let's try Hell first.""So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of bikini-clad women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun was shining; the temperature perfect. He was very pleased. ""This is great!"" he told St. Peter. ""If this is hell, I REALLY want to see heaven!""""Fine,"" said St. Peter, and off they went.Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision. ""Hmmm. I think I'd prefer Hell,"" he told St. Peter.""Fine,"" retorted St. Peter, ""as you desire.""So Bill Gates went to Hell. Two weeks later, St. Peter decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall, screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned and tortured by demons. ""How's everything going?"" he asked Bill.Bill responded, with his voice filled with anguish and disappointment, ""This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the beautiful beaches, the scantily-clad women playing in the water?""""That was a demo,"" replied St. Peter.</p>

5418,"<p>A lawyer died and appeared at the Pearly Gates at the exact same time as<br /> the Pope, who just also happened to die that very day.</p>
<p>Upon their arrival an angel appears and announces ""Please come with me. I<br /> will show you where you will spend eternity.""</p>
<p>They follow the angel and soon come to a run down, ramshackle cabin that<br /> looks like it will fall over in the next big wind. The angel tells the<br /> Pope ""This is where you will live from now on.""</p>
<p>The Pope quietly goes inside and the angel and the lawyer continue along<br /> their way.</p>
<p>Soon they come to this gorgeous mansion in the clouds. It's a spectacular<br /> example of the finest workmanship available in Heaven with a view from<br /> here to eternity. The angel tells the lawyer ""This is where you will live<br /> from now on.""</p>

And when you ask ""Honey, were you looking at her?"" he'll honestly be able to say that he didn't even see her. </p>

5428,"<p>Two different theories exist concerning the origin of children: the theory of sexual reproduction, and the theory of the stork.</p>
<p>Many people believe in the theory of sexual reproduction because they have been taught this theory at school. In reality, however, many of the world's leading scientists are in favour of the theory of the stork.</p>
<p>If the theory of sexual reproduction is taught in schools, it must only be taught as a theory and not as the truth. Alternative theories, such as the theory of the stork, must also be taught.</p>
<p>Evidence supporting the theory of the stork includes the following:</p>
<p>1. It is a scientifically established fact that the stork does exist. This can be confirmed by every ornithologist.</p>
<p>2. The alledged human foetal development contains several features that the theory of sexual reproduction is unable to explain.</p>
<p>3. The theory of sexual reproduction implies that a child is approximately nine months old at birth. This is an absurd claim.  Everyone knows that a newborn child is newborn.</p>
<p>4. According to the theory of sexual reproduction, children are a result of sexual intercourse. There are, however, several well-documented cases where sexual intercourse has not led to the birth of a child.</p>
<p>5. Statistical studies in the Netherlands have indicated a positive correlation between the birth rate and the number of storks. Both are decreasing.</p>
<p>6. The theory of the stork can be investigated by rigorous scientific methods. The only assumption involved is that children are delivered by the stork.</p>

<p>The priest says, ""Well my son, say 3 Hail Mary's and your sins will be forgiven."" </p>
<p>The guy however was quite eager to explain to the priest why he had used the F-word and grudgingly the priest agreed to listen to his explanation. </p>
<p>""Well I was playing golf last Sunday instead of coming to church,"" said the guy. </p>
<p>""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked. </p>
<p>""No,"" the guy replied. ""I was on the first tee and I duck hooked my drive into this terrible rough."" </p>
<p>""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked. </p>
<p>""No,"" the guy replied getting quite annoyed with the constant interruptions to his story. ""My ball took a lucky kick out of the rough and I was left with a perfect shot to the green."" </p>
<p>""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked. </p>
<p>""No,"" the guy said. ""As I went to play my ball a squirrel grabbed it and took off with it."" </p>
<p>""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked. </p>
<p>""No,"" the guy replied. ""As the squirrel was running away with my ball an eagle swooped down on it and took off with the squirrel and my ball."" </p>
<p>""Is that why you said the F-word?"" the priest asked. </p>
<p>""No,"" the guy replied. ""The eagle dropped the squirrel over the green and the ball rolled out of its mouth and finished 5 inches from the hole."" </p>

She judges them to be in the early twenties. ""Okay,"" she says.After they have gone to bed for the night the woman begins to get a little horny just thinking about the two boys in the room next to her. So she quietly goes into their room and says, ""Boys, how would you like for me to teach you the ways of the world?""They say, ""Huh?""She says, ""The only thing is, I don't want to get pregnant, so you have to wear these rubbers."" She puts them on the boys, and the three of them go at it all night long.Forty years later Jed and Luke are sitting on the front porch, rocking back and forth.

5497,"<p>Here are some basic descriptions of what may happen if airplanes had different operating systems running them.DOS: Everybody pushes it till it glides, then jumps on and lets it coast till it skids, then jumps off, pushes, jumps back on, etc.DOS with QEMM:  Same as DOS, but with more leg room for pushing.Macintosh:  All the flight attendants, captains and baggage handlers look the same, act the same and talk the same.  Every time you ask a question, you are told you don't need to know, don't want to know and everything will be done for you without your knowing, so just shut up.OS/2:  To get on board, you have to have your ticket stamped 10 different times by standing in 10 different lines.  Then you fill out a form asking how you want your seating arranged--with the look and feel of an ocean liner, a passenger train or a bus.  If you get on board and off the ground, you will have a wonderful trip, except when the rudder and flaps freeze, in which case you have time to say your prayers before you crash.Windows:  Colorful airport terminal, friendly flight attendants, easy access to a plane, and an uneventful takeoff. Then, all in a sudden, boom! You blow up without any warning whatsoever.NT: The terminal and flight attendants all look like those the Windows plane uses, but the process of checking in and going through security is a nightmare. Once aboard, those passengers with first class tickets can go anywhere they want and arrive in half the time, while the vast majority of passengers with coach tickets can't even get aboard.Unix:  Everyone brings one piece of the plane.  Then they go on the runway and piece it together, all the while arguing about what kind of plane they're building.CAIRO: The airplane is distributed among 47 different hangars in 13 airports scattered over 8 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and a remote mountain hideaway in Nicaragua. But you don't need to know where the airplane is or who it belongs to in order to fly it. Actually, you don't fly the airplane itself; you fly a simulation that behaves just like the real thing except that you don't go anywhere. But that's okay, because when the world is at your fingertips you never need to leave home.</p>

5498,"<p>CAMBRIDGE, MA -- A team of MIT physicists announced Monday that they have successfully split the smithereen, heretofore considered the smallest possible unit of matter.  ""For decades, conventional scientific wisdom held that the most to which you could blow something was smithereens,"" Dr. Jonathan Eng said.  ""It now appears that it is possible, under certain special laboratory conditions, to blow something to sub-smithereens.""Eng said he believes the discovery will revolutionize humanity's potential for harnessing smithereenetic energy.</p>

5566,"<p>Editor's Note:  It's dry parody.  You gotta really like sci-fi to enjoy this one...-------------------------------------------------------Experiment 8 Postflight Summary NASA publication 14-307-1792-------------------------------------------------------ABSTRACTThe purpose of this experiment was to prepare for the expected participation in long-term space based research by husband-wife teams once the US space station is in place. To this end, the investigators explored a number of possible approaches to continued marital relations in the zero-G orbital environment provided by the XXXXXX shuttle mission.Our primary conclusion is that satisfactory marital relations are within the realm of possibility in zero-G, but that many couples would have difficulty getting used to the approaches we found to be most satisfactory.-------------------------------------------------------INTRODUCTION The number of married couples currently involved in proposals for long- term projects on the US space station has grown considerably in recent years. This raises the serious question of how such couples will be able to carry out normal marital relations without the aid of gravity.Preliminary studies in the short-term weightless environment provided by aircraft flying on ballistic trajectories were sufficient to demonstrate that there were problems, but the duration of the zero-G environment on such flights is too short to reach any satisfactory conclusions. Similar experiments undertaken in a neutral buoyancy tank were equally inconclusive because of the awkwardness of the breathing equipment.The primary conclusion that could be drawn from these early experiments was that the conventional approach to marital relationships (sometimes described as the missionary approach) is highly dependent on gravity to keep the partners together. This observation lead us to propose the set of tests known as STS-75 Experiment 8.-------------------------------------------------------METHODOLOGYThe co-investigators had exclusive use of the lower deck of the shuttle XXXXXXXX for 10 intervals of 1 hour each during the orbital portion of the flight. A resting period of a minimum of 4 hours was included in the schedule between intervals. During each interval, the investigators erected a pneumatic sound deadening barrier between the lower deck and the flight deck (see NASA publication 12-571-3570) and carried out one run of the experiment.Each experimental run was planned in advance to test one approach to the problem. We made extensive use of a number of published sources in our efforts to find satisfactory solutions see Appendix I), arriving at an initial list of 20 reasonable solutions. Of these, we used computer simulation (using the mechanical dynamics simulation package from the CADSI company) to determine the 10 most promising solutions.Six solutions utilized mechanical restraints to simulate the effect of gravity, while the others utilized only the efforts of the experimenters to solve the problem. Mechanical and unassisted runs were alternated, and each experimental run was videotaped for later analysis. Immediately after each run, the experimenters separately recorded their observations, and then jointly reviewed the videotapes and recorded joint observations.The sensitive nature of the videotapes and first-hand observations pre- cludes a public release of the raw data. The investigators have pre- pared this paper to summarize their results, and they intend to release a training videotape for internal NASA use, constructed from selected segments of the videotapes and additional narrative material.The following summary is organized in two sections; the first covers the mechanical solutions, while the second covers the ""natural"" approaches. Each solution is described briefly, and then followed by a brief summary of the result. Some summaries are combined.-------------------------------------------------------SUMMARY OF RESULTS1) An elastic belt around the waist of the two    partners. The partners faced each other in the    standard or missionary posture.Entry was difficult and once it was achieved, it was difficult to maintain. With the belt worn around the hips, entry was easy, but it was difficult to obtain the necessary thrusting motion; as a result, this approach was not satisfactory.2) Elastic belts around the thighs of the two partners.    The female's buttocks were against the groin of the    male, with her back against his chest.An interesting experiment, but ultimately unsatisfactory because of the difficulty of obtaining the necessary thrusting motion.3) An elastic belt binding the thighs of the female to    the waist of the male. The female's buttocks were    against the male's groin, while her knees straddled    his chest.Of the approaches tried with an elastic belt, this was by far the most satisfactory. Entry was difficult, but after the female discovered how to lock her toes over the male's thighs, it was found that she could obtain the necessary thrusting motions. The male found that his role was unusually passive but pleasant.One problem both partners noticed with all three elastic belt solutions was that they reminded the partners of practices sometimes associated with bondage, a subject that neither found particularly appealing. For couples who enjoy such associations, however, and especially for those who routinely enjoy female superior relations, this solution should be recommended.4) An inflatable tunnel enclosing and pressing the    partners together. The partners faced each other in    the standard missionary posture. The tunnel enclosed    the partners roughly from the knees to waist and    pressed them together with an air pressure of    approximately 0.01 standard atmospheres.Once properly aroused, the uniform pressure obtained from the tunnel was sufficient to allow fairly normal marital relations, but getting aroused while in the tunnel was difficult, and once aroused outside the tunnel, getting in was difficult. This problem made the entire approach largely unusable.5) The same inflatable tunnel used in run 4, but    enclosing the partners legs only. The partners faced    each other in the missionary position.6) The same inflatable tunnel used in run 4, but with    the partners in the posture used for run 2.Foreplay was satisfactory with both approaches; in the second case, we found that it could be accomplished inside the tunnel, quite unlike our experience with run 4. Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve entry with either approach.A general disadvantage of the inflatable tunnel approach was that the tunnel itself tended to get sticky with sweat and other discharges. We feel that the difficulty of keeping a tunnel clean in zero-G makes these solutions most unsatisfactory.7) The standard missionary posture, augmented by having    the female hook her legs around the male's thighs    and both partners hug each other.8) The posture used in run 3, but with the female    holding herself against the male by gripping his    buttocks with her heels.Initially, these were very exciting and promising approaches, but as the runs approached their climaxes, an unexpected problem arose. One or the one or the other partner tended to let go, and the hold provided by the remaining partner was insufficient to allow continued thrusts. We think that partners with sufficient self-control might be able to use these positions, but we found them frustrating.9) The posture used in run 2, but with the male using    his hands to hold the female while the female used    her heels to hold the male's thighs.Most of the responsibility for success rested on the male here, and we were successful after a series of false starts, but we did not find the experience to be particularly rewarding.10) Each partner gripping the other's head between    their thighs and hugging the other's hips with their    arms.This was the only run involving non-procreative marital relations, and it was included largely because it provided the greatest number of distinct ways for each partner to hold the other. This 4 points redundant hold was good enough that we found this solution to be most satisfactory. In fact, it was more rewarding than analogous postures used in a gravitational field.-------------------------------------------------------RECOMMENDATIONWe recommend that married couples considering maintaining their marital relations during a space mission be provided with an elastic belt such as we used for run 3 (see Appendix II). In addition, we advise that a training program be developed that recommends the solutions used in runs 3 and 10 and warns against the problems encountered in runs 7 and 8.We recognize that any attempt by NASA to recommend approaches to marital relationships will be politically risky, but we feel that, especially in cases where long missions are planned, thought be given to screening couples applying to serve on such missions for their ability to accept or adapt to the solutions used in runs 3 and 10.------------------------------------------------------- NASA Contractor Report 3490A University of (NAME DELETED)IntroductionSupport for the commonsensical observation that male/female subjects can conduct normal marital relations in a zero G environment with mechanical assistance has been deemed feasible based on the experiments outlined in reports NASW-xxxx, NAS1-xxxx, and NASW-xxxx.-------------------------------------------------------MethodThe adaptation of current experiments in artificial eye-hand coordination through application of neural networks coupled with on going cooperating redundant wrist manipulators was performed. The basic paradigm involved attaching each subject to a manipulator and coordinating the motion of the subjects through a two hidden-layer back-error propagation neural network. The output of the neural network stage was fed into a backward- chaining rule based system in order to achieve optimal control of the manipulators. Two different configurations were tested. The first setting involved the application of a single hold manipulator attached via a rigid waist device. The second configuration, believed to be more stable, involved attachment via three bands that can be arranged in different configurations in order to match the local differences of the particular subjects.Attachment of the subjects to the harness was achieved through an electrically excited velcro-like coupling, VELEE-2, see reference NASW- 5641. This arrangement allowed the subject to experiment with different attachment points via vocal command to the manipulators' control system.-------------------------------------------------------ConclusionThe effectiveness of the system was validated through twelve experiments. During the course of these experiments it was determined that the use of the redundant manipulator allowed for single subject use of the system as a unisexual device. We believe that this could be of great importance for long duration flights were the subject can not find a suitable partner or the availability of a opposite configured SO is limited.</p>

5616,"<p>A hippie gets onto a bus and proceeds to sit next to a Nun in the front seat.<br /> The Hippie looks over and asks the Nun if she would have sex with him. </p>
<p>The Nun surprised by the question politely declines and gets of at the next<br /> stop. </p>
<p>When the bus starts on it's way the bus driver says to the hippie, ""if you<br /> want I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you."" </p>
<p>The hippie of course says that he'd love to know so the bus driver tells him<br /> that the every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery to pray<br /> to the lord. ""If you went dressed in robes and some glowing powder,"" said the<br /> bus driver (male), ""you could tell her you were God and command her to have sex<br /> with you."" </p>
<p>Well the Hippie decides to try this out so that Tuesday he goes to the<br /> cemetery and waits for the nun and right on schedule the nun shows up. When<br /> she's in the middle of praying the hippie walks out from hiding, in robes and<br /> glowing with a mask of god. ""I am God, I have heard your prayers and I will<br /> answer them but you must have sex with me first."" </p>
<p>The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. The<br /> hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about to go to work on the nun. After the<br /> Hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, ""Ha ha, I'm the hippie!!"" </p>
<p>The nun replied by whipping off her mask and shouting, ""Ha ha, I'm the bus<br /> driver!!!""</p>

5619,"<p>A man has been in business for many, many years and the business is going<br /> down the drain. He is seriously contemplating suicide and he doesn't know<br /> what to do. He goes to the priest to seek his advice. He tells the priest<br /> about all of his problems in the business and asks the priest what he should<br /> do.</p>
<p>The priest says, ""Take a beach chair and a bible and put them in your car<br /> and drive down to the edge of the ocean. Go to the water's edge. Take the<br /> beach chair out of the car, sit on it and take the Bible out and open it up.<br /> The wind will rifle the pages for a while and eventually the Bible will stay<br /> open at a particular page. Read the Bible and it will tell you what to do.""</p>
<p>The man does as he is told. He places a beach chair and a Bible in his car<br /> and drives down to the beach. He sits on the chair at the water's edge and<br /> opens the Bible. The wind rifles the pages of the Bible and then stops at a<br /> particular page. He looks down at the Bible and sees what he has to do.</p>
<p>Three months later the man and his family come back to see the priest. The<br /> man is wearing a $1,000 Italian suit, his wife is all decked out with a<br /> full-length mink coat and the child is dressed in beautiful silk. The man<br /> hands the priest a thick envelope full of money and tells him that he wants<br /> to donate this money to the church in order to thank the priest for his<br /> wonderful advice. The priest is delighted. He recognizes the man and asks<br /> him what advice in the bible brought this good fortune to him.</p>

5626,"<p>There were these three Eskimos in Alaska, and one time while they were at their local bar, they got to talking about how cold it was outside, and how cold their igloos were. They could agree on everything but whose igloo was the coldest, so they decided to determine who, indeed, had the coldest igloo.</p>
<p>They went to the first Eskimo's igloo, where he said ""Watch this!"" and poured a cup of water into the air. Well, the water froze in mid-air and fell onto the floor. ""Not bad"" said the other Eskimos, but each maintained their igloo was colder still.</p>
<p>So they went to the second Eskimo's igloo, and he said ""Watch this!"" and took a big breath and exhaled, whereupon his breath froze into a big lump and fell to the floor. </p>
<p>""Wow, that's colder than mine!"" said the first Eskimo. But the third Eskimo exclaimed his was colder still.</p>
<p>So they ended up at the third Eskimo's igloo. He said ""Watch this!"" and went into the bedroom, threw back the thick furs, and retrieved one of several small balls of ice there. He took it, put it in a spoon, and held a match under it.</p>
<p>When it heated up enough, it went ""FFFAAAARRRRTTT"". He won!</p>

5640,"<p>In a certain suburban neighborhood, there were two brothers, 8<br /> and 10 years old, who were exceedingly mischievious. Whenever<br /> something went wrong in the neighborhood, it turned out they had<br /> a hand in it. Their parents were at their wits' end trying to<br /> control them. Hearing about a minister nearby who worked with<br /> delinquent boys, the mother suggested to the father that they<br /> ask the minister to talk with the boys. The father agreed. </p>
<p> The mother went to the minister and made her request. He<br /> agreed, but said he wanted to see the younger boy first and<br /> alone. So the mother sent him to the minister. The minister sat<br /> the boy down on the other side of his huge, impressive desk. For<br /> about five minutes they just sat and stared at each other. </p>
<p>Finally, the minister pointed his forefinger at the boy and<br /> asked, ""Where is God?"" </p>
<p>The boy looked under the desk, in the corners of the room, all<br /> around, but said nothing. </p>
<p>Again, louder, the minister pointed at the boy and asked, ""Where<br /> is God?"" </p>
<p>Again the boy looked all around but said nothing. </p>
<p>A third time, in a louder, firmer voice, the minister leaned far<br /> across the desk and put his forefinger almost to the boy's nose,<br /> and asked ""Where is God?"" </p>
<p>The boy panicked and ran all the way home. Finding his older<br /> brother, he dragged him upstairs to their room and into the<br /> closet, where they usually plotted their mischief. He finally<br /> said, ""We are in B-I-I-I-I-G trouble now!"" </p>
<p>The older boy asked, ""What do you mean, B-I-I-I-I-G trouble?"" </p>

5668,"<p>There was a 10 year old boy, who's left arm was damaged in an accident and subsequently amputated. He decided to learn judo. His Sensei (teacher) was an old Chinese judo expert. The boy learned quickly. After three months, he had learned only one move. He asked his teacher to teach him more moves. The Sensei told him that this was all he would need.Soon after, the boy entered a tournament, where he quickly advanced to the finals, where his opponent was bigger and more experienced. The boy seemed very out matched. After a long match, the opponent seemed to loose concentration. Quickly the boy took advantage and pinned what seemed to be his superior opponent. On the ride home, the boy asked his Sensei.""How could I win with only one move?""The Sensei replied, ""You have nearly mastered one of the most difficult moves in all of judo. And, the only defence against that move, is for your opponent to grab your left arm.""</p>

5736,"<p>Santa Claus is a woman....I hate to be the one to defy sacred myth, but I believe he's a she. Think about it. Christmas is a big, organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing social deal, and I have a tough time believing a guy could possibly pull it all off!</p>
<p>For starters, the vast majority of men don't even think about selecting gifts until Christmas Eve. Once at the mall, they always seem surprised to find only Ronco products, socket wrench sets, and mood rings left on the shelves.  On this count alone, I'm convinced Santa is a woman.</p>
<p>Surely, if he were a man, everyone in the universe would wake up Christmas morning to find a rotating musical Chia Pet under the tree, still in the bag.</p>
<p>Another problem for a he-Santa would be getting there.  First of all, there would be no reindeer because they would all be dead, gutted and strapped on to the rear bumper of the sleigh amid wide-eyed, desperate claims that buck season had been extended.  Blitzen's rack would already be on the way to the taxidermist.</p>
<p>Even if the male Santa DID have reindeer, he'd still have transportation problems because he would inevitably get lost up there in the snow and clouds and then refuse to stop and ask for directions.</p>
<p>Other reasons why Santa can't possibly be a man:</p>
<p>Men can't pack a bag.</p>
<p>Men would rather be dead than caught wearing red velvet.</p>
<p>Men would feel their masculinity is threatened having to be seen with all those elves.</p>
<p>Men don't answer their mail.</p>
<p>Men would refuse to allow their physique to be described even in jest as anything remotely resembling a ""bowlful of jelly.""</p>
<p>Men aren't interested in stockings unless somebody's wearing them.</p>
<p>Having to do the Ho Ho Ho thing would seriously inhibit their ability to pick up women.</p>
<p>Finally, being responsible for Christmas would require a commitment!</p>

<p>Amid roaring engines, squealing of tires and lots of smoke, the plane screeched to a halt 2 cm from the end of the runway, much to the relief of Paddy and Gerry and everyone on board.</p>

5788,"<p>My friend is a rather old-fashioned lady, always quite delicate and elegant,<br /> especially in language. She and her husband were planning a trip to Florida so<br /> she wrote to a campground they planned to visit and asked for a reservation. She<br /> wanted to make sure that the campground was fully equipped, but didn't quite<br /> know how to ask about the toilet facilities. She just couldn't bring herself to<br /> write the word ""toilet"" in her letter. </p>
<p>After much deliberation, she finally came up with the old fashion term<br /> ""bathroom commode."" But when she wrote that down, she still thought she was<br /> being too forward, so she rewrote the letter and reffered to the bathroom comode<br /> simply as the ""B.C."" </p>
<p>      ""Does the campground have its own B.C.?"" is what she actually wrote. </p>
<p>Well, the campground owner wasn't old-fashioned at all, and when he got the<br /> letter, he just couldn't figure out what the woman was talking about!<br /> That ""B.C."" buisness really stumped him. After worrying about it for awhile,<br /> he showed the letter to several campers, and they couldn't imagine what the lady<br /> meant, either. So, after coming to the conclusion that the lady must be asking<br /> about the location of the local Baptist church, the owner sat down and wrote the<br /> following reply: </p>
<p>""Dear Madam, </p>
<p>      I regret very much the delay in answering your letter, but I now take<br /> the pleasure of informing you that a B.C. is located 9 miles north of the<br /> campground and is capable of seating 250 people at one time.<br />       It is located in a beautiful pine grove and is open only on Sundays and<br /> Wednesdays. I admit it is quite a distance away if you are in the habit of going<br /> regularly, but no doubt you will be pleased to know that a great number of<br /> people take their lunches along and make a day of it. They usually arrive early<br /> and stay late.<br />       My daughter met her husband at the B.C. The last time my wife and I went<br /> was six years ago, and it was so crowded we had to stand the whole time we were<br /> there. Sometimes it is so crowded that there are five to a seat. It may interest<br /> you to know that there is a supper planned to raise money to buy more seats.<br /> They are going to hold it in the basement of the B.C.<br />       I would like to say it pains me very much not to be able to go more<br /> regularly, but it is surely not do to lack of desire on my part. As we grow<br /> older it seems to be more of an effort, particularly in the cold weather.<br />       ""If you decide to come down to our campground, perhaps I could go with<br /> you.</p>

You should never say anything to a woman that even  remotely suggests you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her at that moment. The most powerful force in the universe is gossip. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we all believe that we are above-average drivers. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to make a big deal about your birthday. That time is age 11. There is a very fine line between ""hobby"" and ""mental illness."" If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that  word would be ""meetings."" If there really is a God who created the entire universe with all of its glories, and he decides to deliver a message to humanity, he will not use as his  messenger a person on cable TV with a bad hairdo. Living on Earth is expensive, but it does include a free trip around the sun. Follow your dream -- unless it's the one where you go to work in your underwear. The one thing that separates us from the animals is that we're not afraid of vacuum cleaners. When trouble arises and things look bad, there is always one individual who perceives a solution and is willing to take command. Very often, that person  is crazy.</p>

5805,"<p>Darwin Award Winner for 1997 Announced</p>
<p>You all know about the Darwin Awards - It's an annual honor given to<br /> the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing<br /> themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way.</p>
<p>The 1995 winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which<br /> toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out<br /> of it.</p>
<p>In 1996 the winner was an air force sergeant who attached a JATO unit<br /> to his car and crashed into a cliff several hundred feet above the<br /> roadbed.</p>
<p>And now, the 1997 winner:  Larry Waters of Los Angeles -- one of the few<br /> Darwin winners to survive his award-winning accomplishment.  Larry's<br /> boyhood dream was to fly.  When he graduated from high school, he<br /> joined the Air Force in hopes of becoming a pilot.  Unfortunately, poor<br /> eyesight disqualified him.  When he was finally discharged, he had to<br /> satisfy himself with watching jets fly over his backyard.</p>
<p>One day, Larry, had a bright idea.  He decided to fly.  He went to the<br /> local Army-Navy surplus store and purchased 45 weather balloons and<br /> several tanks of helium.  The weather balloons, when fully inflated,<br /> would measure more than four feet across.</p>
<p>Back home, Larry securely strapped the balloons to his sturdy lawn<br /> chair. He anchored the chair to the bumper of his jeep and inflated the<br /> balloons with the helium.  He climbed on for a test while it was still<br /> only a few feet above the ground.</p>
<p>Satisfied it would work, Larry packed several sandwiches and a six-pack<br /> of Miller Lite, loaded his pellet gun-- figuring he could pop a few<br /> balloons when it was time to descend-- and went back to the floating<br /> lawn chair.</p>
<p>He tied himself in along with his pellet gun and provisions. Larry's<br /> plan was to lazily float up to a height of about 30 feet above his back<br /> yard after severing the anchor and in a few hours come back down.</p>
<p>Things didn't quite work out that way.</p>
<p>When he cut the cord anchoring the lawn chair to his jeep, he didn't<br /> float lazily up to 30 or so feet. Instead  he streaked into the LA sky<br /> as if shot from a cannon.  He didn't level off at 30 feet, nor did he<br /> level off at 100 feet.  After climbing and climbing, he leveled off at<br /> 11,000 feet. At that height he couldn't risk shooting any of the<br /> balloons, lest he unbalance the load and really find himself in<br /> trouble.  So he stayed there, drifting, cold and frightened, for more<br /> than 14 hours.</p>
<p>Then he really got in trouble. He found himself drifting into the the<br /> primary approach corridor of Los Angeles International Airport. A<br /> United pilot first spotted Larry.  He radioed the tower and described<br /> passing a guy in a lawn chair with a gun.  Radar confirmed the<br /> existence of an object floating 11,000 feet above the airport. LAX<br /> emergency procedures swung into full alert and a helicopter was<br /> dispatched to investigate. LAX is right on the ocean.  Night was<br /> falling and the offshore breeze began to flow.  It carried Larry out to<br /> sea with the helicopter in hot pursuit. Several miles out, the<br /> helicopter caught up with Larry.  Once the crew determined that Larry<br /> was not dangerous, they attempted to close in for a rescue but the<br /> draft from the blades would push Larry away whenever they neared.</p>
<p>Finally, the helicopter ascended to a position several hundred feet<br /> above Larry and lowered a rescue line. Larry snagged the line and was<br /> hauled back to shore.  The difficult maneuver was flawlessly executed by<br /> the helicopter crew.  As soon as Larry was hauled to earth, he was<br /> arrested by waiting members of the LAPD for violating LAX airspace.  As<br /> he was led away in handcuffs, a reporter dispatched to cover the daring<br /> rescue asked why he had done it. Larry stopped,turned and replied<br /> nonchalantly, ""A man can't just sit around.""</p>
<p>Let's hear it for Larry Waters, the 1997 Darwin Award Winner.</p>
"
5806,"<p>There was a middle-aged couple who had two stunningly beautiful blonde teenage daughters. The parents decided to try one last time for the son they always wanted. </p>
<p>After months of trying, the wife became pregnant, and sure enough, nine months later she delivered a healthy baby boy. The joyful father rushed to the nursery to see his new son. </p>
<p>He took one look and was horrified to see the ugliest child he had ever seen. He went to his wife and said that there was no way he could be the father of that child. </p>
<p>""Look at the two beautiful daughters I fathered.""<br /> Then he gave her a stern look and asked, ""Have you been fooling around on me?!"" </p>
<p>The wife just smiled sweetly and said, ""Not this time.""</p>
"
5807,"<p>Relationships:<br /> First of all, a man does not call a relationship a relationship - he refers to it as ""that time when me and Suzie were doing it on a semi-regular basis"".</p>
<p>When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled ""All Men Are Idiots"". Then she will get on with her life.</p>
<p>A man has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will call and say, ""I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I'll never forgive you, and I hate you, and you're a total floozy. But I want you to know that there's always a chance for us"". This is known as the ""I Hate You / I Love You"" drunken phone call, that 99% if all men have made at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need; alas, these classes rarely prove effective.</p>
<p>Admitting Mistakes:<br /> Women will sometimes admit making a mistake. The last man who admitted he was wrong was General George Custer.</p>
<p>Bathrooms:<br /> A man has six items in his bathroom: a toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream, razor, a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.<br /> Most men take only 2-3 minutes to relieve themselves. Women's Restrooms always have long lines.</p>
<p>Cameras:<br /> Men take photography very seriously. They'll shell out $4000 for state of the art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography classes. Women purchase Kodak Instamatics.  Of course, women always end up taking better pictures.</p>
<p>Cats:<br /> Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.</p>
<p>Cheerleaders:<br /> Female cheerleaders are cute, sexy, fresh, and all-American. Male<br /> cheerleaders are scary.</p>
<p>Comedy:<br /> Let's say a small group of men and women are in a room, watching television, and an episode of the Three Stooges comes on. Immediately, the men will get very excited; they will laugh uproariously, and even try to imitate the actions of Curly, man's favorite Stooge. The women will roll their eyes and groan and wait it out.</p>
<p>David Letterman:<br /> Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the Earth. Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always has a bad haircut.</p>
<p>Directions:<br /> If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings, she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions. Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. Men will never stop and ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, ""Looks like I've found a new way to get there."" and, ""I know I'm in the general neighborhood. I recognize that 7-11 store.""</p>
<p>Dressing Up:<br /> A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for: weddings, funerals.</p>
<p>Eating out:<br /> When the check comes, Mike, Dave, Rob and Jack will each throw in $20 bills, even though it's only for $22.50. None of them will have anything smaller, and none will actually admit they want change back. When the girls get their check, out come the pocket calculators.</p>
<p>Garages:<br /> Women use garages to park their cars and store their lawnmowers. Men use garages for many things. They hang license plates in garages, they watch TV in garages, and they build useless lopsided benches in garages.</p>
<p>Going Out:<br /> When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out. When a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she **will** be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her earring, finishes putting on her makeup...</p>
<p>Groceries:<br /> A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes to the store and buys these things. A man waits till the only items left in his fridge are half a lime and a beer. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time a man reached the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter that the Clampett's car on Beverly Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane.</p>
<p>Handwriting:<br /> To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken- scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their ""i's"" with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their ""p's"" and ""g's"". It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she's dumping you, she'll put a smiley face at the end of the note.</p>
<p>Hats:<br /> Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.</p>
<p>Jewelry:<br /> Women look nice when they wear jewelry. A man can get away with wearing one ring and that's it. Any more than that, and he will look like a lounge singer named Vic.</p>
<p>Laundry:<br /> Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul, and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old episodes of ""Love, American Style.""</p>
<p>Leg Warmers:<br /> Leg warmers are sexy. A woman, even if she's walking the dog or doing the dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers. She can wear them any time she wants. A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the ""Gimme the Ball"" number in ""A Chorus Line.""</p>
<p>Locker Rooms:<br /> In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one thing in the locker room, sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.</p>
<p>Low Blows:<br /> Let's say a man and woman are watching a boxing match on TV. One of the boxers is felled by a low blow. The woman says ""Oh, gee. That must have hurt."" The man groans and doubles over, and actually *feels* the pain.</p>
<p>Magazines:<br /> Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women's magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day. Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman's body. Most naked men elicit laughter from women.</p>
<p>Maturity:<br /> Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults. Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.</p>
<p>Menopause:<br /> When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree ofthese changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction; he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather drivin gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.</p>
<p>Mirrors:<br /> Men are vain; they will always check themselves out in a mirror.  Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe Garagiola's head.</p>
<p>Moustaches:<br /> Some men look good with moustaches. Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. There are no women who look good with moustaches.</p>
<p>Movies:<br /> Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.  This is because most movies in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh<br /> for the first time in ""Gone With the Wind"". For men, it's when Jimmy Cagney shoves grapefruit in May Clark's face in ""Public Enemy"".</p>
<p>Nicknames:<br /> With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like ""Ultimate Pecs"" and ""Big Turk,"" women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dave, Rob, and Jack go out for a brewsky, they will affectionately refer to each other as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.</p>
<p>Offspring:<br /> Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.</p>
<p>Plants:<br /> A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens.</p>
<p>Politics:<br /> Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such as voting. Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy's is growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign for them and cry on election night.</p>
<p>Restrooms:<br /> Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms associal lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other. Womenwho've never met will leave a restroom giggling together like old friends. And never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, ""Hey, Bob, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?</p>
<p>This difference may be due to the fact that women don't have to hold their genitals in the bathroom, which might make one feel self-conscious. Not having this problem, women can chat away quite comfortably while ""powdering their noses"". And yes, they are talking about men in their chats.</p>
<p>Another theory is that when women ""powder their noses"", all they have to do is sit there. What else is there for them to do but talk to other women. Men, however, must be much more attentive to such matters. If a male turns too much to talk to someone, he'll be leaking on his shoe. Men must be very serious and patient because heaven only knows if the stream of urine will suddenly change direction. And after all is done, men must try to remove any excess moisture unless he soils his underwear. And unlike women, there is no tissue paper nearby with which to wipe. A man must use his own skills at ""towel snapping"" to do the job. But no man wants to shake it forever because he might look like he's playing with himself. The shaking routine also varies culturally as most men inthe U.K. are 'pullers' as opposed to 'shakers'. Of course, no matter how much a man shakes or pulls, chances are still good that he'll get that little dribble down the leg, which will expand to the size of Lake Ontario if he is wearing synthetics.</p>
<p>After the shaking or pulling comes the tucking-it-all-back-in routine, where the male tries to not leave anything delicate in the path of the approaching zipper. As the men are all leaving the restroom, trying to button up their Levi's, they are still trying not to look as if they're playing with themselves. For a man, a trip to the bathroom is a very serious matter. You wouldn't gossip and chatter at a board meeting would you?</p>
<p>For the male, there are also the considerations like seeing how far up the trough he can pee, bombing the cigarette butt, peeling off the killer fart that he didn't want to loose off at the bar and, his favorite, making that grunt/sigh noise as the first gush lets go, sort of a ""Nnnngwwwwwaaaaa"". Actually, that's about the time the first fart goes too.</p>
<p>Richard Gere:<br /> Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women.</p>
<p>Madonna:<br /> Same as above, but reversed.  Same reason.</p>
<p>Sex:<br /> Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of<br /> foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.</p>
<p>Shoes:<br /> When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip on Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk. A man will wear the same pair of shoes all day.</p>
<p>Socks:<br /> Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweatsocks. Women wear strange socks. Socks that are cut way below the ankles, that have pictures of clouds on them, that have a big fuzzy ball on the back.</p>
<p>Sports Arenas:<br /> Simply put, men can always find their way around stadiums and arenas. The women usually end up following men.</p>
<p>Telephone:<br /> Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.</p>
<p>Toys:<br /> Little girls love to play with toys. Then when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest. Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and impractical.</p>
<p>Examples of men's toys: little miniature TV's, car phones, complicated juicers and blenders, graphic equalizers, small robots that serve cocktails on command, video games, anything that blinks, beeps, and requires at least 6 ""D"" batteries to operate. However, the only toys women still keep around when they grow up still require batteries, only few in number and smaller in size.</p>
<p>Underwear:<br /> Colored underwear. Women are allowed, in fact encouraged, to wear colored underwear. There is no reason for a man to ever, ever, wear anything besides solid white.</p>
<p>Weddings:<br /> When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about ""the ceremony"". Men talk about ""the bachelor party"".</p>

<p>The next day, the garbage disposal wouldn't work. When her husband got<br /> home, she said, very nicely, ""Honey, the disposal won't work. Would you<br /> try to fix it for me?"" Once again, he growled, ""What do I look like?<br /> Mr. Plumber?""</p>
<p>The next day, the washing machine was on the blink. When her husband<br /> got home, she steeled her courage and said, ""Honey, the washer isn't<br /> running.  Would you check on it?"" And again was met with a snarl, ""What<br /> do I look like? The Maytag repairman?""</p>
<p>Finally, she had had enough. The next morning, the woman called three<br /> repairmen to fix the toilet, the garbage disposal, and the washer.<br /> When her husband got home, she said, ""Honey, I had the repairmen out<br /> today."" He frowned, ""Well, how much is that going to cost?"" ""Well,<br /> honey, they all said I could pay them by baking them a cake or having<br /> sex with them.""</p>
<p>""Well, what kind of cakes did you bake them?"" he asked. She smiled.<br /> ""What do I look like? Betty Crocker?""</p>

He would have a religious debate with a leader of the Jewish community. If the Jewish leader won the debate, the Jews would be permitted to stay in Italy. If the Pope won, the Jews would have to leave.The Jewish community met and picked an aged Rabbi, Moishe, to represent them in the debate. Rabbi Moishe, however, could not speak Latin and the Pope could not speak Yiddish. So it was decided that this would be a ""silent"" debate.On the day of the great debate, the Pope and Rabbi Moishe sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Rabbi Moishe looked back and raised one finger.    Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. Rabbi Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope then brought out a communion wafer and chalice of wine. Rabbi Moishe pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and said, ""I concede the debate. This man has bested me. The Jews can stay.""Later, the Cardinals gathered around the Pope, asking him what had happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us of our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?""Meanwhile, the Jewish community crowded around Rabbi Moishe, asking what happened. ""Well,"" said Moishe, ""first he said to me, 'You Jews have three days to get out of here.' So I said to him, 'Up yours'. Then he tells me the whole city would be cleared of Jews. So I said to him, 'Listen here Mr. Pope, the Jews ... we stay right here!""""And then?"" asked a woman.""Who knows?"" said Rabbi Moishe. ""We broke for lunch.""</p>

5868,"<p>[surprisingly bi-partisan]'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE IMPEACHMENTDecember 17, 1998'Twas The Night Before Impeachment, When all through the House, All Congress was stirring, Even Conyers, the louse.  The Articles were hung by the Capitol with care, In hopes that Saint Bubba would be trapped in the lair.  The Republicans were nestled, all smug with The Feds, While visions of perjury danced in their heads.  And Barr with his rhetoric and Hyde with his trap, Had just settled in for a long evening's nap.When out in The Gulf, there arose such a clatter They clicked on CNN to see what was the matter.  When what to their wondering eyes should appear But Tomahawk cruise missiles flying like reindeer.  With a Presidential address, so lively and quick, They knew in a moment, it must be Saint Slick!More rapid than eagles, his supporters they came, And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:'Now Conyers, now Gephardt, let's forget The Vixen!On Barney! On Maxine! I'm no Richard Nixon!!!' 'From Capitol Hill to the Washington Mall, Now dash away, dash away, dash away all !!!'And then the Republicans heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  They scratched their heads and were turning around When resilient Saint Willie scored another rebound.  No longer would he eat from his humble pie, While assaulting Saddam with his bombs from the sky.  A bundle of weapons he had flung at Iraq, It looked once again like Slick Willie was back.His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, His nose like a cherry.  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the hair on his head was as white as the snow.  The stump of a stogie, he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.  He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf, And the Republicans wept, in spite of themselves.  And a wink of his eye and a twist of his head Soon gave them to know they had something to dread.  He spoke the right words and went straight to his work Hard to believe Mon had called him 'The Jerk.'And shaking his finger and thumbing his nose, By 'Wagging The Dog,' up the polls he rose.  He turned to his spinmeisters and gave them a whistle, Then they cheered-on Slick Willie as he launched another missile.  They all heard him exclaim, with Impeachment out of sight, 'Happy Ramadan to all, and to all a good night.'</p>

5874,"<p>After Quasimodo's death, the bishop of the cathedral of  Notre Dame sent word<br /> through the streets of Paris that a  new bell ringer was needed. The bishop<br /> decided that he  would conduct the interviews personally and went up into  the<br /> belfry to begin the screening process. </p>
<p> After observing while several applicants demonstrated their  skills, he<br /> decided to call it a day. Just then a lone,  armless man approached him and<br /> announced that he was there  to apply for the bell ringer's job. </p>
<p> The bishop was incredulous.  ""You have no arms!"" </p>
<p> ""No matter,"" said the man, ""observe!""  He then began  striking the bells with<br /> his face, producing a beautiful  melody on the carillon. </p>
<p> The bishop listened in astonishment, convinced that he had  finally found a<br /> suitable replacement for Quasimodo.Suddenly, while rushing forward to strike a<br /> bell, the  armless man tripped and plunged headlong out of the belfry  window to<br /> his death in the street below. </p>
<p> The stunned bishop immediately rushed down the stairways.When he reached  the<br /> street, a crowd had gathered around  the fallen figure, drawn by the beautiful<br /> music they had  heard only moments before.  As they silently parted to let  the<br /> bishop through, one of them asked, ""Bishop, who was  this man?"" </p>
<p> ""I don't know his name,"" the bishop sadly replied, ""but his  face rings a<br /> bell.""</p>

Put a few upside down and backwards. That way theyhave to remove all your staples rearrange your paperwork and re-staple it (on the leftside).--Line the bottom of your envelope withElmer's glue and let it dry before you put in your forms, so that the automated openerdoesn't open it and the extractor has to open it by hand.--If your very unfortunate and have to paytaxes use a two or three party check.--On top of paying with a three party checkpay one of the dollars you owe in cash. When an extractor receives cash, no matter howsmall an amount, he has to take it to a special desk and fill out of few nasty forms.--Write a little letter of appreciation. Anyletter received has to read and stamped regardless of what it is or what it's on.--Write your letter on something misshapen andunconventional. Like on the back of a Kroger sack.--When you mail it, mail it in a big envelope(even if its just a single EZi form). Big envelopes have to be torn and sorted differentlythan regular business size ones. An added bonus to the big envelope is that they takepriority over other mail, so the workers can hurry up and deal with your mess.--If you send 2 checks they'll have to stapleyour unsightly envelope to your half destroyed form.--Always put extra paper clips on your forms.Any foreign fasteners or the like have to be removed and put away.--Sign your name in ink on every page.

5884,"<p>GUYS SUCK...... and let me tell you why.</p>
<p>FARTING - How come it's cool for you to do it and disgusting if we do it.  And must you lift your    leg?</p>
<p>JOCK-ITCH - Get help!  Do you see us scratch?  We don't want to see you scratch either.</p>
<p>PORNOS - Why do you want to see other guys getting what you can't.  By the way, it's not good for   our skin.</p>
<p>PICK UP LINES - Not!</p>
<p>DOUBLE STANDARDS - If you can do it, why the hell can't we?</p>
<p>HONESTY - Learn the concept.  It is a good thing.</p>
<p>SENSITIVITY - Get some!!!!</p>
<p>DEODORANT - It's only small change at the corner store.  Buy it.</p>
<p>LOCKER ROOMS - Hello.....air freshner.</p>
<p>HEADS - We know you have two.  Keep one in your pants and get the other out of your ass.</p>
<p>You can't beat up everyone who looks at us.</p>
<p>You are not the shit, - I AM!</p>
<p>Being drunk is not an excuse to sleep with any thing on legs.</p>
<p>Believe me, sex is NOT number one and you are NOT number one at it.</p>
<p>Why must you tell ALL of your friends about everything you do with a girl?  They all had the same DREAM last night anyway.</p>
<p>Do not blame everything we do on P.M.S.  You should be glad we're not pregnant.</p>
<p>Try matching your maturity level to your age.</p>
<p>We are NOT objects.  We have feelings, thoughts and ideas.  We can even form words like ""FUCK YOU!!!""</p>
<p>There is more to life than playing cards and video games - How old are you??</p>
<p>Why do we have to look good and you can look like shit?</p>
<p>Can we go out in public?  Your room does not excite me.</p>
<p>Can we eat like humans - utensils were made especially for this purpose.  Ever heard of knives, forks, and spoons?  How about napkins? (This does not include shirt sleeves.)</p>
<p>WAKE UP CALL! - Wasting a ton of money on tuition every year to get drunk, get laid, and play sports is fucking retarded. If you're interested, become a professional athlete and at least GET PAID for it.</p>
<p>I am not putting myself through school to carry your sorry, lazy ass through life.</p>
<p>BIRTHDAYS - If you can remember the size of your cock to the exact millimeter, then you can remember our birthday.</p>
<p>What is the deal with standing in front of your mirror - naked - and thinking ""Oh, what a God.""  Trust me you are not a God.</p>
<p>Rulers were not invented to measure your genitalia - They were not made that small.  Why measure it anyway?  There will always be someone bigger and believe me, we can find him.</p>
<p>Romance is not three seconds of sweat and nothing and then rolling over and going to sleep.</p>
<p>The one thing you are good for, you are not good at!</p>
<p>No, we will not swallow!!!</p>
<p>It feels so good to take it in the ass.  NOT!!  Try it yourself, see if you like it.</p>
<p>Remember Meg Ryan's famous 'faking an orgasm scene'?  Sound familiar?</p>
<p>When we say we're lost without you, we're probably high.</p>
<p>TIGHTY WHITEYS - Gotta go.  (break it to your mother slowly)</p>
<p>When you buy a PLAYBOY be sure to pick us up a PLAYGIRL.</p>
<p>When you screw up, a rose would suffice, but if it's not too much trouble, a dozen would be nice.</p>
<p>WANDERING EYES - We know you look.  Try not to make it so obvious.</p>
<p>GET A CLUE! - When we say ""HARDER!, FASTER!"" we're not refering to your breathing pattern.</p>
<p>HEY BIG FOOT - Nice try.  We've figured it out by now that your foot size doesn't equal your dick size.  You should</p>
<p>MOTTO'S YOU SHOULD ADOPT - ""A stick of dynamite with a short fuse"",""When you pump up the JACK it gets lost in the CRACK"", ""Big EATERS have small PETERS"",""For him... a rare MOMENT, for her..this month's RENT"".</p>

5890,"<p>Your alarm clock rings on the first business day of the Year 2000, and you expect this day to be like any other. Always the worrywart, you're staying off of airplanes and you pulled your cash out of the bank, plus the IT department at your company solved the millennium problem months ago. But if the public agencies in your area haven't addressed the Year 2000 glitch, you could be in for a surprise. The following is, of course, an absolute worst-case scenario, but parts of it could be coming to town near you and are based on actual fears expressed by agencies across the U.S.: </p>
<p>7 a.m. You wake up and hop in the shower. You notice a funny smell. Obviously your local water agency's treatment facility didn't fix the millennium bug. </p>
<p>8 a.m. You head for the subway, only to find that Y2K snafus have halted trains for the day. </p>
<p>8:30 a.m. You return home to get your car and drive to work. Red lights are flashing at all of the intersections because the systems weren't Year 2000-compliant. </p>
<p>9 a.m. Somebody runs one of the flashing red lights in front of you, crashing into another car. You get out to call 9-1-1, but the emergency system doesn't work. </p>
<p>10 a.m. You finally get to work and have a meeting with partners in the new company you're starting. Unfortunately, the state has lost its records on incorporated companies and cannot process your request. </p>
<p>Noon. You go to lunch. It's your treat because your companion didn't receive his social security check. You hold your breath while the restaurant runs your credit card - expiration date 9/00. </p>
<p>2 p.m. You head for the county hospital, where you've scheduled a minor surgery. Things are in disarray because medical devices have failed throughout the day. </p>
<p>4 p.m. The hospital, which has lost all of its appointments, finally admits you. An embedded chip in the elevator fails, and the assistants must drag you and your gurney up the stairs. </p>
<p>6 p.m. You drive to the state college to check the grade for a class you took last semester, the last of your pre-MBA requirements. Unfortunately it's been lost, and there is no record of you ever having taken the class. </p>
<p>7 p.m. You go home to call a friend and complain about your day, but the telephone line is dead because the company hasn't tackled the Year 2000 glitch. </p>
<p>But then again, maybe you won't experience any of it. If your electric company isn't Year 2000-compliant, you might sleep through your alarm.</p>

5903,"<p>How to clean your mouse...</p>
<p>This memo is from an unnamed computer company. It went to all field engineers about a computer peripheral problem. The author of this memo was quite serious. The engineers rolled on the floor.</p>
<p>Mouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit) therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls, should only be attempted by properly trained personnel. Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls.</p>
<p>Ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop off method. Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist-off method.</p>
<p>Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.</p>
<p>Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used immediately. It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction. Any customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these necessary items.</p>

5914,"<p>Women understand that babies do not come from the stork. When a women is pregnant and craves pickle and mustard sandwich�s, the man groans and wines until they remind him that you are the one having the baby HERE! But when the man craves a six pack, she diligently goes to the store and returns five hours later with a romantic movie. When women see a ''caution'' sign, they carefully avoid it, while men assume that it was meant for someone else, and come home with every bone broken. Women characterize the first date, by seeing how you act and eat. Men check to see if you can name at least one football, basketball or baseball star. Women can stand to be wrong, while men make about excuses ''misunderstanding'' and some how it is always the women's fault. When a man attends a concert, he whoops, yells, shrieks and yelps, while gobbling down anything he can get his hands on. While women enjoy the show, dancing and socializing with friends. When women stay in the bathroom for over 45 seconds, men assume that something is wrong, and walk in to examine the situation. Women understand about privacy, and won't come in the room until 2 hours have passed. When in a hospital, women will share all emotions. While men, being the ''tough'' guys that they are, will ''stay calm'' until someone finally notices that he has wet the chair he is sitting in. Women love to help. Men feel you want commitment when you ask to do the dishes</p>

He decided to give five thousand dollars to each woman to see what she would do with it.The first woman bought new clothes for herself. She got an expensive new hairdo, a massage, a facial, a manicure, and a pedicure. She said, I spent the money so that I would look pretty for you because I love you so much.The second woman bought a VCR, a CD player, a set of golf clubs, and a tennis racket and gave them to the man. I used the money to buy you these gifts because I love you, she told him.The third woman invested the money in the stock market and within a short time had doubled her investment. She returned the initial five thousand dollars to the man and reinvested the profit. Im investing in our future because I love you so much, she said.The man carefully considered how each woman had spent the money, and married the woman with the biggest tits.</p>

<p>When they got to heaven, they asked St. Peter if he could arrange for them to be married, saying that it was what they had hoped for in life, and they still desired wedded union. He thought about it and agreed, but said they would have to wait.</p>
<p>It was almost one hundred years later when St. Peter sent for them.  They were married in a simple ceremony.</p>
<p>So things went on, for thirty years or so, but they determined, in this time, that eternity was best not spent together.</p>
<p>They went back to St. Peter, and said, ""We thought we would be happy forever, but now we believe that we have irreconcilable differences.  Is there any way we can get divorced?""</p>
<p>""Are you kidding?"" said St. Peter. ""It took me a hundred years to get a priest up here to marry you. I'll never get a lawyer!""</p>

5960,"<p>Many parents today are concerned that their offspring might somehow be involved in the world of illegal pharmaceuticals, or ""drugs"".  This is a healthy concern.  Knowing your kids are ""high"" is the first step toward helping them avoid problems with their health, their grades,  the law, and getting those hard-to-clean vomit stains out of the Oriental rug.</p>
<p>KNOW THE WARNING SIGNS- select the option which best describes your child.</p>
<p>1. Your child's idea of a fun sport to play is: </p>
<p>A) tossing a pigskin ball around </p>
<p>B) throwing an orange rubber ball into a netted hole </p>
<p>C) inserting a pointy needle into a vein and mixing foreign substances into the human bloodstream.</p>
<p>2. Your child's idea of a responsible adult is: </p>
<p>A) Bill Clinton </p>
<p>B) Tom Hanks </p>
<p>C) Charles Manson.</p>
<p>3. Your child's favorite hobbies include: </p>
<p>A) Model Rocketry </p>
<p>B) Baseball </p>
<p>C) Taking white, powdery substances from a big bag and breaking it down into many smaller bags.</p>
<p>4. Your child's pet is: </p>
<p>A) a puppy dog </p>
<p>B) a 16' python </p>
<p>C) a colony of imaginary bugs and spiders that crawl under their skin.</p>
<p>5. Your child's breath smells like: </p>
<p>A) a fresh, minty mountain top </p>
<p>B) lunch </p>
<p>C) an opium den.</p>
<p>6. When your young ones dress up to go out, they look like: </p>
<p>A) Fred and Ginger </p>
<p>B) Regis and Kathy Lee </p>
<p>C) Sid and Nancy</p>
<p>7. Your child would identify Tijuana Gold as: </p>
<p>A) a precious metal </p>
<p>B) a Mexican theme park </p>
<p>C) a good deal, but not as potent as the stuff from Thailand.</p>
<p>8. When you ask your child how their day at school was at the dinner table they answer: </p>
<p>A) they scored a goal for their soccer team </p>
<p>B) they got the highest grade in class on a math test </p>
<p>C) they scored a dime bag and got high.</p>
<p>Total up the number of times you answered ""C"" to the questions above, and consult the table below.</p>
<p>0 ""C's""- Chances are your child is not on drugs.  They probably aren't that exciting either.  Kick them out of the house and force them to live on the cold streets for a few months to let them really appreciate life in all it's murkiness.</p>
<p>1-3 ""C's""- Your child might be on drugs, but you can't be certain.  Put a flashlight up to their face and flash it in their eyes.  This doesn't really tell you anything, but it scares the pants off your kids and is kind of fun.</p>
<p>3-6 ""C's""- You may as well face it, you've got a little druggie on your hands.  Your child is a menace to society and must be dealt with accordingly.  We suggest a good flaying to help them kick their nasty habit.  Confiscate all their stash and send it to Ooze.</p>
<p>7-8 ""C's""- Your child has never used drugs.  No sir. Just smile nicely at them and slink out of the house. Never return.</p>

<p>In the defense's closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client is guilty and that it looks like he'll probably be convicted, resorts to a clever trick. </p>
<p>``Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all,'' the lawyer says as he looks at his watch. 'Within 1 minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this court room,' he says and he looks toward the courtroom door. The jury, somewhat stunned, all look on eagerly. A minute passes. Nothing happens. </p>
<p>Finally the lawyer says: 'Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I, therefore, put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty.' </p>
<p>The jury, clearly confused, retires to deliberate. </p>
<p>A very few minutes later, the jury returns and a representative pronounces a verdict of guilty. </p>
<p>""But how?"" inquires the lawyer. ""You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door."" </p>

The man drops his pants, strikes a bodybuilder's pose, and says, referring to his bulging thighs, 'See those, baby? That's 1000 pounds of dynamite!' She is aching for action at this point. Finally, he drops his underpants, and after a quick glance, she grabs her purse and runs screaming to the front door. He catches her before she is able to leave and asks, 'Why are you in such a hurry to go?' She replies, 'With 2000 pounds of dynamite and such a short fuse, I was afraid you were about to blow!'</p>

<p>The doctor tried to talk his patient out of the decision, but the man was adamant. He was unwaivering in his desire to be castrated. The doctor, seeing the man was resolute, sighed and put him in touch with a good plastic surgeon. </p>
<p>The surgeon was equally aghast, but after having the man sign a multitude of forms, agreed to perform the procedure. </p>
<p>The day of surgery arrived, and the man was in very good spirits. He was clearly looking forward to being castrated. Everyone was completely puzzled but as this clearly was what he wanted, they all shook their heads and went about the procedure as expertly as they could. </p>

<p>The boy replied, ""This is turpentine, the most powerful potion<br /> in the world!""</p>
<p>Then the pope said, ""I hate to dissagree with you boy but holy<br /> water is the most powerful potion in the world. If you put it on<br /> the belly of a pregnent woman then she will pass her baby right<br /> away!""</p>

Try it and come back in a week to let me know how you got on.'A week later Mrs. Murphy returns to the doctor and he inquires as to how things went. 'Oh it was terrible, just terrible doctor.''What happened?' asks the doctor.'Well I did as you advised and slipped it in his coffee. The effect was immediate. He jumped straight up, swept the cutlery off the table, at the same time ripping my clothes off and then proceeded to make passionate love to me on the tabletop. It was terrible.''What was terrible?' said the doctor, 'was the sex not good?'""Oh no doctor, the sex was the best I've had in 25 years, but I'll never be able to show my face in McDonald's again.</p>

5992,"<p>Several years ago the United States funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft. The study took two years and cost over $180,000. The results of the study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex </p>
<p>After the results were published, Germany decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the U.S. study were incorrect. After three years of research and a cost in excess of $250,000, they concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. When the results of the German study were released, Poland decided to conduct their own study. </p>
<p>The Poles didn't really trust the U.S. or German studies. So after nearly three weeks of intensive research and a cost of right around $75, the Polish study was complete. The Polish study came to the conclusion that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.</p>

<p>''Let me finish,'' says the friend. ''when the time came, my wife took out her orthopaedic leg, and put it in the closet. Then she took out her arm, and put it in the closet. Then she took out her eye, and finally took off her hair and put them both in the closet.'' </p>
<p>''Wow,'' says his friend, ''and what seems to be the dilemma?'' </p>
<p>''Well,'' says the guy, ''I don't know if I should make love to her on the bed or in the closet.'' </p>

The second no legs, and the third has no body, just a head.They all line up, the whistle blows and ""splash"" they're all in the pool.The guy with no arms takes the lead instantly but the guy with no legs is closing fast. The head of course sank straight to the bottom.Ten lengths later and the guy with no legs finishes first.

Eventually the head catches his breath and shouts:""Three long years I've spent learning to swim with my ears, then two minutes before the whistle, some prick puts a swimming cap on me !!""</p>
