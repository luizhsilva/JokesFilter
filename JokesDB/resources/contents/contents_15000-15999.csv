15001,"<p>Ten Things Not To Say To Your New Girlfriend's Parents.</p>
<p>1. My parole officer thinks Sara has a calming effect on me.</p>
<p>2. Did you see that saucer that flew over town yesterday?</p>
<p>3. Which one of you taught Sara to give such great head?</p>
<p>4. Can you believe it! Those shitheads at the corner market won't cash my welfare check!</p>
<p>5. We're going to keep our relationship quiet for now. My wife can be rather vindictive at times.</p>
<p>6. Those home pregnancy kits aren't very reliable, in my opinion.</p>
<p>7. Sara is so pretty I've decided to give up being bisexual just for her.</p>
<p>8. Nice place you got here. That painting looks expensive. I bet a nice home like this came with a safe already built in, didn't it?</p>
<p>9. There ain't nothing that beats that great feeling of knowing your HIV test results are negative! I bet Sara's will be okay too.</p>
<p>10. Can I pull my car in your garage? I'm not sure how long that cop car will stay lost.</p>

15004,"<p>When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I needed a passionate girl with a zest for life. In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency, she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide. So I decided I needed a girl with stability.When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided I needed a girl with some excitement.When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and flirted with everyone she met. She made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some ambition.When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground and married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.Now, I'm 40 and just looking for a girl with big tits.</p>

15007,"<p>A turkey was chatting with a bull.</p>
<p>""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,"" sighed the turkey, ""but I haven't got the energy.""</p>
<p>""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. ""They're packed with nutrients.""</p>
<p>The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree.</p>
<p>The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.</p>
<p>Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree.</p>
<p>Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who promptly shot the turkey out of the tree.</p>
<p>Moral of the story:</p>
<p>Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.</p>

Not two minutes later, he gets a huge strike and lands a trophy. Again and again he baits, casts out and immediately catches a huge fish. The luckless man is now watching the new guy to see his secret. He sees that the man removes a piece of bait from a jar, inspects it carefully and smells it before putting it on the hook. He walks over to him and asks about the bait.The man replies ""This is very special bait indeed. I get it from a friend who is a mortician, he cuts the pussy lips off all the women that he works on.

15023,"<p>Who's In Charge of The Body All the organs of the body were having a meeting, trying to decide who was in charge.  The brain said: ""I should be in charge, because I run all the body's systems, so without me nothing would happen.""  ""I should be in charge,"" said the stomach, ""because I process food and give all of you energy.""  ""I should be in charge,"" said the heart, ""because I pump the blood and circulate oxygen all over the body, so without me you'd all waste away.""  ""I should be in charge,"" said the rectum, ""because I'm responsible for waste removal.""  All the other body parts laughed at the rectum and insulted him, so in a huff, he shut down tight. Within a few days, the brain had a terrible headache, the stomach was bloated, and the blood was toxic. Eventually the other organs gave in. They all agreed that the rectum should be the boss. The moral of the story? You don't have to be smart or important to be in charge... just an asshole.</p>

<p>The director then told the VP: ""It contains that which aids<br /> plant growth, and it is very strong.""</p>
<p>The VP told the Executive-VP: ""It promotes growth, and it is<br /> very powerful.""</p>

15027,"<p>A missionary gets sent into deepest darkest Africa and goes to live with a tribe therein.

<p>One day the wife of one of the tribe's noblemen gives birth to a white child. The village is shocked and the chief is sent by his people to talk with the missionary.</p>
<p>""You have taught us of the evils of sexual sin, yet here a black woman gives birth to white child. You are the only white man that has ever set foot in our village. It doesn't take a genius to work out what has been going on!""</p>
<p>The missionary replies: ""No, no, my good man. You are mistaken. What you have here is a natural occurrence-what is called an albino. Look to the yonder field. See a field of white sheep, and yet amongst them is one black one. Nature does this on occasion.""</p>

15069,"<p>Two nude statues (one male and one female) had been standing in a beautiful park for 99 years. On their 100th anniversary in the park an angel came down from heaven to talk to the statues.He said to them, 'God has been watching you for the past 100 years and has been very pleased with the two of you. So pleased in fact that he has decided to make you human for a short time.'The angel then went on to say that they would be human for 15 minutes and would finally be able to pleasure themselves in a manner in which they have only fantasized about for the last 100 years.The statues were so excited they could hardly believe it. The second they became human they ran off together behind the bushes. The angel heard the rustling of the bushes and shouts of joy and laughter.After 10 minutes the statues returned from behind the bushes sweating and laughing. The angel told the statues that they still had five more minutes.The male statue quickly turned to the female statue and said: `Cool, this time, you hold down the pigeon and I'll shit on its head.'</p>

15079,"<p>As a result of DOD budget cutbacks, we are forced to reduce the size of the force. Under CRAP, older soldiers will go on early retirement, thus permitting the retention of lower paid soldiers who represent the Army's future.</p>
<p>A program to phase out older soldiers via retirement by the end of the current fiscal year will be placed in effect. the program will be known as Retire Active Personnel Early (RAPE).</p>
<p>Employees who are RAPEd will be given the opportunity to seek civilian employment within the Department of the Army. To that end, RAPEd soldiers will be required to fill out numerous DA Forms (currently in the development, test, and evaluation stage) detailing their education and experience.<br /> This phase does not guarantee retired soldiers a civil service position; it does, however, guarantee that the soldier's unique capabilities will be considered before being bypassed in the hiring process. This phase of CRAP is known as Survey of Capabilities of Retired Warriors (SCREW).</p>
<p>Soldiers who have been RAPEd and SCREWed may request review of their situation by higher authority. This is the Study by Higher Authority Following Termination (SHAFT)phase.</p>
<p>CRAP policy dictates that a soldier may be RAPEd once, SCREWed twice, but may be SHAFTed as many times as the Army leadership deems appropriate.</p>
<p>If a soldier follows the above procedures, he or she will be entitled to get Half Earnings for Retired Personnel Early Severance (HERPES). As HERPES is considered a benefit payment, any soldier who gets HERPES will no longer be RAPEd or SCREWed by the Army.</p>
<p>The Army leadership wishes to assure younger soldiers who remain on active duty that the Army will continue its policy of ensuring that soldiers are well trained through our Special High Intensity Training (SHIT) program. The Army takes pride in the amount of SHIT our soldiers receive and can boast that it gives its soldiers more SHIT than any other service.</p>
<p>If a soldier feels he or she does not get enough SHIT, see your commander.</p>

15083,"<p>Title Search Excerpted from the Empire State Surveyor, New York Society of Professional Surveyors, November 1990 One of the best examples of how ridiculous government paperwork can be is illustrated by a recent case in Louisiana. A company president was trying to buy some land in Louisiana for a plant expansion, and he wanted to finance this new facility with a government loan. His lawyer filled out all the necessary forms and applications and sent them appropriately. The government reviewed his application and abstract and sent the following reply: ""We received today your letter enclosing application for your client supported by abstract of title. We have observed, however, that you have not traced the title previous to 1803, and before final approval, it will be necessary that the title be traced previous to that year. Yours truly, etc.""As a result, the lawyer sent the following letter to the government:""Gentlemen, your letter regarding title received. I note you wish said title to be claimed back further than I have done it. I was unaware that any educated man failed to know that Louisiana was purchased by the United States from France in 1803. The title of the land was acquired by France by right of conquest of Spain.  The land came into possession of Spain in 1492 by right of discovery by a Spanish-Portuguese sailor named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by Queen Isabella of Spain. The good queen, being a pious woman and careful about title, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope of Rome upon Columbus' voyage before she sold her jewels to help him. Now the Pope, as you know, is the emissary of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God. And God, it is commonly accepted, made the world.  Therefore, I believe it is safe to assume that He also made that part of the United States called Louisiana, and I hope to hell you're satisfied.""</p>

In order to be<br /> eligible to join the Church, you will be required to abstain<br /> from sexual relations for one week."" He observed their<br /> reactions: The older looked at each other fondly and smiled; the<br /> middle-aged man breathed a sigh of relief, while the woman shot<br /> him a dirty look; both the young newlyweds broke out in a cold<br /> sweat and trembled. The priest noted this and told the six<br /> hopefuls: ""I want to speak with you all a week from today, same<br /> time, to check on your progress."" The couples all left his<br /> office.</p>
<p>One week later, the three couples returned, and once again met<br /> in the priest's office. The priest greeted them all, saying<br /> ""Welcome back, my children! I trust you did not have too much<br /> difficulty with this test."" The elderly man just laughed. ""No,<br /> not a bit of difficulty, Father!"" His gray-haired wife leaned<br /> toward the priest and whispered ""Earl lost his manly functions<br /> twenty years ago; I'm relieved that that part of my wifely duty<br /> is finished!"" The priest smiled, shook hands with both of them<br /> and said ""Congratulations! You have proven yourselves worthy of<br /> the Catholic Church!""</p>

I'm hitting my sexual peak and reached for my dildo a<br /> few times, but we stayed strong."" The priest shook his head. ""It<br /> seems to me this may be a hard adjustment for you to make. I<br /> will allow you to join the church on probationary conditions.""</p>
<p>Then he turned to the young couple, who looked very<br /> uncomfortable. ""And you, my children?"" The girl burst into<br /> tears; the boy hung his head. ""Well?"" insisted the priest. The<br /> boy spoke up. ""Well, Father, we were okay for the first 2 days.<br /> But on the third day, my wife wore those little shorts that<br /> drive me nuts. We tried to ignore the sinful urges, but we just<br /> couldn't fight it. I bent her over the meat freezer and took her<br /> then and there."" The priest frowned and shook his head. ""I'm<br /> sorry, but you two are not welcome in the Catholic Church. The<br /> girl sobbed, ""We're not welcome in the supermarket either!""</p>

When the bus starts on it's way the bus driver says to the hippie, ""if you want I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you."" The hippie of course says that he'd love to know so the bus driver tells him that the every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery to pray to the lord. ""If you went dressed in robes and some glowing powder,"" said the bus driver(male), ""you could tell her you were God and command her to have sex with you."" Well the Hippie decides to try this out so that Tuesday he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun and right on schedule the nun shows up. When she's in the middle of praying the hippie walks out from hiding, in robes and glowing with a mask of god. ""I am God, I have heard your prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first."" The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about to go to work on the nun. After the Hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, ""Ha ha, I'm the hippie!!"" The nun replied by whipping off her mask and shouting, ""Ha ha, I'm the bus driver!!!""</p>

"
15149,"<p>1. Women love to shop. It is the one area of the world where they feel like they're actually in control.</p>
<p>2. Women especially love a bargain. The question of ""need"" is irrelevant, so don't bother pointing it out. Anything on sale is fair game.</p>
<p>3. Women never have anything to wear. Don't question the racks of clothes in the closet; you ""just don't understand"".</p>
<p>4. Women need to cry. And they won't do it alone unless they know you can hear them.</p>
<p>5. Women will always ask questions that have no right answer, in an effort to trap you into feeling guilty. </p>
<p>6. Women love to talk. Silence intimidates them and they feel a need to fill it, even if they have nothing to say.</p>
<p>7. Women need to feel like there are people worse off than they are. That's why soap operas and Oprah Winfrey-type shows are so successful.</p>
<p>8. Women don't need sex as often as men do. This is because sex is more physical for men and more emotional for women. Just knowing that the man *wants* to have sex with them fulfills the emotional need.</p>
<p>9. Women hate bugs. Even the strong-willed ones need a man around when there's a spider or a wasp involved.</p>
<p>10. Women can't keep secrets. They eat away at them from the inside. And they don't view it as being untrustworthy, providing they only tell two or three people.</p>
<p>11. Women always go to public restrooms in groups. It gives them a chance to gossip.</p>
<p>12. Women can't refuse to answer a ringing phone, no matter what she's doing. It might be the lottery calling.</p>
<p>13. Women never understand why men love toys. Men understand that they wouldn't need toys if women had an ""on/off"" switch.</p>
<p>14. Women think all beer is the same.</p>
<p>15. Women keep three different shampoos and two different conditioners in the shower. After a woman showers, the bathroom will smell like a tropical rain forest.</p>
<p>16. Women don't understand the appeal of sports. Men seek entertainment that allows them to escape reality. Women seek entertainment that reminds them of how horrible things *could* be.  </p>
<p>17. If a man goes on a seven-day trip, he'll pack five days worth of clothes and will wear some things twice; if a woman goes on a seven-day trip she'll pack 21 outfits because she doesn't know what she'll feel like wearing each day.</p>
<p>18. Women brush their hair *before* bed.</p>
<p>19. Watch a woman eat an ice cream cone and you'll have a pretty good idea about how she'll be in bed.</p>
<p>20. Women are paid less than men, except for one field: Modeling.</p>
<p>21. Women are *never* wrong. Apologizing is the man's responsibility, ""It's there in the Bible"". Hmmm, who was it that gave Adam the apple?</p>
<p>22. Women do *not* know anything about cars. ""Oil-stick, oil doesn't stick?""</p>
<p>23. Women have better restrooms. They get the nice chairs and red carpet. Men just get a large bowl to share.</p>
<p>24. The average number of items in a typical woman's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.</p>
<p>25. Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.</p>
<p>26. Women love to talk on the phone. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.</p>
<p>27. A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, or get the mail.  </p>
<p>28. Women will drive miles out of their way to avoid the possibility of getting lost using a shortcut.</p>
<p>29. Women don't try as hard as men during sex; after all, they don't fall asleep afterwards.</p>
<p>30. Women do NOT want an honest answer to the question, 'How do I look?'</p>
<p>31. PMS stands for: Permissible Man-Slaughter. (Or at least men think it means that. PMS also stands for Preposterous Mood Swings and Punish My Spouse.</p>
<p>32. The first naked man women see is ""Ken"".</p>
<p>33. Women are insecure about their weight, butt, and breast sizes. </p>
<p>34. Women will make three right-hand turns to avoid making one left-hand turn. </p>
<p>35. ""Oh, nothing,"" has an entirely different meaning in woman-language than it does in man-language.</p>
<p>36. Lewis Carroll's Caterpillar had nothing on women.</p>
<p>37. Women cannot use a map without turning the map to correspond to the direction that they are heading.</p>
<p>38. All women are overweight by definition; don't agree with them about it. Women always have 5 pounds to lose, but don't bring this up unless they really have 5 pounds to gain.</p>
<p>39. If it is not Valentines day and you see a man in a flower shop, you can probably start up a conversation by asking, ""What did you do?""</p>
<p>40. Only women understand the reason for ""guest towels"" and the ""good china"".</p>
<p>41. Women want equal rights, but you rarely hear them clamoring to be let into the draft to cover the responsibilities that go with those rights. All women seek equality with men until it comes to sharing the closet, taking out the trash, and picking up the check.</p>
<p>42. Only women understand the reason for ""guest towels"" and the ""good china"".</p>
<p>43. If a man ticks off a woman she will often respond by getting a fuzzy toilet cover which warms their rear, but makes it impossible for the lid to stay up thus it constantly gets peed on by the guys.  (which gets them in more trouble)</p>
<p>44. Women never check to see if the lid is up.  They seem to prefer taking a flying butt leap towards the bowl and then chewing men out because they ""left the seat up"" instead of taking two seconds and lowering it themselves.</p>
<p>45. Women can get out of speeding tickets by pouting. This will get men arrested.</p>
<p>46. Women don't really care about a sense of humor in a guy despite claims to the contrary. You don't see women trampling over Tom Cruise to get to Gilbert Gottfried, do you?</p>
<p>47. Women fake orgasm because men fake foreplay.</p>
<p>48. It's okay for women to dance with each other and not be gay, You don't see straight men dancing together.</p>
<p>49. Women will spend hours dressing up to go out, and then they'll go out and spend more time checking out other women. Men can never catch women checking out other men; women will always catch men checking out other women.</p>
<p>50. The most embarrassing thing for women is to find another woman wearing the same dress at a formal party. You don't hear men say, ""Oh-my-GOD, there's another man wearing a black tux, get me outta here!""</p>

15150,"<p>A blonde by the name of Julie was getting pretty desperate for money. So she decided to go to the richer part of town and try to get a job as a handywoman. She rang the doorbell at the first house she came to, and a man answered the door. She asked if there were any odd jobs she could do, and he replied, ""Well, actually, we need the porch painted-how much do you want?"" Julie said she felt $50 was fair. He replied, ""OK, the ladders, paint, and other tools you need are in the garage."" When the man closed the door, his wife, who had overheard the conversation asked him, ""$50?!? Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?"" The man replied, ""She must have, she was standing right on it."" About 45 minutes later, the doorbell rings again, and the man is surprised to find Julie there. She tells him that she's done, and states that she even had enough paint to do two coats. As the man is reaching into his wallet to pay her, Julie says, ""Oh, and by the way, that isn't a Porsche-it's a Ferrari.""</p>

15158,"<p>The was a farmer who raised watermelons. He was doing pretty well but he was disturbed by some local kids who would sneak into his watermelon patch at night and eat watermelons. After some careful thought he came up with a clever idea that he thought would scare the kids away for sure. So he made up the sign and posted it in the field. The next day the kids show up and they see this sign. It says, �Warning, one of the watermelons in this field has been injected with cyanide.� So the kids run off, make up their own sign and post it next to the sign that the farmer made. The farmer shows up the next week and when he looks over the field he notices that no watermelons are missing but he notices a new sign next to his. He drives up to the sign which reads, �Now there are two.�</p>

<p>1) A certified medical excuse<br /> 2) A death in the student's immediate family</p>

15184,"<p>Adolf Hitler is speeding through Germany with his chauffeur at the wheel on his way to an important address.<br /> Driving down a country road, the chauffeur (who is distracted, looking out the window at the countryside) doesn't see a pig walk out onto the road, and he hits in with the car. </p>
<p>Stopping the car, he jumps out, and Adolf climbs out also to see what is going on.

<p>All the way to the address the chauffeur, who is a fairly good-hearted person despite his employer, is worried about the family who owned the pig and wondered how they'd react to discovering the pig, so when they arrived he asked Hitler whether he shouldn't drive back to the farm and let them know what happened. </p>

15191,"<p>A language instructor was explaining to her class that in French, nouns unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically designated as masculine or feminine.House, in French, is feminine-la maison. Pencil, in French, is masculine-le crayon.One puzzled student asked, What gender is computer?The teacher did not know, and the word wasn't in her French dictionary. So for fun she split the class into two groups appropriately enough, by gender and asked them to decide whether computer should be a masculine or feminine noun.Both groups were required to give four reasons for their recommendation. The men's group decided that computers should definitely be of the feminine gender (la computer), because: 1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic 2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else 3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for possible later retrieval 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your pay check on accessories for it.The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be masculine (le computer), because:1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on;2. They have a lot of data but they are still clueless3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE the problem4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you'd waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.The women won.</p>

It is a relative of the boa<br /> constrictor, it grows to thirty-five feet in length and weighs between three and<br /> four hundred pounds at the maximum.<br /> This is what the manual said: </p>
<p>1. If you are attacked by an anaconda, do not run. The snake is faster than<br /> you are. </p>
<p>2. Lie flat on the ground. Put your arms tight against your sides, your legs<br /> tight against one another </p>
<p>3. Tuck your chin in. </p>
<p>4. The snake will come and begin to nudge and climb over your body. </p>
<p>5. Do not panic </p>
<p>6. After the snake has examined you, it will begin to swallow you from the<br /> feet and - always from the end. Permit the snake to swallow your feet and<br /> ankles. Do not panic. </p>
<p>7. The snake will now begin to suck your legs into its body. You must lie<br /> perfectly still. This will take a long time. </p>
<p>8. When the snake has reached your knees slowly and with as little movement as<br /> possible, reach down, take your knife and very gently slide it into the side of<br /> the snake's mouth between the edge of its mouth and your leg, then suddenly rip<br /> upwards, severing the snake's head. </p>
<p>9. Be sure you have your knife. </p>
<p>10. Be sure your knife is sharp.</p>

<p>The cop came up to him, took his license without a word, and examined it and the car. Finally he came to the window looking steadily at the driver and said, ""I've had a tough shift and this is my last pull over. I don't feel like more paperwork so if you can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven't heard before, you can go!""</p>

15228,"<p>This actually happened at Harvard University in October of this year. In a<br /> biology class, the professor was discussing the high glucose levels found<br /> in semen.</p>

However, as she was<br /> going out the door, the professor's reply was classic....

The owner says, ""Well the parrot knows how to use a computer"". </p>
<p>The man then asks about the next parrot and is told that this one costs 1,000 dollars because it can do everything the first parrot can do plus it knows how to use the UNIX operating system. </p>
<p>Naturally, the increasingly startled man asks about the third parrot and </p>
<p>is told that it costs 2,000 dollars. Needless to say this begs the question, ""What can it do?"" </p>

In case of emergency, please open these envelopes in<br /> sequential order; envelope one first, envelope two second, and<br /> envelope three third.""</p>
<p>The manager shrugs, puts the envelopes back, and forgets about<br /> them.</p>

<p>A few month later, another strike hits. He goes to the drawer<br /> and opens the second envelope. It reads, ""Blame the government<br /> for everything"". </p>
<p>It works like a charm, and he breathes a sigh of relief as his<br /> job is, once again, saved.</p>

The old fellow preensIn black Gucci boots and red Calvin Klein jeans.The elves have stock options and desks with a view,Where they write computer code for Johnny and Sue.No more dolls or toy soldiers or little toy drums(ahem - pardon me)No more dolls or tin soldiers or little toy drumsWill be under the tree, only compact disk ROMSWith the Microsoft label. So spin up your drive,From now on Christmas runs only on Windows 95.More rapid than eagles the competitors came,And Bill whistled, and shouted, and called them by name.'Now, ADOBE! now, CLARIS! now, INTUIT! too,Now, APPLE! and NETSCAPE! you are all of you through,It is Microsoft's SANTA that the kids can't resist,It's the ultimate software with a traditional twist -Recommended by no less than the jolly old elf,And on the package, a picture of Santa himself.Get 'em young, keep 'em long, is Microsoft's scheme,And a merger with Santa is a marketer's dream.To the top of the NASDAQ! to the top of the Dow!Now dash away! dash away! dash away - wow!'And Mama in her 'kerchief and I in my cap,Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,The whirr and the hum of our satellite platter,As it turned toward that new Christmas star in the sky,The SANTALITE owned by the Microsoft guy.As I sprang from my bed and was turning around,My computer turned on with a Jingle-Bells sound.And there on the screen was a smiling Bill GatesNext to jolly old Santa, two arm-in-arm mates.And I heard them exclaim in voice so bright,Have a MICROSOFT CHRISTMAS,and TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.</p>

15246,"<p>For those who already have children past this age, this is hilarious. For<br /> those who have children this age, this is not funny. For those who have children nearing this age, this is a warning. For those who have not yet had children, this is birth control. The following came from an anonymous mother in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>THINGS I'VE LEARNED FROM MY CHILDREN...(HONEST AND NO KIDDING): </p>
<p>1. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 square foot<br /> house 4 inches deep. </p>
<p>2. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller<br /> blades, they can ignite. </p>
<p>3. A 3 year olds voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded<br /> restaurant. </p>
<p>4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong<br /> enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman<br /> cape.  It is strong enough, however, if tied to a paint can, to spread<br /> paint on all four walls of a 20 by 20 foot room.</p>
<p>5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When<br /> using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times<br /> before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. </p>
<p>6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit by<br /> a ceiling fan. </p>
<p>7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words ""Uh-oh,"" it's already too<br /> late. </p>
<p>8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. </p>
<p>9. A six year old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36<br /> year old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifying glass<br /> can start a fire even on an overcast day.</p>
<p>10. Certain LEGOs will pass through the digestive tract of a four year<br /> old. </p>
<p>11. Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence. </p>
<p>12. Super glue is forever. </p>
<p>13. No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't<br /> walk on water. </p>
<p>14. Pool filters do not like Jell-O. </p>
<p>15. VCR's do not eject PB&amp;J sandwiches even though TV commercials show<br /> they do. </p>
<p>16. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes. </p>
<p>17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving. </p>
<p>18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is. </p>
<p>19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do not<br /> like ovens. </p>
<p>20. The fire department in Austin, TX has a 5 minute response time. </p>
<p>21. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms dizzy.</p>
<p>22. It will however make cats dizzy.</p>
<p>23. Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy</p>

<p>10&gt; Rather than taking the time to master the latest technological advances, they simply pack every PlayStation 2 box with a Hustler and a jar of Vaseline.</p>
<p>9&gt; Sewing a teddy bear is hard work.  Catching a bear cub at the North Pole is easy.  You do the math.</p>
<p>8&gt; Rudolph, elated at finally being invited to join in some reindeer games, instead finds himself confronted by shotgun-toting elves.</p>
<p>7&gt; Several of them were caught on video adding real urine to the ""wet baby"" dolls.</p>

<p>They caught the town clerk just as he was locking up, and got the license from him. </p>

<p>They rushed back to the clerk's office, caught him again, and got another license. </p>
<p>This time, the judge noticed that the clerk had filled in the date in the wrong format. Again they catch the clerk... </p>
<p>After five reissued licenses, the judge is finally satisfied.</p>
<p>The judge says, ""I hope you appreciate why I made you keep going back. If there are irregularities in the license, your marriage would not be legal, and any children you might have would be technical bastards.""</p>

15264,"<p>An engineer, physicist, and mathematician are all challenged with a problem: to fry an egg when there is a fire in the house.  The engineer just grabs a huge bucket of water, runs over to the fire, and puts it out.  The physicist thinks for a long while, and then measures a precise amount of water into a container.  He takes it over to the fire, pours it on, and with the last drop the fire goes out. The mathematician pores over pencil and paper.  After a few minutes he goes ""Aha!  A solution exists!"" and goes back to frying the egg.Sequel:  This time they are asked simply to fry an egg (no fire).  The engineer just does it, kludging along; the physicist calculates carefully and produces a carefully cooked egg; and the mathematician lights a fire in the corner, and says ""I have reduced it to the previous problem.""</p>

"
15267,"<p>I.<br /> Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern<br /> for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage<br /> by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him in an open area where he<br /> can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more<br /> than four feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and<br /> close the sliding -glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A simple<br /> shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower<br /> curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.)<br /> II.<br /> Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from<br /> your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to<br /> protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top construction<br /> boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey face-mask, and a<br /> long-sleeved flak jacket. </p>
<p>III.<br /> Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply<br /> carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire.<br /> They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule.) </p>
<p>IV.<br /> . Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a<br /> single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure, slide<br /> the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo. You<br /> have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. </p>
<p>V.<br /> Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem<br /> is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more than two or<br /> three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember to give<br /> him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring free and<br /> fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national record for<br /> cats is three latherings, so don't expect too much.) </p>
<p>IV.<br /> Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this part will<br /> be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point and the<br /> cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple compared<br /> with what you have just been through. That's because by now the cat is<br /> semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop the drain plug with<br /> your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will<br /> end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing<br /> you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After<br /> all the water is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down<br /> and dry the cat. In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your<br /> leg. He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend a<br /> lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic and<br /> develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine. You will be tempted to assume he<br /> is angry. This isn't usually the case. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to<br /> get through your defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to<br /> give him a bath. But at least now he smells a lot better</p>

"
15389,"<p>Let's say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else. </p>
<p>And then, one evening when they're driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: ''Do you realize that, as of tonight, we've been seeing each other for exactly six months?'' </p>
<p>And then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Gee, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of. </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months. </p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward . . . I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person? </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: . . . so that means it was . . . let's see. .. February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer's, which means . . . lemme check the odometer . . . Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here. </p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: He's upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected. </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600. </p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure. </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: They'll probably say it's only a 90-day warranty. That's exactly what they're gonna say, the rats. </p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy. </p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it right up their ... </p>
<p>''Roger,'' Elaine says aloud. </p>
<p>''What?'' says Roger, startled. </p>
<p>''Please don't torture yourself like this,'' she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. ''Maybe I should never have . . . I feel so . . ."" (She breaks down, sobbing.) </p>
<p>''What? ' says Roger. </p>
<p>''I'm such a fool,'' Elaine sobs. ''I mean, I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse.'' </p>
<p>''There's no horse?'' says Roger. </p>
<p>''You think I'm a fool, don't you?'' Elaine says. </p>
<p>''No!'' says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer. </p>
<p>''It's just that . . . It's that I . . . I need some time,'' Elaine says. (There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.) </p>
<p>''Yes,'' he says. (Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.) </p>
<p>''Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?'' she says. </p>
<p>''What way?'' says Roger. </p>
<p>''That way about time,'' says Elaine. </p>
<p>''Oh,'' says Roger. </p>
<p>''Yes.'' (Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.) </p>
<p>''Thank you, Roger,'' she says. </p>
<p>''Thank you,'' says Roger. </p>
<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechs he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it. (This is also Roger's policy regarding world hunger.) </p>
<p>The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: ''Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?''</p>

He had a wooden leg, a hook where his right hand should be and a patch over his right eye. The agent assured him that he would be compensated  if the injuries were work related. ""How did you get the wooden leg?"" asked the agent. In a booming voice the pirate replied, ""Me and me mates were on the high seas when the boom swang 'round and knocked me into the sea where a shark bit off me leg."" The agent replied, ""That is certainly work related. How did you lose your hand?"" ""Well matey, me and me mates were on the high seas when the boom swang 'round and knocked me into the sea where a shark bit off me hand,"" said the pirate. ""That's also work related. Now how did you lose your eye?"" asked the agent. The pirate replied, ""Well matey, I was laying on the deck one balmy day catching some rays when this seagull flew by and dropped his duty right in me eye!"" ""What does that have to do with the loss of your eye?"" said the agent. ""It were the first day with me hook!""</p>

15397,"<p>Dear Diary:</p>
<p>Day 1<br /> Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to celebrate. When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, he locked himself in the bathroom and cried.</p>
<p>Day 2<br /> Today, he says he has a big secret to tell me. He's impotent, he says, and he wants me to be the first to know. Why doesn't he tell me something I don't know! I mean, gimme a break. He's been dysfunctional for so long that he even walks with a limp.</p>
<p>Day 3<br /> This marriage is in trouble. A woman has needs. Yesterday, I saw a picture of the Washington Monument and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Day 4<br /> A miracle has happened! There's a new drug on the market that will fix his 'problem.' It's called Viagra. I told him that if he takes Viagra, things will be just like they were on our wedding night. He said, 'this time, I'd rather not have your mother join us.' I think this will work. I replaced his Prozac with the Viagra, hoping to lift something other than his mood.</p>
<p>Day 7<br /> This Viagra thing has gone to his head. No pun intended! Yesterday, at Burger King, the manager asked me if I'd like a Whopper. He thought they were talking about him. Get over yourself! Not everything is about you!</p>
<p>Day 8<br /> I think he took too many over the weekend. Yesterday, instead of mowing the lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed wacker.</p>
<p>Day 10<br /> Okay, I admit it. I'm hiding. I mean, a girl can only take so much. And to make matters worse, he's washing the Viagra down with hard cider! The photo of Janet Reno isn't working. What am I gonna do?</p>
<p>Day 11<br /> The side effects are starting to get to him. Everything is turning blue. The other day, we were watching Kenneth Branaugh in Hamlet and he thought it was The Smurfs Do Denmark.</p>
<p>Day 12<br /> I'm basically being drilled to death. It's like going out with a Black and Decker power tool.</p>
<p>Day 13<br /> I wish he was gay. I bought 400 Liza Minelli albums and I keep saying 'fabulous,' and still he keeps coming after me!</p>
<p>Day 14<br /> Now I know how Saddam Hussein's wife feels. Every time I shut my eyes, there's a sneak attack! It's like going to bed with a scud missile. Let's hope he's not like ex-President Bush and takes 100 days to pull out!</p>
<p>Day 15<br /> I've done everything to turn him off. Nothing is working. I even started dressing like a nun. Now he tells me sister Wendy revs his motor.</p>
<p>Day 16<br /> I may just have to kill him. Then he'll go out the way he wants to... stiff! With my luck, I won't be able to close the casket.</p>

15398,"<p>A very inebriated lady walked into a bar shortly before closing time, sat at<br /> the bar and ordered, ""Bartender, bartender, I would like a Marmots.""</p>
<p>The bartender brought her a Martini, which she drinks in one gulp.</p>
<p>""Bartender, I would like another Marmots"", again the bartender brought her a<br /> Martini. By this time the lady is leaning heavily forward, barely able to hang<br /> on. She called, ""Bartender, your Martoutsys are giving me heartburn�.</p>
<p>Patiently, the bartender came near her and said, ""Lady, I am not a bartender,<br /> but a bartender, and what you have been drinking is not a Marmots, but a<br /> Martini, and finally, you do not have heartburn, your tits are hanging in the<br /> ashtray.""</p>

15400,"<p>Wouldn't it be nice to tell the Dean of your college what you REALLY think<br /> about him/her?</p>
<p>Well,... if you like YOUR Dean as much as I like MY Dean, then you'd<br /> better keep your mouth shut. I knew I'd get kicked out of the college if I<br /> expressed my true feelings, so I remained silent for the last four years.<br /> But yesterday was my graduation. And as I walked across the stage, the<br /> Dean handed my diploma to me (nicely scrolled and tied with a ribbon).</p>
<p>Once she handed it to me, I could finally tell that bitch what I REALLY<br /> thought about her. So I leaned across her podium and I looked her straight<br /> in the eye.</p>
<p>""Hey Bitch,"" I said. ""You're so damn ugly... you could practice birth<br /> control just by leaving the lights on!"" And then I walked off the stage,<br /> and went home. I gotta tell you that it felt just as good as I had<br /> imagined it would forthe last four years.</p>
<p>Today, I unwrapped my diploma, framed it, and hung it in the living room,<br /> where it proudly exclaims to the world:</p>
<p>    ""In order to receive your diploma, please present this certificate<br />      to the Dean of your college after final grades have been posted!""</p>

<p>He said he wanted to give everyone a special gift from just him.<br /> So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair was an envelope; He<br /> said that this was his gift to everyone, and that everyone<br /> should open them at the same time. Inside each envelope was an<br /> eight by ten picture of his best man having sex with the bride.</p>

15433,"<p>After having their 10th child, an Arkansas couple decided that that was enough. So the husband went to his doctor and told him that he and his wife didn't want to have any more children. The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. The doctor told the man that he was to go home, get a cherry bomb, put it in a can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.</p>
<p>The Arky said to the doctor ""I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a can next to my ear is going to help me."" </p>
<p>So the couple drove to Missouri to get a second opinion. The doctor was just about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed they were from Arkansas. This doctor also told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, place it in a tin can, hold it next to his ear and count to 10.</p>
<p>Figuring that both doctors couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count, ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5..."" at which point he paused, placed the can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand.</p>

''Mister, it's caused by loose living, being with cheap, wicked women, too much alcohol, and contempt for your fellow man,'' the priest replied.    ''Imagine that,'' the drunk muttered.  He returned to reading his paper.  The priest, thinking about what he had said,  turned to the man and apologized:  ''I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come on so strong.  How long have you had arthritis?''      ''I don't have arthritis, Father,'' the drunk said, ''but I just read in the paper that the Pope does.''</p>

15458,"<p>A guy from Czechslovakia was visiting his cousin the lawyer in California, and they went for a hike in Yellowstone Park. While they were hiking they were attacked by 2 bears, one male and one female. The male bear dismembered and ate the Czechslovakian guy, but the lawyer managed to escape. He ran straight to the nearest Rangers station, and told them what had happened, and they sent out a group of rangers to see what was going on. Sure enough, the Rangers arrived at the place that the lawyer mentioned, and there were the female and the male bears. So one of the Rangers took his rifle and shot the female. The lawyer turned to the ranger and asked ""Why did you shoot the female? - it was the male that ate my friend"" So the Ranger replies ""Would you believe a lawyer if he told you that the Czech is in the male?""</p>

15483,"<p>In the 80's, a [local] radio station had a couple of DJs who claimed<br /> the stealth fighter had landed at the Mt. Joy airport in Mt. Joy,<br /> Iowa. This is used mainly by the weekend warriors, and once a year<br /> it's used for an air show. The authorities were notified after an<br /> estimated 10,000 people came to the airport. They asked the<br /> people why they were out there, and they were given the story about<br /> the stealth fighter.</p>
<p>The authorities then called the FBI, who talked to the FAA, who<br /> called the FBI back. The two DJs got yanked off the air and<br /> suspended for two weeks -- but not before some people at the<br /> airport, armed with cell phones, called into the station, got put on<br /> the air, and said that they couldn't see the thing. The DJs replied<br /> that it was proof the technology worked.</p>
<p>To top it all off: the DJs said the only way that you could see<br /> the plane was to move your head back and fourth -- like a chicken<br /> when it walks -- and try to catch a glimpse out of the corner of<br /> your eye. They stated that if you looked right at it, you would<br /> never see it. This was believed and a majority of the people were<br /> doing just this when the police arrived!</p>

<p>...I must hold the television remote control in my hand while I watch TV. If the thing has been misplaced, I'll miss a whole show looking for it, though one time I was able to survive by holding a calculator.</p>
<p>...when I lock my keys in the car I will fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we call a road service until long after hypothermia has set in. Oh, and when the car isn't running very well, I will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if I know what I'm looking at. If another guy shows up, one of us will say to the other, ""I used to be able to fix these things, but now with all these computers and everything, I wouldn't know where to start."" We will then drink beer.</p>
<p>...when I catch a cold I need someone to bring me soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan. You never get as sick as I do, so for you this isn't an issue.</p>
<p>...I can be relied upon to purchase basic groceries at the store, like milk, or bread. I cannot be expected to find exotic items like ""Cumin"" or ""Tofu."" For all I know these are the same thing.  And never, under any circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which ""feminine hygiene product"" is a euphemism.</p>
<p>...when one of our appliances stops working I will insist on taking it apart, despite evidence that this will just cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and has to put it back together.</p>
<p>...I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I don't think we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen to a complete stranger-how the heck could HE know where we're going?</p>
<p>...there is no need to ask me what I'm thinking about. The answer is always either sex or football, though I have to make up something else when you ask, so don't.</p>
<p>...I do not want to visit your mother, or have your mother come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or think about her any more than I have to. Whatever you got her for mother's day is ok, I don't need to see it. Did you remember to pick up something for my mom, too?</p>
<p>...I am capable of announcing, ""one more beer and I really have to go,"" and mean it every single time I say it, even when it gets to the point that the one bar closes and my buddies and I have to go hunt down another. I will find it increasingly hilarious to have my pals call you to tell you I'll be home soon, and no, I don't understand why you threw all my clothes into the front yard. What's the connection?</p>
<p>...you don't have to ask me if I liked the movie. Chances are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't.</p>
<p>...I have to turn up the radio when Bruce Springsteen or The Doors comes on, and then, yes, I have to tell you  every single time about how Bruce had his picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek the same day, or how Jim Morrison is buried in Paris and everyone visits his grave. Please do not behave as if you do not find this fascinating.</p>
<p>...I think what you're wearing is fine. I thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too. Either pair of shoes is fine. With the belt or without it looks fine. Your hair is fine. You look fine. Can we just go now?</p>
<p>...and this is, after all, the 90's, I will share equally in the housework. You do the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning, and the dishes. I'll do the rest.</p>

<p>Next the fella from U. of Kentucky was put on the block, and the judge asked<br /> again, ""And what are your final remarks, my boy?"" </p>
<p>""Go to hell!"" shouted the student, and the judge signaled. The razor-sharp<br /> blade fell and miraculously stopped just a quarter inch from the condemned boy's<br /> neck. ""It's the will of God!"" exclaimed the judge. ""Set him free!"" </p>
<p>Finally the Texan was put into position. ""Before you're beheaded,"" said the<br /> judge, ""do you have any last words?"" </p>
<p>""Yeh!"" replied the Aggie. ""If y'all will just put a little more grease on them<br /> grooves, the blade'll come down a whole lot easier!""</p>

<p>At the end of the exam we were informed that there were TWO<br /> tests, alternating by row! He had cheated off the wrong test!</p>

<p>True Tale 12<br /> ------------<br /> I was in a meeting with a manager - one of those meetings where<br /> the sole purpose is for her to make a speech and everyone to be<br /> impressed - and she showed an example of how the figures would<br /> be added up. It became apparent that she had no idea how you add<br /> or subtract negative numbers. I pointed out that the result of<br /> her first example was wrong. What followed was a lively debate<br /> on how you are meant to add or subtract negative numbers. The<br /> prevailing opinion was that there wasn't just one correct way of<br /> doing it, so all the different manufacturers of calculators went<br /> with their own conventions. I was told that my calculator worked<br /> differently than hers. (And how many meetings have you been to<br /> that included a concurrent test of two calculators?)</p>
<p>The meeting ended with her bemoaning the fact that she wasn't<br /> getting any ""buy-in"" for her idea. A few days later she<br /> received, anonymously, a picture of Prof. Stephen Hawking, with<br /> the caption, ""You must be at least this smart to invent your own<br /> branch of math.""</p>
<p>True Tale 13<br /> ------------<br /> An Induhvidual in my physics class did his math with a pen. He<br /> had to use lots of Liquid Paper to cover the mistakes. It was<br /> recommended to him that he use a pencil. The next day I saw him<br /> covering his pencil marks with Liquid Paper.</p>
<p>True Tale 14<br /> ------------<br /> A few days ago I went to the copy place. I needed 80 copies. The<br /> guy told me that if I made fewer than 100 copies, each copy<br /> would cost 4 cents. But if I made at least 100 copies I would<br /> get the discounted rate of 2 cents per copy.</p>
<p>I told him to make 80 copies of the front of the document and<br /> make 20 copies of the blank back. I could use the blank paper<br /> later on for other purposes. He probably never thought of this<br /> situation before; he gave me an angry look but copied the<br /> documents anyway.</p>

<p>True Tale 16<br /> ------------<br /> After pulling a ditsy temp secretary off phone duty (she put my<br /> phone number instead of the caller's on phone messages), I<br /> assigned her to something safe: labeling files. This task did<br /> not include the filing itself, which would have required a<br /> thorough grasp of the alphabet; it only involved affixing<br /> colorful self-adhesive labels to the outside edge of each file<br /> indicating the contract number. The Induhvidual cheerfully<br /> labeled throughout the afternoon, completing 150 files. The next<br /> day, my regular secretary asked why our files had been sealed<br /> closed with colorful self-adhesive labels.</p>

How much this time!"" the hiding lover responds, acknowledging his disadvantage.<br /> ""Fifty dollars."" the boy replies and the transaction is completed.</p>
<p>The next weekend, the little boy's father says ""Hey, son. Go get your<br /> ball and glove and we'll play some catch.""<br /> ""I can't. I sold them"" replies the little boy.<br /> ""How much did you get for them?"" asks the father, expecting to hear the profit in terms of lizards and candy.<br /> ""Seventy-five dollars."" the little boy says.<br /> ""Seventy-five dollars! That's thievery! I'm taking you to the church right now. You must confess your sin and ask for forgiveness."" the father explains, as he hauls the child away.</p>
<p>At the church, the little boy goes into the confessional, draws the curtain, sits down, and says ""It's dark in here, isn't it?""</p>
<p>The priest says...""Don't you start that crap in here now!""</p>

15558,"<p>Friendship Plan Announced This is an addendum to the new compensation/benefits package. BOEING MANAGED FRIENDSHIP Welcome to Boeing Managed Friendship, a whole new way of thinking about friends and relationships at work. With all the recent mergers and buyouts, it is difficult for most people to determine who their real friends are anymore. The Managed Friendship Plan (MFP) combines all the advantages of a traditional friendship network with company-approved representation and important cost-saving features. How Does It Work? Under the Plan, you choose your friends from a network of pre-screened accredited Friendship Providers (FPs). All your friendship needs are met by members of your Managed Friendship Staff. What's Wrong with my Current Friends? If you're like most people, you are receiving friendship services from a network of friendship providers haphazardly patched together from your old neighborhoods, jobs, and schools. The result is often costly duplication, inefficiency, and conflict. Many of your current friends may not meet national standards, responding to your needs with inappropriate, outmoded, or even experimental acts of friendship. Under Managed Friendship, your friendship needs are coordinated by your designated Best Friend, who will ensure the quality and goodness of fit of all your friendly relationships. How Do I Know That the Plan's Panel of Friends Is Not Made Up of a Bunch of Losers Who Can't Make Friends on Their Own? Many of today's most dedicated and highly trained Friendship Providers are as concerned as we are about delivering Quality Friendship in a cost-effective manner. They have joined our network because they want to focus on acting like a friend rather than doing the paperwork and paying the high bad-friendship premiums that have caused the cost of traditional friendship to skyrocket. Our Friendship Providers have met our rigorous standards of companionship and loyalty. What If I Need a Special Friend, Say, for Poker or Fishing? Special Friends are responsible for most of the unnecessary and expensive activities that burden already costly relationships. Under the Managed Friendship Plan, your Best Friend is qualified to pre-approve your referral to a Special Friend within the Managed Friendship Network should your needs fall outside of the scope of his/her friendship. Suppose I Want to See Friends Outside the Managed Friendship Network? You may make friends outside of the Managed Friendship Network only in the event of a Friendship Emergency. What is a Friendship Emergency? The Managed Friendship Plan covers your friendship needs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, even if you need a friend out of town, after regular business hours, or when your Best Friend is with someone else. You might be on a business trip, for instance, and suddenly find that you feel lonely. In such cases, you may make a New Friend, and all approved friendly activities will be covered under the Plan, provided you notify the Managed Friendship Office (our 24-hour Friendship Hotline) within two business days. What Friendly Activities Are Covered Under the Plan?  Friendly Activities that are typically covered include: - - Agreeing with you - Appearing sympathetic - Chewing the fat - Dropping by - Feeling your pain - Gossiping - Hanging out - Holding your hand (up to 5 minutes per activity)* - Joshing - Kidding around - Listening to you whine - Partying - Passing the time - Patting your back - Ribbing - Sharing a meal - Shooting the breeze - Slinging the bull - Teasing *up to 15 minutes under the Premium Gold Friendship Plan What Friendly Activities are not covered by the plan? Activities that would not be pre-approved include (but are not limited to): - Bar hopping - Bending over backwards - Drinking to excess - Giving a hoot - Going the extra mile - Lending money - Real empathy - Sexual favors - Truly caring - Using illicit drugs How Can I Find Out More About the Managed Friendship Plan? A simple call is all it takes.  If you need a friend, just call our toll-free number.  Or visit our web site.  Sign up for the Managed Friendship Plan and rest easier that all of your appropriate friendship needs will be met. Who Decides What's Appropriate for Me? We do.  Isn't that what friends are for?</p>

15568,"<p>Bush and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all. They sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dogfight. They would have 5 years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. </p>
<p>Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk. After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 "" thick and nobody could get near it. </p>
<p>When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a strange looking animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the Afghanistani dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it's cage, and slowly waddled over towards Osama's dog. Osama's dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged the American Dachshund---but when it got close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed Osama's dog in one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all. </p>
<p>Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, ""We don't understand how this could have happened. We had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves."" </p>
<p>""That's nothing,"", said Bush. ""We had Michael Jackson's plastic surgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog."" </p>

<p>If you put a woman on a pedestal and try to protect her from the rat race, you're a male chauvinist. If you stay home and do the housework, you're a pansy.</p>
<p>If you work too hard, there is never any time for her. If you don't work enough, you're a good-for-nothing bum.</p>
<p>If she has a boring repetitive job with low pay, this is exploitation. If you have a boring repetitive job with low pay, you should get off your butt and find something better.</p>
<p>If you get a promotion ahead of her, that is favoritism. If she gets a job ahead of you, it's equal opportunity.</p>
<p>If you mention how nice she looks, it's sexual harassment. If you keep quiet, it's male indifference.</p>
<p>If you cry, you're a wimp.  If you don't, you're insensitive.</p>
<p>If you make a decision without consulting her, you're a chauvinist.  If she makes a decision without consulting you, she's a liberated woman.</p>
<p>If you ask her to do something she doesn't enjoy, that's domination.  If she asks you, it's a favor.</p>
<p>If you like a woman to shave her legs and keep in shape, you're a sexist.  If you don't, you're unromantic.</p>
<p>If you try to keep yourself in shape, you're vain.  If you don't, you're a slob.</p>
<p>If you buy her flowers, you're after something.  If you don't, you're not thoughtful.</p>
<p>If you're proud of your achievements, you're up on yourself.  If you don't, you're not ambitious.</p>

<p>The man pulls a small envelope out of his pocket and empties the contents, an orange powder, onto the desk. ""That's my invention!"" ""You dump this onto a womans pussy and it makes it taste like ORANGES! FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGES! He shouts. </p>

<p>The inventor tells him, ""No, you where right! I was wrong. You straightened me out. I've come up with someting much better and I owe it all to you! That's why I using your bank!"" </p>

15632,"<p>Seven New York City bartenders were asked if they could nail a woman's personality based on what she drinks. Though interviewed separately, they concurred on almost all counts. The results: Drink: Beer Personality: Casual, low-maintenance; down to earth. Your Approach: Challenge her to a game of pool. Drink: Blender Drinks Personality: Flaky, whiny, annoying; a pain in the buttocks. Your Approach: Avoid her, unless you want to be her cabin boy. Drink: Mixed Drinks Personality: Older, more refined, high maintenance, has very picky tastes; knows exactly what she wants. Your Approach: You won't have to approach her, if she is interested, she'll send YOU a drink. Drink: Wine - (does not include White Zinfandel, see below) Personality: Conservative and classy; sophisticated yet giggles. Your Approach: Tell her you love to travel and spend quiet evenings with friends. Drink: White Zinfandel Personality: Easy; thinks she is classy and sophisticated, actually has no clue. Your approach: Make her feel smarter than she is... this should be an easy target. Drink: Shots Personality: Likes to hang with frat-boy pals and looking to get totally drunk... and naked. Your Approach: Easiest hit in the joint. You have been blessed this evening. Nothing to do but wait. However, be careful not to make her mad! Then there is the MALE addendum. The deal with guys is, as always, very simple and clear cut: Domestic Beer: He's poor and wants to get laid. Imported Beer: He likes good beer and wants to get laid. Wine: He's hoping that the wine thing will give him a sophisticated image to help him get laid. Whiskey: He doesn't give a hoot about anything but getting laid. Tequila: He is thinking he has a chance with the toothless waitress. White Zinfandel: He's gay.</p>

15634,"<p>A new priest at his frist mass was so nervous he could heardly speak.<br /> After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.  </p>
<p>The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass.  </p>
<p>If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""  </p>
<p>So the next Sunday the priest took the monsignors advice.<br /> At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.<br /> He proceeded to talk up a storm.<br /> Upon his return to his office he found the following note on the door.</p>
<p>1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.<br /> 2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.<br /> 3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.<br /> 4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.<br /> 5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not get his ass.<br /> 6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ and his apostles as J.C. and the boys.<br /> 7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy,  Junior, and the Spook.<br /> 8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the crap out of him.<br /> 9. When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say...he was stoned off his ass.<br /> 10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T"".<br /> 11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, ""Take this and eat it, for it is my body."" He did not say, ""Eat me.""<br /> 12. The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry.""<br /> 13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the gurb, Yeah! God.<br /> 14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's.</p>

One morning the husband returned after several hours of fishing and decided to take a short nap.  Although she wasn�t familiar with the lake, the wife decided to take the boat.  She rowed out a short distance, anchored, and returned to reading her book.  Along came the sheriff in his boat.  He pulled up along side her and said, �Good morning, Ma�am.  What are you doing?� �Reading my book�, she replied�as she thought to herself, �Isn�t it obvious�?  �You�re in a restricted fishing area,� he informed her.  �But officer, I�m not fishing.  Can�t you see that?�  �Yes, but you have all the equipment.  I�ll have to take you in and write you up.�  �If you do that, I�ll have to charge you with rape�, snapped the irate woman.  �But, I haven�t even touched you,� groused the sheriff.  �Yes, that�s true,� she replied, �but you do have all the equipment.� MORAL:  Never argue with a woman who knows how to read.</p>

15655,"<p>An American earned some bonus from his work and he thought he deserved a<br /> hunting trip to Canada. When he came to Canada he popped in a hunting store for<br /> renting a hunting dog. Before he left, he asked the boss what the dog's name<br /> was, the boss told him the dog's name is ""Sales"". </p>
<p>During the hunting, Sales was so great, he barked when he saw quarries. He<br /> never stopped chasing them until he got them. No need to say, the American<br /> really got a bunch of quarries when he's done this hunting trip. </p>
<p>Couple years after then, this American earned another big bonus again. So he<br /> thought about the Canada hunting trip again. Of course he went to the same<br /> hunting store to rent that dog named Sales as soon as he arrived Canada.<br /> However, the boss told him they didn't call him Sales any more. Just because of<br /> his excellent performance, they called him ""Manager"" now. At the very same<br /> moment, the boss pointed to one corner of the store and told the American, �Now<br /> he does nothing but barks at that corner everyday.""</p>

I am suffering from rare and<br /> deadly diseases, poor scores on final exams, extreme virginity,<br /> fear of being kidnapped and executed by anal electrocution, and<br /> guilt for not forwarding out 50 billion fucking chain letters<br /> sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them<br /> on, then that poor 6 year old girl in Arkansas with a breast on<br /> her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it<br /> removed before her redneck parents sell her off to the<br /> travelling freak show.</p>
<p>Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you and<br /> everyone you send ""his"" email to $1000?</p>
<p>How stupid are you? Ooooh, lookyhere! If I scroll down this page<br /> and make a wish, I'll get laid by every Playboy model in the<br /> magazine! What a bunch of bullshit. So basically, this message<br /> is a big F*CK YOU to all the people out there who have nothing<br /> better to do than to send me stupid chain mail forwards. Maybe<br /> the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my apartment<br /> and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing the chain which<br /> was started by Jesus in 5 A.D. and was brought to this country<br /> by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower and if it makes it to the<br /> year 2000, it'll be in the Guinness Book of World Records for<br /> longest continuous streak of blatant stupidity.</p>
<p>Fuck them.</p>
<p>If you're going to forward something, at least send me something<br /> mildly amusing. I've seen all the ""send this to 50 of your<br /> closest friends, and this poor, wretched excuse for a human<br /> being will somehow receive a nicke from some omniscient being""<br /> forwards about 90 times. I don't f*cking care.</p>
<p>Show a little intelligence and think about what you're actually<br /> contributing to by sending out forwards. Chances are it's your<br /> own unpopularity.</p>
<p>THE FOUR BASIC TYPES OF CHAIN LETTERS:</p>
<p>Chain Letter Type 1:</p>
<p>* (scroll down)</p>
<p>* Make a wish!!!</p>
<p>* No, really, go on and make one!!!</p>
<p>* Oh please, they'll never go out with you!!!</p>
<p>* Wish something else!!! </p>
<p>* Not that, you pervert!!</p>
<p>* Is your finger getting tired yet?</p>
<p>* STOP!!!!</p>
<p>* Wasn't that fun? :)</p>
<p>Hope you made a great wish:)</p>
<p>Now, to make you feel guilty, here's what I'll do. First of all,<br /> if you don't send this to 5096 people in the next 5 seconds, you<br /> will be raped by a mad goat and thrown off a high building into<br /> a pile of manure. It's true!</p>
<p>Because, THIS letter isn't like all of those fake ones, THIS one<br /> is TRUE!!</p>
<p>Really!!! Here's how it goes:</p>
<p>Send this to 1 person: One person will be pissed off at you for<br /> sending them a stupid chain letter.</p>
<p>Send this to 2-5 people: 2-5 people will be pissed off at you<br /> for sending them a stupid chain letter. </p>
<p>Send this to 5-10 people: 5-10 people will be pissed off at you<br /> for sending them a stupid chain letter, and may form a plot on<br /> your life.</p>
<p>Send this to 10-20 people: 10-20 people will be pissed off at<br /> you for sending them a stupid chain letter and will napalm your<br /> house.</p>
<p>Thanks!!!! Good Luck!!!</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Chain Letter Type 2</p>
<p>Hello, and thank you for reading this letter. You see, there is<br /> a starving little boy in Baklaliviatatlaglooshen who has no<br /> arms, no legs, no parents, and no goats. This little boy's life<br /> could be saved, because for every time you pass this on, a<br /> dollar will be donated to the Little Starving Legless Armless<br /> Goatless Boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen Fund. Oh, and<br /> remember, we have absolutley no way of counting the emails sent<br /> and this is all a complete load of bullshit.</p>
<p>So go on, reach out.</p>
<p>Send this to 5 people in the next 47 seconds. Oh, and a reminder<br /> - if you accidentally send this to 4 or 6 people, you will die<br /> instantly.</p>
<p>Thanks again!!</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Chain Letter Type 3</p>
<p>Hi there!! This chain letter has been in existence since 1897.<br /> This is absolutely incredible because there was no email then<br /> and probably not as many sad pricks with nothing better to do.<br /> So this is how it works: Pass this on to 15,067 people in the<br /> next 7 minutes or something horrible will happen to you like:</p>
<p>Bizarre Horror Story #1</p>
<p>Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on Saturday. She<br /> had recently recieved this letter and ignored it. She then<br /> tripped in a crack in the sidewalk, fell into the sewer, was<br /> gushed down a drainpipe in a flood of poopie, and went flying<br /> out over a waterfall. Not only did she smell nasty, she died.</p>
<p>This Could Happen To You!!!</p>
<p>Remember, you could end up just like Pinsley. Just send this<br /> letter to all of your loser friends, and everything will be okay.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The point being?</p>
<p>If you get some chain letter that's threatening to leave you<br /> shagless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it.</p>
<p>If it's funny, send it on.</p>
<p>Don't piss people off by making them feel guilty about a leper<br /> in Botswana with no teeth, who's been tied to a dead elephant<br /> for 27 years, whose only saviour is the 5 cents per letter he'll<br /> receive if you forward this mail, otherwise you'll end up like<br /> Miranda.

<p>Unfortunately, he missed one letter and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife, whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor dead. </p>
<p>At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen: </p>

<p>The little boy nodds in a beckoning fashion so the salesman follows him around the house and when he steps up on the back porch.</p>
<p>He looks through the window to see the little boys mother is in a back room getting it on with a billy goat.</p>

However, she could not help but notice that each night, early into their lovemaking, the husband would dash out to the bathroom for several minutes. This tormented her until finally, one night, she followed him. There, in front of the mirror, she found him applying this therapeutic technique: ""She's not my wife... She's not my wife... She's not my wife...""</p>

15672,"<p>One day, a bar owner decided he had enough of the slow business and needed a gimmick. He finally decided on one. He got a horse and put it in the bar. He placed a sign over the horse and had the sign read.<br /> ""Pay $100, make the horse laugh win $1000"" For years, the gimmick worked. Finally, a man walked into the bar saw the sign and asked, ""Is that sign for real?"" The bar owner told him it was. </p>
<p>The man paid $100, walked up to the horse and whispered something to the horse. The horse started to laugh falling to his knees. </p>
<p>The next day, the owner changed the sign. </p>
<p>Pay $100, make the horse cry, win $1000. For years the gimmick worked. One day, the same man walked into the bar and saw the sign. He paid the bar owner $100 and asked for a curtain. The man closed the curtain and then opened it a couple of moments later. The horse was now crying up a storm. </p>
<p>The man walked up to the bar owner and asked for his money. ""Not so fast"", the bar owner said, ""First you have to tell me what you did both times!"" ""Simple"", said the man, ""First I told him I was bigger, this time I proved it""</p>

A prisoner in this vicious thing, My poor defenseless tit!""Take a deep breath"" she said to me, Who does she think she's kidding?!?

You sincerely believe alchohol is the elusive 5th food group. 24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case - coincidence? I think not! Two hands and just one mouth... - now THAT'S a drinking problem! You can focus better with one eye closed. The parking lot seems to have moved while you were in the bar. You fall off the floor... Your twin sons are named Barley and Hops.

15679,"<p>Question: How do you tell the difference between Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Republicans?</p>
<p>The answer can be found by posing the following problem.</p>
<p>You're walking down a deserted street with your wife and two small children.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a dangerous looking man with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, raises the knife, and charges.</p>
<p>You are carrying a Glock and you are an expert shot. You have mere seconds before he reaches you and your family. What do you do?</p>
<p>Democrat's Answer:</p>
<p>Well, that's not enough information to answer the question!</p>
<p>Does the man look poor or oppressed?</p>
<p>Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack?</p>
<p>Could we run away?</p>
<p>What does my wife think?</p>
<p>What about the kids?</p>
<p>Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of his hand?</p>
<p>What does the law say about this situation?</p>
<p>Does the Glock have an appropriate safety built into it?</p>
<p>Why am I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind of message does this send to society and to my children?</p>
<p>Is it possible he'd be happy with just killing me and not my family?</p>
<p>Does he definitely want to kill me, or would he be content just to wound me?</p>
<p>If I were to grab his knees and hold on, could my family get away while he was stabbing me?</p>
<p>Should I call 9-1-1?</p>
<p>Why is this street so deserted?</p>
<p>We need to raise taxes, have a paint and gardening day and make this a happier, healthier street that would discourage such behavior.</p>
<p>This is all so confusing!</p>
<p>I need to debate this with some friends for a few days and try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>Republican's Answer:</p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>Southern Republican's Answer:</p>
<p>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!<br /> Click...(sounds of reloading).</p>

15687,"<p>A man lost two buttons from his shirt and put them in his pants pocket. But the pocket had a hole, so the buttons fell into his shoe.<br /> Unfortunately, the shoe sole also had a hole, so he lost the buttons. Since pockets with holes, holes without buttons, and shoe soles with holes are useless, the man ripped the buttonholes out of his shirt and the pocket from his pants and tossed them in the trash along with the soles of his shoes. After looking in a mirror at the holes in his clothing, he decided to toss his clothes in the trash as well. </p>
<p>A policeman observed all this and asked the man for identification. The man produced a document that he was an ordained minister of the gospel. So, of course, the policeman promptly escorted him to a mental institution. </p>
<p>The minister protested violently, asking why he was receiving such unjust treatment. </p>
<p>""Look, it's the best place for you now,"" the policeman replied, ""Anyone claiming to be a preacher, but who doesn't save souls or wear holy clothes has probably lost his buttons.""</p>

15733,"<p>I, THE UNDERSIGNED, AGREE THAT... 1. In the unlikely event of my not having an orgasm after you've drunkenly rolled on top of me and pumped away for five minutes, wheezing like an old man with emphysema, I shall politely fake one. And it'll be a really good act too, with me saying stuff like ""So THIS is screwing!"" and howling like a cat that's being repeatedly jabbed with a needle. 2. I fully understand that a woman's main role in any relationship is to take the blame. So when you stub your toe in the bathroom or your football teams lose, I agree that - by some complex scientific equation incomprehensible to woman - it will be my fault. Even if I wasn't there. 3. Whenever my friends and I get together for a girlie chat, I will tell them that you are better hung than a large-balled Himalayan yak. 4. And I will also mention this to YOUR friends. A lot. 5. After sex (which I will NEVER refer to as ""making love""), I will not expect you to cuddle me for hours till your arm goes dead. Nor will I let my hair annoyingly get in your face. 6. I will never, ever give your penis a ""cute"" nickname. 7. In bed, I will be happy as can be to try any novel sexual position you fancy. Especially ones where I do all the work and you just lie there, grinning. 8. I will ruthlessly interrogate my attractive female friends and inform you if any of them have the slightest bisexual tendencies. Then I'll invite them around for dinner. And hide their car keys so they have to stay. 9. After we split up, I will never sleep with any of your friends or colleagues. Or anyone else you have ever met. Or may one day meet. And if men attempt to chat me up, I will solemnly inform them that you have ""ruined me for other men."" 10. I understand that mechanical objects like cars, computers, and remote control devices are beyond the comprehension of women. I will only make a fool of myself if I attempt to operate them, so you're in charge of the lot. Except for the oven, iron and the washing machine, of course.

Of course you are on my list, so you will have<br /> to stay -- but you got here a little earlier than I expected and I don't have<br /> your room ready yet.""</p>
<p>The Devil thinks for a moment and says, ""Tell you what I can do. There are a<br /> couple folks here who weren't quite as bad as you were. I can let one of them<br /> go so long as you take their place. I'll even let you decide who gets to<br /> leave.""</p>
<p>Clinton thought that sounded pretty good, so the Devil opened the first room.<br /> In it was Ted Kennedy and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and<br /> surfacing empty handed. Over and over and over. Such was his fate in hell.</p>
<p>""No,"" Bill said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think<br /> I could be doing that all day long.""</p>
<p>The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Newt Gingrich with a<br /> sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, over<br /> and over again.</p>
<p>""No, I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if<br /> all I could do was break rocks all day,"" said Bill.</p>
<p>The devil opened a third door. In it, Clinton�saw Jesse Jackson, lying on the<br /> floor with his arms staked over his head, and his legs staked in a spread<br /> eagle position. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.</p>
<p>His eyes widening in disbelief, Clinton grinned as he took in the whole<br /> picture and said, ""Oh yea, I know can handle this.""</p>

<p>The deal was made and the parrot was brought home complete with a cage. The next day the purchaser went back and said the parrot had yet to say a word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""That's to be expected,"" said the pet shop owner. ""Try getting the bird a few of the toys that were here for the bird to use in the shop.&nbsp;It just needs to feel at home with you.""&nbsp;Toys were purchased and a day went by. The parrot's owner returned and said there still had been no talking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""I see,"" said the pet shop owner.&nbsp;""Perhaps if you got a bird bath, the parrot would start to talk while using it.""&nbsp;A bird bath was purchased and yet another day went by. The next day the owner was back with the same complaint.&nbsp; This time the pet shop owner mentioned that sometimes the bird had been praised in its training by being allowed to ring a little bell.</p>
<p>The parrot's owner bought the bell reluctantly. The following day the parrot's owner was there waiting as the store opened.&nbsp;""Still no luck?"" asked the store owner.</p>
<p>""No. Nothing said yet,"" answered the bird's owner. ""Well, I bet the bird's just lonesome for some of the birds here at the shop."" ""What?&nbsp;You want me to buy another bird!?!"" yelped the unhappy owner of the parrot.</p>
<p>""No, no, calm down,"" reassured the store owner.&nbsp; ""All you have to do is get a mirror and the bird will think it has a companion.""</p>
<p>At last the sale of a mirror was agreed upon. The pet store owner the next day opened the store and found the troublesome customer had returned ... this time with the parrot, only it was dead! ""What happened?"" asked the store owner, ""Didn't the bird ever talk?""&nbsp;</p>

15774,"<p>In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com, did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot. And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg.<br /> Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. </p>
<p>She said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why doth thou travel far from town to town with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?"" And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, Dear?"" </p>
<p>And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)."" </p>
<p>Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. The drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. </p>
<p>A man named Maccabia did secret himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. </p>
<p>And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would work only with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks. </p>
<p>Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."" And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known ""eBay"" he said, ""we need a name that reflects what we are,"" and Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators."" </p>
<p>""YAHOO"", said Abraham. And that is how it all began, It wasn't Al Gore after all.</p>

15775,"<p>So you want a day off. Let's take a look at what you are asking for. There are 365 days per year available for work. There are 52 weeks per year in which you already have 2 days off per week, leaving 261 days available for work. Since you spend 16 hours each day away fron work, you have used up 170 days, leaving only 91 days available. You spend 30 minutes each day on coffee break which counts for 23 days each year, leaving only 68 days available. With a 1 hour lunch each day, you used up another 46 days, leaving only 22 days available for work. You normally spend 2 days per year on sick leave. This leaves you only 20 days per year available for work. We are off 5 holidays per year, so your available working time is down to 15 days. We generously give 14 days vacation per year which leaves only 1 day available for work and I'll be darned if you are going to take that day off!</p>

15778,"<p>A friend just got back from a holiday ski trip to Colorado.One of the women in<br /> the group complained to her husband that she was in dire need of a restroom. He<br /> told her not to worry, that he was sure there was relief waiting at the top of<br /> the lift in the form of a powder room for female skiers in distress. He was<br /> wrong, of course, and the pain did not go away.</p>
<p>Her husband, picking up on the intensity of the pain, suggested that since she<br /> was wearing an all-white ski outfit, she should go off in the woods. No one<br /> would even notice, he assured her. The white will provide more than adequate<br /> camouflage. So she headed for the tree line, began disrobing and proceeded to do<br /> her thing. If you've ever parked on the side of a slope, then you know there is<br /> a right way and wrong way to set up your skis so you don't move. Yup, you got<br /> it. She had them positioned the wrong way.</p>
<p>Without warning, the woman found herself skiing backward, out-of-control,<br /> racing through the trees, somehow missing all of them, and into another slope.<br /> Her derriere and the reverse side were still bare, her pants down around her<br /> knees, and she was picking up speed all the while.</p>
<p>She continued on backwards, totally out-of-control, creating an unusual vista<br /> for the other skiers. The woman skied, if you define that verb loosely, back<br /> under the lift and finally collided violently with a pylon. The bad news was<br /> that she broke her arm and was unable to pull up her ski pants. At long last her<br /> husband arrived, put an end to her nudie show, then went to the base of the<br /> mountain and summoned the ski patrol, who transported her to a hospital.</p>
<p>In the emergency room she was regrouping when a man with an obviously broken<br /> leg was put in the bed next to hers. ""So. How did you break your leg?"" she<br /> asked, making small talk.</p>
<p>""It was the darndest thing you ever saw,"" he said. ""I was riding up this ski<br /> lift, and suddenly I couldn't believe my eyes. There was this crazy woman skiing<br /> backward out-of-control down the mountain with her bare bottom hanging out of<br /> her clothes, and pants down around her knees. I leaned over to get a better look<br /> and I guess I didn't realize how far I'd moved. I fell out of the lift ... ""</p>

The devil begins to laugh as Jesus' terrible slice hits a tree and rolls into the rough. A squirrel scurries by, picks up the ball, and begins to run off with it. The devil can't contain his laughter; tears roll down his cheeks. Then, all of a sudden, a hawk appears from above the treetops, he swoops down snatching the squirrel. The hawk screeches in victory, flying away with the squirrel. Now over the green, the hawk's crushing talons render the squirrel lifeless. The ball falls out of the squirrel's mouth, takes a couple of hops on the green, and lands right in the hole. The devil's grin turns to a smirk as he looks at Jesus and says, ""So ya' wanna play golf...or just fuck around all day?""</p>

15824,"<p>""Equal"" is not always synonymous with ""the same."" Men and women are created equal. But, boys and girls are not born the same.<br /> 1. You throw a little girl a ball, and it will hit her in the nose. You throw a little boy a ball, and he will try to catch it. Then it will hit him in the nose.</p>
<p>2. You dress your little girl in her Easter Sunday best, and she'll look just as pretty when you finally make it to church an hour later. You dress a boy in his Easter Sunday best, and he'll somehow find every mud puddle from your home to the church, even if you're driving there.</p>
<p>3. Boys' rooms are usually messy. Girls' rooms are usually messy, except it's a good smelling mess.</p>
<p>4. A baby girl will pick up a stick and look in wonderment at what nature has made. A baby boy will pick up a stick and turn it into a gun.</p>
<p>5. When girls play with Barbie and Ken dolls, they like to dress them up and play house with them. When boys play with Barbie and Ken dolls, they like to tear off their appendages.</p>
<p>6. Boys couldn't care less if their hair is unruly. If their bangs got cut a quarter-inch too short, girls would rather lock themselves in their room for two weeks than be seen in public.</p>
<p>7. Baby girls find mommy's makeup and almost instintively start painting their face. Baby boys find mommy's makeup and almost instinctively start painting the walls.</p>
<p>8. If a girl accidently burps, she will be embarrassed. If a boy accidently burps, he will follow it with a dozen fake belches.</p>

15845,"<p>Top Ten Reasons Why God Created Eve </p>
<p>10. God was worried that Adam would frequently become lost in the Garden. </p>
<p>9. God knew that one day Adam would require someone to locate and hand him the remote. </p>
<p>8. God knew Adam would never go out and buy himself a new fig leaf when his wore out and would therefore need Eve to buy one for him. </p>
<p>7. God knew Adam would never be able to make a doctor's, dentist, or haircut appointment for himself. </p>
<p>6. God knew Adam would never remember which night to put the garbage on the curb. </p>
<p>5. God knew if the world was to be populated, men would never be able to handle the pain and discomfort of childbearing. </p>
<p>4. As the Keeper of the Garden, Adam would never remember where he left his tools. </p>
<p>3. Apparently, Adam needed someone to blame his troubles on when God caught him hiding in the garden. </p>
<p>2. As the Bible says, It is not good for man to be alone. </p>
<p>And finally, the Number 1 reason why God created Eve... </p>

15882,"<p>SEATTLE'S TURKEY DAY ETIQUETTE It's been 145 years since the first white settlers landed at Alki Beach at Thanksgiving time, took one look at the overcast skies and the sodden, rain-soaked West Seattle terrain, and burst into tears.(History, alas, doesn't record the response of the Native Americans when they spotted those tear-drenched settlers. But they probably were too polite to laugh out loud.)In the intervening years, the first residents and the settlers have worked out the rules for Thanksgiving, Puget Sound style. Here they are, recently updated by an ad hoc Turkey Day committee:DRESS CODE. Thanksgiving Day guests will arrive wearing Seattle tuxes: clean jeans, turtleneck sweaters and down jackets with weathered ski-lift tags. Hiking boots are optional.CONVERSATION'S GAMBIT. Topics will include: 1) the election; 2) previous elections; and, 3) the next election. Several arguments will ensue before the host or hostess declares politics 'off-limits.'CLEANERS' COROLLARY. Spills will happen in direct proportion to the staining capacity of the dish (cranberry sauce rates high) and the expense of dry cleaning the garment.CHRISTMAS CONVENTION. If you are attending a family gathering, expect this reminder: 'Don't forget to bring your Christmas list to Thanksgiving dinner.'MEOW'S MOMENT. The family cat will appear long enough to 1) shed hair on anyone wearing a black or navy-blue sweater; 2) perch on the lap of whoever most dislikes cats; and, 3) insist on sharing the smoked-salmon hors d'oeuvres.OLD-TIMERS' LAMENT. Some oldster in the group will remark that it's a rotten shame there's no longer a Turkey Day football game between Puget Sound and Seattle high-school champs.ELBOW'S LAW. Local custom calls for every left-handed diner to be seated to the right of a right-handed diner, maximizing chances for spills.PORCELAIN'S PROGRESS. At least two different patterns of dinnerware must be visible on Puget Sound tables during every course.SALAD LAW. Tossed salads supplied by guests will arrive with an excess of moisture, supplied by ambient rainfall.  If the day is merely overcast, the host or hostess should add water before serving.MOLDED SALAD LAW. Guaranteed to do one of three things: contain miniature marshmallows, fail to unmold properly, or slide off the serving plate onto the lap of one of the diners.GRAVY'S CONSTANT. The silver gravy boat -- a wedding present from Great Aunt Emma and Uncle Ed -- will vanish before the meal. It will show up next summer when you're searching for beach towels.TURKEY'S GRIPE. One vegetarian guest will complain about the fare, saying, 'Why can't we ever have tofu au gratin?'PIE'S PARADOX. Provide two kinds of pie and diners will either decline or ask for 'a sliver of both.'POLLYANNA'S PRINCIPLE. Guests will include one orphan, someone from out of town who can't make it home. If no orphan is available, the family oddball can substitute.REFRIGERATOR'S RULE. After all guests depart, at least one never-served dish will turn up in the refrigerator.DEPARTURE'S RULE. Some guests will arrive very early; some will show up late. But they'll all leave at the same time.</p>

15884,"<p>There was once a village that was all grass houses. The only<br /> thing of value they had was a butiful gold throne. They new the<br /> tax collecter was coming so they had to hide it otherwise they<br /> would have to sell it to pay for the taxes. So they hid it in<br /> the rafters of the mayors house (his being the bigest) The tax<br /> collecter came and saw they had nothing so he let them pass on<br /> payin taxes. They were all relived but then the throne fell out<br /> of hte rafters and landed on the mayor, killing him.<br /> The moral of this story is; people in grass houses should'nt<br /> stowe thrones</p>

"
15903,"<p>Dear Sirs:<br /> I am responding to your letter denying the deduction for two of the three<br /> dependents I claimed on my 1994 Federal Tax return. Thank you.<br /> I have questioned whether or not these are my children for years. They are<br /> evil and expensive. It's only fair that, since they are minors and no longer my<br /> responsibility, the government should know something about them and what to<br /> expect over the next year. Please do not try to reassign them to me next year<br /> and reinstate the deduction. They are yours!<br /> The oldest, Kristen, is now 17. She is brilliant. Ask her! I suggest you put<br /> her to work in your office where she can answer people's questions about their<br /> returns. While she has no formal training, it has not seemed to hamper her<br /> mastery of any subject you can name. Taxes should be a breeze. Next year she is<br /> going to college. I think it's wonderful that you will now be responsible for<br /> that little expense. While you mull that over, keep in mind that she has a<br /> truck. It doesn't run at the moment, so you have the choice of appropriating<br /> some Department of Defense funds to fix the vehicle, or getting up early to<br /> drive her to school. Kristen also has a boyfriend. Oh joy! While she possesses<br /> all of the wisdom of the universe, her alleged mother and I have felt it best to<br /> occasionally remind her of the virtues of abstinence, or in the face of<br /> overwhelming passion, safe sex. This is always uncomfortable, and I am quite<br /> relieved you will be handling this in the future. May I suggest that you<br /> reinstate Dr. Jocelyn Elders who had a rather good handle on the problem?<br /> Patrick is 14. I've had my suspicions about this one. His eyes are a little<br /> closer together than those of normal people. He may be a tax examiner himself<br /> one day, if he is not incarcerated first. In February, I was awakened at three<br /> in the morning by a police officer who was bringing Pat home. He and his friends<br /> were TP'ing houses. In the future, would you like him delivered to the local IRS<br /> office, or to Ogden, UT? Kids at 14 will do almost anything on a dare. His hair<br /> is purple. Permanent dye, temporary dye, what's the big deal? Learn to deal with<br /> it. You'll have plenty of time, as he is sitting out a few days of school after<br /> instigating a food fight in the cafeteria. I'll take care of filing your phone<br /> number with the vice-principal. Oh yes, he and all of his friends have raging<br /> hormones. This is the house of testosterone and it will be much more peaceful<br /> when he lives in your home. DO NOT leave him or his friends unsupervised with<br /> girls, explosives, inflammables, inflatable, vehicles, or telephones. (They find<br /> telephones a source of unimaginable amusement. Be sure to lock out the 900 and<br /> 976 numbers!)<br /> Heather is an alien. She slid through a time warp and appeared as if by magic<br /> one year. I'm sure this one is yours. She is 10 going on 21. She came from a bad<br /> trip in the sixties. She wears tie-dyed clothes, beads, sandals, and hair that<br /> look like Tiny Tim's. Fortunately you will be raising my taxes to help offset<br /> the pinch of her remedial reading courses. ""Hooked On Phonics"" is expensive, so<br /> the schools dropped it. But here's the good news! You can buy it yourself for<br /> half the amount of the deduction that you are denying me! It's quite obvious<br /> that we were terrible parents ask the other two). She cannot speak English. Most<br /> people under twenty understand the curious patois she fashioned out of valley<br /> girls/boys in the hood/ reggae/yuppie/political double speak. The school sends<br /> her to a speech pathologist that has her roll her r's. It added a refreshing<br /> Mexican/Irish touch to her voice. She wears hats backwards, baggy pants, and<br /> wants one of her ears pierced four more times. There is a fascination with<br /> tattoos that worries me, but I am sure that you can handle it. Bring a truck<br /> when you come to get her, she sort of ""nests"" in her room and I think that it<br /> would be easier to move the entire thing than find out what it is really made<br /> of.<br /> You denied two of the three exemptions, so it is only fair that you get to<br /> pick which two you would take. I prefer that you take the youngest two, I will<br /> still go bankrupt with Kristen's college, but then I am free! If you take the<br /> two oldest, then I still have time for counseling before Heather becomes a<br /> teenager. If you take the two girls, then I won't feel so bad about putting<br /> Patrick in a military academy. Please let me know of your decision as soon as<br /> possible, as I have already increased the withholding on my W-4 to cover the<br /> $395 in additional tax and made a down payment on an airplane.</p>

When you open a new bag of cotton balls, is the top one meant to be thrown away? When your pet bird sees you reading the newspaper, does he wonder Why you're just sitting there, staring at carpeting?

15908,"<p>""Equal"" is not always synonymous with ""the same."" Men and women are created<br /> equal. But, boys and girls are not born the same.<br /> 1. You throw a little girl a ball, and it will hit her in the nose. You throw<br /> a little boy a ball, and he will try to catch it. Then it will hit him in the<br /> nose.<br /> 2. You dress your little girl in her Easter Sunday best, and she'll look<br /> just as pretty when you finally make it to church an hour later. You dress a boy<br /> in his Easter Sunday best, and he'll somehow find every mud puddle from your<br /> home to the church, even if you're driving there.<br /> 3. Boys' rooms are usually messy. Girls' rooms are usually messy, except it's<br /> a good smelling mess.<br /> 4. A baby girl will pick up a stick and look in wonderment at what nature has<br /> made. A baby boy will pick up a stick and turn it into a gun.<br /> 5. When girls play with Barbie and Ken dolls, they like to dress them up and<br /> play house with them. When boys play with Barbie and Ken dolls, they like to<br /> tear off their appendages.<br /> 6. Boys couldn't care less if their hair is unruly. If their bangs got cut a<br /> quarter-inch too short, girls would rather lock themselves in their room for two<br /> weeks than be seen in public.<br /> 7. Baby girls find mommy's makeup and almost instinctively start painting<br /> their face. Baby boys find mommy's makeup and almost instinctively start<br /> painting the walls.<br /> 8. If a girl accidentally burps, she will be embarrassed. If a boy<br /> accidentally burps, he will follow it with a dozen fake belches.<br /> 9. Boys grow their fingernails long because they're too lazy to cut them.<br /> Girls grow their fingernails long - not because they look nice - but because<br /> they can dig them into a boys arm.<br /> 10. Girls are attracted to boys, even at an early age. At an early age, boys<br /> are attracted to dirt.<br /> 11. By the age of 6, boys will stop giving their dad kisses. By the age of 6,<br /> girls will stop giving their dad kisses unless he bribes them with candy.<br /> 12. Most baby girls talk before boys do. Before boys talk, they learn how to<br /> make machine-gun noises.<br /> 13. Girls will cry if someone dies in a movie. Boys will cry if you turn off<br /> the VCR after they've watched ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie three times<br /> in a row.<br /> 14. Girls turn into women. Boys turn into bigger boys.</p>

<p>He thinks it was a figment of his imagination and drives on without<br /> a second thought... Soon he sees another sign, which says:<br /> SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS<br /> HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION<br /> 5 MILES</p>
<p>Suddenly, he begins to realize that these signs are for<br /> real... Then he drives past a third sign saying:<br /> SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS<br /> HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION<br /> NEXT RIGHT</p>
<p>His curiosity gets the best of him and he pulls into the<br /> drive... On the far side of the parking lot is a stone building with a<br /> small sign next to the door reading:<br /> SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS</p>
<p>He climbs the steps and rings the bell. The door is answered by a nun in a long black habit who asks, ""What may we do for you, my son?""</p>
<p>He answers, ""I saw your signs along the highway, and was interested in<br /> possibly doing business.""</p>
<p>""Very well, my son. Please follow me."" He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. The nun stops at a closed door and tells the man, ""Please knock on this door.""</p>
<p>He does as he is told and another nun in a long habit, holding a<br /> tin cup answers the door. This nun instructs, ""Please place $100 in the<br /> cup, then go through the large wooden door at the end of this way.""</p>
<p>He gets $100 out of his wallet and places it in the second nuns cup. He trots eagerly down the hall and slips through the door, pulling it shut behind him. As the door locks behind him, he finds himself<br /> back in the parking lot, facing another small sign:</p>
<p>GO IN PEACE.<br /> YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SCREWED<br /> BY THE SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS.<br /> SERVES YOU RIGHT,<br /> YOU SINNER.</p>

15930,"<p>Little Johnny was 12 years old and, like other boys his age, was rather<br /> curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about ""courting"" from older boys and he<br /> wondered what it was like and how it was done. One day he took his question to<br /> his mother who became rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny,<br /> his mother told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older<br /> sister and her boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described<br /> everything to his mom. ""Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile then he<br /> turned off most of the lights. He then started hugging and kissing her. I<br /> figured Sis must be getting sick because her face started to look funny. He must<br /> have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart<br /> just like the doctor would do. He was not as smart as a doctor because he seemed<br /> to be having trouble finding it. ""I guess he was getting sick too because pretty<br /> soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand<br /> must have been cold because he put it in her skirt. About this time Sis got<br /> worse and began to moan and groan and squirm around and slide down towards the<br /> end of the couch. This is when the fever started. ""I knew it was the fever<br /> because Sis said she felt real hot. Finally I found out what was making them so<br /> sick. A big eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his<br /> pants and stood there, about 10 inches long, honest. Anyway, he grabbed it in<br /> one hand to keep it from getting away. ""When Sis saw it, she got real scared,<br /> her eyes got big and her mouth fell open and started calling to God and stuff.<br /> She said it was the biggest one she ever saw...... I should have told her about<br /> the one down at the lake. ""Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its<br /> head off. All of a sudden she made a noise and let the eel go. I guess it bit<br /> her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while her<br /> boyfriend took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel`s head to<br /> keep it from biting again. ""Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a<br /> scissor lock on it and he helped by laying on top of the eel. The eel put up a<br /> hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost<br /> upset the couch. I guess he wanted to kill it by squeezing it between them.<br /> ""After a while they both quit moving and a great sigh came forth. Her boyfriend<br /> got up, and sure enough, the eel was dead. I knew it was dead because it just<br /> hung there limp with some of its insides hanging out. ""Sis and her boyfriend<br /> were a little tired from the battle but they went on courting anyways. He<br /> started hugging and kissing her again. By golly the eel wasn`t dead after all.<br /> It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats<br /> with 9-lives. ""This time Sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on<br /> it. After 35 minutes of struggling, they finally killed it. I knew it was dead<br /> because I saw Sis`s boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the<br /> toilet.....""</p>

Each afternoon she'd take a frankfurter from her refrigerator and put it in a hole on her trailer floor. Then she'd sit on it and have a ball.""</p>
<p>""She nearly drove me crazy. So I got a bright idea. One day I got under her trailer and when she slid the frankfurter into the hole, I slid it out and slipped my penis up through the hole."" ""She sat down on it and everything was great until there was a knock at the door.""</p>
<p>""And then?"" said the doctor. ""Aw hell,"" the patient explained.</p>

He said down here mam, she bent down to Bill and said what can I do for you young man. he said I have $10.00 here mam and I need to have sex with you.

Bill gave her a big frown and started to walk away and the lady said wait! look go down the road one block and turn left and go to the pink house on the corner and I think you will find what your looking for. So the boy went on his way and found the house. He stood up and smiled and knocked on the door. At that moment he heard a cough and then another cough and then he heard an old hag clearing her throat and spitting. Then out of the shadow he saw this nasty old ugly bitch that he could smell as she walked to the door. She said hello boy what can I do for you. He said mam I have $10.00 and I need sex with you and right now. She said look for $10.00 go get you a clean girl and he said no mam you dont understand I need to have sex with a whore that has Herpies, Crabs, VD STD and what ever else I can catch and then Im going home and have sex with my baby sitter and then dad is going to have sex with the baby sitter and then dad will have sex with mom and then mom will have sex with the fucking mail man and thats the sonofabitch I aim to get because he ran over my damn pet frog Herman!!!!!!!.</p>
