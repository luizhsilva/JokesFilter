20001,"<p>The local sheriff was looking for a deputy, so Gomer - who was not exactly the sharpest nail in the bucket - went in to try out for the job. 'Okay,' the sheriff drawled, 'Gomer, what is 1 and 1?' '11' he replied. The sheriff thought to himself, 'That's not what I meant, but he's right.' 'What two days of the week start with the letter 'T'?' 'Today and tomorrow.' He was again surprised that Gomer supplied a correct answer that he had never thought of himself. 'Now Gomer, listen carefully: Who killed Abraham Lincoln?' Gomer looked a little surprised himself, then thought really hard for a minute and finally admitted, 'I don't know.' 'Well, why don't you go home and work on that one for a while?' So, Gomer wandered over to the barbershop where his pals were waiting to hear the results of the interview. Gomer was exultant. 'It went great! First day on the job and I'm already working on a murder case!'</p>

20003,"<p>A fellow walks into a bar very down on himself.    As he walks up to the bar the bartender asks,   ""what's the matter?""The fellow replies, ""well I've got these two   horses (sniff,sniff), and well... I can't tell   them apart.  I don't know if I'm mixing up riding   times or even feeding them the right foods.""     The bartender, feeling sorry for the guy, tries  to think of somthing he can do.""Why don't   you try shaving the tail of one of the horses?""    The man stops crying and says, ""that sounds like a good idea, I think I'll try   it.""   A few months later he comes back to the bar in worse condition than he was before.""What's the   matter now?"" the bartender asks.    The fellow, in no condition to be in public,   answers,  ""I shaved the tail of one of the   horses (sob, sob), but it grew back and I can't   tell them apart again!""      The bartender, now just wanting him to shut up   or leave says,  ""why don't you try   shaving the mane, maybe that will not grow   back.""   The fellow stops crying, has a few drinks, and leaves.    A few months later the fellow is back in the   bar.  The bartender has never seen anybody in   this sorry of a state. Without the bartender   even asking the fellow breaks into his problems.   ""I.. I shaved the (sob) mane of one of the   (sniff) horses, and... it... it... grew back!""The bartenter, now furious at the guy's general   stupidity,  yells, ""for crying out loud,  just   measure the stupid horses. Perhaps one is   slightly taller that the other one!""      The fellow can not believe what the bartender   has said and storms out of the bar.    The next day the fellow comes running back into   the bar as if he had just won the lottery.""It   worked, it worked!"" he exclaims.""I measured the   horses and the black one is two inches taller   than the white one!""</p>

20005,"<p>It was Saturday morning as Jake, an avid hunter, woke up ready to go bag the first deer of the season. He walked down to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee, and to his surprise he found his wife, Alice, sitting there, fully dressed in camouflage. </p>
<p>Jake asked her, ""What are you up to?"" </p>
<p>Alice smiled. ""I'm going hunting with you!"" </p>
<p>Jake, though he had many reservations about this, reluctantly decided to take her along. Later they arrived at the hunting site. Jake set his wife safely up in the tree stand and told her, ""If you see a deer, take careful aim and I'll come running back as soon as I hear the shot."" </p>
<p>Jake walked away with a smile on his face knowing that Alice couldn't bag an elephant, much less a deer. Not 10 minutes passed when he was startled as he heard an array of gunshots. </p>
<p>Quickly, Jake ran back. As Jake got closer to her stand, he heard Alice screaming: ""Get away from my deer!"" </p>
<p>Confused, Jake raced faster towards his screaming wife. And again he heard her yell: ""Get away from my deer!"" followed by another volley of gunfire! </p>
<p>Now within sight of where he had left his wife, Jake was surprised to see a guy standing there with his hands high in the air. The guy, obviously distraught, said, ""Okay, lady, okay!!!! You can have your deer!!! Just let me get my saddle off it!""</p>

20007,"<p>How does a blonde like her eggs?</p>
<p>Unfertilized.</p>
"
20008,"<p>1. Enter the stall. Shower for about 3 minutes, then scream really loudly, exclaiming, ""I didn't know I had one of THOSE!"" </p>
<p>2. Enter the stall, fully clothed. Do not undress and make sure your clothes get all wet and soapy. Complain when leaving the bathroom that your shirt tends to bleed. </p>
<p>3. Ask Scottie to beam you up. </p>
<p>4. Enter the stall, undress and then re-dress up as Superman. Leap out of the stall, vengefully vow to stop Lex Luther's evil plot, then run full force into the wall. Stand up, shake your head, and proceed to take your shower. </p>
<p>5. Bring a bottle of fake blood or ketchup into the shower with you. Exclaim ""Ow! You know, it really hurts when you pop one of those."" Then let the blood/ketchup seep down the drain for all to see. </p>
<p>6. Bring in a rubber chicken. Get it all soapy, then toss in into the next stall. Demand that the person in that stall return it to you, or you will cast a voodoo curse on them. The next day, hang the chicken from the bathroom lighting fixtures by a noose and stick numerous pins and forks in it. </p>
<p>7. Have a seizure. Bang against the walls of the stall really hard. Try to knock them down. If anyone later asks if you are okay, just say that you had some Mexican Jumping Fava Beans and they were reacting negatively with your stomach. </p>
<p>8. Stand in the bathroom, waiting for would-be shower-goers. When they come in, tell them ""not to do it"" and ask them ""not to give in to sin."" Wail mournfully when they step into the shower. </p>
<p>9. Initiate a war with the person in the stall next to you. Use the residual water on the floor as your battle medium, and float little battleships over to their side. If they kick them back or throw them over the edge, exclaim that you didn't know they had the power of God and sheepishly mumble prayers for the duration of your shower. </p>
<p>10. Bring in a fake finger. Float it down the drainage ""ditch."" Ask if someone would be so kind as to return it to you. If no one does, tell them that the finger has been sacrificed to Satan and that the shower stalls are now possessed. Hang Halloween decorations and crepe-paper ghosts from them the next day. </p>
<p>11. Bang your head against the stall wall, shouting ""Redrum! Redrum!"" in your best groggy voice. </p>
<p>12. Bring a Yoo-Hoo chocolate milk drink to the shower with you. Complain about a stomach ache, then moan ""Ohhhh, um, uh-oh,"" and squirt the Yoo-Hoo down the drain ""ditch"" for all to see. </p>
<p>13. Before you turn the shower on, make a noise like you are charging up a proton pack from Ghostbusters. Before you turn it off, ask Egon to set the trap up for you. </p>
<p>14. Bring a balloon into the shower. Make the balloon squeak for the duration of your bathing experience. Then pop it, and fall to the ground as if shot. </p>
<p>15. Bring dead fish into the shower with you. Let them float down the drainage ""ditch"", complaining angrily about the quality of water these days. </p>
<p>16. Hang up the names of different farm animals in the stalls. Have everyone entering the stalls join you in a rendition of ""Old McDonald Had A Farm,"" making the sound of the animal in their stall. </p>
<p>17. Turn the stall into a shrine for a pagan god. Call him Weeshy. Insist that anyone who uses that stall must tithe to receive his benevolence and glory. If they don't tithe, avoid them for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>18. Take your shower like normal, and then begin screaming that the Communists are taking over. Make battle sounds -- including bombs, bazookas, and tanks. Towards the end, wearily declare victory. Leave wounded. </p>
<p>19. Blow bubbles. Exclaim that you are dissolving. </p>
<p>20. Bring in a bucket, fill it with water, and float a bar of soap in it. Charge a fee for people to see the Wicked Witch of the West bathing nude. Threaten anyone who laughs at you with flying monkeys. </p>
<p>21. Start singing Pavarotti really loud. In the middle, stop, stutter for a second, and then exclaim ""Ohmigosh...do you know what these words REALLY mean?"" </p>
<p>22. Suck on the faucet head until you fill up with water. Complain that the Seven Chinese Brothers get no respect, OR pretend to be a fountain. </p>
<p>23. Wet your head, and then sneak into a toilet stall. Flush the bowl and wait a minute. Walk out of the stall lurching, complaining about how dizzy you are. </p>
<p>24. Buy a bunch of those tiny animal-pills that expand into full, spongy shapes when they get wet. Bring them into the shower and spill them into the ditch. Ask somebody for your pills back, and when they hand you little animals, scream, slap them, and run away. </p>
<p>25. Make your best Psycho noise (reeEENT reeEENT...). </p>
<p>26. Try to get everyone in the other stalls to sing in four-part harmony with you. If this actually works, change your voice part every three measures. </p>
<p>27. Become a shower-pirate. Loot other stalls of soap, Oxy pads, and Q-Tips. Bury them under the tile floor. Fire cannons at people using toilet balls. </p>
<p>28. Bring scuba gear into the shower with you. Talk to Cousteau. Upon leaving, tell everyone that the Titanic was actually torpedoed by the Germans. Be cocky. </p>
<p>29. Hum for a couple of moments, stop, make an ""Mmmm!"" sound, and then announce to everyone that the mildew on the shower walls kind of tastes like head cheese. </p>
<p>30. Coat the floor in a fine layer of quick-drying cement. </p>
<p>31. Hang ""Marisa Cevasco steals Homecoming Queen Crown"" signs in all the stalls. If anyone asks who Marisa Cevasco is, call them ignorant and ignore them for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>32. Bring in Sesame Street bath books. Read them aloud. Giggle every time Bert walks in on Ernie bathing. </p>
<p>33. Stare at people's feet as they bathe. If they do not wash their feet, tell them to. If this happens a second time, steal their shoes and tell them that they left on strike. If they DO wash their feet and fall down while doing it, laugh hysterically. </p>
<p>34. Stand outside the shower curtain, raise a harpoon, and shout ""I'm coming for you, Moby!"" Run in and do battle with the faucet-head. Walk out a peg leg. </p>
<p>35. Charge a toll for people wanting to use the shower. If they complain, light them on fire. THEN they'll pay</p>

20011,"<p>To My Dearest Wife,</p>
<p>During the past year, I have attempted to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of only once every 10 days. The following is a list of why I didn't succeed more often:</p>
<p>We will wake the kids - 54 times</p>
<p>It's too late - 15 times</p>
<p>I'm too tired - 42 times</p>
<p>It's too early - 12 times</p>
<p>It's too hot - 18 times</p>
<p>Pretending to be asleep - 31 times</p>
<p>The neighbors will hear - 9 times</p>
<p>Headache or backache - 26 times</p>
<p>Sunburn - 10 times</p>
<p>Your mother will hear us - 9 times</p>
<p>Not in the mood - 21 times</p>
<p>Watching the late show - 17 times</p>
<p>Too sore - 26 times</p>
<p>New hairdo - 6 times</p>
<p>Wrong time of the month - 14 times</p>
<p>You had to go to the bathroom - 19 times</p>
<p>Of the 36 times that I DID succeed, the result was not always satisfying because 6 times you just laid there, 8 times you reminded me that there was a crack in the ceiling, 4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with, 7 times I had to wake you up to tell you I was finished, and once I was afraid that I had hurt you because you started thrashing around and breathing heavy. Let's try to improve this, shall we??</p>
<p>Love, Your Hubby</p>
<p>**********************</p>
<p>To My Dearest Husband,</p>
<p>I think things are a little confused. Here are the REAL reasons you didn't get more than you did this past year:</p>
<p>Came home drunk and tried to screw the cat - 23 times</p>
<p>Did not come home at all - 36 times</p>
<p>Did not come - 21 times</p>
<p>Came too soon - 38 times</p>
<p>Went soft before you got it in - 19 times</p>
<p>Cramps in your leg - 16 times</p>
<p>Working too late - 33 times</p>
<p>You had a rash, probably from a toilet seat - 29 times</p>
<p>Caught yourself in your zipper - 15 times</p>
<p>You had a cold and your nose kept running - 21 times</p>
<p>You had burned your tongue on hot coffee - 9 times</p>
<p>You had a splinter in your finger - 11 times</p>
<p>You lost the notion after thinking about it - 42 times</p>
<p>Came in your pajamas after reading a dirty book - 16 times</p>
<p>The reason I laid still was because you had missed me and were screwing the sheet. You seemed to be having a good time and I didn't want to move and spoil it for you. I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling. </p>
<p>What I said was, ""Would you like me on my back or kneeling?"" The time I was thrashing around and gasping was when you farted and I was fighting for air. Maybe you can work on your ""shortcomings?""</p>
<p>Love, Your Wife</p>

"
20016,"<p>If operating systems were airlines, what kind of service would they offer?<br /> Here is a lighthearted look at what passengers could expect.</p>
<p>DOS Air:<br /> All the passengers go out onto the runway, grab hold of the plane, push it<br /> until it gets in the air, hop on, jump off when it hits the ground again,<br /> push it back into the air, hop on, and so on.</p>
<p>Mac Airways:<br /> The cashiers, flight attendants and pilots all look the same, feel the<br /> same and act the same. When asked questions about the flight, they reply<br /> that you don't want to know, don't need to know and would you please<br /> return to your seat and watch the movie.</p>
<p>Windows Airlines:<br /> The terminal is very neat and clean, the attendants are all very<br /> attractive, the pilots very capable. The fleet of Lear jets the carrier<br /> operates is immense. Your jet takes off without a hitch, pushing up above<br /> the clouds and, at 20,000 feet, it explodes without warning.</p>
<p>OS/2 Skyways:<br /> The terminal is almost empty with only a few prospective passengers<br /> milling about. The announcer says that their flight has just departed and<br /> wishes them a good flight, although there are no planes on the runway.<br /> Airline personnel walk around, apologizing profusely to customers in<br /> hushed voices, pointing from time to time to the sleek powerful jets<br /> outside the terminal on the field. They tell each passenger how good the<br /> real flight will be on these new jets and how much safer it will be than<br /> Windows Airlines but that they will have to wait a little longer for the<br /> technicians to finish flight systems.</p>
<p>Fly Windows NT:<br /> All the passengers carry their seats out onto the tarmac, placing the<br /> chairs in the outline of a plane. They all sit down, flap their arms and<br /> make jet swooshing sounds as if they are flying.</p>

20034,"<p>Basic Rules for Cats Who Have a House to Run</p>
<p>1. CHAIRS AND RUGS: If you have to throw up, get into a chair quickly. If you cannot manage in time, get to an Oriental rug. If no Oriental rug is available, shag is good.</p>
<p>2. DOORS: Do not allow closed doors in any room. To get a door opened, stand on hind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is opened, it is not necessary to use it.After you have ordered an outside door opened, stand halfway in and out and think about several things, This is particularly important during very cold weather, rain, snow, and mosquito season.</p>
<p>3. GUESTS: Quickly determine which guest hates cats the most. Sit on that human's lap. If you can, arrange to have ""Friskies Fish n' Glop"" on your breath. For sitting on laps or rubbing against clothing, select fabric color which contrasts well with your fur. For example: white furred cats go to black wool clothing. For the guest who claims, ""I love kitties,"" be ready with aloof disdain; apply claws to stockings or use a quick nip on the ankle. When walking among the dishes on the dinner table, be prepared to look surprised and hurt when scolded. The idea is to convey, ""But you always allow me on the table when company isn't here."" Always accompany guests to the bathroom. It isn't necessary to do anything. Just sit and stare.</p>
<p>4. WORK:  If one of your humans is sewing or writing and another is idle, stay with the busy one. This is called helping, otherwise known as hampering. Following are the rules for hampering: A. When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook. You can't be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on, picked up and consoled. B.

<p>The boy explained that he would have to ask the manager and so he walked into the back room and said, ""There is some jerk out there who wants to buy only a half a head of lettuce."" </p>
<p>As he finished saying this, he turned around to find the man standing right behind him, so he quickly added, ""and this gentleman wants to buy the other half"". </p>
<p>The manager okayed the request and the man went on his way. </p>
<p>Later on the manager said to the boy, ""You almost got yourself in a lot of trouble earlier, but I must say I was impressed with the way you got out of it. You think on your feet and we like that around here. Where are you from son?"" </p>
<p>The boy replied, ""Minnesota sir"". </p>

20055,"<p>Let's face it -- English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant not ham in hamburger; neither apple or pine in pineapple. English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.</p>
<p>We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.</p>
<p>And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices?</p>
<p>Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend, that you comb through annals of history but not a single annal? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?</p>
<p>If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetraian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? If you wrote a letter, perhaps you bote your tongue?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? Park on driveways and drive on parkways?</p>
<p>How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the sanme, while a wise man and wise guy are opposites? How can overlook and oversee be opposites, while quite alot and quite a few are alike? How can the weather be hot as hell one day and cold as hell another.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that we talk about certain things only when they are absent?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a horseful carriage or a strapful gown? Met a sung hero or experienced requited love? Have you ever run into someone who was combobulated, gruntled, ruly or peccable? And where are all those people who ARE spring chickens or who would ACTUALLY hurt a fly?</p>
<p>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm clock goes off by going on.</p>
<p>English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race at all). That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible. And why, when I wind up my watch, I start it, but when I wind up this essay, I end it.</p>

20060,"<p>I used to pull this joke regularly on all new arrivals into our department. I had fashioned a sort of catapult using a very flexible plastic ruler and cable-end-cap attached to the end of the ruler (a cable-end-cap is about the size and shape of an aerosol can cap). Inside the victim's pencil drawer (sometimes known as a lap drawer) I would tape the end of the ruler opposite the cap to the bottom of the drawer. This way I could fold the cap end of the ruler back so that the cap would be open-end-up. I would then fill the cap with hole-punch ""confetti"" and close the drawer holding the ""catapult"" in the ""cocked"" position. Then when the victim opened the drawer, the device would launch the confetti into the victim's lap, face, or whatever else might be in the line of fire. </p>
<p>Finally one coworker decided to effect revenge. He placed a couple pieces of confetti on my floor, but did nothing else. Being the cautious type, I immediately noticed the confetti pieces and checked my storage place for my catapult. It was gone. I then very cautiously set about searching my cubicle for the loaded launcher with the intent of not tripping it. About a half hour later I began to realize I had been had. A quick and careful scrutiny of the faces of my neighbors confirmed my suspicion.</p>

He &gt; &gt; &gt; approached her and asked, ""Ms. &gt; &gt; &gt; Jones, do you know me? &gt; &gt; &gt; ""She responded, ""Why, yes, I do know you Mr. &gt; &gt; &gt;  Williams. I've known you since &gt; &gt; &gt;  you were a young boy, and frankly, you've been a big &gt; &gt; &gt; disappointment to me. &gt; &gt; &gt; You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate &gt; &gt; &gt;  people and talk about &gt; &gt; &gt; them behind their backs. You think you're a rising &gt; &gt; &gt;  big shot when you &gt; &gt; &gt;  haven't the brains to realize you never will amount &gt; &gt; &gt;  to anything more than a &gt; &gt; &gt;  two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you."" &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;  The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, &gt; &gt; &gt;  he pointed across the &gt; &gt; &gt;  room and asked, ""Ms. Williams, do you know the &gt; &gt; &gt;  defense attorney?""  She &gt; &gt; &gt;  again replied, ""Why, yes I do. I've known Mr. &gt; &gt; &gt;  Bradley since he was a &gt; &gt; &gt;  youngster, too. I used to baby-sit him for his &gt; &gt; &gt;  parents. And he, too, has &gt; &gt; &gt; been a real disappointment to me. He's lazy, &gt; &gt; &gt;  bigoted, and has a &gt; &gt; &gt;  drinking problem. The man can't build a normal &gt; &gt; &gt;  relationship with anyone and &gt; &gt; &gt;  his law practice is one of the worst in the entire &gt; &gt; &gt;  state.

20091,"<p>An Israeli soap powder company is using the U.S. presidential sex scandal to sell stain-removing detergent.In a television commercial, the Lever Israel company suggests that its Biomat detergent can deal with even the most stubborn stains caused by what has euphemistically been called DNA material.It shows ''FBI agents'' entering the ''home'' of Monica Lewinsky to remove, wash and return the dress at the center of an investigation into whether President Bill Clinton had an affair with the former White House intern and told her to lie about it.For what the company called legal reasons, the spelling of Lewinsky's name on a mailbox outside the house was Monika Lavinsky.But the two agents slip up in their apparent mission to protect the president.On leaving the house, they report by wrist radio the dress is now ''whiter then white'' -- only to be told by a voice in their earpieces: ''White? But it's a blue dress.''The commercial, already aired on Israeli news programs, premiered on Monday to coincide with Clinton's closed circuit television testimony to a federal grand jury.''We believe that this kind of humor will help us reach the consumer,'' Yair Sharett, a Lever Israel representative, told Reuters</p>

It might look like I'm doing nothing, but at the cellular level I'm really quite busy. Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view. The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't care. I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial. No, my powers can only be used for good. How about never? Is never good for you?

"
20118,"<p>A friend just got back from a holiday ski trip to Utah with the kind of story that warms the cockles of anybody's heart. Conditions were perfect, 12 below, no feeling in the toes, basic numbness all over. The ""Tell me when we're having fun"" kind of day. </p>
<p>One of the women in the group complained to her husband that she was in dire need of a restroom. He told her not to worry, that he was sure there was relief at the top of the lift in the form of a powder room for female skiers in distress. He was wrong, of course, and the pain did not go away. </p>
<p>If you've ever had nature hit its panic button in you, then you know That a temperature of 12 below zero doesn't help matters. So with time running out, she weighed her options. </p>
<p>Her husband, picking up on the intensity of the pain, suggested that since she was wearing an all white ski outfit, she should go off in the woods. No one would ever notice, he assured her. The white will provide more than adequate camouflage. So she headed for the tree line, began disrobing and proceeded to do her thing. If you've ever parked on the side of a slope, then you know there is a right way and a wrong way to set your skies so you don't move. Yup, you got it. She had the skies positioned the wrong way. </p>
<p>Steep slopes are not forgiving, even during embarrassing moments. Without any warning, the woman found herself skiing backward, out of control racing through the trees, somehow missing all of them, and on to the slope. Her derriere and the reverse side were still bare, her pants down around her knees, and she was picking up speed all the while she continued on backwards, totally out-of-control, creating an unusual sight for the other skiers. </p>
<p>The woman skied, if you define that verb loosely, back under the lift, and finally collided violently with a pylon. The bad news was she broke her arm and was unable to pull up the ski pants. At long last her husband arrived, put an end to her nude show, then went to the base of the mountain and summoned the ski patrol, who transported her to a hospital. </p>
<p>In the emergency room she was regrouping when a man with a broken leg was put in a bed next to hers. </p>
<p>""So, how'd you break your leg?"" She asked, making small talk. </p>
<p>""It was the darndest thing you ever saw,"" he said ""I was riding up this ski lift and suddenly I couldn't believe my eyes. There was this crazy woman skiing backwards out of control down the mountain with her bare bottom hanging out. I leaned over to get a better look and I guess I didn't realize how far I'd moved. I fell out of the lift."" </p>
<p>""So how'd you break your arm?""</p>
"
20119,"<p>After a very successful career, a former Human Relations guru found herself at<br /> the pearly gates. </p>
<p>""Welcome to Heaven,"" said St.Peter. ""Before you get settled in though, it<br /> seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we've never once had a Human<br /> Resources Director make it this far, and we're not really sure what to do with<br /> you, so what we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven<br /> and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in."" </p>
<p>With that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and went down to hell.<br /> The doors opened, and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a<br /> beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and standing in front<br /> of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with - and<br /> they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up, kissed<br /> her and talked about old times. </p>
<p>They played an excellent round of golf, and at night went to the country club,<br /> where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil, who<br /> was </p>
<p>actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes<br /> and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was<br /> time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and </p>
<p>waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. </p>
<p>The elevator went up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates, and she found St.<br /> Peter waiting for her. ""Now it's time to spend a day in heaven,"" he said. So she<br /> spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and<br /> singing. She had a great time, and before she knew it, her 24 hours were up and<br /> St. Peter came and got her and asked her to choose. </p>
<p>The woman paused for a second and then replied, ""Well, I never thought I'd say<br /> this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better<br /> time in Hell."" So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again she went<br /> down-down-down back to Hell. </p>
<p>When the doors of the elevator opened, she found herself standing in a<br /> desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends were<br /> dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The<br /> Devil came up to her and put his arm around her. </p>
<p>""I don't understand,"" stammered the woman, ""yesterday I was here and there was<br /> a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a<br /> great time. Now, all there is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look<br /> miserable."" </p>
<p>The Devil looked at her and smiled. ""Yesterday, we were recruiting you, today<br /> you're staff.""</p>

20150,"<p>Once upon a yesterday afternoon, I had to pick up my we�re do well brother<br /> because his car broke down. I probably shouldn't have done this, but I wanted to<br /> show off this cool new car I got, so I agreed. I left work at about five o<br /> clocks and I went to the gas station before I picked up my brother. Of course,<br /> after a few bad incidences with the gas station attendants, I discovered that<br /> self-serve was the way to go, so I pulled up and hopped out of my car. When I<br /> was finished pumping the gas, I pulled out the pump, but I had forgotten to<br /> completely let go of the handle, so some gas spilled out onto the sleeve of my<br /> jacket.�Big deal' I thought, and I paid for the gas and got back into the car.<br /> Well, something you must know about my brother is that he's a terribly addicted<br /> smoker, and of course, he has no regard for people�s things, not even their new<br /> car with leather seats. So, of course, the first thing that brother of mine does<br /> when he gets in the car, are lights up a cigarette. Remember the gas I spilled<br /> on my jacket? Well, needless to say, one spark from that lighter sent my arm<br /> bursting into flames. ""CRAP!"" I screamed. I pulled the car over and jumped out.<br /> I was waving my arm around like crazy trying to get that fire out. Luckily, a<br /> policeman drove by and stopped to help me. He had a fire extinguisher in his<br /> cruiser and he used it to put out the fire on my arm. ""Thank you officer"" I<br /> said, ""If you hadn't stopped to help me, my arm could have burned off!"" ""It was<br /> no problem ma'am,"" the officer replied in very police-is style,"" but I'm sorry,<br /> I'm going to have to give you a fine"" ""Why officer?"" I said, completely shocked<br /> ""For using a firearm without a license""</p>

20197,"<p>Obesity has been getting a lot of bad press recently. Research conducted entirely by thin people, has uncovered justification for their own masochistic obsessive-compulsive, fun-killing anal retentative lifestyles.</p>
<p>One of the great problems with research, of course, is that the researchers tend to find what they're looking for. And when they find it, they stop looking for other things. It's important, therefore, not to believe research by pressure groups that start with preconceived ideas.</p>
<p>Examples of findings not to believe: research on the benefits of exercise by phys. Ed. Department, on the hazards of cholesterol by an anorexic and on the joy of obesity by an overweight G. P. The whole obesity phobia was started by some statistics from a life insurance company purporting to show that people who were overweight didn't live as long as people who were underweight. These were very raw figures and led to some unwarranted conclusions.</p>
<p>First, it was assumed that if the overweight group lost weight they'd live longer. This was totally unproved. It never will be proved, as there are just not enough people to study who've lost weight permanently. [95% of those who lose weight gain it back again within 5 years -ed] [and the yo-yo effect of losing then gaining many pounds repeatedly causes a greater health risk than staying overweight. -ed]</p>
<p>Second, it did not address the possibility that the obese group might have another factor affecting lifespan. It seems this is very likely, since the Framington Study showed that if diabetics and those with heart disease were removed from the obese group, the obese group lived longer.</p>
<p>Let's list some benefits of obesity:</p>
<p>Overeating Is Fun. Make a list of all the pleasures that are in this life and you'll find the list isn't very long. The one pleasure that's life-long and never pales is eating.</p>
<p>Carrying Fat Is Good Exercise. If you believe in exercise (I don't), surely carrying around 20 or 30 pounds of fat all day should be good for you.</p>
<p>Obese People Are Nicer People. This is not just a hasty remark, but the result of careful clinical observation. I've seen an average of 20 patients a day for 30 years. I can tell you that these people are more jolly, more kind, more forgiving and just generally nicer. Although it could be the other way round, losing weight and keeping it off, is so rare that only obsessive-compulsives are able to do it. This may be admirable, but obsessive-compulsives aren't relaxing people to be with. [I agree. Really thin and athletic people are that way usually from a driving goal-oriented personality. In short, they are assholes. -ed.]</p>
<p>Obese People Represent Superior Adaptation. In days gone by, there were many advantages to being able to convert excess food into fat. The long winters were better survived by those with a reserve of calories.</p>
<p>Climatic Adaptation. Obese people can survive cold better. In particular, their cold-water survival ability has been demonstrated many times.</p>
<p>Obese People Make Better Lovers. This is a fact known to romantics the world over. Bony lovers can never compete with what G.K. Chesterston referred to as the ""promise of pneumatic bliss.""</p>
<p>Anorexia, a terrible condition, is rare among obese people.<br /> Those who consider the highly trained athlete to be the ideal human might want to consider the greatest duration runner of the animal kingdom, the pronghorn antelope of Wyoming. It can run 95km/h for an hour. It has tremendous lungs, an amazing cardiac output and a maximum oxygen uptake that might deplete the Earth's resources. So why didn't this marvel of nature become a widespread species? Since these antelopes have no body fat, and can standneither cold nor lack or food, few survive the Wyoming winter.</p>

20208,"<p>A guy driving a Yugo pulls up at a stoplight next to a Rolls-Royce. The driver of the Yugo rolls down his window and shouts to the driver of the Rolls, ""Hey, buddy, that's a nice car.  You got a phone in your Rolls? I've got one in my Yugo!""</p>
<p>The driver of Rolls looks over and says simply, ""Yes I have a phone.""</p>
<p>The driver of the Yugo says, ""Cool!  Hey, you got a fridge in there too? I've got a fridge in the back seat of my Yugo!""</p>
<p>The driver of the Rolls, looking annoyed, says, ""Yes, I have a refrigerator.""</p>
<p>The driver of the Yugo says, ""That's great, man!  Hey, you got a TV in there, too?  You know, I got a TV in the back seat of my Yugo!""</p>
<p>The driver of the Rolls, looking very annoyed by now, says, ""Of course I have a television.  A Rolls-Royce is the finest luxury car in the world!""</p>
<p>The driver of the Yugo says, ""Very cool car!  Hey, you got a bed in there, too?  I got a bed in the back of my Yugo!""</p>
<p>Upset that he did not have a bed, the driver of the Rolls-Royce sped away, and went straight to the dealer, where he promptly ordered that a bed be installed in the back of the Rolls.  The next morning, the driver of the Rolls picked up the car, and the bed looked superb, complete with silk sheets and brass trim.  It was clearly a bed fit for a Rolls Royce.</p>
<p>So the driver of the Rolls begins searching for the Yugo, and he drove all day.  Finally, late at night, he finds the Yugo parked, with all the windows fogged up from the inside. The driver of the Rolls got out and knocked on the Yugo.  When there wasn't any answer, he knocked and knocked, and eventually the owner stuck his head out, soaking wet.</p>

20212,"<p>What to say to a telemarketer! One of the things that has always bugged me<br /> (and I'm sure it has most of you, too) is to sit down to dinner only to be<br /> interrupted by a phone call from a telemarketer. I decided, on one such<br /> occasion, to try to be as irritating to them as they were to me. The call was<br /> from AT&amp;T, and it went something like this: </p>
<p>Me: Hello</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Hello, this is AT&amp;T.... </p>
<p>Me: Is this AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, this is AT&amp;T.... </p>
<p>Me: This is AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes. This is AT&amp;T.... </p>
<p>Me: Is this AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: YES! This is AT&amp;T. May I speak to Mr. Salem please? </p>
<p>Me: May I ask who is calling?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: This is AT&amp;T. </p>
<p>Me: OK, hold on. </p>
<p>At this point, I put the phone down for a solid 5 minutes thinking that,<br /> surely, this person would have hung up the phone. I ate my salad. Much to my<br /> surprise, when I picked up the receiver, she was still waiting. </p>
<p>Me: Hello?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Is this Mr. Salem? </p>
<p>Me: May I ask who is calling please?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, this is AT&amp;T.... </p>
<p>Me: Is this AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, this is AT&amp;T.... </p>
<p>Me: This is AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, is this Mr. Salem? </p>
<p>Me: Yes, is this AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, sir. </p>
<p>Me: The phone company?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, sir. </p>
<p>Me: I thought you said this was AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, sir, we are a phone company. </p>
<p>Me: I already have a phone.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: We aren't selling phones today, Mr. Salem. </p>
<p>Me: Well, whatever it is, I'm really not interested, but thanks for calling. </p>
<p>When you are not interested in something, I don't think you can express<br /> yourself any plainer than by saying ""I'm really not interested"", but this lady<br /> was persistent. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Mr. Salem, we would like to offer you 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day,<br /> 7 days a week, 365 days a year. </p>
<p>Now, I am sure she meant she was offering a ""rate"" of 10 cents a minute, but<br /> she at no time used the word ""rate"". I could clearly see that it was time to<br /> whip out the trusty old calculator and do a little ciphering. </p>
<p>Me: Now, that's 10 cents a minute 24 hours a day? AT&amp;T: (getting a little<br /> excited at this point by my interest) Yes, sir, that's right! 24 hours a day! </p>
<p>Me: 7 days a week?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: That's right. </p>
<p>Me: 365 days a year?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, sir. </p>
<p>Me: I am definitely interested in that! Wow!! That's amazing!! AT&amp;T: We think<br /> so! </p>
<p>Me: That's quite a sum of money!</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, sir, it's amazing how it adds up. </p>
<p>Me: OK, so will you send me checks weekly, monthly or just one big one at the<br /> end of the year for the full $52,560? If you send an annual heck, can I get a</p>
<p>cash advance?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Excuse me? </p>
<p>Me: You know, the 10 cents a minute.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: What are you talking about? </p>
<p>Me: You said you'd give me 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,<br /> 365 days a year. That comes to $144 per day, $1,008 per week and $52,560 per<br /> year. I'm just interested in knowing how you will be making payment.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Oh no, sir, I didn't mean we'd be paying you. You pay us 10 cents a<br /> minute. </p>
<p>Me: Wait a minute here! Didn't you say you'd give me 10 cents a minute? Are<br /> you sure this is AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Well, yes, this is AT&amp;T, sir, but.... </p>
<p>Me: But nothing! How do you figure that by saying that you'll give me 10 cents<br /> a minute that I'll give you 10 cents a minute? Is this some kind of suliminal<br /> telemarketing scheme? I've read about things like this in the Enquirer, you<br /> know. Don't use your alien brainwashing techniques on me.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: No, sir, we are offering 10 cents a minute for.... </p>
<p>Me: THERE YOU GO AGAIN! Can I speak to a supervisor please?!? AT&amp;T: Sir, I<br /> don't think that is necessary. </p>
<p>Me: Sure! You say that now! What happens later? AT&amp;T: What? </p>
<p>Me: I insist on speaking to a supervisor! AT&amp;T: Yes, Mr. Salem. Please hold. </p>
<p>So, now AT&amp;T has me on hold, and my supper is getting cold. I begin to eat<br /> while I'm waiting for a supervisor. After a wait of a few minutes and while I<br /> have a mouth full of food....... </p>
<p>Supervisor: Mr. Salem?</p>
<p>Me: Yeth? </p>
<p>Supervisor: I understand you are not quite understanding our 10 cents a minute<br /> program.</p>
<p>Me: Id thish Ath Teeth &amp; Teeth? (Is this AT&amp;T) </p>
<p>Supervisor: Yes, sir, it sure is. </p>
<p>I had to swallow before I choked on my food. It was all I could do to suppress<br /> my laughter, and I had to be careful not to produce a snort. </p>
<p>Me: No, actually I was just waiting for someone to get back to me so that I<br /> could sign up for the plan. </p>
<p>Supervisor: OK, no problem, I'll transfer you back to the person who was<br /> helping you.</p>
<p>Me: Thank you. </p>
<p>I was on hold once again and managed a few more mouthfuls. I needed to end<br /> this conversation. Suddenly, there was an aggravated but polite voice at the<br /> other end of the phone. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Hello, Mr. Salem. I understand that you are interested in signing up for<br /> our plan?</p>
<p>Me: Do you have that friends and family thing because you can never have<br /> enough friends and I'm an only child and I'd really like to have a little<br /> brother......... </p>

But there is a sign on the wall that reads, �Wipe yourself with your finger, then insert the finger into this hole, and your finger will be cleaned with great attention.�  So the man wipes up and sticks his finger through the hole. On the other side is standing a little boy holding a brick in either hand, who claps them together at the sight of the finger poking through.  The guy screams in pain, yanks his hand back, and starts sucking on his finger. So now his finger is cleaned with great attention...</p>

20233,"<p>Basic Rules for Cats Who Have a House to Run</p>
<p>1. CHAIRS AND RUGS: If you have to throw up, get into a chair quickly. If you cannot manage in time, get to an Oriental rug. If no Oriental rug is available, shag is good.</p>
<p>2. DOORS: Do not allow closed doors in any room. To get a door opened, stand on hind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is opened, it is not necessary to use it.After you have ordered an outside door opened, stand halfway in and out and think about several things, This is particularly important during very cold weather, rain, snow, and mosquito season.</p>
<p>3. GUESTS: Quickly determine which guest hates cats the most. Sit on that human's lap. If you can, arrange to have ""Friskies Fish n' Glop"" on your breath. For sitting on laps or rubbing against clothing, select fabric color which contrasts well with your fur. For example: white furred cats go to black wool clothing. For the guest who claims, ""I love kitties,"" be ready with aloof disdain; apply claws to stockings or use a quick nip on the ankle. When walking among the dishes on the dinner table, be prepared to look surprised and hurt when scolded. The idea is to convey, ""But you always allow me on the table when company isn't here."" Always accompany guests to the bathroom. It isn't necessary to do anything. Just sit and stare.</p>
<p>4. WORK: If one of your humans is sewing or writing and another is idle, stay with the busy one. This is called helping, otherwise known as hampering. Following are the rules for hampering: A. When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook. You can't be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on, picked up and consoled. B. For book readers, get in close under the chin, between the human's eyes and the book, unless you can lie across the book itself. If it is a news paper, claw at it until shredded.</p>

20261,"<p>Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to leave Italy.<br /> There was, of course, a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope<br /> offered a deal. He would have a religious debate with a leader of the Jewish<br /> community. If the Jewish leader won the debate, the Jews would be permitted to<br /> stay in Italy. If the Pope won, the Jews would have to leave. </p>
<p>The Jewish community met and picked an aged Rabbi, Moishe, to represent them<br /> in the debate. Rabbi Moishe, however, could not speak Latin and the Pope could<br /> not speak Yiddish. So it was decided that this would be a ""silent"" debate. </p>
<p>On the day of the great debate, the Pope and Rabbi Moishe sat opposite each<br /> other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three<br /> fingers. </p>
<p>Rabbi Moishe looked back and raised one finger. </p>
<p>Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. </p>
<p>Rabbi Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. </p>
<p>The Pope then brought out a communion wafer and chalice of wine. </p>
<p>Rabbi Moishe pulled out an apple. </p>
<p>With that, the Pope stood up and said, ""I concede the debate. This man has<br /> bested me. The Jews can stay."" </p>
<p>Later, the Cardinals gathered around the Pope, asking him what had happened. </p>
<p>The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He<br /> responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God<br /> common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that<br /> God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God<br /> was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that<br /> God absolves us of our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original<br /> sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?"" </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Jewish community crowded around Rabbi Moishe, asking what<br /> happened. </p>
<p>""Well,"" said Moishe, ""first he said to me, 'You Jews have three days to get<br /> out of here.' So I said to him, 'Up yours'. Then he tells me the whole city<br /> would be cleared of Jews. So I said to him, 'Listen here Mr. Pope, the Jews ...<br /> we stay right here!"" </p>

20278,"<p>I was playing golf with my doctor friend one day.<br /> He ALWAYS hit his drives right down the middle of the fairway.<br /> My problem was that I ALWAYS hooked my ball completely off the fairway. </p>
<p>I asked him for help, and he offered to give me a physical to see if he could determine the problem. </p>
<p>Sure enough, he said that I had three times the ""normal length"" of the average male, which caused an anomaly in my swing that caused me to hook. </p>
<p>I asked him to help me, and he agreed to do surgery -- provided that I didn't play golf for four weeks. I agreed. Golf is just that important to me. </p>
<p>Four weeks later, new body and all, I teed off on the first hole and drove the ball 270 yards right down the middle. Feeling elated, I thanked the doctor. </p>
<p>Then I asked him what had become of the ""rest"" of me. </p>
<p>He just smiled, teed his ball, then hit it...<br /> and watched it duck hook two fairways away...</p>

20282,"<p>A radio station routinely paid money for people to tell their<br /> most embarrassing stories. Here was one of the winners.</p>
<p>I was due later that week for an appointment with the<br /> gynecologist when early one morning I received a call from his<br /> office: I had been rescheduled for early that morning at 9:30am.<br /> I has just packed everyone off to work and school and it was<br /> around 8:45 already. The trip usually took about 35 minutes so I<br /> didn't have any time to spare. As most women do, I'm sure, I<br /> like to take a little extra effort over hygiene when making such<br /> visits, but this time I wasn't going to be able to make the full<br /> effort. So I rushed upstairs, threw off my dressing gown, wet<br /> the washcloth and gave myself a wash in ""that area"" in front of<br /> the sink, taking extra care to make sure that I was presentable.</p>
<p>I threw the washcloth in the clothes basket, donned some<br /> clothes, hopped in the car and raced to my appointment. I was in<br /> the waiting room only a few minutes when he called me in.</p>
<p>Knowing the procedure, as I'm sure all women do, I hopped up on<br /> the table, looked over at the other side of the room and<br /> pretended I was in Hawaii or some other place a million miles<br /> away from here. I was surprised when he said: ""My...we have<br /> taken a little extra effort this morning, haven't we?"" but I<br /> didn't respond. The appointment over, I heaved a sigh of relief<br /> and went home. The rest of the day went as normal, some<br /> shopping, cleaning and the evening meal, etc.</p>
<p>At 8:30 that evening my 14 year old daughter was getting ready<br /> for a school dance, when she called down from the bathroom,<br /> ""Mom, where's my washcloth?""</p>
<p>I called back for her to get another from the cabinet. She<br /> called back, ""No, I need that one that was here by the sink. It<br /> had all my glitter and sparkles in it.""</p>

20283,"<p>One night, a father passed by his son's room and heard his son praying: ""God bless Mommy, Daddy, and Grandma. Ta ta, Grandpa."" The father didn't quite know what this meant, but was glad his son was praying. The next morning, they found Grandpa dead on the floor of a heart attack. The father reassured himself that it was just a coincidence, but was still a bit spooked. The next night, he heard his son praying again: ""God bless Mommy and Daddy. Ta ta, Grandma."" The father was worried, but decided to wait until morning. Sure enough, the next morning Grandma was on the floor, dead of a heart attack. Really scared now, the father decided to wait outside his son's door the next night. And sure enough, the boy started to pray: ""God bless Mommy. Ta ta, Daddy."" Now the father was crapping his pants. He stayed up all night, and went to the doctor's early the next day to make sure his health was fine. When he finally came home, his wife was waiting on the porch. She said, ""Thank God you're here -- we could really use your help! We found the milkman dead on our porch this morning!""</p>

20285,"<p>The Cameron children are the sort of kids who really light up a room, and then<br /> are content to leave it lit until all the electricity in the country has flowed<br /> through our circuits and out into the night. I'm developing carpal tunnel<br /> syndrome from the repetitive motion of turning off the lights after them, and<br /> can't understand how they could possibly fail to notice a blazing light bulb,<br /> for crying out loud. When I walk into the house in the evenings, every single<br /> room is as brilliantly lit as a hospital operating theater. The little wheel<br /> that measures the electricity sluicing through my home spins inside its glass<br /> case like a CD player, and no one can walk within 100 feet of my yard without<br /> casting a shadow. It looks like the grand opening of a sporting goods store.<br /> My teenagers are the worst. Not only do they require every bulb to be lit, but<br /> they can often be found in front of the television, the phone to their ears, the<br /> stereo blaring in the background. ""I'm doing homework,"" they'll protest when I<br /> ask them to choose between one of the appliances. They use this as their<br /> universal alibi for everything. If I were to catch them in the middle of an<br /> armed robbery, I'm sure they would claim it was for a school assignment.<br /> I've tried to explain to my family that as responsible Americans, we all need<br /> to preserve precious natural resources like the W. Bruce Cameron bank account.<br /> ""I have no desire to have the nation's next nuclear reactor named after me,"" I<br /> advise them, but they don't seem to get it. It makes me wonder whether the power<br /> company isn't paying them off after school.<br /> Let's be reasonable. The furniture hasn't moved. There are no falling objects<br /> in the living room. We don't need to turn on the lights unless there is<br /> something special we want to look at.<br /> ""But we have to do our homework!"" my children protest.<br /> ""Remember Abe Lincoln?"" I challenge them.<br /> ""No,"" they respond, ""We don't remember Abe Lincoln because you won't let us<br /> turn on the lights so we can study.""<br /> ""Very funny. Abe Lincoln never had electric lights. He studied in front of a<br /> fireplace, doing math by writing numbers on a shovel.""<br /> ""You mean his teachers let him turn in homework written on a SHOVEL?"" My son<br /> laughs, delighted.<br /> ""Also,"" I recall from some book I read once, ""he held his brother up to the<br /> ceiling to make footprints or something.""<br /> ""What was that, gym class?""<br /> ""The point is, we have to reduce our use of electricity.""<br /> ""Which is why your father is giving up watching sports on the television,"" my<br /> wife chimes in.<br /> I give her a stern look. ""Let's stay focused on what we're interested in,<br /> which is what I'm saying,"" I admonish her. It is a primary tenet of good<br /> parenting that parents should be unified when it comes to matters of my policy.<br /> ""Also, whenever the thermostat is set above hypothermia, we have to turn it<br /> down,"" she cautions. ""And children, you will all need to learn Braille so you'll<br /> be able to read in the dark. Showers will be limited to seven seconds--if you<br /> can't wash your hair in that time, there's always the hose."" She smiles sweetly<br /> at me. ""Oh, and I'm going to the store tomorrow--tell me how much homework you<br /> have so I'll know how many garden tools to pick up.""<br /> ""Instead of listening to music on the stereo, we should all just sing!"" my son<br /> suggests.<br /> ""There's no sense in using the telephone when you can shout,"" my<br /> daughter affirms.<br /> ""Flushing toilets more than once a month is an extravagance!"" they hoot.<br /> ""Never open the refrigerator! Doing laundry is communist!""<br /> Well, there's no point trying to reason with them--they're laughing too hard<br /> to pay attention. ""As soon as you're finished I'll begin passing out<br /> punishments,"" I state menacingly.<br /> ""What are you going to do, make us sit in the dark?"" my daughter shrieks,<br /> holding her sides.<br /> Half an hour later, when I stroll in to check on the thermostat and turn off a<br /> few of the lights, they're still laughing.</p>

A few minutes later as he was undressing, he noticed blood, so he checked himself out in the mirror, and, sure enough, his behind was cut up something terrible. Well, he repaired the damage as best he could under the circumstances, and he went to bed. The next morning, his head was hurting, and his rear was hurting and he was hunkering under the covers trying to think up some good story, when his wife came into the bedroom. 'Well, you really tied one on last night,' she said. 'Where'd you go?' 'I worked late,' he said, 'and I stopped off for a couple of beers.' 'A couple of beers? That's a laugh,' she replied. 'You got plastered last night. Where the heck did you go?' 'What makes you so sure I got drunk last night, anyway?' 'Well,' she replied, 'my first big clue was when I got up this morning and found a bunch of band-aids stuck to the mirror.'</p>

20312,"<p>In a crowded city at a crowded bus stop, a beautiful blonde was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt with matching tight leather boots and jacket. As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.<br /> Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again she tried to make the step onto the bus only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed she once again reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, much to her chagrin she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. So, with a coy little smile to the driver she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step. </p>
<p>About this time the big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him ""How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!"" </p>
<p>At this the Texan drawled ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.""</p>

20313,"<p>Entertainment A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom, ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax - OH MY GOD!""</p>
<p>Silence followed and after a few minutes, the captain came back on the intercom and said, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you earlier, but while I was talking, the flight-attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap. You should see the front of my pants!""</p>
<p>A passenger in Coach said, ""That's nothing. He should see the back of mine!""</p>

20315,"<p>Two weeks ago was my 44th birthday and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning.<br /> I went down to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say ""Happy<br /> Birthday"" and probably have a present for me. She didn't even say ""Good<br /> Morning"", let alone any ""Happy Birthday."" I thought, ""Well, that's wives for<br /> you. The children will remember. ""The children came down to breakfast and didn't<br /> say a word.</p>
<p>When I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and despondent. As I<br /> walked into my office, my secretary, Janet said, ""Good Morning, Boss, Happy<br /> Birthday."" I felt a little better. Someone had remembered. I worked until noon,<br /> then Janet knocked on my door and said, ""You know it is such a beautiful day<br /> outside and it is your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me."" I said,<br /> ""By George, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go.</p>
<p>We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go. We went out into the<br /> country to a little private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch<br /> tremendously. On the way back to the office, she said, ""You know it is such a<br /> beautiful day; we don't need to go back to the office, do we?"" I said, ""No, I<br /> guess not."" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment.""</p>
<p>After arriving at her apartment she said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I think<br /> I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable. Sure,"" I<br /> excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes she came<br /> out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my wife, children and dozens of<br /> our friends. They were all singing Happy Birthday.......and there I sat on the<br /> couch.......naked.</p>

''Now sir, are they the size a pair of melons? Coconuts? Grape fruits? Oranges?'' ''No,'' he said, ''nothing like that.'' ''Come on, sir, think. There must be something your wife's bust resembles.''

It was determined that the patient had acute appendicitis and<br /> was scheduled for immediate surgery.

20339,"<p>A tourist wanders into a back-alley antique shop in San Francisco's Chinatown. Picking through the objects on display he discovers a detailed, life-sized bronze sculpture of a rat. The sculpture is so interesting and unique that he picks it up and asks the shop owner what it costs. ""Twelve dollars for the rat, sir,"" says the shop owner, ""and a thousand dollars more for the story behind it."" ""You can keep the story, old man,"" he replies, ""but I'll take the rat."" </p>
<p>The transaction complete, the tourist leaves the store with the bronze rat under his arm. As he crosses the street in front of the store, two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall into step behind him. Nervously looking over his shoulder, he begins to walk faster, but every time he passes another sewer drain, more rats come out and follow him. </p>
<p>By the time he's walked two blocks, at least a hundred rats are at his heels, and people begin to point and shout. He walks even faster, and soon breaks into a trot as multitudes of rats swarm from sewers, basements, vacant lots, and abandoned cars. Rats by the thousands are at his heels, and as he sees the waterfront at the bottom of the hill, he panics and starts to run for the bridge. </p>
<p>Making a mighty leap, he jumps up onto a light post, grasping it with one arm while he hurls the bronze rat into San Francisco Bay with the other, as far as he can heave it. Pulling his legs up and clinging to the light post, he watches in amazement as the seething tide of rats surges over the breakwater into the sea, where they drown. </p>
<p>Shaken and mumbling, he makes his way back to the antique shop. ""Ah, so you've come back for the rest of the story,"" says the owner. </p>
<p>""No,"" says the tourist, ""but I was wondering if you have any bronze lawyers!""</p>

20343,"<p>As a young man, Norton was an exceptional golfer. At the age of<br /> 26, however, he decided to become a priest, and joined a rather<br /> peculiar Order. He took the usual vows of poverty, chastity, but<br /> his Order also required that he quit golf and never play again.<br /> This was particularly difficult for Norton, but he agreed and<br /> was finally ordained a priest.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning, the Reverend Father Norton woke up and<br /> realizing it was an exceptionally beautiful and sunny early<br /> spring day, decided he just had to play golf.</p>
<p>So... he told the Associate Pastor that he was feeling sick and<br /> convinced him to say Mass for him that day. As soon as the<br /> Associate Pastor left the room, Father Norton headed out of town<br /> to a golf course about forty miles away. This way he knew he<br /> wouldn't accidentally meet anyone he knew from his parish.</p>
<p>Setting up on the first tee, he was alone. After all, it was<br /> Sunday morning and everyone else was in church! At about this<br /> time, Saint Peter leaned over to the Lord while looking down<br /> from the heavens and exclaimed, ""You're not going to let him get<br /> away with this, are you?""</p>
<p>The Lord sighed, and said, ""No, I guess not."" Just then Father<br /> Norton hit the ball and it shot straight towards the pin,<br /> dropping just short of it, rolled up and fell into the hole. It<br /> WAS A 420 YARD HOLE IN ONE! St. Peter was astonished. He looked<br /> at the Lord and asked, ""Why did you let him do that?"" The Lord<br /> smiled and replied, ""Who is he going to tell?""</p>

<p>Each category can be subdivided into prizes, surprises, consolations and dead losses, the last group being the most common. </p>
<p>If you flatter them, they get frightened. If you don't, they get bored. </p>
<p>If you allow them to make love to you in the beginning, they get bored with you in the end. If you don't allow them to make love to you, they get bored in the beginning. </p>
<p>If you argue with them, you will lose your charm. If you don't argue with them, they will stop trying to charm you. </p>
<p>If you are outgoing and popular with other men, they think you are a tart.If you are not an extrovert they ignore you. </p>

20365,"<p>A Blonde airhead goes for a job interview in an office.<br /> The interviewer starts with the basics.<br /> ""So, Miss, can you tell us your age, please?"" </p>
<p>The blonde counts carefully on her fingers for half a minute before replying ""Ehhhh... 22!"" </p>
<p>The interviewer tries another straightforward one to break the ice.<br /> ""And can you tell us your height, please?"" </p>
<p>The young lady stands up and produces a measuring tape from her handbag. She then traps one end under her foot and extends the tape to the top of her head. She checks the measurement and announces ""Five foot two!"" </p>
<p>This isn't looking good so the interviewer goes for the real basics; something the interviewee won't have to count, measure, or lookup.<br /> ""Just to confirm for our records, your name please?"" </p>
<p>The airhead bobs her head from side to side for about ten seconds, mouthing something silently to herself, before replying ""MANDY!"" </p>
<p>The interviewer is completely baffled at this stage, so he asks -<br /> ""What in the world were you doing when I asked you your name?"" </p>
<p>""Ohhhh, that!"" replies the airhead...<br /> "" I was just running through that song -<br /> 'Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear...'</p>

20379,"<p>A bartender is sitting behind the bar on a typical day, when the door bursts open and in comes four exuberant blondes. They come up to the bar, order five bottles of champagne and ten glasses, take their order over and sit down at a large table. The corks are popped, the glasses are filled and they begin toasting and chanting, ""51 days, 51 days, 51 days!""<br /> Soon, three more blondes arrive, take up their drinks and the chanting grows, ""51 days, 51 days, 51 days!"" Two more blondes show up and soon their voices join in raising the roof, ""51 days, 51 days, 51 days!""<br /> Finally, the tenth blonde comes in with a picture under her arm. She walks over to the table, sets the picture in the middle and the table rupts. Up jump the others, they begin dancing around the table, exchanging high-fives, all the while chanting, ""51 days, 51 days, 51 days!""<br /> The bartender can't contain his curiosity any longer, so he walks over to the table. There in the center is a beautiful child's puzzle of the cookie monster. When the frenzy dies down a little bit, the bartender asks one of the blondes, ""What's all the chanting and celebration about?""<br /> The blonde who brought in the picture pipes up, ""Everyone thinks that blondes are dumb and they make fun of us. So, we decided to set the record straight. Ten of us got together, bought that puzzle and put it together.<br /> The side of the box said 2 - 4 years, but we put it together in 51 days!""</p>

20388,"<p>Saturday, September 6, 1997</p>
<p>Ligonier, PA. -- There was an old woman who worked in a shoe.  She<br /> saw a lot of tourists and knew exactly what to do.</p>
<p>After 25 years of playing the ""old woman who lived in a shoe"" at the<br /> nursery rhyme-themed Story Book Forest at Idlewild Park, Nellie<br /> Gindlesperger is retiring at the end of the summer at age 85.</p>
<p>She has spent her days crocheting in front of the park's massive brown and<br /> green boot, often putting down her sewing to talk to visitors.</p>
<p>""So many of the little ones ask me how many children I have,"" she said.  ""I<br /> tell them that all of the children who come through Story Book Forest are<br /> mine.""</p>
<p>Gindlesperger, who in real life has five children and whose own mother<br /> played the role for 12 years before her, teaches nursery rhymes to her<br /> visitors.</p>
<p>""They aren't teaching the youngsters nursery rhymes today,"" she said.  ""Our<br /> fairy tales are going to be lost.""</p>
<p>Her fairy tales come with a personal twist.</p>
<p>""She said that she really was the old lady in the shoe, and someone wrote a<br /> nasty old poem about her,"" said 8-year-old Gina Crivella.</p>
<p>Idlewild Park is about 35 miles east of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>This stressed Santa even more...when he went to harness the reindeer he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out heaven knows where...more stress.</p>
<p>And then, when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards on the sleigh cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered all the toys...so, frustrated Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey...but he found that the elves had hit the liquor cupboard and there was nothing there to drink...and in his frustration he dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor... he went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from.</p>
<p>Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door ..he opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. And the angel said: Santa, where would you like to put this Christmas tree??</p>
<p>And that, my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the Christmas tree...</p>

20419,"<p>A husband and wife are traveling by car from Atlanta to New York. After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they're too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a rest. They stop at a nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four hours and then get back on the road.</p>
<p>When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350. The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the rooms certainly aren't worth $350. When the clerk tells him $350 is the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the manager.</p>
<p>The manager listens to the man and then explains the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that were available for the husband and wife to use. He also explains they could have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous.</p>
<p>""The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here,"" explains the manager.</p>
<p>No matter what facility the manager mentions, the man replies, ""But we didn't use it!""</p>
<p>The manager is unmoved and eventually the man gives up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the manager. The manager is surprised when he looks at the check.</p>
<p>""But sir,"" he says, ""this check is only made out for $100.""</p>
<p>""That's right,"" says the man. ""I charged you $250 for kissing my wife.""</p>
<p>""But I didn't!"" exclaims the manager.</p>
<p>""Well,"" the man replies, ""she was here, and you could have.""</p>

<p>George's Wife: ""The last time you went out with your friends you got so drunk that you puked on your shirt.""</p>
<p>George: ""But Honey, I promise that I wont drink a drop of alcohol all night!""</p>
<p>So after begging his old lady for an hour, George got the OK the go out with the guys as long as he stayed off of the booze.</p>
<p>George met up with the guys at a local bar and proceeded to get shit-faced. After about 3 hours of guzzling liquor, George blew chow all over his shirt.</p>
<p>George: ""Shit! The old lady is going to throw my ass out of the house for getting drunk and puking on my new shirt!""</p>
<p>Bill, George's best pal, gave drunk ass George an idea of how to keep from getting in trouble with the wife.</p>
<p>Bill: ""All you got to do is have a $20 bill in your hand when you walk through the door. Then, when she accuses you of barfing all over yourself, just tell her that some other drunk puked on you and that he gave you 20 bucks to get the shirt cleaned.""</p>
<p>So, when drunk ass George walked into the house with money in hand, his wife was waiting for him in the living room.</p>
<p>Georges wife: ""I knew that your drunk ass would spew bile and booze all over that new shirt!""</p>
<p>George: ""Honey, let me explain! This drunken fool at the bar puked on me and gave me 20 bucks to have it cleaned.""</p>
<p>His wife snatched the money out of his hand and observed that he was holding two $20 bills.</p>
<p>George's wife: ""Is that so? Then where did the other 20 dollar bill come from?""</p>
<p>George: ""Oh, That's from the guy who shit in my pants.""</p>

<p>When he opened the door, he found an even bigger mess: dishes on the counter, dog food spilled on the floor, a broken glass under the table and a pile of sand by the back door. The family room was strewn with toys, and a lamp had been knocked over.</p>
<p>He headed up the stairs, stepping over toys, to look for his wife.<br /> He was becoming worried that she might be ill or that something terrible had happened to her.</p>
<p>He found her in the bedroom still in bed with her pajamas on, reading a book. She looked up at him, smiled and asked how his day had gone.  He looked at her, bewildered, and asked, ""What happened here today?""</p>
<p>She again smiled and answered, ""You know, every day, you come home from work and ask me what I did today.""</p>
<p>""Yes"" was his reply.</p>
<p>She answered, ""Well, today, I didn't do it!""</p>

20469,"<p>An elderly and somewhat hard-of-hearing man was sitting in a stylish downtown attorney�s office as his lawyer handed him his will. ""Your estate is very complex,"" said the lawyer, ""but I�ve made sure that all of your wishes will be executed. Due to the complexity, my fee is $4500.""Just then, the phone rang and the lawyer got involved with a long call. Thinking the lawyer had said ""$500,"" the old man wrote out his check and left.When she got off the phone and realized the old man�s mistake, the lawyer ran after him down the stairs and into the parking lot just as he drove away. Feeling frustrated, the lawyer looked at the check and decided to accept the situation philosophically. ""Oh well,"" she said to herself, ""$500 for half an hour�s work isn�t bad.""</p>

20499,"<p>1. No matter what my problem is, it's the fault of someone other than myself, and the appropriate response is to find that person and kill him with my bare hands. </p>
<p>2. To be truly attractive, a woman must wear high heels and an outfit so tight you can tell whether she's cold or not from across the room. </p>
<p>3. There are two kinds of women in the world: One type want to go to bed with you, and the other type want to kill you. Both types are physically attractive and under 25 years old. </p>
<p>4. If I rudely argue with my boss in front of my coworkers, not only won't he fire me, but he will gain a profound respect for me. </p>
<p>5. If I can find an important enough mission, it will supersede my obligations to perform household chores, bathe, and call the next day. </p>
<p>6. If I go without bathing, swear a lot, and treat women badly, they will adore me. </p>
<p>7. If a woman tries to clean a bullet wound and I curse in pain, she will fall in love with me. </p>
<p>9. If I have a prolonged fist-fight with another guy and neither of us dies, we will become best friends. </p>
<p>10. My archenemy will bear an uncanny resemblance in age and bearing to my father, and he will make it clear that he has gained a deep respect for me before I kill him with my bare hands. </p>
<p>11. When I shoot people, they will die quickly and cleanly, and I will never be arrested or troubled by their widowed wife and children. When people shoot me, however, I will at most receive a 'flesh wound,' which will be tended to by a beautiful woman (see #7, above). </p>
<p>12. I will befriend at least one black guy, if white, or one white guy, if black. If I am Latino the monster/villain will kill me halfway through the film, urging the hero to even greater levels of violence.</p>
<p>13. If an aged scientist is involved in any way, he will have a beautiful daughter who will gaze at me adoringly. </p>
<p>14. If royalty is involved, it will include a beautiful princess who will gaze at me adoringly. </p>
<p>15. If I have a kid partner, he will be tightly-muscled, clean-cut, and gaze at me adoringly. </p>
<p>16. If I am asked to compete against a world champion at any sport or game of any type, I will win. This will infuriate my opponent, who will then try to kill me. </p>
<p>17. If my opponent has a sidekick or henchman, he will never have a sensible name like 'Rick,' or 'Steve.' </p>
<p>18. Beautiful women will frequently furrow their brows with concern and ask, ""When's the last time you got any sleep?"" They will never ask when I last bathed or used the toilet, although I apparently never do those things either.</p>

They went to a hot dog stand and bought a dog and threw away the bun. ""We'll go into a bar and order drinks, and when the bartender asks for money, I'll unzip my fly and pull out the hot dog. You drop to your knees and pretend to suck me off."" The second man agrees to this and they start thier rounds.When they get to the bar, they sit down and have a beer. The bartender tells them, ""That will be 3 dollars.""The first man stands up and upzips his fly. The second man drops to his knees and starts sucking on the hot-dog. ""You faggots!"", screams the bartender. ""Get the hell out of here!"" They run out and go to another bar and order drinks and when the bartender asks for money, the first man unzips his fly, and the second man drops to his knees. The bartender throws them out. After the sixth bar the second man complains, ""Man this isn't working out so well, My knees are killing me!""""You think you've had it bad.."", the first man exclaims. ""I lost the hotdog 4 bars ago!""</p>

20514,"<p>The following information was gained through much arduous research involving men and women from all backgrounds and walks of life. It consists of the most frequently asked questions of women (i.e. relationships, sex and life in general). All women who read this are encouraged to use the wisdom contained therein to change their behavior in accordance with the truths established below. </p>
<p>Q: How do I know if I'm ready for sex? </p>
<p>A: Ask your boyfriend. He'll know when the time is right. When it comes to love and sex, men are much more responsible, since they're not as emotionally confused as women. It's a proven fact.</p>
<p>Q: Should I have sex on the first date? </p>
<p>A: YES. Before if possible.</p>
<p>Q: What exactly happens during the act of sex? </p>
<p>A: Again, this is entirely up to the man. The important thing to remember is that you must do whatever he tells you without question. Sometimes, however, he may ask you to do certain things that may at first seem strange to you. Do them anyway. </p>
<p>Q: How long should the sex act last? </p>
<p>A: This is a natural &amp; normal part of nature, so don't feel ashamed or embarrassed. After you've finished making love, he'll have a natural desire to leave you suddenly, &amp; go out with his friends to play golf. Or perhaps another activity, such as going out with his friends to the bar for the purpose of consuming large amounts of alcohol &amp; sharing a few personal thoughts with his buddies. Don't feel left out - while he's gone you can busy yourself by doing laundry, cleaning the apartment, or perhaps even going out to buy him an expensive gift. He'll come back when he's ready.</p>
<p>Q: What is ""afterplay""? </p>
<p>A: After a man has finished making love, he needs to replenish his manly energy. ""Afterplay"" is simply a list of important activities for you to do after lovemaking. This includes lighting his cigarette, making him a sandwich or pizza, bringing him a few beers, or leaving him alone to sleep while you go out and buy him an expensive gift.</p>
<p>Q: Does the size of the penis matter? </p>
<p>A: Yes. Although many women believe that quality, not quantity, is important, studies show this is simply not true. The average erect male penis measures about three inches. Anything longer than that is extremely rare and if by some chance your lover's sexual organ is 4 inches or over, you should go down on your knees and thank your lucky stars and do everything possible to please him, such as doing his laundry, cleaning his apartment and/or buying him an expensive gift.</p>
<p>Q: What about the female orgasm? </p>
<p>A: What about it? There's no such thing. It's a myth.</p>

The bartender then returned to the other end of the bar. The guy drank half the beer and poured the other half on his left hand. The bartender saw this and just shook his head. The guy asked for another beer. The bartender handed him another and resisted the temptation to ask the guy what he was doing. Once again, the guy drank half the beer and poured the other half on his left hand.The bartender has seen a lot of strange behavior from drunk people, but this guy was sober! The guy asked for another beer. The bartender handed him another and found that he couldn't resist asking, 'Buddy, I can't help noticing what you're doing. What's going on?' The guy looked at him and said, 'What does look like? My date and I are having a drink!'</p>

<p>""Look, I'll give you $100 if you'll change the wedding vows.

He passed the minister a $100 bill and walked away satisfied. </p>
<p>It is now the day of the wedding, and the bride and groom have moved to that part of the ceremony where the vows are exchanged. When it comes time for the groom's vows, the pastor looks the young man in the eye and says: </p>
<p>""Will you promise to prostrate yourself before her, obey her every command and wish, serve her breakfast in bed every morning of your life and swear eternally before God and your lovely wife that you will not ever even look at another woman, as long as you both shall live?"" </p>
<p>The groom gulped and looked around, and said in a tiny voice, ""Yes."" </p>
<p>After the wedding, the groom pulled the pastor aside and hissed, ""I thought we had a deal."" </p>
<p>The pastor put the $100 bill into the groom's hand and whispered back, ""She made me a much better offer.</p>

20525,"<p>An old couple in Santo Domingo was puzzled when the coffin<br /> of their dead relative arrived from the USA. The corpse was<br /> so tightly squeezed inside the coffin that her face was<br /> practically touching the glass cover. When they opened the<br /> coffin, they found a letter pinned to her chest, which<br /> read:</p>
<p>Dearest Papi &amp; Mami:</p>
<p>I am sending you Tia Juana's remains for the funeral in the<br /> Santo Domingo Cemetery.</p>
<p>Sorry I couldn't come along as the expenses were too high.<br /> You will find inside the coffin, under Tia's body, 12 cans<br /> of Bumble Bee Tuna, 12 bottles of Paul Mitchell Shampoo and<br /> 12 bottles Paul Mitchell Conditioner, 12 Vaseline Intensive<br /> Care Skin Lotion, 12 Colgate Toothpaste and 12 cans of<br /> Spam.

Also, the six pairs of Chanel<br /> stockings that she is wearing must be divided among the<br /> teen-age girls there. I hope the colors are to their<br /> liking.</p>

<p>A long black hearse was followed by a second long black hearse about 50 feet behind.  </p>
<p>Behind the second hearse was a solitary woman walking a very mean looking dog on a leash. </p>
<p>Behind that were 200 women walking single file. </p>
<p>The woman couldn't stand the curiosity. She respectfully approached the woman walking the dog and said, ""I am so sorry for your loss, and I know now is a bad time to disturb you, but I've never seen a funeral like this. Whose funeral is it?""</p>
<p>The woman replied, ""Well, that first hearse is for my husband.""<br /> ""What happened to him?""<br /> The woman replied, ""My dog attacked and killed him.""</p>
<p>She inquired further, ""Well, who is in the second hearse?""</p>
<p>The woman answered, ""My mother-in-law.  She was trying to help my husband when the dog turned on her.""</p>

20553,"<p>Superman and one of his superhero friends are flying around<br /> Metropolis one day, looking for trouble like they usually do.<br /> Seeing no crime, Superman makes the suggestion that the two fly<br /> down to the beach to see what is going on. His friend, being<br /> bored, happily agrees.</p>
<p>As the two fly along the beach, they spot Wonder Woman, ""spread<br /> eagle"" on the beach. Superman's friend is simply amazed by what<br /> he is seeing. Superman, seeing his friend's astonishment and<br /> looking to impress him even further, proclaims, ""I'll bet you<br /> $10 that I can fly down there, screw her and fly back before she<br /> even realizes that I'm doing it."" His friend, eyes still fixed<br /> on the naked beauty, looks at Superman and just starts laughing.<br /> ""I'd like to see that...you're on.""</p>
<p>So Superman flies down, bam-bam-bam, flies back and says, ""See,<br /> I told you I could."" His friend, obviously impressed, forks over<br /> the $10. Just then, Wonder Woman says, ""What the hell was that?""<br /> And the invisible man replies back, ""I don't know, but my ass<br /> sure does hurt.""</p>

"
20575,"<p>If your favorite color is:</p>
<p>RED Tend to be tigers in the sack. They are easily aroused and enjoy sex in every way imaginable. Once the sexual spark is lighted, it may take hours to extinguish. When two Reds get together, the ensuing erotica could make Lady Chatterley blush. Lovers of Red tend to be the aggressors and weaker colors should beware!</p>
<p>YELLOW If you tend to favor Yellow your sexual drivers are complex and lean toward the adaptable. The favorite color of homosexuals is Yellow! No don't panic, not everyone who wears Yellow is gay.  In most cases the person will acquiesce to the stronger partner's desires in a passive manner. You will never enjoy sex to the fullest, but you will never turn down an invitation from someone you enjoy or admire.</p>
<p>PURPLE Lovers of the color Purple frequently consider themselves too regal for a fun romp in the sack. Women sometimes are the type who hate to muss their hair. Men are businesslike in their approach to lovemaking. In both sexes, Purple partners are more concerned with their fulfillment than anyone else's gratification.</p>
<p>BLACK Black color preferences point to Black sex. These people are the misfits of the sex world and seek out each other in kinship. They tend to prefer perverted sex and are usually masochistic or sadistic in nature. They are moody people and often perform at their peak when under stress or during unhappy times. Police psychiatrists claim that many sex offenders prefer the color Black. And it is no coincidence that the uniform of monsters and teenaged gangs is Black attire.</p>
<p>GREEN Those who prefer Green are fresh and innocent in their approach to sex. Women who love Green will make love like virgins all of their life. And a man may always be a trifle clumsy and awkward, but in a charming and endearing sort of way. Green lovers are gentle, but not passionate. If chosen as a mate, one will never need worry about infidelity.</p>
<p>PINK Persons who like Pink show a reluctance to mature in sexual matters. Women tend to tease; to promise more than they intend to deliver. In some cases, they flaunt their femininity - but because they secretly hate men.</p>
<p>A great percentage of prostitutes boast entire lingerie wardrobes in Pink. Men who like Pink are philanderers and flirts. They are the type who will take three dates for the same evening and not keep one; preferring to pick up a dish in some bar, instead. Women whose husbands like Pink should keep a secret nest egg for when they are deserted. Pink indicates a tendency to squander money.</p>
<p>ORANGE People who favor Orange tend to have sexual fantasies. The sex act is regarded as a dramatic role, a one-act play in which they are the star. Foreplay is as important as the act of love. They whisper sweet nothings; meaningless dialogue they feel fits their image. Orange people often do not experience orgasm, but they put on a darn good act. Men tend to pull their partner's hair and women leave red welts on their sex partners back. But the bruises and the ballyhoo add up to nothing.</p>
<p>BROWN If you love Brown, you are a real treasure for the right mate. Brown lovers tend to be warm and deep. Sensitive to the needs and desires of their partners. Sex is a 24-hour a day thing to them. They can't say ""I Love You"" often enough. Snuggling by the fire, walking in the rain or catching snowflakes on their tongue is a turn on to a lover of Brown. They need lots of time and privacy to make love. But their emotions are such that one harsh word could end the affair.</p>
<p>GRAY The color Gray is preferred by people who are indecisive. They can't get excited about anything - including colors - so they choose a noncommittal shade. Men who prefer Gray look at sex as a means of relieving tension, (nothing more, nothing less). It's wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Women who prefer Gray don't make love, they have intercourse. And for one of two reasons, to accommodate their mate or to become pregnant. They count the cracks in the bedroom plaster until the sex act is over with and done. When a Gray marries another Gray, the marriage is made in heaven. But when teamed with another color, the Gray spouse considers the color's infidelity a blessing.</p>
<p>BLUE Lovers of Blue are wonderful sex partners. They are sincere, affectionate and sensitive to their partners needs. They consider lovemaking a fine art and their approach is elegant. Men who love Blue are like concert pianists; delicately ravaging their partner like they would play a baby grand. Women in the Blue category enjoy sex to the fullest. They are exciting partners, but their passion might be compared to tidal waves rather than fiery aggression. Both men and women enjoy foreplay and the aftermath of love-making as much as the sex act itself. In marriage, a Blue person is a wonderful mate - never failing to please the spouse and never seeking outside interests.</p>
<p>WHITE If a person in infatuated with White, sex often seems dirty. These people are puritanical in nature. French kissing is obscene and to make love in daylight in unheard of. Women who love White will undress beneath the covers. Men will shower before and after the sex act. These people will use pet names for their genitals.</p>

20586,"<p>Dear Technical Support:</p>
<p>I'm currently running the latest version of GirlFriend and I've<br /> been having some problems lately. I've been running the same<br /> version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 forever as my primary<br /> application, and all the GirlFriend releases I've tried have<br /> always conflicted with it. I hear that DrinkingBuddies won't<br /> crash if GirlFriend is run in background mode and the sound is<br /> turned off. But I'm embarrassed to say I can't find the switch<br /> to turn the sound off. I just run them separately, and it works<br /> okay.</p>
<p>Girlfriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf<br /> program, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing<br /> incompatibility.</p>
<p>I probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought<br /> I might see better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months<br /> of conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has<br /> had experience with GirlFriend 2.0. He said I probably didn't<br /> have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0, and eventually it would<br /> require a Token Ring to run properly. He was right - as soon as<br /> I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, I installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the<br /> bugs were supposed to be gone, but the first time I used it, it<br /> gave me a virus anyway. I had to clean out my whole system and<br /> shut down for a while. I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend<br /> 4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a<br /> virus protection program. It worked okay for a while until I<br /> discovered that GirlFriend 1.0 was still in my system. I tried<br /> running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still<br /> installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I didn't know about<br /> that automatically senses the presence of any other version of<br /> GirlFriend and communicates with it in some way, which results<br /> in the immediate removal of both versions.</p>
<p>The version I have now works pretty well, but there are still<br /> some problems. Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in<br /> some obscure language I can't understand, much less reprogram.<br /> Frankly I think there is too much attention paid to the look and<br /> feel rather than the desired functionality. Also, to get the<br /> best connections with your hardware, you usually have to use<br /> gold-plated contacts. And I've never liked how GirlFriend is<br /> totally ""object-oriented."" A year ago, a friend of mine upgraded<br /> his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a<br /> Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. He discovered<br /> that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don't<br /> upgrade to Fiancee 1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had<br /> to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a huge resource<br /> hog. It has taken up all his space, so he can't load anything<br /> else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go with Wife 1.0<br /> was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out<br /> the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits<br /> access to FreeSexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted<br /> to try. On top of that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well<br /> warmed-up system before he can do anything. Although he did not<br /> ask for it, Wife 1.0 came with MotherInLaw which has an<br /> automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off.</p>
<p>I told him to try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he heard<br /> if you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife<br /> 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself.<br /> Then Mistress 1.0 won't install anyway because of insufficient<br /> resources. Any Ideas???</p>

20616,"<p>BECAUSE I'M A GUY   Because I'm a guy, I must hold the television remote control in my hand while I watch TV. If the thing has been misplaced, I'll miss a whole show looking for it, though one time I was able to survive by holding a calculator.<br /> Because I'm a guy, when I lock my keys in the car I will fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we call a road service until long after hypothermia has set in. Oh, and when the car isn't running very well, I will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if I know what I'm looking at. If another guy shows up, one of us will say to the other, ""I used to be able to fix these things, but now with all these computers and everything, I wouldn't know where to start."" We will then drink beer. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, when I catch a cold I need someone to bring me soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan. You never get as sick as I do, so for you this isn't an issue. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I can be relied upon to purchase basic groceries at the store, like milk or bread. I cannot be expected to find exotic items like ""cumin"" or ""tofu."" For all I know these are the same thing. And never, under any circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which ""feminine hygiene product"" is a euphemism. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, when one of our appliances stops working I will insist on taking it apart -- despite evidence that this will just cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and has to put it back together. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I don't think we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen to a complete stranger -- how the heck could HE know where we're going? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, there is no need to ask me what I'm thinking about. The answer is always either sex or football, though I have to make up something else when you ask, so don't. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I do not want to visit your mother, or have your mother come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or think about her any more than I have to. Whatever you got her for Mother's Day is okay, I don't need to see it. Did you remember to pick up something for my mom, too?</p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I am capable of announcing, ""one more beer and I really have to go,"" and mean it every single time I say it, even when it gets to the point that the one bar closes and my buddies and I have to go hunt down another. I will find it increasingly hilarious to have my pals call you to tell you I'll be home soon, and no, I don't understand why you threw all my clothes into the front yard. What's the connection? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, you don't have to ask me if I liked the movie. Chances are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, yes, I have to turn up the radio when Bruce Springsteen or The Doors comes on, and then, yes, I have to tell you every single time about how Bruce had his picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek the same day, or how Jim Morrison is buried in Paris and everyone visits his grave. Please do not behave as if you do not find this fascinating. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I think what you're wearing is fine. I thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too. Either pair of shoes is fine. With the belt or without it looks fine. Your hair is fine. You look fine. Can we just go now? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy and this is, after all, the '90s, I will share equally in the housework. You do the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning and the dishes. I'll do the rest.</p>

20631,"<p>Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event. It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal. Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer came to him and said, ""Now don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's never lost a match because of this ""pretzel"" hold he has. Whatever you do, don't let him get you in this hold! If he does, you're finished!"" </p>
<p>The wrestler nodded in agreement. </p>
<p>Now, to the match: The American and the Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold! A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn't watch the ending. Suddenly there was a scream, a cheep from the crowd, and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The Russian's back hit the mat with a thud, and the American weakly collapsed on top of him, getting the pin and winning the match. The trainer was astounded! </p>
<p>When he finally got the American wrestler alone, he asks, ""How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before!"" </p>
<p>The wrestler answered, ""Well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face. I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could. ""You'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls!""</p>

<p>He always had trouble getting his key into the keyhole and getting the door opened. His wife, waiting up for him, would go to the door and let him in. </p>
<p>Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out, and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry continued his nightly routine. </p>
<p>One day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior, and was particularly distraught by it all. </p>
<p>The friend listened to her, and then said, ""Why don't you treat him a little differently, when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words, and welcome him home with a kiss? He then might change his ways."" </p>
<p>The wife thought that might be a good idea. </p>
<p>That night, Harry took off again, after dinner. And, about midnight, he arrived home, in his usual condition.</p>
<p>His wife heard him at the door, and quickly went to it, and opened the door, and let Harry in.</p>
<p>This time, instead of berating him, as she had always done, she took his arm, and led him into the living room. She sat him down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. </p>
<p>Then she went behind him, and started to cuddle him a little. After a little while, she said to him, ""It's pretty late, dear. I think we had better go upstairs to bed, now, don't you think?""</p>
<p>At that, Harry replied, in his inebriated state, ""I guess we might as well. I'll be getting in trouble with the stupid wife when I get home anyway!"" </p>

20686,"<p>Dos semanas despu�s de comenzadas las clases, Anastasio, un estudiante latinoamericano, llega a un sal�n en la Universidad de Massachusetts. Se presenta con el catedr�tico; le explica su tardanza y �ste le permite pasar.</p>
<p>""Empecemos"", dice el profesor, ""revisemos un poco de historia de EE.UU. �Qui�n dijo la frase: Denme libertad, o denme la muerte?""</p>
<p>Un mar de caras sin sustancia se le puso enfrente, excepto la de Anastasio, quien ten�a la mano levantada:</p>
<p>""Patrick Henry, 1775"", dijo en ingl�s.</p>
<p>Continu� el maestro:</p>
<p>""�Qui�n pronunci� la frase: Un gobierno del pueblo, por el pueblo y para el pueblo no perecer� de la tierra?""</p>
<p>Nuevamente Anastasio, con la mano en alto, responde:</p>
<p>""Abraham Lincoln, 1863"".</p>
<p>El educador pierde compostura y rega�a a toda la clase:</p>
<p>""Les deber�a dar verg�enza que este muchacho, que es reci�n llegado a nuestro pa�s, sepa m�s que ustedes"".</p>
<p>El maestro se vuelve hacia el pizarr�n para escribir la siguiente pregunta, cuando escucha a un estudiante susurrar:</p>
<p>""�Malditos latinos!""</p>
<p>""�Qui�n dijo eso?"", pregunta, molesto, el profesor.</p>
<p>""Primer Movimiento Raza Blanca, 1985"", contesta Anastasio.</p>
<p>Otro estudiante, ya molesto y apabullado por la superioridad de conocimientos de Anastasio, anuncia desde el fondo:</p>
<p>""Voy a vomitar"".</p>
<p>""�Qui�n dijo eso?"", inquiere, nuevamente, el maestro.</p>
<p>""George Bush al Primer Ministro japon�s, 1991"", indica, otra vez, Anastasio.</p>
<p>Ahora, ya verdaderamente irritado, un tercer estudiante le grita a Anastasio:</p>
<p>""�Eh, m�mame el pito!""</p>
<p>""�Qui�n fue el que dijo eso?"", pregunta, furibundo, el mentor.</p>
<p>""Bill Clinton a Monica Lewinsky, 1998"", afirma Anastasio.</p>

20697,"<p>A very self-important young man goes out and buys what he believes is the best car available: a 1997 Porsche 911 Turbo. It is one of the fastest and most expensive cars in the world.</p>
<p>That night, he takes it out for a spin and, while doing so, stops at a red light. An old man on a mo-ped (both looking about 90 years old) pulls up next to him. </p>
<p>The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the car and asks, ""What kind of car ya' got there, sonny?""</p>
<p>The young man replies, ""A 1997 Porsche 911 Turbo. It cost me $100,000.""</p>
<p>""That's a lot of money,"" replies the old man. ""Why do they cost so much?""</p>
<p>""Because this car can do up to 180 miles an hour!"" states the young man proudly.</p>
<p>The mo-ped driver asks, ""Can I take a look inside?""</p>
<p>""Sure,"" replies the owner.</p>
<p>So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around. Leaning back on his mo-ped, the old man says, ""That's a pretty nice car, all right!""</p>
<p>Just then the light changes, so the young guy decides to show the old man what his car can do. He floors it, and within 10 seconds the speedometer reads 120 MPH. </p>
<p>Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror that seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be and suddenly, whhhoooossshhh! Something whips by him, going much faster!</p>
<p>""What on earth could be going faster than my Porsche 911 Turbo?"" the young man asks himself. Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot coming toward him. Whoooooosh! It goes by again, heading the opposite direction! And, it almost looked like the old man on the mo-ped!</p>
<p>""Couldn't be,"" thinks the guy. ""How could a mo-ped outrun a Porsche 911 Turbo?""</p>
<p>Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whooooosh-BLAMMM! It plows into the back of his car. The young man jumps out. It is the old man! Of course, the mo-ped and the old man are hurting for certain. </p>
<p>He runs up to the old man and says, ""You're hurt bad! Is there anything I can do for you?""</p>
<p>The old man groans and replies, ""Yes. Unhook my suspenders from your side mirror, please.""</p>

20703,"<p>Any improbable event which would create maximum confusion.</p>
"
20704,"<p>While visiting England recently, George W. Bush was invited to have tea with the Queen.</p>
<p>Given his recent political problems, he decides to take advantage of her years of leadership experience and asks her for her advice. She responds that she surrounds herself with the most intelligent people she can find and lets them do their jobs.</p>
<p>Intrigued with this novel theory, Bush asks her how she is able to tell if the people are intelligent.</p>
<p>""I do so by asking them a test question"" responds the Queen. ""Allow me to demonstrate.""</p>
<p>The Queen then dials 10 Downing Street and asks to speak to Tony Blair. ""Mr. Prime Minister, please answer a hypothetical question for me.""</p>
<p>""I'll do my best, Your Majesty"" responds Blair.</p>
<p>""Your mother has a child and your father has a child"" says the Queen. ""The child is not your brother or your sister. Who is the child?""</p>
<p>Tony Blair hesitates momentarily and then confidently replies, ""Well, Your Majesty, I guess it would have to be me.""</p>
<p>""Correct"" says the Queen. ""Thank you and good day to you Sir.""</p>
<p>The Queen hangs up and says ""Did you hear that Mr. Bush? See how clever he is.""</p>
<p>Impressed, Bush replies ""I certainly did. I'll definitely be using that one when I conduct my next Cabinet shuffle back in the US.""</p>
<p>Upon returning to Washington, Bush decides he'd better put some of his senior Cabinet Members to the test. He summons Dick Cheney to his office and says, ""Dick, I wonder if you could answer a question for me?""</p>
<p>""Why of course Sir"" Cheney responds unenthusiastically, annoyed that the President was again seeking his input on something.</p>
<p>""Well, uh, let's say your mother has a child and your father too has a child. This child is not your brother and also is not your sister. Who is it?""</p>
<p>Somewhat surprised at this odd question, Cheney hems and haws and finally asks if he can have some time to think about it.</p>
<p>""Certainly"" responds Bush.</p>
<p>Cheney immediately calls a meeting of other senior Republicans and they puzzle over the question for several hours. Totally baffled, they decide to conduct some research and contact a loyal Washington consulting firm. A budget of $10 million is provided and intensive research is carried out over the next two weeks. Unfortunately, the consultants are unable to come up with an answer.</p>
<p>Desperate to prove that he is smarter than George, Cheney decides to take a chance and calls Al Gore.</p>
<p>""I realize you are just an Tennessee redneck and are not all that wise in the ways of the world, but maybe you can help me out with a problem I have.</p>
<p>Gore is naturally skeptical about Republican promises, but in the spirit of political co-operation he agrees to do what he can to help out.</p>
<p>""O.K., here goes"" says Cheney. ""Your mother has a child and your father has a child. The child is not your brother or your sister. Who is the child?""</p>
<p>Without hesitating, Gore responds ""It would be me, of course.""</p>
<p>Impressed at the his quick response, Cheney quickly brushes off Gore and rushes to the President's office (where he is watching football and eating snack foods under the careful observation of the Secret Service on the lookout for choking).</p>
<p>"" I know the answer to your question, you Idiot!! I know who the child is!!""</p>
<p>Bush, who was privately becoming a bit concerned at the delay in hearing back from Cheney, is delighted (when he finally remembers what it was that he asked). ""Who is it Dick?"" he asks.</p>
<p>With obvious pride, Cheney replies ""It's Al Gore, George - its Al Gore!!""</p>
<p>Stunned, Bush shouts in disgust, ""Wrong you idiot - it's Tony Blair!!""</p>

The thrid string says ''Oh, I come in here all the time, I know how to order something to drink'' The third sting walks to the restroom where he ties himself up and muffs up his end. He then walks out to the bar and asks the bartender for three beers. The bartender kind of looks at him weird and says, ''You a string?'' ''Frayed knot,'' he replies.</p>

You are not allowed to say I love you and then a week later<br /> say no i dont, if youre not sure whether the feelings will last<br /> dont say it in the first place.<br /> 3.

Do not go further with a person and say that you think a<br /> relationship will come of it, and then when stuff has happenned<br /> say you dont want a relationship with the person in question.</p>

<p>12&gt; With her passion sated, her breath returning and her love satisfied as it had never been before, there was nothing left for the black widow to do but to bite off and devour her lover's head and go lay her eggs.</p>
<p>11&gt; ""Oink!"" she snorted.  It was just the word he needed to hear.</p>
<p>10&gt; Elsie slowed deliberately, giving the grazing young bulls a languorous view of her asset -- full, pink and pendulous. Her tail coyly swished, affording peek-a-boo glances irresistible to the randy nose-ringed, teats-and-grass trio. Oh, yes, there would be mounting tonight.</p>
<p>9&gt; The leg bounced seductively, up and down, up and down --  until Mr. Bojangles could no longer contain his passion.</p>
<p>8&gt; Ed was a stud and he knew it.  He liked to sow his oats and nothing could harness him.  Sex was his mane concern and he loved to stirrup romance.  When he was going at it, he would pace himself.  He didn't stall.  He knew his bit. Yes, Ed was a stud.</p>

20828,"<p>The Pope met with his cardinals to discuss a proposal from Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of Israel.<br /> �Your Holiness,� said one of the Cardinals, �Mr. Netanyahu wants to challenge you to a game of golf to show the friendship and ecumenical spirit shared by the Jewish and Catholic faiths.� </p>
<p>The Pope thought it was a good idea, but he had never held a golf club in his hand, �Have we not,� he asked, �a cardinal who can represent me against the leader of Israel?� </p>
<p>�None that plays golf very well,� a cardinal said. �But,� he added, �there is a man named Jack Nicklaus, an American golfer who is a devout Catholic. We can offer to make him a cardinal, then ask him to play Benjamin Netanyahu as your personal representative. In addition to showing our spirit of cooperation, we�ll also win the match.� </p>
<p>Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made. Of course Nicklaus was honored and agreed to play. The day after the match, Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the Pope of the result. </p>
<p>�I have some good news and some bad news, Your Holiness,� said the golfer. �Tell me the good news first, Cardinal Nicklaus,� said the Pope. </p>
<p>�Well,� your Holiness, �I don�t like to brag, but even though I�ve played some pretty terrific rounds of golf in my life, this was the best I have ever played, by far. I must have been inspired from above. My drives were long and true, my irons were accurate and purposeful and my putting was perfect. With all due respect, my play was truly miraculous.� </p>
<p>�There�s bad news?� the Pope asked. </p>

<p>He asked the janitor to cover for him and gave him the confessions book then sped off in the direction of the bathroom.</p>
<p>The janitor was a little bewildered but he went into the cubicle and sat down. A woman came knelt in front of his window and said, ""Father I have sinned. I cheated on my husband.""</p>
<p>The janitor scanned in the book until he found ""adultery"". He told the woman to say 50 ""Hail Mary's"" and wash in holy water.</p>

20833,"<p>It got crowded in heaven, so, for one day it was decided only to<br /> accept people who had really had a bad day on the day they died. St.<br /> Peter was standing at the pearly gates and said to the first man,<br /> ""Tell me about the day you died.""</p>
<p>The man said, ""Oh, it was awful. I was sure my wife was having an<br /> affair, so I came home early to catch her with him. I searched all<br /> over the apartment but couldn't find him anywhere. So I went out onto<br /> the balcony, we live on the 25th floor, and found this man hanging<br /> over the edge by his fingertips. I went inside, got a hammer, and<br /> started hitting his hands. He fell, but landed in some bushes. So, I<br /> got the refrigerator and pushed it over the balcony and it crushed<br /> him. The strain of the act gave me a heart attack, and I died.""</p>
<p>St. Peter couldn't deny that this was a pretty bad day, and since it<br /> was a crime of passion, he let the man in.</p>
<p>He then asked the next man in line about the day he died. ""Well, sir,<br /> it was awful,"" said the second man. ""I was doing aerobics on the<br /> balcony of my 26th floor apartment when I twisted my ankle and<br /> slipped over the edge. I managed to grab the balcony of the apartment<br /> below, but some maniac came out and started pounding on my fingers<br /> with a hammer. Luckily I landed in some bushes. But, then the guy<br /> dropped a refrigerator on me!""</p>
<p>St. Peter chuckled, let him into heaven and decided he could really<br /> start to enjoy this job.</p>
<p>""Tell me about the day you died?"", he said to the third man in line.</p>
<p>""OK, picture this; I'm naked, hiding inside a refrigerator....""</p>
"
20834,"<p>There were two men in a bar talking and the first man began to tell<br /> the second man a story:</p>
<p>""One day St. Peter sent an angel to Earth to make a list of all the<br /> people that were doing hanky-panky.  The angel soon found that this<br /> was a monumental task, so he asked St. Peter for some assistance.<br /> However, none could be given due to the labor shortage.  So, a<br /> compromise was reached in that the angel would a list of those persons<br /> not engaging in hanky-panky.  This was a much shorter list.  Upon<br /> returning with the list, the angel was bid of St Peter to send a<br /> letter of commendation to all those on the list that had not<br /> participated in hanky-panky.""</p>
<p>At this point the first man turned to the second and asked,""And do you<br /> know what the letter said?""  ""No, what did the letter say?""  ""Ah, so<br /> you didn't get one either!""</p>

Suddenly the train went through a tunnel, and as it was an old style train, there were no lights in the carriages and it went completely dark.Then there was this kissing noise and the sound of a loud slap.When the train came out of the tunnel, Claudia Schiffer and the Irishman were sitting as if nothing had happened and the Englishman had his hand against his face as he had been slapped there.The Englishman was thinking, 'The Irish fella must have kissed Claudia Schiffer and she missed him and slapped me instead.'Claudia Schiffer was thinking, 'The Englishman must have tried to kiss me and actually kissed the Irishman and got slapped for it.'And the Irishman was thinking, 'This is great. The next time the train goes through a tunnel, I'll make another kissing noise and slap that English bastard again!'</p>

20841,"<p>A tourist walks into a curio shop in San Francisco. Looking around at the exotica, he notices a very lifelike life-sized bronze statue of a rat.  It has no price tag, but is so strikingly unique that he decides he must have it.</p>
<p>He takes it to the owner: ""How much for the bronze rat?""  ""$12 for the rat, $100 for the story,"" says the owner.  The tourist gives the man $12. ""I'll just take the rat, you can keep the story.""</p>
<p>As he walks down the street carrying his bronze rat, he notices that a few real rats have crawled out of the alleys and sewers and begun following him down the street. This is disconcerting, and he begins walking faster. But within a couple of blocks, the herd of rats behind him has grown to hundreds, and they begin squealing.  He begins to trot toward the Bay, looking around to see that the rats now number in the MILLIONS, and are squealing and coming toward him faster and faster. Concerned, even scared, he runs to the edge of the Bay, and throws the bronze rat as far out into the water as he can.  Amazingly, the millions of rats all jump into the Bay after it, and are all drowned.  The man walks back to the curio shop.</p>
<p>""Ah ha,"" says the owner, ""you have come back for the story?""</p>
<p>""No,"" says the man, ""I came back to see if you have a bronze Republican.""</p>

<p>Frank decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks, Frank soon recovered and vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the black bear and shot it.</p>
<p>There was another tap on his shoulder.</p>
<p>This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him. The grizzly says: ""That was a huge mistake, Frank. You've got two choices. Either I maul you to death or we have REALLY rough sex.""</p>
<p>Again, Frank thought it was better to comply. Although he survived, it would take several months before Frank finally recovered. Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed to track down the grizzly and shot it.</p>
<p>He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder. He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there.</p>
<p>The polar bear says:<br /> ""Admit it, Frank, you don't come here for the hunting, do you?""</p>

20857,"<p>In 1993, the American Government funded a study to see why the<br /> head of a man's penis was larger than the shaft. After one year<br /> and $180,000.00, they concluded that the reason the head was<br /> larger than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure during<br /> sex. After the US published the study, France decided to do<br /> their own study. After $250,000.00, and 3 years of research,<br /> they concluded that the reason was to give the woman more<br /> pleasure during sex.

20890,"<p>""What does this golf ball do?"" Frank asked the manager of the<br /> golf shop. ""This golf ball magnetically attracts to all sorts of<br /> holes. It depends on what direction you hit the ball in. If it<br /> goes straight towards the hole, it will go into the hole"" the<br /> manager replied. ""I'll buy it."" Frank bought this rather strange<br /> golf ball and walked out to the golf course, where his friend<br /> Bill, was waiting for him.</p>
<p>The first hole was a Par 3, so Frank had a good chance of<br /> getting a hole-in-one on this hole. After Bill had played his<br /> first shot, Frank stuck the tee into the ground and placed his<br /> magnetic golf ball on top of it. When he was set, Frank hit the<br /> ball straight towards the hole and got a hole-in-one. ""You can't<br /> ask for a better start than that Frank"", said Bill. Frank smiled.</p>
<p>For the next sixteen holes, Frank's weird golf ball found holes<br /> to go into after every shot. However, most of these holes that<br /> the ball went into were either a bunker or the hole itself.<br /> There was one occasion though, when the ball went into one of<br /> the pockets in Bill's pants, but this doesn't compare with what<br /> happened on the eighteenth hole.</p>
<p>Bill had already played his first shot on the eighteenth, and<br /> Frank was about to play his. The eighteenth hole had a large<br /> hill in which the ball had to be hit over. The hole and pin<br /> could not be seen from where Frank and Bill were.</p>
<p>Since this hole is a Par 3, Frank could get another hole-in-one.<br /> When Frank was set he hit the ball, and to his disappointment he<br /> hooked it to the left. A few seconds later, a loud noise could<br /> be heard ""Aaaaaaaargh!!!!"" Frank and Bill had no idea where the<br /> noise came from, so they both walked over the hill to look for<br /> their balls.</p>
<p>Bill found his ball straight away, but Frank was having great<br /> difficulty in finding his ball. Frank had spent about twenty<br /> minutes trying to find his ball, when he decided to give up and<br /> use another ball. ""I'll use another ball for my second shot<br /> Bill, but first I need to go to the toilet"". Frank walked over<br /> to the public toilets, which was about twenty meters to the left<br /> of the eighteenth green.</p>
<p>When Frank walked into the public toilets he heard a voice, ""Is<br /> there anyone there?"" ""Yes there is,"" replied Frank, as he walked<br /> towards the cubicle at the far end. When he got to the cubicle<br /> door, which was open, Frank asked the man, ""What do you want?""<br /> ""I need a doctor,"" came the reply. ""Why do you need a doctor?""<br /> Frank asked curiously. After Frank asked this question, the man<br /> in the cubicle did something strange. He stood up, turned around<br /> and flashed his naked backside at Frank, who suddenly became<br /> worried, ""Holy shit!!!!""</p>
<p>""What is it?"" said the man in the cubicle. ""You wouldn't believe<br /> what's stuck up there!!"" Frank said. ""What is?"" ""My fucking golf<br /> ball, that's what!!!!""</p>

20894,"<p>A male and female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they<br /> noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had<br /> harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Let's<br /> both swim under the ship and blowout of our air holes at the same time and it<br /> should cause the ship to turn over and sink"". They tried it and sure enough the<br /> ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors<br /> had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore.</p>
<p>The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female,<br /> ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore. At this<br /> point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him.</p>
<p>""Look"", she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to<br /> swallow the seamen"". </p>

He thought, �I better open this one and see what it�s all about.�So he opened it and it read: �Dear God, I am an 83 year old widow living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had a hundred dollars in it which was all the money I had until my next pension check.� �Next Sunday is Easter, and I had invited two of my friends over for dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with.� �I have no family to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me?�The postal worker was touched, and went around showing the letter to all the others. Each of them dug into his wallet and came up with a few dollars. By the time he made the rounds, he had collected 96 dollars, which they put into an envelope and sent over to her. The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of the nice thing they had done.Easter came and went, and a few days later came another letter from the old lady to God. All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.It read, �Dear God, How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me?� �Because of your generosity, I was able to fix a lovely dinner for my friends. We had a very nice day, and I told my friends of your wonderful gift. � �By the way, there was 4 dollars missing. It was no doubt those thieving bastards at the post office.�</p>

<p>We always spent Christmas with Grandpa and Grandma. They used to live here in a big brick house, but Grandpa got retarted and they moved to Arizona.</p>
<p>They go to a big building they call a wrecked hall. But if it was wrecked, it is fixed now. They play games there and do exercises, but they don't do them very well.</p>
<p>There is a swimming pool and they go to it and just stand in the water with their hats on. I guess they don't know how to swim. My Grandma used to bake cookies and stuff, but I guess she forgot how. Nobody cooks there. They all go to fastfood restaurants.</p>
<p>As you come into the park, there is a doll house with a man sitting in it. He watches all day so they can't get out without him seeing them. They wear badges with their names on them. I guess they don't know who they are.</p>

<p>If you agree to all her likes, she is abusing. If you don't, you are not understanding. </p>
<p>If you make romance, you are an 'experienced man'. If you don't you are half a man. </p>
<p>If you visit her too often, she thinks it is boring. If you don't, she accuses you of double crossing. </p>
<p>If you are well dressed, she says you are a playboy. If you don't, you are a dull boy. </p>
<p>If you are jealous, she says it's bad. If you don't , she thinks you do not love her. </p>
<p>If you attempt a romance, she says you didn't respect her. If you don't, she thinks you do not like her. </p>
<p>If you are a minute late, she complains it's hard to wait. If she is late, she says that's a girl's way. </p>
<p>If you visit another, she accuses you of being a heel. If she is visited by another, 'oh it's natural, we are girls. </p>

<p>If you fail to help her in crossing the street, you lack ethics. If you do, she thinks it's just one of the man's tactics. </p>

Regardless of the problem, calling Microsoft Tech Support won't help.     4. As they mature, we pray that they will be better than that which preceeded them.     5. At first release they're relatively compact, but they seem to grow and grow and grow with each passing year.     6. Although announced with great fanfare, pretty much anyone could have produced one.     7. They arrive in shaky condition with inadequate documentation.     8. No matter what, it takes several months between the announcement and the actual release.     9. Bill gets the credit but someone else did most of the work.     10.

20999,"<p>Dear Abby,</p>
<p>My husband has cheated on me our entire marriage. He tells<br /> everybody how much he loves me, but they all know what he's<br /> doing. He has many influential friends and they just pretend<br /> it's not happening because they want his help in big deals.<br /> They're so snowed by him that they avoid the whole issue. I know<br /> I should be thankful that he is successful in his profession,<br /> but now many of his coworkers are leery of him. Every time he<br /> gets caught, he first denies it all, then admits that he was<br /> wrong and begs me to forgive him. This has been going on for so<br /> long, everyone in town knows he's a cheater. I don't know what to<br /> do. Frustrated. </p>
<p>Dear Frustrated,</p>
<p>Why don't you move to New York and run for the Senate? </p>
<p>Abby</p>
