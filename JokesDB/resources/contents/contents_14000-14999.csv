14002,"<p>A keen country lad applied for a salesman's job at a city department store. In fact it was the biggest store in the world - you could get anything there.</p>
<p>The boss asked him, ""Have you ever been a salesman before?""</p>
<p>""Yes, I was a salesman in the country"" said the lad.</p>
<p>The boss liked the cut of him and said, ""You can start tomorrow and I'll come and see you when we close up.""</p>
<p>The day was long and arduous for the young man, but finally 5 o'clock came around. The boss duly fronted up and asked, ""How many sales did you make today?"".</p>
<p>""One,"" said the young salesman.</p>
<p>""Only one,"" blurted the boss, ""Most of my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day. How much was the sale worth?""</p>
<p>""Three hundred thousand dollars,"" said the young man.</p>
<p>""How did you manage that?"" asked the flabbergasted boss.</p>
<p>""Well,"" said the salesman, ""this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook. Then I sold him a small fishing line, a medium one and a huge big one. I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast. I said he would probably need a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that twenty foot schooner with the twin engines. Then he said his Volkswagen probably wouldn't be able to pull it, so I took him to the car department and sold him the new Deluxe Cruiser.""</p>
<p>The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, ""You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook?""</p>
<p>""No,"" answered the salesman, ""He came in to buy a box of Tampons for his wife and I said to him, 'Your weekend's shot, you may as well go fishing.'""</p>

<p>""Not a problem...after 25 years of Harley riding, I can do that with the best of them."" </p>

<p>Once again Enoch turns from the door. ""I've seen some wild sex at these parties too."" </p>
<p>""Now that is not a problem,"" says Sam, ""remember, I've been alone for six months. I'll definitely be there! By the way...what should I wear to the party?"" </p>
<p>Enoch stops in the door again and says, ""Whatever you want...it's just gonna be the two of us."" </p>

14011,"<p>Dear Mother and Dad,    </p>
<p>It has been three months now since I left for college.  I have been remiss in<br /> writing and I am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not writing before.  I<br /> will bring you up to date now, but before you read<br /> on, please sit down.  You are not to read further unless you are sitting down,<br /> okay?    </p>
<p>Well, then, I'm getting along pretty well now.  The skull fracture and  the<br /> concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory  when it caught<br /> fire shortly after my arrival here is pretty well healed.  I only spent two<br /> weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those sick<br /> headaches once a day.    </p>
<p>Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an<br /> attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the<br /> fire department and the ambulance.  He also visited me in<br /> the hospital and since I have nowhere to live because of the burnt-out<br /> dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment. It's really a<br /> basement room, and it's kind of cute.  He is a very fine boy and we have fallen<br /> deeply in love and are planning to get married.    </p>
<p>We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins<br /> to show.  I know how much you are looking forward to being grandparents, and I<br /> know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender<br /> care you gave me when I was a child.    </p>
<p> The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has a minor<br /> infection that prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I<br /> carelessly caught it from him.  I have bumps all over my<br /> ""down there"" but this will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am<br /> taking daily.  I know that you will welcome him into our family with open arms.<br /> He is kind and although not well educated,he is ambitious.  Although he is of a<br /> different race, color and religion than ours, I know your often-expressed<br /> tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by this fact.<br /> Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no<br /> dormitory fire.  I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture.  I was not in<br /> the hospital.  I am not pregnant.  I am not engaged.  I do not have a disease<br /> and there is no miscegenation in my<br /> life.  However, I am getting a ""D"" in history and an ""F"" in science, and I<br /> wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.    </p>
<p>Your loving daughter, Kimberly!</p>

""I want you each to keep your eye on this antique watch. It's a very special watch. Its been in my family for six generations."" He began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting, ""Watch the watch, watch the watch, watch the watch....""The crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, light gleaming off its polished surface. Hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch, until suddenly it slipped from the hypnotist's fingers and fell to the floor, breaking into a hundred pieces. ""Shit"" said the hypnotist.It took three weeks to clean up the theater.</p>

14142,"<p>A game warden noticed how a particular fellow named Sam consistently caught more fish than anyone else, whereas the other guys would only catch three or four a day. Sam would come in off the lake with a boat full. Stringer after stringer was always packed with freshly caught trout. The warden, curious, asked Sam his secret. The successful fisherman invited the game warden to accompany him and observe.So the next morning the two met at the dock and took off in Sam's boat. When they got to the middle of the lake, Sam stopped the boat, and the warden sat back to see how it was done.Sam's approach was simple. He took out a stick of dynamite, lit it, and threw it in the air. The explosion rocked the lake with such a force that dead fish immediately began to surface. Sam took out a net and started scooping them up.Well, you can imagine the reaction of the game warden. When he recovered from the shock of it all, he began yelling at Sam.""You can't do this! I'll put you in jail, buddy! You will be paying every fine there is in the book!""Sam, meanwhile, set his net down and took out another stick of dynamite. He lit it and tossed it in the lap of the game warden with these words, ""Are you going to sit there all day complaining, or are you going to fish?""</p>

14164,"<p>Several years ago the United States funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft. </p>
<p>The study took two years and cost over $180,000. The results of the study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex.</p>
<p>After the results were published, Germany decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the US study were incorrect. After three years of research and costs in excess of $250,000, they concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the women with more pleasure during sex.</p>
<p>When the results of the German study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't trust the US or German studies. So after nearly three weeks of intensive research at a cost of around $75, the Aussie study reached a conclusion. </p>
<p>They came to the final conclusion that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent his hand from flying off and hitting him in the forehead.</p>

14170,"<p>The gift</p>
<p>  A young man wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetheart's<br />   birthday, and as they had not been dating very long, after careful<br />   consideration, he decided a pair of gloves would strike the right<br />   note; romantic, but not too personal.</p>
<p>  Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to<br />   Nordstom and bought a pair of white gloves.  The sister purchased<br />   a pair of panties for herself. </p>
<p>  During the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister<br />   got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties.  Without checking<br />   the contents, the young man sealed the package and sent it to his<br />   sweetheart with the following note:</p>
<p>  ""I choose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing</p>
<p>  any when we go out in the evening.  If it had not been for your sister, I<br />   would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears short<br />   ones that are easier to remove.  These are a delicate shade, but the lady<br />   I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past<br />   three weeks and they were hardly soiled.  I had her try yours on for me<br />   and<br />   she looked really smart.  I wish I was there to put them on you for the<br />   first<br />   time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have<br />   a chance to see you again.  When you take them off, remember to blow in<br />   them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from</p>
<p>  wearing.  Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming<br />   year.  I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night.  All my love.""</p>
<p>  ""P.S.  The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur<br />   showing.""</p>

"
14191,"<p>1. Verbs HAS to agree with their subjects.<br /> 2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.<br /> 3. And don't start a sentence with a conjunction.<br /> 4. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.<br /> 5. Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat)<br /> 6. Also, always avoid annoying alliteration.<br /> 7. Be more or less specific.<br /> 8. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually) unnecessary.<br /> 9. Also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies.<br /> 10. No sentence fragments.<br /> 11. Contractions aren't necessary and shouldn't be used.<br /> 12. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.<br /> 13. Do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it's highly<br />     superfluous.<br /> 14. One should NEVER generalize.<br /> 15. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.<br /> 16. Don't use no double negatives.<br /> 17. Eschew ampersands &amp; abbreviations, etc.<br /> 18. One-word sentences? Eliminate.<br /> 19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.<br /> 20. The passive voice is to be ignored.<br /> 21. Eliminate commas, that are, not necessary. Parenthetical words however<br />     should be enclosed in commas.<br /> 22. Never use a big word when a diminutive one would suffice.<br /> 23. Kill all exclamation points!!!<br /> 24. Use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them.<br /> 25. Understatement is always the absolute best way to put forth<br />     earth-shaking ideas.<br /> 26. Use the apostrophe in it's proper place and omit it when its not<br />     needed.<br /> 27. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""I hate quotations.<br />     Tell me what you know.""<br /> 28. If you've heard it once, you've heard it a thousand times: Resist<br />     hyperbole; not one writer in a million can use it correctly.<br /> 29. Puns are for children, not groan readers.<br /> 30. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.<br /> 31. Even IF a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.<br /> 32. Who needs rhetorical questions?<br /> 33. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.</p>
<p>And finally...</p>
<p>34. Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.</p>

He stepped to the microphone and said:Slowly across the desert sand Trekked a lonely caravan; Men on camels, two by two,Destination Timbuktu.The crowd went crazy! No way could the redneck top that, they thought. The redneck calmly made his way to the microphone and recited:Me and Tim a huntin' went. Met three whores in a pop up tent.

<p>Customer: Depends on what? </p>
<p>Clerk: Actually, a lot of things. </p>
<p>Customer: How about giving me an average price? </p>
<p>Clerk: Wow, that's too hard a question. The lowest price is $9 a gallon, and we have 150 different prices up to $200 a gallon. </p>
<p>Customer: What's the difference in the paint? </p>
<p>Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint. </p>
<p>Customer: Well, then, I'd like some of that $9 paint. </p>
<p>Clerk: Well, first I need to ask you a few questions. When do you intend to use it? </p>
<p>Customer: I want to paint tomorrow, on my day off. </p>
<p>Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint. </p>
<p>Customer: What? When would I have to paint in order to get the $9 version? </p>
<p>Clerk: That would be in three weeks, but you will also have to agree to start painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until at least Sunday. </p>
<p>Customer: You've got to be kidding! </p>
<p>Clerk: Sir, we don't kid around here. Of course, I'll have to check to see if we have any of that paint available before I can sell it to you. </p>
<p>Customer: What do you mean check to see if you can sell it to me? You have shelves full of that stuff; I can see it right there. </p>
<p>Clerk: Just because you can see it doesn't mean that we have it. It may be the same paint, but we sell only a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price just went to $12.</p>
<p>Customer: You mean the price went up while we were talking! </p>
<p>Clerk: Yes, sir. You see, we change prices and rules thousands of times a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with your paint yet, we just decided to change. Unless you want the same thing to happen again, I would suggest that you get on with your purchase. How many gallons do you want? </p>
<p>Customer: I don't know exactly. Maybe five gallons. Maybe I should buy six gallons just to make sure I have enough. </p>
<p>Clerk: Oh, no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy the paint and then don't use it, you will be liable dor penalties and possible confiscation of the paint you already have. </p>
<p>Customer: What? </p>
<p>Clerk: That's right. We can sell you enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do the bedroom, you will be in violation of our tariffs.</p>
<p>Customer: But what does it matter to you whether I use all the paint? I already paid you for it! </p>
<p>Clerk: Sir, there's no point in getting upset; that's just the way it is. We make plans based upon the idea that you will use all the paint, and when you don't, it just causes us all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>Customer: This is crazy! I suppose something terrible will happen if I don't keep painting until after Saturday night! </p>
<p>Clerk: Yes, sir, it will. </p>
<p>Customer: Well, that does it! I'm going somewhere else to buy my paint. </p>

<p>He started to have a good conversation with the barber who attended him. </p>
<p>They talked about so many things and various subjects. </p>
<p>Suddenly, they touched the subject of God.  The barber said: ""Look man, I don't believe that God exists."" </p>
<p>""Why do you say that?"" asked the client. </p>
<p>""Well, it's so easy, you just have to go out in the street to realize that God does not exist.  Oh, tell me, if God existed, would there be so many sick people?  </p>
<p>Would there be abandoned children?  If God existed, there would be no suffering nor pain.  I can't think of loving a God who permits all of these things."" </p>

<p>""How can you say they don't exist?"" asked the barber.  ""Well, I am here and I am a barber."" </p>
<p>""No!"" the client exclaimed. ""They don't exist because if they did there would be no people with long hair and beard like that man who walks in the street."" </p>
<p>""Ah, barbers do exist, what happens is that people do not come to me."" </p>
<p>""Exactly!"" affirmed the client.  </p>
<p>""That's the point. God does exist, what happens is people don't go to Him and do not look for Him.  That's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world."" </p>

<p>The butcher goes to the lawyer's office and asks, ""If a dog, running unleashed, steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a right to demand payment for the meat from the dog's owner?""</p>
<p>""Absolutely,"" the lawyer responded.</p>
<p>The butcher immediately shot back, ""Good! You owe me $7.99 for the roast your dog stole from me this morning.""</p>
<p>The lawyer, without a word, writes the butcher a check for $7.99.</p>
<p>A few days later, the butcher, browsing through his mail, finds an envelope from the lawyer. The contents read ""Consultation: $25.00.""</p>

14228,"<p>French-Bashing to Be Olympic Sport</p>
<p>2/18/2003 - William Grim</p>
<p>Geneva - At its annual meeting, the International Olympic Committee has decided to add French-Bashing to its roster of medal sports in both the Summer and Winter Games.</p>
<p>""We thought it was about time,"" said Jesus de Manuel y Corazon, Chairman of the IOC and the 1968 European French-Bashing Champion. ""Everbody hates those little lying, cowardly, collaborating, garlic-eating, never-bathing, nose-picking French bastards. It's time that French-Bashing was recognized for the truly international sport that it is, one, I might add, that is much more popular than soccer.""</p>
<p>In Summer French-Bashing the Basher runs along a 25 meter path to the Bashee (or the Pierre as it is sometimes called), a typical French sissy picked randomly from the Paris phone book. The first phase of the Bash is called Verbal Bashing in which the Basher has 20 seconds to hurl insults at the Bashee until he starts to cry like a little girl. Then comes the second phase, or Physical Bashing in which the Basher whacks the Bashee over the head with a baseball bat. Play continues until the Bashee surrenders, which in most cases happens immediately because the Bashee is a scairdy-cat Frog after all. Scoring is similar to that in diving in which points are awarded on style, technique and degree of </p>
<p>difficulty.</p>
<p>Winter French-Bashing resembles its Summer counterpart with the exception that the Basher approaches the Bashee on skis.</p>
<p>Sports writers are predicting French-Bashing to be the biggest spectator sport of all time, with the potential of billions of dollars in TV revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in endorsement contracts for world-class bashers.</p>
<p>The United States and Great Britain are already being touted as gold medal contenders for the 2006 Games, with Canada (the only country to produce both world-class bashers and bashees) a very serious challenger.</p>

14230,"<p>A married couple have been stranded on a deserted island for many years. One day another man washes up on shore. He and the wife become attracted to each other right away, but realize they must be creative if they are to engage in any hanky-panky. The husband, however, is very glad to see the second man there. ""Now we will be able to have three people doing eight hour shifts in the watchtower, rather than two people doing 12-hour shifts."" </p>
<p>The newcomer is only too happy to help and in fact volunteers to do the first shift. He climbs up the tower to stand watch. Soon the couple on the ground are placing stones in a circle to make a fire to cook supper. The second man yells down, ""Hey, no screwing!"" They yell back, ""We're not screwing!"" </p>
<p>A few minutes later they start to put driftwood into the stone circle. Again the second man yells down, ""Hey, no screwing!"" Again they yell back, ""We're not screwing!"" Later they are putting palm leaves on the roof of their shack to patch leaks. Once again the second man yells down, ""Hey, I said no screwing!"" They yell back, ""We're not screwing!""</p>
<p>Eventually the shift is over and the second man climbs down from the tower to be replaced by the husband. He's not even halfway up before the wife and her new friend are hard at it. The husband looks out from the tower and says, ""Son-of-a-gun. From up here it DOES look like they're screwing.</p>

14232,"<p>Let's face it, English is a stupid language.<br /> There is no egg in the eggplant.<br /> No ham in the hamburger.<br /> And neither pine nor apple in the pineapple.<br /> English muffins were not invented in England.<br /> And French fries were not invented in France.</p>
<p>We sometimes take English for granted.<br /> But if we examine its paradoxes we find that<br /> Quicksand takes you down slowly,<br /> Boxing rings are square<br /> And a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.</p>

<p>English was invented by people, not computers.<br /> And it reflects the creativity of the human race.<br /> (Which of course isn't a race at all)</p>

''Well, how much does a brain cost?'' asked the relatives.    ''For a male brain, $500,000.  For a female brain, $200,000,'' replied the doctor.    Some of the younger male relatives tried to look shocked, but all the men nodded because they thought they understood.     But the patient's daughter was unsatisfied and asked, ''Why the difference in price between male brains and female brains?''    ''Standard pricing practice,'' said the doctor. ''Women's brains have to be marked down because they've actually been used.''</p>

14235,"<p>Any students out there? Here is some advice for writing your term papers :)<br /> 1. Sit in a straight, comfortable chair in a well lighted place with plenty of freshly sharpened pencils. </p>
<p>2. Read over the assignment carefully, to make certain you understand it. </p>
<p>3. Walk down to the vending machines and buy some coffee to help you concentrate. </p>
<p>4. Stop off at another floor on the way back and visit with your friend from class. If your friend hasn't started the paper yet either, you can both walk to McDonald's and buy a hamburger to help you concentrate. If your friend shows you his paper, typed, double-spaced, and bound in one of those irritating see-thru plastic folders, drop him. </p>
<p>5. When you get back to your room, sit in a straight, comfortable chair in a clean, well lighted place with plenty of freshly sharpened pencils. </p>
<p>6. Read over the assignment again to make absolutely certain you understand it. </p>
<p>7. Check your e-mail; reply to everyone who sent you letters. </p>
<p>8. You know, you haven't written to that kid you met at camp since fourth grade... You'd better write that letter now and get it out of the way so you can concentrate. </p>
<p>9. Go look at your teeth in the bathroom mirror. </p>
<p>10. Listen to one side of your favorite tape and that's it, I mean it, as soon as it's over you are going to start that paper. </p>
<p>11. Listen to the other side. </p>
<p>12. Check your e-mail again. </p>
<p>13. Rearrange all of your CDs into alphabetical order. </p>
<p>14. Phone your friend on the other floor and ask if he's started writing yet. Exchange derogatory remarks about your teacher, the course, the university, the world at large. </p>
<p>15. Sit in a straight, comfortable chair in a clean, well lighted place with plenty of freshly sharpened pencils. </p>
<p>16. Read over the assignment again; roll the words across your tongue; savor its special flavor. </p>
<p>17. Check your e-mail to make sure no-one sent you any urgent messages since the last time you checked. </p>
<p>18. Check the newspaper listings to make sure you aren't missing something truly worthwhile on TV. NOTE: When you have a paper due in less than 12 hours, anything on TV from Masterpiece Theater to Sgt. Preston of the Yukon is truly worthwhile, with these exceptions: Pro Bowler's Tour, any movie starring Don Ameche and Star Trek. </p>
<p>19. Catch the last hour of Soul Brother of Kung Fu on channel 26. </p>
<p>20. Phone your friend on the third floor to see if he was watching. Discuss the finer points of the plot. </p>
<p>21. Go look at your tongue in the bathroom mirror. </p>
<p>22. Look through your roommate's book of pictures from home. Ask who everyone is. </p>
<p>23. Sit down and do some serious thinking about your plans for the future. </p>
<p>24. Open your door and check to see if there are any mysterious, trench-coated strangers lurking in the hall. </p>
<p>25. Sit in a straight, comfortable chair in a clean, well lighted place with plenty of freshly sharpened pencils. </p>
<p>26. Read over the assignment one more time, just for the hell of it. </p>
<p>27. Check your e-mail. </p>
<p>28. Scoot your chair across the room to the window and watch the sunrise. </p>
<p>29. Lie face down on the floor and moan. </p>
<p>30. Leap up and write the paper. </p>
<p>31. Type the paper.</p>

He<br /> decided that he wasn't happy with his life and needed a change, so he went and<br /> got himself a sex change operation.<br /> A couple of weeks later he returned to his practice. His secretary wondered<br /> why it took him so long to return. 'Well, it hurt a lot more than I thought it<br /> would.'<br /> Then she asked him, 'What part hurt the most? Was it when they cut off your<br /> penis or when they pumped you full of air to make your breasts that big?'<br /> He said 'Well, that hurt, but not bad enough to keep me at home for so long.<br /> What hurt the most was when they drilled a hole in my head and pumped out half<br /> of my brains!'</p>

14267,"<p>Last summer, down on Lake Isabella, (located in the high desert an hour east of Bakersfield, California) some folks who were new to boating were having a problem. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't get their brand new 22-ft. Bayliner to perform. </p>
<p>It wouldn't get on a plane at all, and it was very sluggish in almost every maneuver, no matter how much power was applied. After about an hour of trying to make it go, they putted over to a nearby marina, thinking someone there could tell them what was wrong. </p>
<p>A thorough topside check revealed everything in perfect working order. The engine ran fine, the out drive went up and down, the prop was the correct size and pitch. So, one of the marina guys jumped in the water to check underneath. He came up choking on water, he was laughing so hard. Under the boat, still strapped securely in place, was the trailer.</p>

Since a Jewish wife<br /> is entitled to sexual pleasure, they decide to ask the rabbi.<br /> The rabbi listens to their story, strokes his beard, and makes<br /> the following suggestion.. ""Hire a strapping young man. While<br /> the two of you are making love, have the young man wave a towel<br /> over you. That will help the wife fantasize and should bring on<br /> an orgasm."" They go home and follow the rabbi's advice. They<br /> hire a handsome young man and he waves a towel over them as they<br /> make love. It doesn't help and she is still unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Perplexed, they go back to the rabbi. ""Okay"", says the rabbi to<br /> the husband, ""let's try it reversed. Have the young man make<br /> loveto your wife and you wave the towel over them.""

<p>The octopus crawls up on the bar and feels around the guitar for a little while, then finally he picks it up and starts jamming. He's so good he sounded like Jimi Hendricks!</p>
<p>The bartender was amazed and says,  ""alright lets try one more"".<br /> This time he goes into the back room and brings out a dusty old set of bagpipes and promptly put them on the bar and says ""lets see him play this!"" </p>
<p>The octopus starts crawling all over the bagpipes. He continues this for quite awhile.</p>
<p>The bartender shouted out "" See I knew he couldn't play all these instruments!""</p>
<p>And the man replies, ""Just give him a few more minutes...<br /> as soon as he figures out he can't have sex with it, he'll play it!""</p>

14301,"<p>A fellow went to work one day and was met at the door by his boss. ""You're<br /> fired, and there may be a summons for your arrest out of this!"" the boss<br /> exclaimed.</p>
<p>The fellow then started to drive home when the steering went out<br /> on his car and he ran into a carload of nuns. After the policeman let him<br /> go with the collection of tickets, he called his insurance company, only to<br /> find out that his wife forgot to send in the premium payment and that his<br /> insurance ran out last week.</p>
<p>On his way home, he stopped into the bank to get some money and found<br /> out that his wife had been there earlier with his best friend and<br /> emptied the accounts. After leaving the bank, he was on his way home and<br /> saw the fire engines heading down his street. Upon arriving<br /> at his house, he discovered that it was indeed his house on fire. The fire<br /> chief was sure that it was going to be a total loss. Again, calling the<br /> insurance company, he found that the homeowner's insurance also had been<br /> cancelled.</p>
<p>By now the fellow was somewhat depressed and went into the local<br /> bar. As he was telling his troubles to the bartender the bartender said,<br /> ""You've got the chance of a lifetime. All your obligations are gone and you<br /> can start all over. Why don't you take this bucket, go up to Huckleberry<br /> Hill,<br /> pick huckleberries, and go door to door selling them.""</p>
<p>Well, this sounded O.K. to the fellow, so off he went. After picking<br /> most of the day he finally had enough berries to sell. At the first house<br /> he<br /> stopped at the woman said that she would indeed take all his huckleberries<br /> but would he mind coming around to the back door. As the fellow got to the<br /> back door the woman opened it and was totally nude. (And not hard on the<br /> eyes.)</p>
<p>The fellow just broke down and was weeping hysterically. The woman was<br /> quite<br /> beside herself and asked what the problem was. The fellow answered ""I've<br /> lost<br /> my job, my car is ruined, my wife ran off with my best friend taking all my<br /> money, my house burned down, all my insurance has been cancelled, and now<br /> I'm going to be screwed out of my huckleberries.""</p>

14302,"<p>Joe was moderately successful in the career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help.<br /> After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem. ""The good news is I can cure your headaches, the bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."" </p>
<p>Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. After the operation, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, ""That's what I need, a new suit."" </p>
<p>He entered the shop and told the salesman, ""I'd like a new suit."" The salesman eyed him briefly and said, ""Let's see, size 44 long?"" Joe laughed, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit, it fitted perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, ""How about a new shirt?"" Joe thought for a moment and then said, ""Sure!"". The salesman eyed Joe then said, ""Let's see, 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck."". Joe was surprised, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fitted perfectly. The salesman asked, ""How about new shoes?"". Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, ""Let's see, nine-and-a-half?"" Joe was astonished, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" said the salesman again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fitted perfectly. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, ""How about some new underwear?"" Joe thought for a second and said, ""Sure, why not."" The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, ""Let's see, size 36."" Joe laughed smugly, ""No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" </p>
<p>The shocked salesman shook his head, ""You can't possibly wear a size 34! It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache!""</p>

14313,"<p>The setting is Ohio State University about six or seven years ago in a huge<br /> lecture hall (approximately 1000 students) for a Calculus final. Apparently this<br /> particular calculus teacher wasn't very well liked. He was one of those guys who<br /> would stand at the front of the class and yell out how much time was remaining<br /> before the end of a test, a real charmer. Since he was so busy galavanting<br /> around the room making sure that nobody cheated and that everyone was aware of<br /> how much time they had left before their failure on the test was complete, he<br /> had the students stack the completed tests on the huge podium at the front of<br /> the room. This made for quite a mess, remember there were 1000 students in the<br /> class. Five minutes turned into ten, ten into twenty, twenty into fourty...<br /> almost an hour after the test was ""officially over"", our friend finally put down<br /> his pencil, gathered up his work, and headed to the front of the hall to submit<br /> his final. The whole time, the professor sat at the front of the room, strangely<br /> waiting for the student to complete his exam.<br /> ""What do you think you're doing?"" the professor asked as the student stood in<br /> front of him about to put down his exam on one of the neatly stacked piles of<br /> exams (the professor had plenty of time to stack the mountain of papers while he<br /> waited). It was clear that the professor had waited only to give the student a<br /> hard time.</p>
<p>""Turning in my exam,"" retorted the student confidently.</p>
<p>""I'm afraid I have some bad news for you,"" the profesor gloated, ""Your exam is<br /> an hour late. You've FAILED it and, consequently, I'll see you next term when<br /> you repeat my course.""</p>
<p>The student smiled slyly and asked the professor ""Do you know who I am?""</p>
<p>""What?"" replied the professor grufly, annoyed that the student showed no sign<br /> of emotion.</p>
<p>The student rephrased the question mockingly, ""Do you know what my name is?""</p>
<p>""NO"", snarled the professor.</p>
<p>The student looked the professor dead in the eyes and said slowly, ""I didn't<br /> think so"", as he lifted up one of the stacks half way, shoved his test neatly<br /> into the center of the stack, let the stack fall burying his test in the middle,<br /> turned around, and walked casually out of the huge lecture hall.</p>

Morning comes and the groom goes into the bathroom but finds no towel when he emerges from the shower. He asks the bride to please bring one from the bedroom.When she gets to the bathroom door, he opened the door, exposing his body for the first time to his bride where she see him well. Her eyes went up and down and at about midway, they stopped and stared, and she asked shyly, ""What's THAT?"", pointing to a small part of his anatomy. He, also being shy, thought for a minute and then said, ""Well, that's what we had so much fun with last night."" And she, in amazement, asked, ""Is that all we have left?""</p>

14341,"<p>Police in George, WA issued a report on the events leading up to the deaths of Ro`ert Uhlenake (24) and his friend, Ormond D. Young (27) at the Metallica concert last Friday. Uhlenake and Young were found dead at the Gorge Amphitheater after the show. Uhlenake was in pickup that was on top of Young at the bottom of a 20 ft drop. Young was found with severe lacerations, numerous fractures, contusions, and a branch in his anal cavity. He also had been stabbed and his pants were in a tree above him, some 15 ft off the ground; adding to the mystery of the heretofore unexplained scene. </p>
<p>According to Commissioner-In-Charge Inoye Appleton, Uhlenake and Young had tried to get tickets for the sold-out concert. When they were unable to get any tickets, the two decided to stay in the lot and drink. Once the show began, and after the two had consumed 18 beers between the two of them, they hit upon the idea of scaling the 7 foot wooden security fence around the perimeter of the site and sneak in. They apparently moved the truck up to the edge of the fence and decided that Young would go over first and assist Uhlenake later. </p>
<p>They had not counted on the fact that while it was a 7 foot fence on the parking lot side, there was a 23 foot drop on the other side. Young, who weighed 255 lbs and was quite inebriated, had jumped up and over the fence and promptly fell about half the 23 foot distance before a large tree branch broke his fall AND his left forearm; unfortunately, he also managed to get his shorts caught on the branch. Since he was now in a lot of pain and with no way to extricate himself and his shorts from the tree, he decided, seeing bushes down below, to cut his shorts off and fall to the ground. Upon cutting the last bit of fabric from himself, he suddenly plummeted to earth, losing grip of the knife. </p>
<p>The ""soft"" bushes were actually holly bushes and landing in them caused a massive number of cuts. He also had the misfortune of landing squarely on a holly bush branch; effectively impaling himself. The knife, which he had accidentally released 15 ft up, now landed and stabbed him in his left thigh. Apparently, he was in a lot of pain. Enter his friend Robert. Uhlenake had apparently observed the last bit of this and, despite his inebriated state, realized that Young was in trouble. He hit upon the idea of lowering a rope to his friend and pull him up and over the fence. </p>
<p>This was complicated by the fact that Uhlenake was outweighed by his friend `y a good 100 lbs. Again, despite his state he realized he could use their truck to pull Young out. Unfortunately, because of his state, Uhlenake put the truck in reverse, rather than drive, broke through the fence, landed on Young (killing him), was thrown out of the truck and subsequently died of internal injuries. ""So that's how a dead 255 lb man with no pants on, with a truck on top of him and a stick up his ass came to be"" said Commissioner Appleton.</p>

<p>The bartender, not seeing how this bet could be cheated, says, ""ok, show me""</p>
<p>The guy then spits, and makes it in the glass, without getting any on the counter or the floor. </p>
<p>The bartender say, ""That's amazing! You deserve the $50!""</p>

<p>The bartender agrees, and the guy spits from across the bar and makes it in both glasses, without getting any anywhere else. Than the evening rolls around, and the bartender sticks glass all over the bar. He than says to the guy, ""if you can spit in all of these glass at the same time, without getting any anywhere else, I'll give you $200""</p>
<p>The guy says, ""Sure, but I need a little time to get ready"" </p>
<p>So after a minute, the guy comes up, and procceds to spit everywhere at lightning speed. the bartender, seeing that the guy has missed every single cup, jumps up and down for joy, screaming. The guys than pays the bartender, and says, ""I don't see what you're so happy about, I just bet the guy in the corner $500 that I could spit all over your bar, and you'd be happy about it.""</p>

14380,"<p>A wise old gentleman retired and purchased a modest home near a<br /> junior high school. He spent the first few weeks of his<br /> retirement in peace and contentment. Then a new school year<br /> began. The very next afternoon three young boys, full of<br /> youthful, after-school enthusiasm, came down his street, beating<br /> merrily on every trash can they encountered. The crashing<br /> percussion continued day after day, until finally the wise old<br /> man decided it was time to take some action.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, he walked out to meet the young<br /> percussionists as they banged their way down the street.<br /> Stopping them, he said, ""You kids are a lot of fun. I like to<br /> see you express your exuberance like that. In fact, I used to do<br /> the same thing when I was your age. Will you do me a favor? I'll<br /> give you each a dollar if you'll promise to come around every<br /> day and do your thing."" The kids were elated and continued to do<br /> a bang-up job on the trashcans. </p>
<p>After a few days, the old-timer greeted the kids again, but this<br /> time he had a sad smile on his face. ""This recession's really<br /> putting a big dent in my income,"" he told them. ""From now on,<br /> I'll only be able to pay you 50 cents to beat on the cans."" </p>
<p>The noisemakers were obviously displeased, but they accepted his<br /> offer and continued their afternoon ruckus. A few days later,<br /> the wily retiree approached them again as they drummed their way<br /> down the street. </p>
<p>""Look,"" he said, ""I haven't received my Social Security check<br /> yet, so I'm not going to be able to give you more than 25 cents.<br /> Will that be okay?"" </p>

When the lawyer arrived, the man asked for his physician to stand on one side of the bed, while the lawyer stood on the other. The man then laid back and closed his eyes. When he remained silent for several minutes, the physician asked what he had in mind. The man replied ""Jesus died with a thief on either side, and I thought I'd check out the same way.""</p>

"
14384,"<p>Good afternoon. I'm Al Gore, and I'd like to tell you about myself.<br /> I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black<br /> child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee. I was born in a log cabin<br /> that I built with my own hands. I taught myself to read by candlelight and<br /> helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a<br /> Mississippi River steamboat.<br /> My mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles<br /> to a one-room schoolhouse. I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought I<br /> never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration<br /> for ""Huckleberry Finn.""<br /> Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens. One day, a<br /> traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going<br /> to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I<br /> made an impression. You see, the minister's name was Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /> My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and<br /> said, ""Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a<br /> hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school.""<br /> But life of privilege was not for me. After getting my high school diploma, I<br /> took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill. I was so appalled at the treatment of<br /> the workers there that I organized a union. Later, that experience inspired a<br /> movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me<br /> ""Norma Rae.""<br /> When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called<br /> and offered me a scholarship. I captained the hockey team to four consecutive<br /> national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win<br /> the Heisman Trophy.<br /> During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing<br /> lead guitar for a little rock band. You may have heard of it-the Rolling<br /> Stones.<br /> But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country. So<br /> I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam. I was deeply opposed to the<br /> war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the Medal of Honor<br /> and the Croix de Guerre.<br /> When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours. I've<br /> crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man, I've<br /> traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere. And the people I met at<br /> truck stops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the<br /> same thing: ""Al, we need you in Washington.""<br /> I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other<br /> business---building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon Society, doing<br /> the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the<br /> recipe for Mrs. Field's chocolate chip cookies.<br /> Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and allowed them<br /> to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate, where I established<br /> the US Strategic Oil Reserve. And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for<br /> no particular reason, I answered the call of the people once again and took the<br /> oath of office as Vice President of the United States.<br /> Since then, I've been part of the most successful administration in American<br /> history. And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet. Many times Bill Clinton<br /> has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do. And when I<br /> would give him my thoughts, he would invariable say, ""Of course. That's<br /> brilliant. Why didn't I think of that?""<br /> During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he<br /> only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away form that dark-haired<br /> intern. So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked<br /> if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign. And Bill Clinton<br /> gave me a few simple words of advice-words I'll never forget.<br /> He looked me in the eye and he said, ""Al, just tell the truth, it's always<br /> worked for me.""</p>

14387,"<p>A husband and wife are traveling by car from Key West to Boston.<br /> After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they're too tired to<br /> continue, and they decide to stop for a rest. They stop at a<br /> nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four<br /> hours and then get back on the road. When they check out four<br /> hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350.</p>
<p>The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so<br /> high. He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the rooms<br /> certainly aren't worth $350. When the clerk tells him $350 is<br /> the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the manager.</p>
<p>The manager appears, listens to the man, and then explains that<br /> the hotel has an Olympic sized pool and a huge conference<br /> center that were available for the husband and wife to use.</p>
<p>""But we didn't use them."" the man complains. ""Well, they are<br /> here, and you could have."" explains the manager.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of the shows<br /> for which the hotel is famous. ""The best entertainers from New<br /> York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here."" the manager says.<br /> ""But we didn't go to any of those shows."" complains the man<br /> again.</p>
<p>""Well, we have them, and you could have."" the manager replies.<br /> No matter what facility the manager mentions, the man replies,<br /> ""But we didn't use it!""</p>
<p>The manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives up and<br /> agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the manager.<br /> The mnager is surprised when he looks at the check. ""But sir,""<br /> he says, ""this check is only made out for $100."" </p>
<p>""That's right,"" says the man. ""I charged you $250 for sleeping<br /> with my wife."" </p>
<p>""But I didn't!"" exclaims the mnager.</p>
<p>""Well,"" the man replies, ""she was here, and you could have.""</p>

14388,"<p>A man traveling down a country road was forced to stop before a giant puddle<br /> covering the entire road. Looking to the side of the road, the man noticed a<br /> farmer leaning on a fence. ""Think it's safe to cross?"" the man asked. </p>
<p>""I reckon so,"" replied the farmer. </p>
<p>The puddle immediately swallowed the car as the man drove in. In fact, it was<br /> so deep that he had to roll his window down to swim out of his car back to the<br /> surface. As his head broke the surface, the man said to the farmer, ""I thought<br /> you said I could safely drive through this puddle!"" </p>
<p>""Well, shoot!"" said the farmer, scratching his head. ""It only come up<br /> chest-high on my ducks!""</p>
<p>One morning a boy got up and was leaving the house with a hand full of chicken<br /> wire. His father said, 'Son, where are you going?' The son replied, 'I'm going<br /> to catch me some chickens.' The father said, 'Son, you can't catch chickens with<br /> chicken wire.' But the son insisted that he knew what he was doing. </p>
<p>Later on that day, the son came home with two chickens in his hand. The father<br /> thought, 'I guess he knows what he's doing.' The next morning, the son got up<br /> and was leaving the house with some duck tape. The father said, 'Son, where are<br /> you going?' The son replied, 'I'm going to catch some ducks.' The father yelled,<br /> 'You can't catch ducks with duck tape!' The son insisted that he knew what he<br /> was doing. </p>
<p>Awhile later, the son came home with two ducks under each arm. The father<br /> thought, 'Shoot, I guess he does know what he's doing!' The next morning the son<br /> got up and was leaving the house with a hand full of puss willows. The father<br /> said, 'Hold up, son, let me put on my shoes!'</p>

<p>Well, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what the man had claimed, but her husband felt he really didn't need them, being the sex god he was. </p>

14402,"<p>Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton. So you want to buy the old Rye Brook place, that's<br /> 2.2 million, and with the customary 20 percent down, that's $440,000, leaving a<br /> mortgage of $1,760,000. Now let's have a look at your financial statements.<br /> Let's see, Mr. Clinton, you are the president of the United States, of course,<br /> and your salary is $200,000 a year. We recommend buying a house that costs no<br /> more than two and a half times your annual salary. That means you should be<br /> looking for something around $500,000, perhaps a nice brick rancher?<br /> And I see here that you'll be out of a job in 16 months or so. What will you<br /> do then? Open a library? In Little Rock? Arkansas? Wow. I bet that will be some<br /> kind of moneymaker.<br /> Mrs. Clinton, you're running for Senate, right? Senators are paid $130,000<br /> year-assuming, of course, she's elected, so even with your pension you're still<br /> looking at a house in the $825,000 range. Maybe a nice center hall colonial.<br /> Mrs. Clinton, you haven't worked outside the house since 1991? But you did<br /> some volunteer work, I see. You tried to overhaul the entire national health<br /> care system? I see. But no one was interested? But you have other experience? I<br /> see you had several business ventures back in Arkansas. How about this<br /> Whitewater Development<br /> Corp.? It went bankrupt. And Madison Guaranty? Bankrupt. And Castle Grande?<br /> Bankrupt, too. You actually did go to Yale you claim? A little bad luck with the<br /> law, too, I see. Three of your business partners went to jail.<br /> This is embarrassing, I know, but we have to ask because it does, after all,<br /> affect your ability to pay. Any problems in your marriage? No? Fine.<br /> Let's look at your assets: you owe $4.5 million Mr. Clinton? How do you expect<br /> to pay that off? You're hoping people will donate to a special fund? So<br /> basically you're relying on the kindness of strangers.<br /> You also have some serious expenses. A kid at Stanford has got to be setting<br /> you back $30,000 to $35,000 a year, probably more with the air fares. And she<br /> wants to go to medical school?<br /> Any legal problems? I see a $90,000 fine for perjury. I guess that rules out<br /> putting your law degree to work. Say, how do we know you're not lying on you<br /> loan application? Of course it would look a lot better if you WERE lying.<br /> Are there any other legal matters we should know about? Mrs. Clinton? You<br /> don't think she's going to get hit with a perjury or obstruction of justice rap.<br /> But we're not totally sure, right? That means there's a remote possibility-note<br /> that I say ""remote"" that you could be trying to pay off a $1.76 million mortgage<br /> while making 12 cents an hour stitching mailbags for the feds, and while Mr.<br /> Clinton is trying to make a go of a library in Little Rock.<br /> Let's review the situation. One of you is now unemployed and the other one<br /> soon will be. Your business partners are in jail. You have debts equivalent to<br /> over 22 times your annual income that you're hoping someone is going to come<br /> along and pay. And a looming criminal indictment. Your tangible assets seem to<br /> consist of an old Ford.<br /> We�ll give you a call.</p>

14418,"<p>1. Weigh yourself with clothes on, after dinner... as well as in the morning, without clothes, before breakfast, because it's nice to see how much weight you've lost overnight.2. Never weigh yourself with wet hair.3. When weighing, remove everything, including glasses. In this case, blurred vision is an asset. Don't forget the earrings, these things can weigh at least a pound.4. Use cheap scales only, never the medical kind, because they are always five pounds off...to your advantage.5. Always go to the bathroom first.6. Stand with arms raised, making pressure on the scale lighter.7. Don't eat or drink in the morning until AFTER you've weighed in, completely naked, of course.8. Weigh yourself after a haircut, this is good for at least half a pound of hair (hopefully).9. Exhale with all your might BEFORE stepping onto the scale (air has to weigh something, right?).10. Start out with just one foot on the scale, then holding onto the towel rack in front of you, slowly edge your other foot on and slowly let off of the rack. Admittedly, this takes time, but it's worth it. You will weigh at least two pounds less than if you'd stepped on normally.</p>

In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating (by Mr. Welch himself): If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day.2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new car.3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just accept this, restart and drive on.4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought ""Car95"" or ""CarNT."" But then you would have to buy more seats.6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five per cent of the roads.7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single ""general car default"" warning light.8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt.9. The airbag system would say ""Are you sure?"" before going off.10. Occasionally, and for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grab hold of the radio antenna.11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50% or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department.12. Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.13. You'd press the ""start"" button to shut off the engine</p>

14468,"<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>Microsoft Addresses Justice Department Accusations</p>
<p>REDMOND, Wash. - Jul. 1, 1998 -- In direct response to accusations made by<br /> the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today that it<br /> will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of America<br /> for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>""It's actually a logical extension of our planned growth"", said Microsoft<br /> chairman Bill Gates, ""It really is going to be a positive arrangement for<br /> everyone"".</p>
<p>Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of the White<br /> House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and assured members of the press<br /> that changes will be ""minimal"". The United States will be managed as a<br /> wholly owned division of Microsoft. An initial public offering is planned<br /> for July of next year, and the federal government is expected to be<br /> profitable by ""Q4 1999 at latest"", according to Microsoft president Steve<br /> Ballmer.</p>
<p>In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had ""willingly and<br /> enthusiastically"" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft,<br /> and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting<br /> directly to Bill Gates. When asked how it felt to give up the mantle of<br /> executive authority to Gates, Clinton smiled and referred to it as ""a<br /> relief"". He went on to say that Gates has a ""proven track record"", and<br /> that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their ""full support and confidence"".</p>
<p>Clinton will reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he<br /> has earned as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as<br /> ""silly"", though did say that he would make executive decisions for the<br /> U.S. government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters. Gates<br /> went on to say that the House and Senate would ""of course"" be abolished.<br /> ""Microsoft isn't a democracy"", he observed,""and look how well we're doing"".</p>
<p>When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was proceeding,<br /> Gates said, ""We don't deny that discussions are taking place"".</p>
<p>Microsoft representatives closed the conference by stating that United<br /> States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in<br /> government services and discounts on all Microsoft products.</p>
<p>About Microsoft</p>

14478,"<p>There were three men. Joe, Rich, and Scott. </p>
<p>They were all camping in the woods, and they knew they had to stop for<br /> the<br /> night.  Joe suggested they stop where they were right there, a nice<br /> clear,<br /> wooded area. Rich agreed, but Scott disagreed, because there was nothing<br /> interesting around, only trees. </p>
<p>They kept hiking for a little longer, and came across a small clear area,<br /> right next to the highway. Both Joe and Rich wanted to saty there because<br /> there was no stumps, or moss around, and the sounds of the cars could<br /> help<br /> to put them asleep. Scott said no, because he found a small ant farm 500<br /> meters away, and was scared the ants might come, and get them. </p>
<p>SO they kept hiking, and finally, they came to the end of the woods, and<br /> stepped onto the highway. Scott was mystified, and wanted to sleep right<br /> smack dab in the middle of the highway. It was interesting, and he wanted<br /> to look at all the different liscence plates, as they drove by. Joe and<br /> Rich were so upset, because, obviously, that was the LAST place that they<br /> wanted to sleep in! But, they were too tired to argue, so they set up<br /> their tent in the middle of the highway and went to sleep. </p>
<p>They slept soundly through the night, but were awaked a couple of times<br /> by<br /> the sound of cars beeping, and crashing. The next morning, they awoke<br /> early, and noticed a huge pileup of cars right off the highway, in the<br /> spot they had earlier chosen. Feeling proud, Scott said:</p>
<p>""See, guys? Imagine what would of happened if we slept there last night!""</p>

<p>""That's really good. I'm really glad you take this seriously.<br /> Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost?""--15 students raise<br /> their hands.</p>
<p>""That's a great response. Has anyone here ever touched a<br /> ghost?""--3 students raise their hands.</p>
<p>""That's fantastic. But let me ask you one question<br /> further...Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?</p>
<p>One student in the back raises his hand. The professor is<br /> astonished. He takes off glasses, takes a step back, and says,<br /> ""Son, all the years I've been giving this lecture, no one has<br /> ever claimed to have slept with a ghost. You've got to come up<br /> here and tell us about your experience.</p>
<p>The redneck student replies with a nod and begins to make his<br /> way up to the podium. The professor says, ""Well, tell us what<br /> it's like to have sex with a ghost.</p>

14507,"<p>One thing that has always bugged me, and I'm sure it does most of you, is to sit down at the dinner table only to be interrupted by a phone call from a telemarketer. I decided, on one such occasion, to try to be as irritating as they were to me. The call was from AT&amp;T and it went something like this: </p>
<p>(swallowing) Me: Hello </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Hello, this is AT&amp;T... </p>
<p>Me: Is this AT&amp;T? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, this is AT&amp;T... </p>
<p>Me: This is AT&amp;T? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes This is AT&amp;T... </p>
<p>Me: Is this AT&amp;T? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: YES! This is AT&amp;T, may I speak to Mr. Byron please? </p>
<p>Me: May I ask who is calling? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: This is AT&amp;T. </p>
<p>Me: OK, hold on. </p>
<p>At this point I put the phone down for a solid 5 minutes thinking that, surely, this person would have hung up the phone. I ate my salad. Much to my surprise, when I picked up the receiver, they were still waiting. </p>
<p>Me: Hello? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Is this Mr. Byron? </p>
<p>Me: May I ask who is calling please? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes this is AT&amp;T... </p>
<p>Me: Is this AT&amp;T? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes this is AT&amp;T... </p>
<p>Me: This is AT&amp;T? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes, is this Mr. Byron? </p>
<p>Me: Yes, is this AT&amp;T? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes sir. </p>
<p>Me: The phone company? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes sir. </p>
<p>Me: I thought you said this was AT&amp;T. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes sir, we are a phone company. </p>
<p>Me: I already have a phone. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: We aren't selling phones today Mr. Byron. </p>
<p>Me: Well whatever it is, I'm really not interested but thanks for calling. When you are not interested in something, I don't think you can express yourself any plainer than by saying ""I'm really not interested"", but this lady was persistent. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Mr. Byron we would like to offer you 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. </p>
<p>Now, I am sure she meant she was offering a ""rate"" of 10 cents a minute but she at no time used the word rate. I could clearly see that it was time to whip out the trusty old calculator and do a little ciphering. </p>
<p>Me: Now, that's 10 cents a minute 24 hours a day? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: (getting a little excited at this point by my interest) Yes sir that's right! 24 hours a day! </p>
<p>Me: 7 days a week? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: That's right. </p>
<p>Me: 365 days a year? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes sir. </p>
<p>Me: I am definitely interested in that! Wow!!! That's amazing! </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: We think so! </p>
<p>Me: That's quite a sum of money! </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes sir, it's amazing how it adds up. </p>
<p>Me: OK, so will you send me checks weekly, monthly or just one big one at the end of the year for the full $52,560, and if you send an annual check, can I get a cash advance? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Excuse me? </p>
<p>Me: You know, the 10 cents a minute. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: What are you talking about? </p>
<p>Me: You said you'd give me 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. That comes to $144 per day, $1,008 per week and $52,560 per year. I'm just interested in knowing how you will be making payment. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Oh no sir I didn't mean we'd be paying you. You pay us 10 cents a minute. </p>
<p>Me: Wait a minute here!!! Didn't you say you'd give me 10 cents a minute. Are you sure this is AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Well, yes this is AT&amp;T sir but...... </p>
<p>Me: But nothing, how do you figure that by saying that you'll give me 10 cents a minute that I'll give you 10 cents a minute? Is this some kind of subliminal telemarketing scheme? I've read about things like this in the Enquirer you know. Don't use your alien brainwashing techniques on me. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: No sir we are offering 10 cents a minute for..... </p>
<p>Me: THERE YOU GO AGAIN! Can I speak to a supervisor please! </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Sir I don't think that is necessary. </p>
<p>Me: Sure! You say that now! What happens later? </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: What? </p>
<p>Me: I insist on speaking to a supervisor! </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Yes Mr. Byron. Please hold. </p>
<p>So now AT&amp;T has me on hold and my supper is getting cold. I begin to eat while I'm waiting for a supervisor. After a wait of a few minutes and while I have a mouth full of food: </p>
<p>Supervisor: Mr. Byron? </p>
<p>Me: Yeth? </p>
<p>Supervisor: I understand you are not quite understanding our 10 cents a minute program. </p>
<p>Me: Id thish Ath Teeth &amp; Teeth? </p>
<p>Supervisor: Yes sir, it sure is. </p>
<p>I had to swallow before I choked on my food. It was all I could do to suppress my laughter and I had to be careful not to produce a snort. </p>
<p>Me: No, actually I was just waiting for someone to get back to me so that I could sign up for the plan.</p>
<p>Supervisor: OK, no problem, I'll transfer you back to the person who was helping you. </p>
<p>Me: Thank you. </p>
<p>I was on hold once again and managed a few more mouthfuls. I needed to end this conversation. Suddenly, there was an aggravated but polite voice at the other end of the phone. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T: Hello Mr. Byron, I understand that you are interested in signing up for our plan? </p>
<p>Me: Do you have that friends and family thing because you can never have enough friends and I'm an only child and I'd really like to have a little brother... </p>

<p>1.your surrounded by 15-25 girls everyday.</p>
<p>2.if your flyer (which is usually a girl) falls theres no<br /> telling were your hands catch her.</p>
<p>3. many stunts (if u are a back spotter)require placing ur hands<br /> on the flyers ass to push her up into the air.</p>
<p>4. a chair reqires u to put your hands between the girls legs.</p>
<p>5. there is no laying on other boyz (like in wrestling).</p>
<p>6. girls cant get mad at u for catching them in a bad spot if<br /> they fall out of a stunt.</p>
<p>the #1 reason boys in cheerleading  r not gay is:<br /> 7. at cheerleading camp you have to leep there n your sleeping<br /> in the same bunk as 15-25 girls.  there mite not be enough beds<br /> u mite have to share w/ sumone.</p>

"
14585,"<p>Let's look at a few rather important topics to prove this:</p>
<p>NICKNAMES<br /> If Laura, Suzanne, Debra and Rose go out for lunch, they will<br /> call  each other Laura, Suzanne, Debra and Rose. If Mike,<br /> Charlie, Bob and John go out, they will affectionately refer to<br /> each other as Fat Boy, Godzilla, Peanut-Pecker and Schmucko.</p>
<p>EATING OUT<br /> When the bill arrives, Mike, Charlie, Bob and John will each<br /> throw in $20, even though it's only for $32.50. None of them<br /> will have anything smaller, and none will actually admit they<br /> want some change back. The girls get their bill, out come the<br /> pocket calculators.</p>
<p>MONEY<br /> A man will pay $2 for a $1 item he wants. A woman will pay $1<br /> for a $2 item that she doesn't want.</p>
<p>BATHROOMS<br /> A man has six items in his bathroom: toothpaste,<br /> toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, a bar of soap, and a towel from<br /> the Holiday Inn.; The average number of items in the<br /> typical woman's bathroom is 337.No man will be able to<br /> identify most of these items.</p>
<p>ARGUMENTS<br /> A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says<br /> after that is the beginning of a new argument.</p>
<p>CATS<br /> Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't<br /> looking, men kick cats.</p>
<p>THE FUTURE<br /> A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband. A man<br /> never worries about the future until he gets a wife.</p>
<p>MARRIAGE<br /> A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A<br /> man marries a woman expecting she won't change and she does.</p>
<p>DRESSING UP<br /> A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty<br /> the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, and get the mail. A<br /> man will dress up for weddings and funerals.</p>
<p>NATURAL<br /> Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed. Women somehow<br /> deteriorate during the night.</p>
<p>OFFSPRING<br /> Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows<br /> about dentist appointments and romances, best friends, favorite<br /> foods, secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware<br /> of short people living in the house.</p>
<p>THOUGHT FOR THE DAY<br /> Every married man should forget his mistakes. There's no use in<br /> two people remembering the same thing, is there?</p>
<p>LISTENING<br /> What a woman says: ""C'mon...This place is a mess. You and I need<br /> to clean. Your pants are on the floor and you'll have no clothes<br /> if we don't do laundry now.""<br /> What a man hears: C'MON ... blah, blah, blah YOU AND I blah,<br /> blah, blah blah, blah ON THE FLOOR blah, blah, blah, NO CLOTHES<br /> blah, blah, blah, blah, NOW.</p>

"
14588,"<p>Deep Thoughts about Marriage </p>
<p>There was a man who said, ""I never knew what real happiness was<br /> until I got married and then it was too late. </p>
<p>At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, ""Aren't you<br /> wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger?"" The other<br /> replied, ""Yes I am, I married the wrong man."" </p>
<p>Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is really<br /> finished. </p>
<p>Marriage is an institution in which a man loses his bachelor's<br /> degree and the woman gets her master's. </p>
<p>A little boy asked his father, ""Daddy, how much does it cost to<br /> get married?"" And the father replied, ""I don't know, son, I'm<br /> still paying for it."" </p>
<p>Young Son: Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa<br /> a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her? </p>
<p>Dad: That happens in most countries, son. </p>
<p>A happy marriage is a matter of give and take; the husband gives<br /> and the wife takes. </p>
<p>Three rings: Engagement ring, Wedding ring, Suffering. </p>
<p>When a newly married man looks happy we know why. But when a<br /> ten-year married man looks happy - we wonder why. </p>
<p>Married life is very frustrating. In the first year of marriage,<br /> the man speaks and the woman listens. In the second year, the<br /> woman speaks and the man listens. In the third year, they both<br /> speak and the neighbours listen. </p>
<p>After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband, ""You know, I was a<br /> fool when I married you."" And the husband replied, ""Yes, dear,<br /> but I was in love and didn't notice it."" </p>
<p>It doesn't matter how often a married man changes his job, he<br /> still ends up with the same boss. </p>
<p>A man inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds: ""Wife wanted"". Next<br /> day he received a hundred letters. They all said the same thing:<br /> ""You can have mine."" </p>
<p>When a man opens the door of his car for his wife, you can be<br /> sure of one thing: either the car is new or the wife is. </p>
<p>A perfect wife is one who helps the husband with the dishes. </p>
<p>A woman was telling her friend , ""It is I who made my husband a<br /> millionaire."" ""And what was he before you married him."" Asked<br /> the friend. The woman replied, "" A multi-millionaire"". </p>
<p>Getting married is very much like going to a continental<br /> restaurant with friends. You order what you want, then when you<br /> see what the other fellow has, you wish you had ordered that. </p>
<p>Marriage is not a word. It is a sentence- a life sentence!!! </p>
<p>Marriage is very much like a violin; after the sweet music is<br /> over, the strings are attached. </p>
<p>Marriage is love. Love is blind. Therefore, marriage is an<br /> institution for the blind. </p>
<p>Marriage is a thing which puts a ring on a woman's finger and<br /> TWO under the man's eyes. </p>
<p>Marriage certificate is just another name for a work permit. </p>
<p>It is true that love is blind but marriage is definitely an<br /> eye-opener. </p>
<p>There was this man who muttered a few words in the church and<br /> found himself married. A year later he muttered something in his<br /> sleep and found himself divorced. </p>
<p>Love is one long sweet dream, and marriage is the alarm clock. </p>
<p>They say that when a man holds a woman's hand before marriage,<br /> it is love; after marriage it is self-defense. </p>
<p>A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can<br /> spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man. </p>
<p>Before marriage, a man 'yearns' for the woman he loves. After<br /> marriage, the ""y"" becomes silent. </p>
<p>My girlfriend told me I should be more affectionate. So I got<br /> two girlfriends. </p>
<p>A man meets a genie. The genie tells him he can have whatever he<br /> wants provided that his mother-in-law gets double. The man<br /> thinks for a moment and then says, ""OK, give me a million<br /> dollars and beat me half to death."" </p>
<p>A man said his credit card was stolen but he decided not to<br /> report it because the thief was spending less than his wife did. </p>
<p>Her husband has been slipping in and out of a coma for several<br /> months yet she stayed by his bedside every single day. When he<br /> came to, he motioned for her to come nearer. As she sat by him,<br /> he said, ""You know what? You have been with me all through the<br /> bad times. When I got fired, you were there to support me. When<br /> my business fell, you were there. When I got shot, you were by<br /> my side. When we lost the house, you gave me support. When my<br /> health started failing, you were still by my side. When I think<br /> about it now, I think you bring me bad luck!"" </p>
<p>First Guy (proudly): ""My wife's an angel!"" Second Guy: ""You're<br /> lucky, mine's still alive."" </p>
<p>Marriage is grand -- and divorce is about 10 grand. </p>
<p>This guy goes to a party without his wife. He hears this other<br /> guy say to his wife ""Pass the sugar, Honey."" and ""Pass the<br /> honey, Sugar."" He thinks this sort of speech is a good idea. So,<br /> the morning when he and his wife are eating breakfast, he says<br /> to his wife, ""Pass the bacon, Pig."" </p>
<p>A couple came upon a wishing well. The husband leaned over, made<br /> a wish and threw in a penny. The wife decided to make a wish,<br /> too. But she leaned over too much, fell into the well, and<br /> drowned. The husband was stunned for a while but then smiled ""It<br /> really works</p>

The head of the tribe says to the German, ""What do you want on your back for your whipping?"" The German responds, ""I will take oil!""So they put oil on his back, and a large Amazon whips him 10 times. When he is finished the German has these huge welts on his back, and he can hardly move. The Amazons haul the German away, and say to the Mexican, ""What do you want on your back?"" ""I will take nothing!"" says the Mexican, and he stands there straight and takes his 10 lashings without a single flinch. ""What will you take on your back?"" the Amazons ask the American. He responds, ""I'll take the Mexican.""</p>

14617,"<p>It was the final examination for an introductory Biology course at the local university. Like many such freshman courses, it was designed to weed out new students, having over 500 students in the class! The examination was two hours long, and exam booklets were provided. The professor was very strict and told the class that any exam that was not on his desk in exactly two hours would not be accepted and the student would fail. Half of an hour into the exam, a student came rushing in and asked the professor for an exam booklet. ""You're not going to have time to finish this,"" the professor stated sarcastically as he handed the student a booklet. ""Yes I will,"" replied the student. He then took a seat and began writing. After two hours, the professor called for the exams, and the students filed up and handed them in. All except the late student, who continued writing. An hour later, the last student came up to the professor who was sitting at his desk preparing for his next class. He attempted to put his exam on the stack of exam booklets already there.""No you don't, I'm not going to accept that. It's late."" The student looked incredulous and angry. ""Do you know who I am?"" ""No, as a matter of fact I don't,"" replied the professor with an air of sarcasm in his voice. ""Do you know who I am?"" the student asked again in a louder voice. ""No, and I don't care."" replied the professor with an air of superiority. ""Good,"" replied the student, who quickly lifted the stack of completed exams, stuffed his in the middle, and walked out of the room.</p>

During the meal, the new appointee, Justice Johnson, couldn't<br /> help noticing how attractive and shapely the Chief Justice's housekeeper was.<br /> Over the course of the evening he started to wonder if there was more between<br /> the Chief Justice and the housekeeper than met the eye. Reading the new<br /> appointee's thoughts, the Chief Justice volunteered, ""I know what you must be<br /> thinking, but I assure you, my relationship with my housekeeper is purely a<br /> professional one.""<br />     About a week later the housekeeper came to the Chief Justice and said,<br /> ""Your Honor, ever since your new appointee came to dinner, I've been unable to<br /> find that beautiful silver gravy ladle.

<p>This theorem can now be supported by a mathematical equation based on the<br /> following two postulates:</p>
<p>As every engineer knows: Power = Work / Time</p>
<p>Since:</p>
<p>Knowledge = Power<br /> Time = Money<br /> Knowledge = Work/Money.</p>
<p>Solving for Money, we get:</p>
<p>Money = Work / Knowledge.</p>
<p>Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity, regardless of<br /> the amount of work done.</p>

<p>So, the husband went to his doctor (who also treated mules) and told him that he and his wife didn't want to have any more children.</p>
<p>The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. The doctor instructed him to go home, get a cherry bomb, light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.</p>
<p>The Alabamian said to the doctor, ""I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me"".</p>
<p>So, the couple drove to Georgia to get a second opinion. The Georgia physician was about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed that they were from Alabama.</p>
<p>The doctor instead told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it, place it in a beer can, hold it to his ear and count to 10.</p>

""But I don't need twenty years"", he protested, ""ten is plenty for me."" Man spoke up eagerly, ""Can I have the other ten?"" The monkey graciously agreed.Then the Lord called the lion and gave him twenty years, and the lion, like the monkey wanted only ten. Again the man spoke up, ""Can I have the other ten?"" The lion said of course he could.Then came the donkey and he was given twenty years-but like the others,ten was sufficient-and again man pleaded, ""Can I have the other ten?"" The donkey said yes he could.This explains why man has twenty years of normal sex life, plus ten years of monkeying around, ten years of lion about it, and ten years of making an ass of himself.</p>

14658,"<p>(Remember, this is on the INTERNET -- proceed with caution.)Leola Starling of Ribrock, Tenn., had a serious telephone problem. But unlike most people she did something about it.The brand-new $10 million Ribrock Plaza Motel opened nearby and had acquired almost the same telephone number as Leola.From the moment the motel opened, Leola was besieged by calls not for her. Since she had the same phone number for years, she felt that she had a case to persuade the motel management to change its number. Naturally, the management refused claiming that it could not change its stationery.  The phone company was not helpful, either. A number was a number, and just because a customer was getting someone else's calls 24 hours a day didn't make it responsible. After her pleas fell on deaf ears, Leola decided to take matters into her own hands.At 9 o'clock the phone rang.  Someone from Memphis was calling the motel and asked for a room for the following Tuesday. Leola said, 'No problem.  How many nights?'A few hours later Dallas checked in. A secretary wanted a suite with two bedrooms for a week. Emboldened, Leola said the Presidential Suite on the 10th floor was available for $600 a night. The secretary said that she would take it and asked if the hotel wanted a deposit. 'No, that won't be necessary,' Leola said. 'We trust you.'The next day was a busy one for Leola. In the morning, she booked an electric appliance manufacturers' convention for Memorial Day weekend, a college prom and a reunion of the 82nd Airborne veterans from World War II.She turned on her answering machine during lunchtime so that she could watch the O.J. Simpson trial, but her biggest challenge came in the afternoon when a mother called to book the ballroom for her daughter's wedding in June.Leola assured the woman that it would be no problem and asked if she would be providing the flowers or did she want the hotel to take care of it. The mother said that she would prefer the hotel to handle the floral arrangements. Then the question of valet parking came up.Once again Leola was helpful. 'There's no charge for valet parking, but we always recommend that the client tips the drivers.'Within a few months, the Ribrock Plaza Motel was a disaster area.People kept showing up for weddings, bar mitzvahs, and Sweet Sixteen parties and were all told there were no such events.Leola had her final revenge when she read in the local paper that the motel might go bankrupt. Her phone rang, and an executive from Marriott said, 'We're prepared to offer you $200,000 for the motel.'Leola replied. 'We'll take it, but only if you change the telephone number.'</p>

<p>April 18, 1994<br /> Mr. John T. Mongan<br /> 123 Main Street<br /> Smalltown, California 94123-4567<br /> Dear John:<br /> You've got the grades. You've certainly got the PSAT scores. And now you've<br /> got a letter from MIT. Maybe you're surprised. Most students would be. But<br /> you're not most students. And that's exactly why I urge you to consider<br /> carefully one of the most selective universities in America.<br /> The level of potential reflected in your performance is a powerful indicator<br /> that you might well be an excellent candidate for MIT. It certainly got my<br /> attention!<br /> Engineering's not for you? No problem. It may surprise you to learn<br /> we offer more than 40 major fields of study, from architecture to brain and<br /> cognitive sciences, from economics (perhaps the best program in the country) to<br /> writing.<br /> What? Of course, you don't want to be bored. Who does? Life here is<br /> tough and demanding, but it's also fun. MIT students are imaginative and<br /> creative - inside and outside the classroom.<br /> You're interested in athletics? Great! MIT has more varsity teams - 39 - than<br /> almost any other university, and a tremendous intramural program so everybody<br /> can participate.<br /> You think we're too expensive? Don't be too sure. We've got surprises for you<br /> there, too.<br /> Why not send the enclosed Information Request to find out more about this<br /> unique institution? Why not do it right now?<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Michael C. Benhke<br /> Director of Admissions<br /> P.S. If you'd like a copy of a fun-filled, fact-filled brochure, ""Insight,""<br /> just check the appropriate box on the form.</p>

14683,"<p>This list is a general disclaimer for any wives or girlfriends who happen upon a copy of this:1) The floor is considered an acceptable clothing storage location.2) Never ask me to purchase feminine products. Assume that I will come home with the wrong thing.3) When watching TV hugging is always fine because I can still see the screen. Kissing should only be done during timeouts and commercials. Questions should also be limited to this period as you stand a much better chance of getting an immediate response.4) When we are watching your show and I change the channels during a commercial do not hassle me that they are over to change the channel back. I always know when the timing is right. Also, when we are channel surfing do not ask me to go back, there was a good reason why I skipped it.5) If you need help with the laundry, I am more than willing to carry it from the bedroom to the washer. In my mind this is half the chore and I am now free to return to the couch.6) If I mention that a male friend of mine is allowed to do something it is not necessary for you to call his wife/girlfriend to discuss it.5) If you don't like the way I am driving close your eyes. And I would appreciate it if you would refrain from making that reverse inhaling alarmed noise. I haven't hit anything yet and if I do it will be your fault.6) I go clothes shopping to buy, never to look.7) Just tell me what you want me to wear before I get dressed. And remember that this takes me less than ten minutes no matter what the occasion is. After all I am getting dressed, not getting ready.8) Don't ask me if I prefer one outfit over another or if a certain accessory should be worn or not. I consider this a no win situation and would rather just wait for you to get dressed while watching TV.9) If you want me to put the seat down when I am finished then you should leave the seat up when you are finished.It's only fair. And stop giving me a hard time about missing the bowl. What do you expect from an organ that has a brain of its own.10) I will cook anything as long as it is on the BBQ.11) Yelling to me across the house sounds exactly like stadium crowd background noise to me. I am not ignoring you.</p>

14689,"<p>I was riding to work yesterday when I observed a female driver cut right in front of a pickup truck, causing him to have to drive on the shoulder. This evidently pissed the driver off enough that he hung out his window and flipped the woman off. ""Man, that guy is stupid"" I thought to myself. I ALWAYS smile nicely and wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything to me in traffic and here's why.<br /> I drive 38 miles each way, every day, to work. That's 76 miles, of these, 16 each way is bumper-to-bumper. Most of the bumper-to-bumper is on an 8 lane highway. So, if you just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass something like a new car every 40 feet per lane. That's 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars. Even though the rest of the 34 miles is not bumper-to-bumper. I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass every day. Statistically half of these are driven by females, that's 18,000. In any given group of females, 1 in 28 are having the worst day of their period. That is 642. </p>
<p>According to Cosmopolitan, 70% describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding, that's 449. According to the National Institutes of Health, 22% of all females have seriously considered suicide or homicide, that's 98. And, 34% describe men as their biggest problem, that's 33. According to the National Rifle Association, 5% of all females carry weapons, and the number is increasing. </p>
<p>That means, that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one female that has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, is having the worst day of her period, and is armed. </p>
<p>No matter what she does in traffic, I wouldn't DREAM of flipping her off.</p>

He instructed his wife to go to the bank and withdraw enough money to fill two pillow cases. He then directed her to take the bags of money to the attic and leave them directly above his bed. His plan: When he passed away, he would reach out and grab the bags on his way to heaven.Several weeks after the funeral, the deceased lawyer�s wife, up in the attic cleaning, came upon the two forgotten pillow cases stuffed with cash. ""Oh, that darned old fool,"" she exclaimed. ""I knew he should have had me put the money in the basement.""</p>

14704,"<p>In a small southern town I saw a wonderful nativity scene, but one feature bothered me. The three wise men were wearing firemen's helmets. Unable to come up with a reason or explanation, I left. At a convenience store on the edge of town, I asked the lady behind the counter about the helmets. </p>
<p>She exploded into a rage, yelling at me, ""You darn Yankees never do read the Bible!"" </p>
<p>I assured her that I did, but simply couldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible. She jerked her Bible from behind the counter and ruffled through some pages, and finally jabbed her finger at a passage.</p>
<p>Sticking it in my face, she said, ""See, it says right here, 'The three wise men came from afar!'""</p>

14705,"<p>A man is sitting in a plane which is about to take off, when<br /> another man with a dog occupies the empty seats alongside. The<br /> dog is sat in the middle, and the first man is looking<br /> quizzically at the dog, when the second man explains that they<br /> work for the airline. The dog handler says to the first man,<br /> ""Don't mind Rover, he is a 'sniffer dog,' the best there is.<br /> I'll show you when we get airborne and I set him to work.""</p>
<p>The plane takes off and levels out, when the handler says to the<br /> first man, ""Watch this."" He tells the dog, ""Rover, search.""</p>
<p>The dog jumps down, walks along the aisle and sits next to a<br /> woman for a few seconds. It then returns to its seat and puts<br /> one paw on the handler's arm. He says, ""Good boy,"" and turns to<br /> the first man and says, ""That woman is in possession of<br /> marijuana, so I'm making a note of this and the seat number for<br /> the police who will apprehend her on arrival."" ""Fantastic!""<br /> replies the first man.</p>
<p>Once again, he sends the dog to search the aisles. The dog<br /> sniffs about, sits down beside a man for a few seconds, returns<br /> to its seat and places both paws on the handler's arm. He says,<br /> ""Good boy,"" and he turns to the first man and says, ""That man is<br /> carrying cocaine, so again, I'm making a note of this and the<br /> seat number."" ""That's marvellous, I've never seen anything like<br /> it!"" says the first man.</p>
<p>Once again he sends the dog to search the aisles. He goes up and<br /> down the plane and after a while sits down next to someone, and<br /> then comes racing back and jumps up onto the seat and shits all<br /> over the place. The first man is surprised and disgusted by<br /> this, and asks, ""What the hell is going on?""</p>
<p>The handler replies. ""He's just found a bomb!""</p>

<p>To go outside, and there perchance to stay Or to remain within: that is the question: Whether 'tis better for a cat to suffer The cuffs and buffets of inclement weather That Nature rains on those who roam abroad, Or take a nap upon a scrap of carpet, And so by dozing melt the solid hours That clog the clock's bright gears with sullen time And stall the dinner bell. To sit, to stare Outdoors, and by a stare to seem to state A wish to venture forth without delay, Then when the portal's opened up, to stand As if transfixed by doubt. To prowl; to sleep; To choose not knowing when we may once more Our readmittance gain: aye, there's the hairball; For if a paw were shaped to turn a knob, Or work a lock or slip a window-catch, And going out and coming in were made As simple as the breaking of a bowl, What cat would bear the household's petty plagues, The cook's well-practiced kicks, the butler's broom, The infant's careless pokes, the tickled ears, The trampled tail, and all the daily shocks That fur is heir to, when, of his own free will, He might his exodus or entrance make With a mere mitten? Who would spaniels fear, Or strays trespassing from a neighbor's yard, But that the dread of our unheeded cries And scratches at a barricaded door No claw can open up, dispels our nerve And makes us rather bear our humans' faults Than run away to unguessed miseries? Thus caution doth make house cats of us all; And thus the bristling hair of resolution Is softened up with the pale brush of thought, And since our choices hinge on weighty things, We pause upon the threshold of decision.</p>

Yes, he has a few unusual quirks and mannerisms, but he's no boring, cookie-cutter frat boy. In short, he's totally unlike any other man you've ever dated, which strikes you as a good thing. </p>
<p>Your view changes, radically, the evening you proudly introduce him to your friends. In front of everyone you know, your new suitor relates an anecdote about a bus trip he once took that goes on forever and has no apparent pont. THen, when the conversation turns to politics, he hijacks it, launching into a long, unstoppable tirade about the unacknowledged link between diet soda and brain damage. In a moment of sickening clarity, you become aware that you are dating a deeply odd individual. He's the nerd from chemistry class, traveling incognito thanks to a pair of chinos from the GAP. </p>

But the Harmless Weirdo isn't exactly attuned to social clues and fundamentally doesn't understand he's being ditched. Long after you've shown him the door, he'll still call and drop by with no warning, as though nothing has changed. Although he's not physically threatening, psychologically, he's a menace.

Do you wanna try it?� Said David �Sure, hell I�ll try anything once!� Said Jim. SO with that they poured themselves a couple of glasses and began drinking the jet fuel. They sipped a little bit to find it actually tasted quiet good. so they drank more and more and sure enough they got stoned drunk. The next morning Jim awoke feeling like a million bucks he jumped up wet to the bathroom feeling great like he was floating on air he hadn�t felt this good in years. �Wow!!� He said.

14786,"<p>The other day I went to the local religious book store where I saw a ""HONK IF<br /> YOU LOVE JESUS"" bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on my back bumper and I'm<br /> glad I did. </p>
<p>What an uplifting experience followed. That bumper sticker really worked!!</p>
<p>I found lots of people who loved Jesus. </p>
<p>I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about<br /> the Lord. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. </p>
<p>He must REALLY love Jesus because pretty soon he leaned out of his window and<br /> yelled ""JESUS CHRIST!"" as loud as he could. </p>
<p>It was like a football game with him shouting, ""GO!...JESUS CHRIST!...GO!""<br /> Everyone else started honking too, so I leaned out the window and smiled and<br /> waved to all those loving people. </p>
<p>There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I heard him yell<br /> something about a sunny beach and saw him waving with only his middle finger. </p>
<p>I asked my kids what he meant by that and they laughed and said it was the<br /> Hawaiian good luck sign. So I leaned out of the window and gave him the good<br /> luck sign back. </p>
<p>A couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got<br /> out of their cars and started running towards me! </p>
<p>I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed<br /> so I stepped on the gas. </p>
<p>It's a good thing that I did because I was the only driver to get across the<br /> intersection. </p>
<p>I looked back and everyone was still standing there so I leaned way out the<br /> window and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away. </p>
<p>Praise the Lord for such wonderful people!</p>

14794,"<p>With Viagra such a hit, Pfizer is bringing forth a whole line of drugs  oriented towards improving the performance of men in today's society.... DIRECTRA - a dose of this drug given to men before leaving on car   trips caused 72 percent of them to stop and ask directions when  they got lost,  compared to a control group of 0.2 percent.     PROJECTRA - Men given this experimental new drug were far more likely to  actually finish a  household repair project before starting a new one. CHILDAGRA - Men taking this drug reported a sudden, over-whelming  urge to perform more child-care tasks - especially cleaning up  spills  and 'little accidents.' COMPLIMENTRA - In clinical trials, 82 percent of middle-aged  men administered this drug noticed that their wives had a new  hairstyle. Currently being tested to see if its effects extend  to noticing new clothing. BUYAGRA - Married and otherwise attached men reported a sudden  urge to buy their sweeties expensive jewelry and gifts after  talking this drug for only two days. Still to be seen:  whether the  drug can be continued for a  period longer than your favorites store's  return limit. NEGA-VIAGRA - Has the exact opposite effect of Viagra.  Currently undergoing clinical trials on sitting U.S. presidents. NEGA-SPORTAGRA - This drug had the strange effect of making men  want to turn off televised sports and actually converse with  other family members.

FLYAGRA - This drug has been showing great promise in treating  men with O.F.D. (Open Fly Disorder).  Expecially useful for men on  Viagra.  PRYAGRA - About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men  in the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal  affairs of other people. Note:  Apparent over-dose turned three test  subjects into 'special  prosecutors.' LIAGRA - This drug causes men to be less than truthful when  being asked about their sexual affairs.  Will be available Regular,  Grand Jury and Presidential Strength versions.</p>

The motorist passed on by and went a couple of miles on down the road. All of a sudden he spun his car around and sped back toward the fortune teller. As he got closer to the still laughing fortune teller he began to slow down. He pulled up next to the woman and jumped out of his car and suddenly began slapping and beating her.A policeman passing by screeched to a stop and wrestled the man to the ground.

14806,"<p>INTER OFFICE MEMORANDUM<br /> SUBJECT: Solution to Y2K Problem </p>
<p>Factory Networks is pleased to announce the successful completion of a pilot program that was developed to establish a low-cost solution to the Year 2000 issue. In accordance with the wishes of the our manager, at meeting last week, we have been asked to implement this plan on a group-wide basis ASAP. Our new goal is to remove all computers from the desktop by Jan, 1999. Instead, everyone will be provided with an Etch-A-Sketch. </p>
<p>There are many sound reasons for doing this:<br /> 1. No Y2K problems<br /> 2. Reduction in technical problems<br /> 3. Major reduction in software costs.<br /> 4. Smaller learning curve for our managers. </p>
<p>As part of our continuing effort to be proactive in our customer relations, we are including the most frequently asked questions from our test group from the pilot phase. We believe that these questions cover approximately 99% of the issued involved with the new 'systems' - though we recognize it is certainly not foolproof since we all know how ingenious fools are. Should you have questions or concerns with this plan, please contact a member of the system administration team and take it up with them.</p>

<p>The woman rushed down to the man and immediately began to apologize. She<br /> explained that she was a physical therapist: ""Please allow me to help. I'm<br /> a physical therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you'd allow<br /> me"", she told him earnestly.</p>
<p>Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I'll be alright...I'll be fine in a few minutes, he<br /> replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal position still clasping<br /> his hands together at his crotch.</p>
<p>But she persisted, and he finally allowed her to help him. She gently took<br /> his hands away and laid them to the side, she loosened his pants, and she<br /> put her hands inside and began to massage him. She then asked him: How<br /> does that feel?

14833,"<p>One day a fly was flying over a lake. In the lake a trout said<br /> to himself, ""If that fly will drop four inches, I can jump out<br /> and catch it."" Behind a shrub a bear said to himself, ""If that<br /> fly will drop four inches, the trout will jump out of the water<br /> and catch it, so I can reach out and grab the trout."" On a hill<br /> sat a hunter who said, ""If that fly will drop four inches, the<br /> trout will jump out of the water and catch it, the bear will<br /> reach out and grab the trout, and it will expose him for a clear<br /> shot."" Behind A bush there was a rat who said, ""If that fly will<br /> drop four inches, the trout will jump out of the water and catch<br /> it, the bear will reach out and grab the trout, the hunter will<br /> have a clear shot at the bear and run down to get his kill, and<br /> I can steal his food."" Behind a tree was a cat who said, ""If<br /> that fly will drop four inches, the trout will jump out of the<br /> water and catch it, the bear will reach out and grab the trout,<br /> the hunter will have a clear shot at the bear and run down to<br /> get his kill, the rat will steal the hunter's food, and I can<br /> pounce on the rat."" Well, everything began: the fly dropped four<br /> inches, the trout caught the fly, the bear reached out and<br /> grabbed the trout exposing himself, the hunter shot the bear and<br /> ran down for his kill, the rat stole the hunter's food, and the<br /> cat tripped and rolled all the way down the hill into the lake.</p>
<p>Moral: When the fly drops, the pussy gets wet.</p>

<p>I can't come to the phone now, so if, well, actually, I CAN come to the phone now, I mean, like, I'm at the phone NOW, recording this message, but I'm doing this NOW, while you're listening to it LATER, except for you I guess it's NOW, like, when you're listening to it...I mean, like, wait, gosh.

<p>Hi. I'm probably home, I'm just avoiding someone I don't like. Leave me a message, and if I don't call back, it's you.</p>

That means you should be looking for<br /> something around $500,000, perhaps a nice brick rancher.  And I see here<br /> that you'll be out of a job in 6 months or so. What will you do then?  Open<br /> a library?  In Little Rock?  Arkansas?  Wow, I bet that will be some kind<br /> of moneymaker.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clinton, you're running for the Senate, right?  Senators are paid<br /> $130,000 a year, assuming, of course, that you're elected- so even with<br /> your pension you're still looking at a house in the $825,000 range.  Maybe<br /> a nice center hall colonial.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clinton, you haven't worked outside the house since 1991?  But you did<br /> some volunteer work I see.  You tried to overhaul the entire national<br /> health care system?  I see.  But no one was interested?  But you have other<br /> experience?  Yes, I see you had several business ventures back in Arkansas.<br /> How about this Whitewater Development Corp.?  It went bankrupt. And Madison<br /> Guaranty? Bankrupt.  And Castle Grande?  Bankrupt, too. You actually did go<br /> to Yale, you claim?  A little bad luck with the law, too, I see.  Three of<br /> your business partners went to jail.</p>
<p>This is embarrassing, I know, but we have to ask because it does after all,<br /> affect your ability to pay: Any problems in your marriage? No, fine.  Let's<br /> look at your assets: you owe $4.5 million, Mr. Clinton? How do you expect<br /> to pay that off?  You're hoping people will donate to a special fund?  So<br /> basically, you're relying on the kindness of strangers.</p>
<p>You also have some serious expenses.  A kid at Stanford has got to be<br /> setting you back $30,000 to $35,000 a year, probably more with the<br /> airfares.  And she wants to go to medical school? Any legal problems?  I<br /> see a $90,000 fine for perjury.  I guess that rules out putting your law<br /> degree to work.  Say, how do we know you're not lying on your loan<br /> application?  Of course it would look a lot better if you WERE lying.</p>
<p>Are there any other legal matters we should know about, Mrs. Clinton?  You<br /> don't think you're going to get hit with a perjury or obstruction of<br /> justice rap?  But we're not totally sure, right?  That means there's a<br /> remote possibility- note that I say  ""remote""-that you could be trying to<br /> pay off a $1.76 million mortgage while making 12 cents an hour stitching<br /> mailbags for the feds, while Mr. Clinton is trying to make a go of a<br /> library in Little Rock.</p>
<p>Let's review the situation.  One of you is now unemployed and the other one<br /> soon will be.  Your business partners are in jail.  You have debts<br /> equivalent to over 22 times your annual income that you're hoping someone<br /> is going to come along and pay off for you. There's a criminal indictment<br /> looming in your near future.  Your tangible assets seem to consist of an<br /> old Ford.</p>
<p>We'll give you a call.</p>

14864,"<p>A doctor and a lawyer were attending a cocktail party when the doctor was<br /> approached by a man who asked advice on how to handle his ulcer.The doctor<br /> mumbled some medical advice, then turned to the lawyer and asked, ""How do you<br /> handle the situation when you are asked for advice during a social<br /> function?""""Just send a bill for such advice"" replied the lawyer.On the next<br /> morning the doctor arrived at his surgery and issued the ulcer-stricken man a<br /> $50 bill.

14865,"<p>Two law partners were walking down the street one day and agreed that the<br /> first one to die would come back and help the other from beyond. As it<br /> turned out, the older of the two did in fact die a couple of weeks later<br /> and that left the younger lawyer all alone and very discouraged. He waited<br /> and waited and his partner never showed any signs of contacting him. Then,<br /> after about two months, a friend suggested he go visit a clairvoyant and<br /> maybe receive the help he needed. The younger lawyer summoned up as much<br /> courage as he could and found the address. After walking down a seemingly<br /> never ending set of steps and rapping the brass knocker a couple of times,<br /> the door opened and through a screen of dangling beads, he saw a little<br /> old lady sitting at a table with a crystal ball in front of her. ""Can you<br /> help me please?"" he said. ""My partner just recently died and I would very<br /> much like to get in contact with him."" To which the woman responded, ""for<br /> 50 dollars you can talk to your partner, but he won't be able to talk to<br /> you. For 100 dollars, he will be able to talk to you, but not you to him.<br /> And for 200 dollars, you will both be able to talk to each other while I'm<br /> drinking a glass of water.""</p>

14866,"<p>A group of Texans are driving down the road, whooping it up, drinking beer and shooting off their guns when they get into an accident with busload of nuns and orphans, killing everyone. The Texans go straight to Hell. When they arrive the Devil is shocked to see that they are not in agony over the heat and he demands an explanation.</p>
<p>""Well, sir, we're from Texas, and we're used to the heat,"" says one. This infuriates the Devil and he cranks the thermostat up to its highest setting. The lost souls all over hell start wailing. ""I'll check on them in the morning and see how they like THIS."" He snorts and disappears in a ball of fire.</p>
<p>The next morning, the Devil shows up at the Texans' camp site, and sure enough they are showing some signs of discomfort. They have taken off their 10 Gallon hats and are fanning themselves. One has even rolled up his sleeves. ""Well, sir,"" explains a Texan, ""when you have been on a cattle drive in Lubbock during August, this ain't hardly nothing."" The Devil is now so angry he is seeing red.</p>
<p>""Those damn Texans seem immune to heat, let 's see what happens when I turn OFF the heat,"" he says as he heads to the thermostat. ""I'll check on them tomorrow."" </p>
<p>So in the morning the Devil arrives at the Texans' campsite, and they are all whoopin' and hollerin' and drinkin' the beers from the ice chest in the back of the pick up, now that they have ice to chill them with. The wail of the lost souls is deafening but the Texans are partyin' like there is no tomorrow.</p>
<p>""I don't get it,"" the Devil says, completely defeated. ""I tried to roast you and it had no effect, and then I tried to freeze you and you are partying. You Texans are made of tough stuff. But why are you celebrating?""</p>
<p>A Texan takes a swig from a Bud in a longneck and replies, ""Look around! Hell is frozen over. That's just gotta mean there is another Bush in the White House.""</p>

But now, Murphy had cancer, and was lying on his deathbed,  surrounded by his friends. He calls, ''O'Brian, come 'ere  O'Brian. I 'ave a request for  ye.'' O'Brian walks to his friends bedside and kneels down.''O'Brian, we've been friends all our lives, and now I'm dying  'ere. I 'ave one last request fir ye to do.'' O'Brian bursts into tears, ''Anything Murphy, anything ye wish. It's done.'' ''Well, under me bed is a box containing a bottle of the finest  whiskey in all of Ireland. Bottled the year I was born it was.  After I die, and they plant me in the ground, I want you to  pour that fine whiskey over me grave so it might soak into me  bones and I'll be able to enjoy it for all eternity.'' O'Brian was overcome by the beauty and true Irish spirit  of his friend's request. ''Aye, tis a fine thing you ask of me, and I will pour the  whiskey.

<p>""If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon.""</p>
<p>In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a news release<br /> stating:</p>
<p>""If GM had developed technology like Microsoft we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:</p>
<p>For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day</p>
<p>Every time you painted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new car</p>
<p>Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you<br /> would just accept this, restart and drive on</p>
<p>Occasionally executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you'd have to reinstall the engine</p>
<p>Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought<br /> ""Car95"" or CarNT"".&nbsp;But then you would have to buy more seats</p>
<p>MacIntosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only work on 5 per cent of the roads</p>
<p>The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single ""general car default"" warning light</p>
<p>Now seats would force everyone to have the same size butt</p>
<p>The airbag system would say ""Are you sure?"" before going off</p>
<p>Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna</p>
<p>GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand<br /> McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary) even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the cars performance to diminish by 50% or more (Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department)</p>
<p>Every time GM introduced a new model, car buyers would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car</p>
<p>You'd press the start button to shut off the engine""</p>

<p>She turns around quickly to see who has spoken, but there is no one. All she<br /> sees is a big green parrot, resting on his perch in his cage. ""Did you say<br /> that?"" she asks.</p>
<p>""Why, yes, I did!"" he replies. ""And may I add that dress is a very nice color<br /> for you.""</p>
<p>The lady suddenly realizes how nice it would be to not only have a talking<br /> parrot, but also one that paid such nice compliments. So she pays for him and<br /> takes him home.

<p>The parrot says, ""Why yes, that would be delightful. I know a charming place<br /> on 7th Street.""</p>
<p>So they arrive home and the lady progresses upstairs to her room to change for<br /> dinner, bringing the parrot along, of course. When the woman enters the<br /> building, the parrot begins complaining, swearing, and even bit her once.</p>
<p>Well, the woman is flabbergasted! She grabs the parrot by the throat, marches<br /> down the stairs into the basement, and stuffs the parrot in the freezer. She<br /> leaves him there in the freezer for five long minutes before taking him back<br /> out. The parrot is very cold.</p>
<p>She says, ""Well? Have you learned your lesson? I will not tolerate such<br /> language in my house!""</p>
<p>The parrot says, ""Okay, okay, I promise it won't happen again. I am deeply<br /> sorry.""</p>
<p>Within five minutes, he is cursing again and bit her once on the arm<br /> and once on the finger.</p>
<p>The lady is absolutely stunned. She rips the parrot out of his cage, goes down<br /> the stairs, into the cellar, and, slam, into the freezer. This time, she leaves<br /> him in there for fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>When she finally takes him out, the parrot is one step away from death. He is<br /> shivering and has light frost on the beak. ""I swear it will never ever happen<br /> again! I will never insult you again! I promise!"" As he thaws, he looks up at<br /> the lady and says, ""I do have one question though. That turkey in there, what'd<br /> he do, attack you?""</p>

The patron takes a sip and is most satisfied.All the while this has been going on, a drunk at the end of the bar has been watching.

14949,"<p>RECOUNT DEMANDED BY METS</p>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference earlier today. They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union. ""We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,"" said the Mets batting coach. ""We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit.""</p>
<p>One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year.</p>
<p>""The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit,"" said the Mets batting coach.</p>
<p>""The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely. ""Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game. ""While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series,"" the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.</p>
<p>""It's clear that we were on-base slightly more often than the Yankees,"" said a Mets spokesman. ""The World Series crown is rightly ours. ""The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise. He has stated that he believes ""we need to let the process run its course without a rush to judgment.""</p>

14984,"<p>While Bill, Hillary and Chelsea were vacationing at Camp David the housekeeper<br /> was tasked with looking after their pet parrot. They hadn't been gone for more<br /> than a couple of days when the parrot was found dead in the bottom of its cage. </p>
<p>The housekeeper knew the first family would be desolate at the loss of one of<br /> their family pets, so she set out to find a replacement bird and visited nearly<br /> every pet store in Washington. </p>
<p>After nearly two days of looking no-stop, she came across an almost exact<br /> duplicate of the bird. As she purchased the parrot, the shop owner cautioned her<br /> that the bird had previously been owned by a Madam and had lived for several<br /> years in a house of ill-repute. </p>
<p>The housekeeper replied that no one would ever know and she took the bird back<br /> to the White House. </p>
<p>The morning after the Clintons return to the White House, Chelsea walked<br /> through the room and the bird said, ""Too young�. </p>
<p>A little later Hillary came into the room and the bird responded with, ""Too<br /> old�. </p>
<p>Late that afternoon the President entered the room and the bird said, ""HI,<br /> BILL!""</p>

<p>He gets a pitcher of beer and asks the bartender, 'man, I heard that things are big down here in Texasm but this is ridiculas!' and goes about drinking his beer. He orders another and he gets really pissed drunk.</p>
<p>Well, not too long later, he has to go to the bathroom really, really bad so he asks the bartender, 'Where is your washroom???' The bartender says, down the hall, second door on the right.'</p>
<p>So the man climbs off the stool and stumbles down the hall and enters the second door to the left and falls in this huge swimming pool.</p>
<p>The man is struggling to stay afloat and screams 'DON'T FLUSH IT!!!</p>

14993,"<p>There was this fly hovering about 8 inches above the surface of the river, but unbeknown to the fly, just below the surface of the river there was this salmon looking up at the fly thinking, 'If that fly was to come just six inches lower I would leap out of this water and have it for my tea.' But unbeknown to the fish, there was this bear watching it, thinking, 'If that fly was to come just six inches lower, that fish would leap out of the water and take it for its tea, and I could reach out and take that fish for my tea.' But unbeknown to the bear, in the bushes was a hunter with his gun thinking, 'If that fly was to come just six inches lower, that fish would leap out of the water and take it for its tea, that bear would reach out and take that fish for its tea, and I could lean forward with my gun and shoot that bear.' But, unbeknown to the hunter, there was this mouse thinking, 'If that fly was to come just six inches lower, that fish would leap out of the water and take it for its tea, that bear would reach out and take that fish for its tea, that hunter would lean forward with his gun and shoot that bear and I could run between the hunters legs and have his sandwich's for my tea.' But unbeknown to the mouse, there was this cat thinking, 'If that fly was to come just six inches lower, that fish would leap out of the water and take it for its tea, that bear would reach out and take that fish for its tea, that hunter would lean forward with his gun and shoot that bear, that mouse would run between the hunters legs and have his sandwich's for its tea and I could leap onto the mouse and have it for my tea.'<br /> Just then the fly dropped six inches, the fish jumped, the bear reached, the hunter leaned, the mouse ran, the cat leaped and missed, falling into the water. </p>
<p>Which only goes to prove that ""Whenever a fly drops six inches there is going to be a wet pussy"".</p>

First, he asked that the air conditioning be turned up because he was too hot, then he asked it be turned down cause he was too cold, and so on for about half an hour.Surprisingly, the waiter was very patient, he walked back and forth and never once got angry.  So finally, a second customer asked him why he didn't throw out the pest.""Oh, I really don't care or mind,"" said the waiter with a smile.  ""We don't even have an air conditioner.""</p>
