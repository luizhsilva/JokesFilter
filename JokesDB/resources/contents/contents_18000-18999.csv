18001,"<p>Two guys wandered into a bar.</p>
<p>One of the men shouted to the barkeeper, ""Hiya, Mike, set 'em up for me and my pal here.""</p>
<p>Then he turned to his slightly dim partner and boasted, ""This is a great bar. For every two drinks you buy, the house gives you one. And the pinball machines in the back are free!""</p>
<p>""That's not so great,"" responded the friend. ""There's a bar across town that'll match you drink for drink, and you can get laid in the back for free.""</p>
<p>""Where is this place?"" the first guy exclaimed.</p>
<p>""Oh, I don't know,"" the dim fellow replied, ""But my wife goes there all the time.""</p>

18008,"<p>There once was a man who lost his arms in a car accident. One<br /> day he won a million dollar lottery. After a moment of thought,<br /> he rushed to the hospital and asked their top surgeon whether he<br /> could get his arms back for a million dollars.</p>
<p>""Wow,"" the doctor replied, ""I just invented a completely voice<br /> activated mechanical arm, but I can only give you one though.""<br /> So he showed him some of the stuff the arm could do and the man<br /> was amazed and bought the arm.</p>
<p>The next day he went to the pub with his friends to show off his<br /> new advanced arm. As they sat together he told the arm to pick<br /> up his pint of beer and give him a sip. The arm did it perfectly<br /> and the friends were amazed.</p>
<p>After a few pints the man went for a piss. He told the arm to<br /> take his penis out and away he pissed. Then he tells the arm to,<br /> ""give it a little shake."" The arm does and the man enjoyed it,<br /> and so he looks around to make sure no one is looking and tells<br /> the arm to give it another little shake.</p>
<p>He gets a boner and once again turns around to make sure<br /> nobody's watching and then tells the arm, ""Jerk it off!"" The arm<br /> pulls off his penis and the man screams out, in pain, ""Fuck Me!""</p>
<p>So the arm then shoves his penis up his ass. The man even more<br /> shocked at this stage shouts out, ""Holy shit, would you look at<br /> that."" The arm pulls his penis out of his ass and shoves it<br /> right into one of his eyeballs!</p>

18012,"<p>A flea had oiled up his little flea legs and his little flea arms, had spread out his blanket, and was proceeding to soak up the Miami sun when who should stumble by on the beach but an old flea friend of his.</p>
<p>""Oscar, what happened to you?"", asked the flea, because Oscar looked terrible, wrapped up in a blanket, his nose running, his eyes red, and his teeth chattering.</p>
<p>""I got a ride down here in some guy's moustache and he came down here by motorcycle. I nearly froze my nuts off,"" wheezed Oscar.</p>
<p>""Let me give you a tip, old pal,"" said the first flea, spreading some more suntan oil on his shoulders. ""You go to the stewardess lounge at the airport, see, and you get up on the toilet seat, and when an Air Florida stewardess comes in to take a leak, you hop on for a nice warm ride. Got it?""</p>
<p>So you can imagine the flea's surprise when, a month or so later, while stretched out all warm and comfortable on the beach, who should he see but Oscar - looking more chilled and miserable than before.</p>
<p>""Listen,"" said Oscar, ""I did everything you said. I made it to the stewardess lounge and waited till a really cute one came in, and made a perfect landing and got so warm and cozy that I dozed right off.""</p>
<p>""And so?"" asked the first flea.</p>

18013,"<p>Two men were down on their luck and decided to paint houses to earn some extra money. To start their business they asked the rabbi of a local synagogue if he would be interested in their service. He agreed and the men went out to buy the paint. </p>
<p>As they drove to the paint store they decided that they would mix half paint and half water to try to increase their profits. When they finished the job they called the rabbi outside to look at their work. ""It looks wonderful,"" the rabbi said and as he started to hand them the check a small raincloud appeared.</p>
<p>All at once there was lightning and thunder and the temple area was drenched with rain. As the rain hit the synagogue the paint started running. Suddenly, as the three of them stood there in disbelief, a voice from heaven said ... ""Repaint and thin no more.""</p>

18015,"<p>Q. Why don't women wear watches?<br /> A. There's a clock on the stove!</p>
"
18016,"<p>A must-read for all men.<br /> Keywords and their meanings: </p>
<p>FINE:<br /> This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel<br /> we are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to<br /> describe how a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of<br /> those arguments. </p>
<p>FIVE MINUTES:<br /> This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that<br /> your football game is going to last before you take out the<br /> trash, so it's an even trade. </p>
<p>NOTHING:<br /> This means something and you should be on your toes. ""Nothing""<br /> is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting<br /> to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. ""Nothing""<br /> usually signifies an argument that will last ""Five Minutes"" and<br /> end with a huffy ""Fine."" </p>
<p>GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows):<br /> This is a dare, one that will result in my getting upset over<br /> ""Nothing"" and will end with the word ""Fine."" </p>
<p>GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows):<br /> This means ""I give up"" or ""do what you want because I don't<br /> care."" You will get a raised eyebrow ""Go ahead"" in just a few<br /> minutes, followed by ""Nothing"" and ""Fine"" and she will talk to<br /> you in about ""Five Minutes"" when she cools off. </p>
<p>(LOUD SIGH):<br /> This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal<br /> statement very misunderstood by men.<br /> A ""Loud Sigh"" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment<br /> and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and<br /> arguing with you over ""Nothing."" </p>
<p>(SOFT SIGH):<br /> Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. ""Soft Sighs"" are one<br /> of the few things that some men actually understand. She is<br /> content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will<br /> stay content. </p>
<p>OH!:<br /> This exclamation, followed by any statement, is trouble.<br /> Example:<br /> ""Oh, let me get that."" Or, ""Oh, I talked to him about what you<br /> were doing last night.""<br /> If she says ""Oh"" before a statement, RUN, do not walk, to the<br /> nearest exit. She will tell you that she is ""Fine"" when she is<br /> done tossing your clothes out the window, but do not expect her<br /> to talk to you for at least 2 days. ""Oh"" as the lead to a<br /> sentence usually signifies that you are<br /> caught in a lie. Do not try to lie more to get out of it, or you<br /> will get raised eyebrows and ""Go ahead"" followed by acts so<br /> unspeakable that we can't bring ourselves to write about them. </p>
<p>THAT'S OK:<br /> This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can<br /> say to a man. ""That's OK"" means that she wants to think long and<br /> hard before paying you retributions for what ever it is that you<br /> have done.<br /> ""That's OK"" is often used with the word ""Fine"" and used in<br /> conjunction with a raised eyebrow ""Go ahead."" At some point in<br /> the near future when she has plotted and planned, you are going<br /> to be in some mighty big trouble. </p>
<p>PLEASE DO:<br /> This is not a statement; it is an offer. A woman is giving you<br /> the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have<br /> for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair<br /> chance to tell the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a<br /> ""That's OK."" </p>
<p>THANKS:<br /> A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say, ""You're<br /> welcome."" </p>
<p>THANKS A LOT:<br /> This is much different from ""Thanks."" A woman will say, ""Thanks<br /> A LOT,"" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that<br /> you have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by<br /> the ""Loud Sigh."" Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the<br /> ""Loud Sigh,"" as she will only<br /> say ""Nothing."" </p>
<p>I hope this clears up any misunderstandings...</p>

Andrzej thought for a while, and then came up with the second  question: 'what about female priests then, will we have that one day?' Again God had to disappoint Old Andrzej: 'Not in your life-time,  I'm afraid.' Andrzej was sorry to hear that, and he decided to drop the  subject. After having though for a while, he asked the last  question: 'Will there ever be another Polish pope?' God answered quickly and with a firm voice, 'Not in My life time.'</p>

18068,"<p>My uncle was in the fertilized egg business when I was young. He had several hundred young layers, called pullets, and 8 or 10 roosters whose job was to fertilize the eggs. My uncle kept records and any rooster or pullet that didn't perform well went into the pot and was replaced. </p>
<p>Now this took an awful lot of time. So when my uncle saw a set of eight tiny bells that each rang a different tone he promptly bought them. He glued a piece of foam rubber to each clapper shaft so the bell wouldn't ring except when violently shaken. He hung a bell on each rooster's neck and went and mixed a Mint Julep. </p>
<p>Now he could sit on the porch and sip while filling out an efficiency report on the roosters by listening to the different tones of the bells and marking down each encounter. My uncle's favorite rooster was old Brewster. Brewster was a fine specimen, but his bell didn't ring all morning. Uncle went to investigate. Several roosters were chasing pullets, bells a-ringing. Brewster had his bell in his beak so it couldn't ring. </p>
<p>He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one. Chagrined at first, Uncle was soon so proud of Brewster he entered him in the county fair. Brewster was an overnight sensation. They not only awarded him the No Bell prize but also the Pullet Surprise.</p>

<p>To his surprise the old man played fairly quickly. He didn't hit the ball far, but plodded along consistently and didn't waste much time. </p>
<p>Finally, they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot. </p>
<p>There was a large pine tree right in front of his ball and it was directly between his ball and the green. </p>
<p>After several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said, ""You know, when I was your age I'd hit the ball right over that tree."" </p>
<p>With that challenge placed before him, the youngster swung hard, hit the ball up, right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay. </p>

18097,"<p>A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA loan for a client. He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The title to the property dated backto 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down. After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following reply:""Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral proper back to 1803. Before final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin.""Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows:""Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been received. I notethat you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application. I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application. For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain. The land came into possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the then reigning monarch, Isabella. The good queen, being a pious woman and careful about titles, almost as much as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to fund Columbus' expedition. Now the Pope, as I'm sure you know, is the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And God, it is commonly accepted, created this world. Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that He also made that part of the world called Louisiana. He, therefore, would be the owner of origin. I hope to you find His original claim to be satisfactory.Now, may we have the lousy loan?</p>

<p>Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%? Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:</p>
<p>If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z<br /> are represented as:</p>
<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K<br /> 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E<br /> 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E<br /> 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T<br /> 2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%</p>

<p>A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G<br /> 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%</p>
<p>So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that: While Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, Bullshit and Ass-kissing will put you over the top!!!</p>

During the courting process Saddam would tell the women he's the potentate of an oil-rich Middle Eastern nation. Not until the final episode would he reveal the truth -- that he has been driven from power and doesn't have a single weapon of mass destruction to his name."" </p>

18158,"<p>Un buen d�a, un mexicano y un gringo estaban divirti�ndose con el Bungee-jumping. De pronto, al yanqui se le ocurre una brillante idea y le propone al mexicano:</p>
<p>""You know, we could make a lot of money running our own bungee jumping service in Mexico.""<br /> (Sabes, podr�amos hacer mucho dinero con el negocio de Bungee Jumping en M�xico).</p>
<p>Al mexicano no le parece mala la idea, as� que ambos sacan sus ahorros del banco y compran todo lo necesario para iniciar su business: las cuerdas el�sticas, seguros, etc. Y comienzan a buscar lugares para iniciar la construcci�n de la torre de Bungee Jumping.</p>
<p>Cuando reci�n empiezan la construcci�n, obviamente, la curiosidad llama a una multitud de vecinos. Poco a poco llega m�s y m�s gente mientras ellos siguen con su trabajo. Al terminar, deciden hacer una demostraci�n para la congregaci�n de curiosos.</p>
<p>El estadounidense pide saltar primero. La cuerda se estira al m�ximo y regresa. El mexicano observa al norteamericano con unos ligeros cortes sobre su rostro y algunos rasgu�os. La algarab�a crece entre la multitud y hasta se escucha que han organizado canciones. El mexicano intenta detener al gringo, pero falla y �ste vuelve a caer. Nuevamente la cuerda se estira a su m�ximo y vuelve a subir. Esta vez el mexicano, asombrado, nota que el pobre yanqui tiene magulladuras y est� sangrando. Con poca fortuna, esa vez tampoco lo puede detener arriba, as� que el tipo vuelve a caer. La siguiente vez, el pobre hombre regresa hecho un desastre: la ropa toda rota, sangre por todos lados, huesos rotos y semiconsciente. Sin embargo, la algarab�a crec�a en la base de la torre. Afortunadamente, en esa ocasi�n el mexicano si logra detenerlo y le pregunta desesperado:</p>
<p>""What happened? Was the cord too long?""<br /> (�Qu� pas�? �La cuerda estaba muy larga?</p>
<p>""No, no, the cord was fine. But WHAT THE HELL IS LA PI�ATA?""<br /> (No, no, la cuerda est� bien, pero �qu� diablos es la pi�ata?)</p>

<p>They all line up, the whistle blows and ""splash"" they're all in<br /> the pool. The guy with no arms takes the lead instantly but the<br /> guy with no legs is closing fast. The head sank straight to the<br /> bottom.</p>
<p>Ten lengths later and the guy with no legs finishes first. He<br /> can still see bubbles coming from the bottom of the pool, so he<br /> decides he had better dive down to rescue him. He picks up the<br /> head, swims back up to the surface and places the head at the<br /> side of the pool, where-upon the head starts coughing and<br /> spluttering. </p>

On the 10th day, bleary eyed and half dead from heat, thirst and starvation, they spotted a small object floating toward them in the water. As it drew  near, they were ecstatic to find that it was an old oil lamp (the kind that genies come in).</p>
<p>They grabbed the lamp and rubbed it. Out popped a tired old genie who said, ""OK, so you freed me from the stupid lamp, but hey, I've been doing this 3-wishes stuff for a while now and quite frankly, I'm burned out. You guys only get 1 wish and then I'm outta here. Make it a good one.""</p>
<p>The first guy, blurted out, without thinking, ""Give us all the beer we can drink for the rest of our lives!"" ""Fine,"" said the genie, and he instantly turned the entire ocean to beer.</p>

<p>When the bus starts on it's way the bus driver says to the hippie, ""if you want I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you."" </p>

""If you went dressed in robes and some glowing powder,"" said the bus driver(male), ""you could tell her you were God and command her to have sex with you."" </p>
<p>Well the Hippie decides to try this out so that Tuesday he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun and right on schedule the nun shows up. When she's in the middle of praying the hippie walks out from hiding, in robes and glowing with a mask of god. ""I am God, I have heard your prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first."" </p>
<p>The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about to go to work on the nun. After the Hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, ""Ha ha, I'm the hippie!!"" </p>
<p>The nun replied by whipping off her mask and shouting, ""Ha ha, I'm the bus driver!!!""</p>

18163,"<p>Dear Employee:</p>
<p>As a result of the reduction of money budgeted for department areas, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel.</p>
<p>Under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. Therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.</p>
<p>This program will be known as SLAP (Sever Late-Aged Personnel). Employees who are SLAPPED will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company.</p>
<p>SLAPPED employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This review phase of the program is called SCREW.</p>
<p>SCREW (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers). All employees who have been SLAPPED and SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management.</p>
<p>This appeal is called SHAFT (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination).</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be SLAPPED once, SCREWED twice, but may be SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate.</p>
<p>If an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel's Early Severance) or CLAP (Combined Lump sum Assistance Payment).</p>
<p>As HERPES and CLAP are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received HERPES or CLAP will no longer be SLAPPED or SCREWED by the company.</p>
<p>Management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our:</p>
<p>Special High Intensity Training (SHIT). We take pride in the amount of SHIT our employees receive. We have given our employees more SHIT than any company in this area. If any employee feels they do not receive enough SHIT on the job, see your immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>Your supervisor is specially trained to make sure you receive all the SHIT you can stand.</p>
<p>And, once again, thanks for all your years of service with us.</p>

<p>In light of the rising frequency of human/grizzly bear<br /> conflicts, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is advising<br /> hikers, hunters, and fishermen to take extra precautions and<br /> keep alert of bears while in the field.</p>
<p>We advise outdoorsmen to wear noisy little bells on their<br /> clothing so as not to startle bears that aren't expecting them.<br /> We also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in<br /> case of an encounter with a bear.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear<br /> activity. Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between<br /> black bear and grizzly bear manure: Black bear manure is smaller<br /> and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur. Grizzly bear<br /> manure has little bells in it and smells like pepper-spray.""</p>

18172,"<p>Every night after dinner, Harry took off for the local watering hole. He spent the whole evening there and arrived home, well inebriated, around midnight each night. He always had trouble getting his key into the keyhole and getting the door opened. His wife, who was waiting up for him, would go to the door and let him in. Then she would proceed to yell and scream at him, for his constant nights out and coming home in a drunken state. But, Harry continued his nightly routine. One day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior and was particularly distraught by it all. The friend listened to her and then said, ""Why don't you treat him a little differently when he comes home? Instead of berating him, why don't you give him some loving words and welcome him home with a kiss? He then might change his ways."" The wife thought that might be a good idea. That night, Harry took off again after dinner. At about midnight, he arrived home, in his usual condition. His wife heard him at the door, quickly went to it, opened the door and let Harry in. This time, instead of berating him as she had always done, she took his arm and led him into the living room. She sat him down in an easy chair, put his feet up on the ottoman and took his shoes off. Then she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little. After a little while, she said to him, ""It's pretty late, dear. I think we had better go upstairs to bed now, don't you think?"" At that, Harry replied in his inebriated state, ""I guess we might as well. I'll get in trouble when I get home anyway!</p>

18182,"<p>How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night of drinking and thought 'How did I get home?'? As hard as you try, you cannot piece together your return journey from the bar to your home. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a beer scooter.</p>
<p>The beer scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased out to drunks by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched out since the decrease in the worship of the Roman pantheon and bought a large batch of these magical devices.</p>
<p>The beer scooter works in the following fashion:<br /> The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the slurring gland begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of his many sub-contractors detects the pheromone and sends down a winged beer scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits them in their bedroom via a trans-dimensional portal.</p>
<p>It is not cheap to run a beer scooter franchise, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket cash is taken as payment. This generates the second question after a night out 'How did I spend so much money?'.</p>
<p>Beer scooters have a poor safety record and are thought to be responsible for 90% of all UDI (unidentified drinking injuries). Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles cause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending the passenger to the wrong bedroom often with horrific consequences.</p>

18197,"<p>Bholaji finds himself in dire trouble. His business has gone bust and he's in<br /> serious financial trouble. He's so desperate that he decides to ask Bhagwan for<br /> help. He goes into the temple and begins to pray. </p>
<p>�Oh Bhagwan, please help me, I've lost my business and if I don't get some<br /> money, I'm going to lose my house as well. Please let me win the lottery.� </p>
<p>Lotto night comes and somebody else wins it. Bholaji goes back to the temple.<br /> ""Bhagwan please let me win the lotto. I've lost my business, my house and I'm<br /> going to lose my car as well.� </p>
<p>Lotto night comes and Bholaji still has no luck. Back to the temple he goes.<br /> ""My Bhagwan, why have you forsaken me? I've lost my business, my house, my car<br /> and my wife and children are starving. I don't often ask you for help and I have<br /> always been a good servant to you. Why won't you just let me win the lotto this<br /> one time so I can get my life back in order?"" </p>
<p>Suddenly there is a blinding flash of light as the sky parts open and Bholaji<br /> is confronted by the voice of God: ""Bholaji, buy a damn lottery ticket first.""</p>

18199,"<p>There was once this guy and a girl in a car, parked neatly on Makeout Ridge, and they were, well, doing the obvious. So, here they were, naked as jay birds, when the guy suddenly says: ""I need a cigarette.""<br /> ""But honey,"" his lover says. ""The store closes in two minutes. You'll never have time to get to the store, and get dressed."" </p>
<p>""That's okay,"" He quipps. ""I'll just run down there naked, and if anyone sees me, I'll pretend I'm a statue."" </p>
<p>So the young man ran down to the store, got two packs of cigaretts (this store was obviously in a heavy nudist area or something), and starts to run back. The car is in sight, and he has a few more yards to go, when all of the sudden three nuns round the corner. He panics, and freezes like a statue, his beloved cigarettes in one hand. </p>
<p>The first nun walks over to the young man. ""Oh! What a beautiful cigarette dispenser!"" She exclaimed. She sticks a quarter up his ass, pulls on his dong, and he drops a pack of cigarettes in utter disbelief. </p>
<p>The second nun strolls over. ""What an interesting cigarette dispenser! I must try it, too."" She sticks a quarter up the young man's ass, chokes his chicken, and he drops the other pack of cigarettes. </p>
<p>The third nun was the unimpressed sort. She strode up, stuck a quarter up the young man's ass, and yanked his monkey. Nothing happened. She pulled on his Element of Adam again. Nothing happened. She tried a third time, and her eyes widened with sudden realization and suprise. ""Oh, I get it! A lotion dispenser!""</p>

18201,"<p>One evening after attending the theater two gentlemen were walking down the street when they observed a well-dressed, attractive young lady walking just ahead of them. One turned to the other and said, ""I'd give 50 bucks to spend the night with that woman.""</p>
<p>To their surprise, the woman turned and said, ""I'll take you up on that.""</p>
<p>She had a neat appearance and a pleasant voice, so after bidding his friend good-night, the man accompanied the lady to her apartment, where they immediately went to bed. The following morning the man presented her with 25 dollars as he prepared to leave. She demanded the rest of the money stating, ""If you don't give me the other 25 I'll sue you for it."" </p>
<p>He laughed, saying, ""I'd like to see you get it on these grounds."" </p>
<p>The next day he was surprised when he was served with a summons ordering his presence in court as defendant.... He hurried to his lawyer and explained the details of the case. </p>
<p>His lawyer said, ""She can't possibly get a judgment against you on such grounds, but it will be interesting to see how her case will be presented."" </p>
<p>After the usual preliminaries, the lady's lawyer addressed the court as follows: </p>
<p>""Your Honor, my client is the owner of a piece of property, a garden spot surrounded by a profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she agreed to rent to the defendant for a specified length of time for the sum of $50. The defendant took possession of the property, used it extensively for the purpose for which it was rented, but upon evacuating the premises he paid only $25. The rent is not excessive since it was restricted property, and we ask judgment to be granted against the defendant to assure payment of the balance."" </p>
<p>The defendant's lawyer was impressed and amused at the way the case had been presented. His defense was therefore somewhat altered from what he had planned.... This is what he said: </p>
<p>""Your Honor, my client agrees the young lady has a fine piece of property, for a degree of pleasure was derived from the transaction. However my client found a well on the property, around which he placed his own stones; sunk a shaft and erected a pump, all labor being personally performed by him. We claim these improvements to the property are sufficient to offset the unpaid balance, and that the plaintiff was adequately compensated for the rental of the said property. We therefore ask that the judgment not be granted."" </p>
<p>The young lady's lawyer's comeback was like this.... </p>
<p>""Your Honor, my client agrees that the defendant did find a well on the property, and he did make improvements such as described by my opponent, however, had the defendant not known the well existed, he would have never have rented the property; also, on evacuating the premises, the defendant moved the stones, pulled out the shaft and took the pump with him. In so doing he not only dragged his equipment through the shrubbery, but left the hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, making it easily accessible to little children. We therefore ask judgment be granted."" </p>
<p>She got it....</p>
"
18202,"<p>""You are a cheat!"" shouted the attorney to his opponent.</p>
<p>""And you're a liar!"" bellowed the opposition.</p>
<p>Banging his gavel loudly, the judge interjected, ""Now that both attorneys have been identified for the record, let's get on with the case."" </p>

18217,"<p>Dear Professor:______________________________Date:________ </p>
<p>My grade in _______________ should be raised from __________ to ______ because: </p>
<p>There must be a mistake somewhere. </p>
<p>I was not well at the time of the examination. </p>
<p>My mind always goes blank during an examination. </p>
<p>This mark ruined my prospect of getting a scholarship. </p>
<p>This is the only course in which I received a poor grade </p>
<p>This mark grieved my mother (or Father). whose pride I am. </p>
<p>Conditions in the room were not conductive to concentration. </p>
<p>The examination was unfair and unfairly distributed over the subject </p>
<p>I have to work after school and nights; therefore I should be given a break. </p>
<p>I am married; therefore, I should be given a break. </p>
<p>I would have done much better if I had taken the examination give to one of the other sections. </p>
<p>Several people around me copied from my paper during the examination yet they received higher marks than I did. Surely this is not fair. </p>
<p>The reason I did not do better is because I am very honest. I do no wish to say anything against any other members of the class. </p>
<p>I know many of the class members who do not work as hard as I do an who got a better grade. I am recognized among my classmates as a good student - you just ask any one of them. </p>
<p>The question were ambiguous, and therefore, my answers should be graded according to the reasonable interpretations that I made of your questions. </p>
<p>Many of the questions could not be answered with straight facts; they were matters of opinion. I do not believe I should be penalize just because my opinions differ from those of the instructor. </p>
<p>I have studied this subject from the broad philosophical viewpoint and therefore, I was unable to answer your technical-based question </p>
<p>I am philosophically oriented to the realm of ideas; I respond to the sweep and scope of great intellects. My work is beyond the interest in petty details and parrot-like memorizing of those who are merely students </p>
<p>At the time of the exam, I was suffering from a severe case of cognitive dissonance and was incapable of coping with the stress of the hour. </p>
<p>It is not a higher mark I seek; I care nothing about marks; I think marks are wicked and I disapprove of them. However, this pernicious system of which I am a victim requires marks for achieving success and therefore, I seek a higher mark. </p>

18219,"<p>Two high school sweethearts who went out together for four years<br /> in high school were both virgins; they enjoyed losing their<br /> virginity to each other in 10th grade. When they graduated, they<br /> wanted both to go to the same college but, the girl was accepted<br /> to a college on the East Coast, and the guy went to a college on<br /> the West Coast. They agreed to be faithful to each other and to<br /> spend anytime they could together. </p>
<p>As time went on, the guy would call the girl and she would never<br /> be home, and when he wrote, she would take weeks to return the<br /> letters. Even when he emailed her, she took days to return his<br /> messages. </p>
<p>Finally, she confessed to him that she wanted to date around. He<br /> didn't take this very well and increased his calls, letters, and<br /> emails trying to win back her love. She soon became very annoyed<br /> with his persistence and now with a new boyfriend, she wanted to<br /> get him off her back. </p>
<p>So, what she did is this: she took a Polaroid picture of her<br /> sucking her new boyfriend's unmentionables and sent it to her<br /> old boyfriend with a note reading, ""I found a new boyfriend,<br /> leave me alone."" </p>
<p>Well, needless to say, this guy was heartbroken but, even more<br /> so, he was pissed. So, what he did next was awesome. </p>
<p>He wrote on the back of the photo the following, ""Dear Mom and<br /> Dad, having a great time at college, please send more money!""<br /> and mailed the picture to her parents.</p>

Oh please, oh please, oh please, let me have that ability, It'd be so great! When I'm working in the garden or naming the animals, I could just stand there and let it fly.

Oh please God, let it be me who you give that gift to, let me stand and pee, oh please...On and on he went like an excited little boy who had to pee. Eve just smiled and told God that if Adam really wanted that so badly, that he should have it. It seemed to be the sort of thing that would make him happy and she really wouldn't mind if Adam were the one given this ability.And so Adam was given the ability to control the direction of his misdirection while in a vertical position. And so, he was happy and did celebrate by wetting down the bark on the tree nearest him, laughing with delight all the while.

18249,"<p>A man with a winking problem is applying for a position as a sales<br /> representative for a large firm. The interviewer looks over his papers and says,<br /> ""This is phenomenal. You've graduated from the best schools; your<br /> recommendations are wonderful, and your experience is unparalleled. Normally,<br /> we'd hire you without a second thought. However, a sales representative has a<br /> highly visible position, and we're afraid that your constant winking will scare<br /> off potential customers. I'm sorry...we can't hire you.""</p>
<p>""But wait,"" he said. ""If I take two aspirin, I'll stop winking!""</p>
<p>""Really? Great! Show me!""</p>
<p>So the applicant reaches into his jacket pocket and begins pulling out all<br /> sorts of condoms: red condoms, blue condoms, ribbed condoms, flavored condoms;<br /> finally, at the bottom, he finds a packet of aspirin. He tears it open, swallows<br /> the pills, and stops winking.</p>
<p>""Well,"" said the interviewer, ""that's all well and good, but this is a<br /> respectable company, and we will not have our employees womanizing all over the<br /> country!""</p>
<p>""Womanizing? What do you mean? I'm a happily married man!""</p>

She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking.After becoming very frustrated with the ""no haggle"" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, ""Maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!"" The shopkeeper said, ""By all means, be my guest. Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!"" Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.Later in the day, the shopkeeper is driving home, when he spots the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he sees a huge 9 foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She takes aim, kills the creature and with a great deal of effort hauls it on to the swamp bank. Lying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watches in amazement. Just then the blonde flips the alligator on its back, and frustrated, shouts out, ""Damn it, this one isn't wearing any shoes either!""</p>

18258,"<p>Tale 1: ""I was watching the local news this morning when the<br /> anchor reported that the police had arrested two suspects for an<br /> extremely brutal murder in our area. The reporter stood there<br /> with a straight face and said that the District Attorney's<br /> office was going for the death penalty because they had proof<br /> that the victim was alive just moments before his death.""</p>
<p>Tale 2: I bought a microphone for singing, which I returned to<br /> the store after trying it out (according to their policy). The<br /> salesperson asked me why I was returning it, and I told her that<br /> I was returning it because it didn't work properly. She<br /> responded, ""Did you open it?""</p>
<p>Tale 3: One day my (now ex-) wife called the Help Desk at the<br /> hospital that I worked at to tell them that I had left my pager<br /> at home that day. She was not sure where I was at the time, and<br /> figured the Help Desk would track me down to tell me to go home<br /> to get my pager. The Help Desk paged me with the Help Desk<br /> extension displayed.</p>
<p>She then called the Help Desk again, and told them that the<br /> pager was in her hand, and that paging me was pointless, since<br /> it was not on my person. They paged me again, with my home<br /> number, to tell me that my wife had my pager.</p>
<p>Tale 4: I am a reference librarian. I had an Induhvidual come up<br /> to me yesterday wanting help finding Internet sites for her<br /> class project. She found the perfect site the day before, but<br /> being an Induhvidual, did not bookmark it or write down the URL.<br /> So, the question I got was, ""I need to find that web page with a<br /> yellow background that I found on this computer yesterday.""</p>
<p>Tale 5: I recently had trouble with my cellular service. I<br /> called the Support Hotline and waited thirty minutes for a human<br /> response. The tech asked the make and model of my phone. I<br /> informed the tech that I could see no model number on the phone.<br /> He said, ""Take the battery off and look inside. The model number<br /> is printed there."" I said if I take the battery out, I'll lose<br /> the connection. He said, ""That's okay. I'll hold.""</p>
<p>Tale 6: A customer called me the other day to complain that the<br /> contract delivery people had scratched her countertop, and that<br /> the delivery company would not accept the damage claim because<br /> the customer's maid had signed a form stating the damage was<br /> pre-existing. The customer told me her maid Maria neither read<br /> nor wrote English and would not have realized what it was she<br /> was signing. When I called the delivery company to press home<br /> this point, they replied, ""The maid must have known what she was<br /> signing because she signed her name in English"".</p>
<p>At that point I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Tale 7: There's this Induhvidual in my office who got a new PC<br /> that has a blank-screen screensaver that comes up after about<br /> twenty minutes without activity. Returning from lunch the first<br /> day, he was aghast to find his monitor ""not working."" So he gave<br /> it the good old-fashioned whack on the side. Lo and behold, the<br /> vibrations carried to the mouse and his monitor ""worked""!!</p>
<p>Now, every day, on returning from lunch, he fixes the ""loose<br /> connection"" in his monitor with a whack.</p>

Stumped, frustrated and running out of time, he searched  his mind for a fifth reason.

18282,"<p>There was this little guy sitting in a bar, drinking, minding his  own business when all of a sudden this great big dude comes  in and --WHACK!!-- knocks him off the bar stool and onto the  floor. The idiot says, 'That was a karate chop from Korea.'The little guy thinks 'GEEZ,' but he gets back up on the stool  and starts drinking again when all of a sudden --WHACK-- the  big dude knocks him down AGAIN and says, 'That was a judo  chop from Japan.' So the little guy has had enough of this. He gets up, brushes himself off and quietly leaves. The little guy is gone for an hour or so when he returned.  Without saying a word, he walks up behind the big idiot and  *WHACK*  bangs the big dude off his stool, knocking him out  cold!!!The little guy looks at the bartender and says, 'When he  comes to, tell him that is a crowbar from Sears.'</p>

18286,"<p>Q. What does HMO stand for?A. This is actually a variation of the phrase, ""Hey, Moe!"" Its roots go back to a concept pioneered by Doctor Moe Howard, who discovered that a patient could be made to forget about the pain in his foot if he was poked hard enough in the eyes. Modern practice replaces the physical finger poke with hi-tech equivalents such as voice mail and referral slips, but the result remains the same.Q. Do all diagnostic procedures require pre-certification?A. No. Only those you need.Q. I just joined a new HMO. How difficult will it be to choose the doctor I want?A. Just slightly more difficult than choosing your parents. Your insurer will provide you with a book listing all the doctors who were participating in the plan at the time the information was gathered. These doctors basically fall into two categories -- those who are no longer accepting new patients, and those who will see you but are no longer part of the plan. But don't worry -- the remaining doctor who is still in the plan and accepting new patients has an office just a half day's drive away!Q. What are pre-existing conditions?A. This is a phrase used by the grammatically challenged when they want to talk about existing conditions. Unfortunately, we appear to be pre-stuck with it.Q. Well, can I get coverage for my pre-existing conditions?A. Certainly, as long as they don't require any treatment.Q. What happens if I want to try alternative forms of medicine?A. You'll need to find alternative forms of payment.Q. My pharmacy plan only covers generic drugs, but I need the name brand. I tried the generic medication, but it gave me a stomach ache. What should I do?A. Poke yourself in the eye.Q. I have an 80/20 plan with a $200 deductible and a $2,000 yearly cap. My insurer reimbursed the doctor for my out-patient surgery, but I'd already paid my bill. What should I do?A. You have two choices. Your doctor can sign the reimbursement check over to you, or you can ask him to invest the money for you in one of those great offers that only doctors and dentists hear about, like windmill farms or frog hatcheries.Q. What should I do if I get sick while traveling?A. Try sitting in a different part of the bus.Q. No, I mean what if I'm away from home and I get sick?A. You really shouldn't do that. You'll have a hard time seeing your primary care physician. It's best to wait until you return, and then get sick.Q. I think I need to see a specialist, but my doctor insists he can handle my problem. Can a general practitioner really perform a heart transplant right in his office?A. Hard to say, but considering that all you're risking is the $10 co-payment, there's no harm giving him a shot at it.Q. What accounts for the largest portion of health care costs?A. Doctors trying to recoup their investment losses.Q. Will health care be any different in the next century?A. No, but if you call right now, you might get an appointment by then.</p>

18296,"<p>In a certain suburban neighborhood, there were two brothers, 8 and 10 years old, who were exceedingly mischievous. Whatever went wrong in the neighborhood, it turned out they had had a hand in it. Their parents were at their wit's end trying to control them. Hearing about a priest nearby who worked with delinquent boys, the mother suggested to the father that they ask the priest to talk with the boys. </p>
<p>The father replied, ""Sure, do that before I kill them!"" </p>
<p>The mother went to the priest and made her request. He agreed, but said he wanted to see the younger boy first and alone. So the mother sent him to the priest. </p>
<p>The priest sat the boy down across a huge, impressive desk he sat behind. </p>
<p>For about five minutes they just sat and stared at each other. Finally, the priest pointed his forefinger at the boy and asked, ""Where is God?"" </p>
<p>The boy looked under the desk, in the corners of the room, all around, but said nothing. </p>
<p>Again, louder, the priest pointed at the boy and asked, ""Where is God?"" </p>
<p>Again the boy looked all around but said nothing. A third time, in a louder, firmer voice, the priest leaned far across the desk and put his forefinger almost to the boy's nose, and asked, ""Where is God?""</p>
<p>The boy panicked and ran all the way home. Finding his older brother, he dragged him upstairs to their room and into the closet, where they usually plotted their mischief. </p>

18321,"<p>A blonde walks into a shoe shop looking for some crocodile shoes<br /> at rediculous prices.<br /> The blonde eyes a pair and waves for the<br /> manager of the shop to come over.""I want these shoes for half<br /> price,"" she said flatly.""I'm sorry madam, but there are no sales<br /> on today,"" said the manager.""well fine,""she said.""Ill go and get<br /> my own pair."" And she took off with a ""HUMPH!""<br /> The manager was<br /> driving home that afternoon and saw the blonde in Lake<br /> Crocodile. She was standing there with a rifle in her hand, her<br /> dress rolled up, and at least 15 crocks lined up on the side. He<br /> got out and sttod next to his car to catch the blonde firing the<br /> rifle madly.<br /> Suddenly, she dragged a huge crock out of the<br /> water. She put it on the bank, turned it over and screamed out<br /> in fury.""THIS ONE ISNT WEARING SHOES EITHER!""</p>

18326,"<p>A city man was tooling down a country road when his car sputtered to a complete stop near a field filled with cows. The driver, getting out to see what was the matter, noticed one of the cows looking at him. </p>
<p>""I believe it's your radiator,"" said the cow. </p>
<p>The man nearly jumped right out of his city slicker britches! He ran to the nearest farmhouse and knocked on the door. </p>
<p>""A cow just gave me advice about my car!"" he shouted, waving his arms franticly back toward the field.</p>
<p>The farmer nonchalantly leaned out beyond the door frame to glance down the field. ""The cow with two big black spots on it?"" the farmer asked slowly. </p>
<p>""Yes! Yes! That's the one!"" the excited man replied. </p>
<p>""Oh. Well, that's Ethel,"" the farmer said, turning back to the man. ""Don't pay any attention to her. She doesn't know a thing about cars.""</p>

18329,"<p>The brash young gynecologist, fresh out of medical school, took one look at his voluptuous new patient and abandoned his professional ethics entirely.  As he stroked the supple skin of her naked body, he asked, ""Do you understand what I am doing?""</p>
<p>""Yes,"" the patient answered.<br /> ""You're checking for dermatological abrasions.<br /> ""Correct,"" the doctor lied.</p>
<p>Next, he fondled her breasts long and lovingly.<br /> Again, he inquired, ""Do you understand what I am doing?""<br /> ""You're feeling for cancerous lumps,"" she ventured.</p>
<p>""Very astute,"" the doctor complimented, getting more excited. He placed the woman's feet in stirrups, dropped his pants, and slipped his member inside her. </p>
<p>""And do you understand what I am doing now?""<br /> ""All too well,"" the patient shot back. ""You're contracting herpes!""</p>

All you need to do is tell it what you want to listen to, and you<br /> will hear exactly that!""<br /> She drove out, somewhat amazed and a little confused. She looked at the radio<br /> and said, ""Nelson."" The radio responded, ""Ricky or Willie?"" She was astounded.<br /> If she wanted Beethoven, that's what she got. If she wanted Nat King Cole, she<br /> got it.<br /> She was stopped at a traffic light enjoying ""On The Road Again"" when the light<br /> turned green and she pulled out. Suddenly an enormous sports utility vehicle<br /> coming from the street she was crossing sped toward her, obviously not paying<br /> attention to the light.

18346,"<p>A woman who was a science fiction fan had all of her checks personalized with Star Wars character Han Solo (Harrison Ford) saying his famous line -- 'I've got a bad feeling about this'.  Lots of people complimented her on how cool the checks were.  When those checks had all been used up, she had tired of Star Wars and ordered new checks with religious scenes from the Bible that the same company was offering. Unfortunately, the Bible checks had room for a quote on them as well.Some faceless computer or person on the company production line must have figured that she wanted to keep the same quote that she used before. Well.....  NOW her checks have:   Moses parting the Red Sea saying:       'I've got a bad feeling about this',   David stands in front of Goliath saying:       'I've got a bad feeling about this'    Noah is building his ark, also saying       'I've got a bad feeling about this'.   Moses coming down off Mt. Sinai with the ten commandments saying:       'I've got a bad feeling about this'.    Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden captioned:      'I've got a bad feeling about this'. Can you just imagine the reaction she gets now when she writes a check?</p>

18350,"<p>The 5 toughest questions that women ask men, and the answers...</p>
<p>The questions are:<br /> 1.     What are you thinking about?<br /> 2.     Do you love me?<br /> 3.     Do I look fat?<br /> 4.     Do you think she is prettier than me?<br /> 5.     What would you do if I died?</p>
<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e., tells the truth).  Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible responses.</p>
<p>Question # 1: What are you thinking about?<br /> The proper answer to this, of course, is: ""I'm sorry if I've been<br /> pensive, dear.  I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful,<br /> thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to<br /> have met you."" This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which most likely is one of the following:<br /> a.     Baseball.<br /> b.     Football.<br /> c.     How fat you are.<br /> d.     How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e.     How I would spend the insurance money if you died.<br /> (Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, ""If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!"")</p>
<p>Question # 2: Do you love me?<br /> The proper response is: ""YES!"" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in order, ""Yes, dear."" Inappropriate responses include:<br /> A.     I suppose so.<br /> B.     Would it make you feel better if I said yes?<br /> C.     That depends on what you mean by love.<br /> D.     Does it matter?<br /> E.     Who, me?</p>
<p>Question # 3: Do I look fat?<br /> The correct answer is an emphatic: ""Of course not!"" Among the incorrect answers are:<br /> A.     Compared to what?<br /> B.     I wouldn't call you fat, but you're not exactly thin.<br /> C.     A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> D.     I've seen fatter.<br /> E.     Could you repeat the question?  I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>Question # 4: Do you think she's prettier than me?<br /> Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: ""Of course not!""<br /> Incorrect responses include:<br /> A.  Yes, but you have a better personality<br /> b.  Not prettier, but definitely thinner<br /> c.  Not as pretty as you when you were her age<br /> d.  Define pretty<br /> e.  Could you repeat the question?  I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.</p>
<p>Question# 5: What would you do if I died?<br /> A definite no-win question. (The real answer, or course, is ""Buy a<br /> Corvette."") No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an<br /> hour of follow-up questions, usually along the these lines:</p>
<p>Woman:  Would you get married again?<br /> Man:    Definitely not!<br /> W:      Why not, don't you like being married?<br /> M:      Of course I do.<br /> W:      Then why wouldn't you remarry?<br /> M:      Okay, I'd get married again.<br /> W:      You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)<br /> M:      Yes, I would.<br /> W:      Would you sleep with her in our bed?<br /> M:      Where else would we sleep?<br /> W:      Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her?<br /> M:      That would seem like the proper thing to do.<br /> W:      And would you let her use my golf clubs?<br /> M:      Of course not, Dear. She's left-handed.</p>

18351,"<p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger is a US radio personality who dispenses advice to people who call in to her radio show. Recently, she said that, as an observant orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22, and cannot be condoned under any circumstance.</p>
<p>The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a US resident, Jim, which was posted on the Internet. It's funny, as<br /> well as informative:</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Laura:</p>
<p>Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend<br /> the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.</p>
<p>I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other<br /> specific laws and how to follow them.</p>
<p>1. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord-Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?</p>
<p>2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?</p>
<p>3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual cleanliness-Lev.15:19-24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.</p>
<p>4. Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and<br /> female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?</p>
<p>5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?</p>
<p>6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an<br /> abomination-Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?</p>
<p>7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?</p>
<p>8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?</p>
<p>9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?</p>
<p>10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)</p>
<p>I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.</p>
<p>Your devoted fan,<br /> Jim.</p>

So its leaders sent a message to the great hunter, Jonesie, to come and kill the beast.For several nights the hunter lay in wait for the lion, but it never appeared. Finally, he told the village chief to kill a cow and give him its hide. Draping the skin over his shoulders, he went to the pasture to wait for the lion.In the middle of the night, the villagers woke to the sound of blood-curdling shrieks coming from the pasture. As they carefully approached, they saw the hunter on the ground, groaning in pain. There was no sign of the lion.""What happened, Jonesie? Where is the lion?"" asked the chief.""Forget the damn lion!"" he howled. ""Which one of you idiots let the bull loose?""</p>

18361,"<p>Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out<br /> section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest<br /> fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete<br /> with scuba tanks on his back, flippers, and facemask. A<br /> post-mortem revealed tthat the person died not from burns, but<br /> from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a<br /> positive identification. Investigators then set about to<br /> determine how a fully clad diver ended up in the middle of a<br /> forest fire. It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the<br /> person went for a diving trip off the coast some 20 miles from<br /> the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as<br /> quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very<br /> large dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and then<br /> flown to the forest fire and emptied. You guessed it. One minute<br /> our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next he<br /> was doing the breaststroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the<br /> air. Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'10"" of the fire. Some<br /> days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed. </p>

18387,"<p>One day at a busy airport, the passengers on a commercial airliner are seated waiting for the pilot to show up so they can get under way.The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle. Both appear to be blind; the pilot is using a white cane, bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle. The copilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered with sunglasses.At first, the passengers do not react thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke. After a few minutes though, the engines start revving, and the airplane begins moving down the runway.The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness. They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance.Yet, the plane starts accelerating rapidly, and people begin panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical.When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once. At the very last moment, the plane lifts off and is airborne.Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: ""You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream, and we aren't going to know when to take off!""</p>

You are invited to write a poem or compose a modern dance about your personal relationship with your light bulb (or light source, or non-dark resource), and present it next month at our annual light bulb Sunday service, in which we explore a number of light bulb traditions, including incandescent, fluorescent, three-way, long-life, and tinted all of which are equally valid paths to luminescence."" </p>
<p>12. How many Amish does it take to change a light bulb? ""What light bulb?"" </p>
<p>13. How many youth Pastors does it take to change a light bulb? Youth pastors aren't around long enough for a light bulb to burn out. </p>
<p>14. How many Southern Baptists does it take to change a light bulb? 109. Seven on the Light Bulb Task Force Sub-committee who report to the 12 on the Light Bulb Task Force, appointed by the 15 on the Trustee Board. Their recommendation is reviewed by the Finance Committee Executive of 5, who place it on the agenda of the 18 member Finance committee. If they approve, they bring a motion to the 27 member Church Board, who appoint another 12 member review committee. If they recommend that the Church Board proceed, a resolution is brought to the Congregational Business Meeting. They appoint another 8 member review committee. If their report to the next Congregational Business Meeting supports the changing of the light bulb, and the congregation votes in favor, the responsibility to carry out the light bulb change is passed on to the Trustee Board, who in turn appoint a 7 member committee to find the best price on new light bulbs. Their recommendation of which hardware store has the best buy must then be reviewed by the 23 member Ethics Committee to make certain that this hardware store has no connections to Disneyland. They report back to the Trustee Board who then commissions the Trustee in charge of the janitor to ask him to make the change. By then the janitor discovers that one more light bulb has burned out.</p>

18409,"<p>A truck driver used to amuse himself by running over lawyers he would see walking down the side of the road. (As he'd had a bad time in divorce court recently, and blamed the lawyers.) Every time he would see a lawyer walking along the road, he would swerve to hit him, and there would be a loud ""THUMP"" and then he would swerve back on the road.</p>
<p>One day, as the truck driver was driving along he saw a priest hitch hiking. He thought he would do a good turn and pulled the truck over.</p>
<p>He asked the priest, ""Where are you going, Father?"".</p>
<p>""I'm going to the church 5 miles down the road!"", replied the priest.</p>
<p>""No problem, Father! I'll give you a lift. Climb in the truck"".</p>
<p>The happy priest climbed into the passenger seat and the truck driver continued down the road. Suddenly the truck driver saw a lawyer walking down the road and instinctively he swerved to hit him. But then he remembered there was a priest in the truck with him, so at the last minute he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the lawyer. However even though he was certain he missed the lawyer, he still heard a loud ""THUD"". Not understanding where the noise came from he glanced in his mirrors and when he didn't see anything, he turned to the priest and said, ""I'm sorry Father. I almost hit that lawyer"".</p>
<p>""That's okay"", replied the priest. ""I got him with the door!</p>

18419,"<p>Bob Hill and his new wife Betty were vacationing in Europe, as it happens, near Transylvania. They were driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It was late, and raining very hard. Bob could barely see 20 feet in front of the car.</p>
<p>Suddenly the car skids out of control! Bob attempts to control the car, but to no avail! The car swerves and smashes into a tree. Moments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees his wife unconscious, with her head bleeding! Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to carry her to the nearest phone.</p>
<p>Bob carefully picks his wife up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light. He heads towards the light, which is coming from an old, large house. He approaches the door and knocks. A minute passes. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob immediately blurts, ""Hello, my name is Bob Hill, and this is my wife Betty. We've been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone?""</p>
<p>""I'm sorry,"" replied the hunchback, ""but we don't have a phone. My master is a doctor; come in and I will get him!""</p>
<p>Bob brings his wife in. An elegant man comes down the stairs. ""I'm afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had a basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory.""</p>
<p>With that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. After a brief examination, Igor's master looks worried.</p>
<p>""Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion."" Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more.</p>
<p>The Hills' deaths upset Igor's master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. For it is here that he has always found solace. He begins to play, and a stirring, almost haunting, melody fills the house.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty's hand twitch, keeping time to the haunting piano music. Stunned, he watches as Bob's arm begins to rise, marking the beat! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! Unable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: ""Master, Master! The Hills are alive with the sound of music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""</p>

18430,"<p>Seems God was just about done creating the universe, had a couple of left-over things left in his bag of creations, so he stopped by to visit Adam and Eve in the Garden. He told the couple that one of the things he had to give away was the ability to stand up and pee. ""It's a very handy thing,"" God told the couple who he found hanging around under an apple tree. ""I was wondering if either one of you wanted that ability."" Adam popped a cork. Jumped up and begged, ""Oh, give that to me! I'd love to be able to do that! It seems the sort of thing a Man should do. Oh please, oh please, oh please, let me have that ability. It'd be so great! When I'm working in the garden or naming the animals, I could just let it rip, I'd be so cool. Oh please God let it be me who you give that gift to, let me stand and pee, oh please........."" On and on he went like an excited little boy (who had to pee). Eve just smiled and shook her head at the display. She told God that if Adam really wanted it so badly, and it sure seemed to be the sort of thing that would make him happy, she really wouldn't mind if Adam were the one given the ability to stand up and pee. And so it was. And it was...well, good. ""Fine,"" God said, looking back into his bag of left-over gifts. ""What's left here? Oh yes, multiple orgasms...""</p>

<p>8. You have too many shoes.<br /> R: Well in order to ""look fine"" in everything we wear we have to<br /> have a matching pair with every outfit.</p>

<p>10. Your brother is an idiot, your ex-boyfriend is an idiot and<br /> your Dad probably is too.<br /> R: Our brothers are related, they must have some intelligence.<br /> Yes our ex-boyfriends are idiots, why else would we have dumped<br /> them? My father IS an idiot, he gave YOU permission to marry me.</p>
<p>11. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers.<br /> R: That depends on the question.</p>
<p>12. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a<br /> doctor.<br /> R: It's a waste of $$. He'll only tell me to make you turn down<br /> the damn T.V.</p>
<p>13. Nothing says 'I love you' like a blowjob in the morning.<br /> R: Again, do it yourself. If your dick isn't big enough your not<br /> my boyfriend.</p>
<p>14. Don't give us 50 rules when 25 will do.<br /> R: Don't do 50 things wrong and there won't be 50 rules.</p>
<p>15. Don't fake it. We'd rather be ineffective than deceived.<br /> R: if we stopped faking, you'd tell us you'd rather be deceived<br /> than ineffective.</p>
<p>16. It is neither your interest nor ours to take the quiz<br /> together.<br /> R: If I brought it up its in my interest.</p>
<p>17. Anything we said 6 or 8 months ago is inadmissible in an<br /> argument. All comments become null and void after 7 days.<br /> R: If we followed that rule then we would lose all the fights<br /> like you.</p>
<p>18. If you don't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't<br /> expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br /> R: If we dressed like Victoria's Secret then it would no longer<br /> be a secret.</p>
<p>19. Let us ogle. If we don't look at other women, how can we<br /> know how pretty you are?<br /> R: Here is how. You stop looking at other women and we'll SHOW<br /> you and let you EXPERIENCE our true beauty.</p>
<p>20. Don't rub the lamp if you don't want the genie to come out.<br /> R: Who said we didn't want the genie to come out?</p>
<p>21. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say<br /> during commercials.<br /> R: How about turning off the damn T.V. and making eye contact<br /> with us for 10 minutes?</p>

<p>24. When we're turning the wheel and the car is nosing onto the<br /> off-ramp, you saying, ""This is our exit,"" is not strictly<br /> necessary.<br /> R: Your right its not. Only a blonde would say that. Because we<br /> all know that it isn't the exit you really want.</p>
<p>25. Nothing says 'I love you' quite like a blowjob in the<br /> morning.<br /> R: Again, do it yourself, if you dick isn't long enough your not<br /> my boyfriend.</p>

""Yes,<br /> I'm more than well aware of this,"" replied the man with a great<br /> big grin on his face, ""but let me tell you, with her thinking<br /> that coat was hers, I had the weekend of my life!""</p>

<p>I gasped at the thought and started to grouse,<br /> Then turned my head sideways and clicked on my mouse.<br /> When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br /> My Mac jumped to a page that wasn't quite clear.</p>
<p>When the image resolved, so bright and so quick,<br /> I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick!<br /> More rapid than mainframes, more graphics they came,<br /> Then Nick glanced toward my screen, my Mac called them by name;</p>
<p>""Now Compaq! Now Acer!"", my speaker did reel;<br /> ""On Apple! On Gateway!"" Santa started to squeal!<br /> ""Jump onto the circuits! And into the chip!<br /> Now speed it up! Speed it up! Make this thing hip!""</p>
<p>The screen gave a flicker, he was into my ""Ram"",<br /> Then into my room rose a full hologram!<br /> He was dressed in all red, from his head to his shoes,<br /> Which were black (the white socks he really should lose).</p>
<p>He pulled out some discs he had stored in his backpack.<br /> Santa looked like a dude who was rarin' to hack!<br /> His eyes, how they twinkled! His glasses, how techno!<br /> This ain't the same Santa that I used to know!</p>
<p>With a wink of his eye and a nod of his head,<br /> Santa soon let me know I had nothing to dread.<br /> He spoke not a word, gave my Mac a quick poke,<br /> And accessed my C drive with only a stroke.</p>
<p>He defragged my hard drive, and added a ""Dimm"",<br /> Then threw in some cool games, just on a whim!<br /> He worked without noise, his fingers they flew!<br /> He distorted some pictures with Kai's Power Goo!</p>
<p>He updated Office, Excel and Quicken,<br /> Then added a screensaver with a red clucking chicken!<br /> My eyes widened a bit, my mouth stood agape,<br /> As he added the latest version of Netscape.</p>
<p>The drive gave a whirl, as if it were pleased,<br /> St. Nick coyly smiled, the computer appeased.<br /> Then placing his finger on the bridge of his nose,<br /> Santa turned into nothing but ones and zeros!</p>
<p>He flew back into my screen and through my uplink,<br /> Back into the net with barely a blink.<br /> But I heard his sweet voice as he flew from my sight,<br /> ""Happy surfing to all, and to all a good byte!""</p>
<p>Merry Xmas to you all !!!</p>

<p>The woman reporter shouted out ""This just in! A man is at the edge of a cliff attempting to jump!"". Then the red-head leans over to the blonde and whispers, ""I bet you $50 that the man's gonna jump!"" The blonde responds back ""That's a bet you have there!"". </p>
<p>So, both of the woman stared at the news waiting to know whats gonna happen. Then, the man jumps! The blonde turns around to the red-head and hands her the $50. The red-head feeling guilty said ""I cant take that there money. I saw the news earlier this mornin', i knew he was gonna jump off that there cliff."" </p>
<p>And the blonde says ""Well, i did too! But i never would have thought that the man would do it again!""</p>

<p>""Ah. So what about candles after they are burnt? What do you do<br /> with the drippings?""</p>

"
18492,"<p>The recent announcement that Donner and Blitzen have elected to take the early reindeer retirement package has triggered a good deal of concern about whether they will be replaced and about other restructuring decisions at the North Pole.<br /> Streamlining was appropriate in view of the reality that the North Pole no longer dominates the season's gift distribution business. Home shopping channels and mail order catalogues have diminished Santa's market share, and he could not sit idly by and permit further erosion of the profit picture. </p>
<p>The reindeer downsizing was made possible through the purchase of a late model Japanese sled for the CEO's annual trip. Improved productivity from Dasher and Dancer, who summered at the Harvard Business School, is anticipated and should take up the slack with no discernible loss of service. Reduction in reindeer will also lessen airborne environmental emissions for which the North Pole has been cited and received unfavorable press. </p>
<p>I am pleased to inform you and yours that Rudolph's role will not be disturbed. Tradition still counts for something at the North Pole. Management denies, in the strongest possible language, the earlier leak that Rudolph's nose got that way not from the cold, but from substance abuse. Calling Rudolph ""a lush who was into the sauce and never did pull his share of the load"" was an unfortunate comment, made by one of Santa's helpers and taken out of context at a time of year when he is known to be under executive stress. </p>
<p>As a further restructuring, today's global challenges require the North Pole to continue to look for better, more competitive steps. Effective immediately, the following economy measures are to take place in the ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" subsidiary: </p>
<p>The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree never turned out to be the cash crop forecasted. It will be replaced by a plastic hanging plant, providing considerable savings in maintenance. </p>
<p>The two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not cost effective. In addition, their romance during working hours could not be condoned. The positions are therefore eliminated. </p>
<p>The three French hens will remain intact. After all, everyone loves the French. </p>
<p>The four calling birds were replaced by an automated voice mail system, with a call waiting option. An analysis is underway to determine who the birds have been calling, how often and how long they talked. </p>
<p>The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of Directors. Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could have negative implications for institutional investors. Diversification into other precious metals as well as a mix of T-Bills and high technology stocks appears to be in order. </p>
<p>The six geese-a-laying constitute a luxury which can no longer be afforded. It has long been felt that the production rate of one egg per goose per day is an example of the decline in productivity. Three geese will be let go, and an upgrading in the selection procedure by personnel will assure management that from now on every goose it gets will be a good one. </p>
<p>The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in better times. Their function is primarily decorative. Mechanical swans are on order. The current swans will be retrained to learn some new strokes and therefore enhance their outplacement. </p>
<p>As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under heavy scrutiny by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the workforce is being sought. The more militant maids consider this a dead-end job with no upward mobility. Automation of the process may permit the maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring or a-mulching. </p>
<p>Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number. This function will be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no longer do the steps. </p>
<p>Ten lords-a-leaping is overkill. The high cost of lords plus the expense of international air travel prompted the compensation committee to suggest replacing this group with ten out-of-work congressmen. While leaping ability may be somewhat sacrificed, the savings are significant because we expect an oversupply of unemployed congressmen this year. </p>
<p>Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple case of the band getting too big. A substitution with a string quartet, a cutback on new music, and no uniforms will produce savings which will drop right down to the bottom line. </p>
<p>We can expect a substantial reduction in assorted people, fowl, animals, and other expenses. Though incomplete, studies indicate that stretching deliveries over twelve days is inefficient. If we can drop ship in one day, service levels will be improved. </p>
<p>Action is pending regarding the lawsuit filed by the attorneys' association seeking expansion to include the legal profession (""thirteen lawyers-a-suing""). </p>
<p>Lastly, it is not beyond consideration that deeper cuts may be necessary in the future to stay competitive. Should that happen, the Board will request management to scrutinize the Snow White Division to see if seven dwarfs is the right number. </p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

<p>In a bold move to privatize Social Security, President George W. Bush today put all of the program's funds under the control of former Education Secretary William Bennett, urging Mr. Bennett to ""work your magic"" on the nation's nest egg. </p>
<p>Recognizing that many retirees are nervous about the privatization of America's retirement system, Mr. Bush reassured them today, stating flatly, ""Bill Bennett is a safe bet.""</p>
<p>""I have known Bill Bennett for many years,"" Mr. Bush told reporters.  ""This is a man who knows when to hold 'em and knows when to fold 'em.""</p>

<p>During the past year, I have attempted to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of only once every 10 days. The following is a list of why I didn't succeed more often:</p>
<p>We will wake the kids - 54 times</p>
<p>It's too late - 15 times</p>
<p>I'm too tired - 42 times</p>
<p>It's too early - 12 times</p>
<p>It's too hot - 18 times</p>
<p>Pretending to be asleep - 31 times</p>
<p>The neighbors will hear - 9 times</p>
<p>Headache or backache - 26 times</p>
<p>Sunburn - 10 times</p>
<p>Your mother will hear us - 9 times</p>
<p>Not in the mood - 21 times</p>
<p>Watching the late show - 17 times</p>
<p>Too sore - 26 times</p>
<p>New hairdo - 6 times</p>
<p>Wrong time of the month - 14 times</p>
<p>You had to go to the bathroom - 19 times</p>
<p>Of the 36 times that I DID succeed, the result was not always satisfying because 6 times you just laid there, 8 times you reminded me that there was a crack in the ceiling, 4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with, 7 times I had to wake you up to tell you I was finished, and once I was afraid that I had hurt you because you started thrashing around and breathing heavy. Let's try to improve </p>
<p>this, shall we??Love, Your Hubby</p>
<p>**********************</p>
<p>To My Dearest Husband,</p>
<p>I think things are a little confused. Here are the REAL reasons you didn't get more than you did this past year:</p>
<p>Came home drunk and tried to screw the cat - 23 times</p>
<p>Did not come home at all - 36 times</p>
<p>Did not come - 21 times</p>
<p>Came too soon - 38 times</p>
<p>Went soft before you got it in - 19 times</p>
<p>Cramps in your leg - 16 times</p>
<p>Working too late - 33 times</p>
<p>You had a rash, probably from a toilet seat - 29 times</p>
<p>Caught yourself in your zipper - 15 times</p>
<p>You had a cold and your nose kept running - 21 times</p>
<p>You had burned your tongue on hot coffee - 9 times</p>
<p>You had a splinter in your finger - 11 times</p>
<p>You lost the notion after thinking about it - 42 times</p>
<p>Came in your pajamas after reading a dirty book - 16 times</p>
<p>The reason I laid still was because you had missed me and were screwing the sheet. You seemed to be having a good time and I didn't want to move and spoil it for you. I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling. What I said was, ""Would you like me on my back or kneeling?"" The time I was thrashing around and gasping was when you farted and I was fighting for air. Maybe you can work on your ""shortcomings?""</p>
<p>Love, Your Wife</p>

18526,"<p>One afternoon a man came home from work to find total mayhem in<br /> his family's house: Their four children were outside, still in<br /> their pajamas, playing in the mud, with empty food boxes and<br /> wrappers strewn all around the front yard. The door of his<br /> wife's car was open, as was the front door to the house.</p>
<p>Proceeding into the entry he found an even bigger mess: A lamp<br /> had been knocked over, and the throw rug was wadded against one<br /> wall. In the front room the TV was loudly blaring a cartoon<br /> channel, and the family room was strewn with toys and various<br /> items of clothing. In the kitchen, dishes filled the sink,<br /> breakfast food was spilled on the counter, dog food was spilled<br /> on the floor, a broken glass lay under the table, and a small<br /> pile of sand was spread by the back door.</p>
<p>He quickly headed up the stairs, stepping over toys and more<br /> piles of clothes, looking for his wife. He was worried she may<br /> be ill, or that something serious had happened. He found her<br /> lounging in the bedroom, still curled in the bed in her pajamas,<br /> reading a novel. She looked up at him, smiled, and asked how his<br /> day went.

18534,"<p>Our [softball] team usually puts the other woman at second base, where the<br /> maximum possible number of males can get there on short notice to help out in<br /> case of emergency.  As far as I can tell, our second basewoman is a pretty<br /> good baseball player, better than I am, anyway, but there's no way to know for<br /> sure<br /> because if the ball gets anywhere near her, a male comes barging over<br /> from, say, right field, to deal with it.  She's been on the team for three<br /> seasons now, but the males still don't trust her.  They know, deep in their<br /> souls, that if she had to choose between catching a fly ball and saving an<br /> infant's life, she<br /> probably would elect to save the infant's life, without ever considering<br /> whether there were men on base.  - Dave Barry, ""Sports Is A Drag""</p>

18537,"<p>One night a man decides to visit his local bar. He takes a seat and orders a beer. After polishing off his beer, he beckons the bartender over and says, �Betcha $20 I can bite my eye.� The bartender scoffs and accepts. The man then calmly removes his false eye and bites it. The bartender grudgingly forks over a twenty. Later that night, after a few more beers, the man wanders back to the bar and says rather drunkenly, �Hey barkeep, betcha another $20 I can bite my other eye.� Wanting to win back his money and seriously doubtful that the man has two false eyes, the bartender accepts. The man calmly removes his false teeth and bites his other eye. Scowling, the bartender hands over another twenty. The man leaves and wanders around the bar as he drinks a few more beers.He strolls back over to the bar, leaning on it, again and calls the bartender, �Hey, barkeep,� he burbles, �I'll give you a chance to win yer money back plus. Betcha $100 if you put a shot glass on that end of the bar, and I stood on this end, I could piss into it and not spill a drop.� The bartender eagerly accepts, knowing the feat to be impossible. The man wobbily climbs atop the bar, zips down his fly and promptly pisses all over the bar. He zips up, sits down, slaps the $100 on the bar and laughs uproarously. �What's so funny?� says the barkeep, �you just lost everything you won and more!� �Well,� giggles the man, �I just bet those guys over there $200 that I could piss all over your bar and you wouldn't get angry.�</p>

<p>The Frenchman was next up. After watching the Dutchman in horror he said smugly: ""Please fix two pillows to my back."" </p>
<p>But even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again and the Frenchman was soon led away whimpering loudly.</p>

You must remember, it is spring, ze air, ze flowers, Ah, L'amour!  Zis is very natural.'

After carefully examining the participants he drove calmly back to Henri and Jean, who were waiting at the station.

Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard 'c' will be dropped in favor of the 'k'. This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter.There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the troublesome 'ph' will be replaced with the 'f'. This will make words like 'fotograf' 20 percent shorter.In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling.

18628,"<p>Seems that when the Lord was creating the world, He called man over and bestowed upon him twenty years of normal sex life. Man was absolutely horrified...""Only twenty years of normal sex life?"" Yet, the Lord was adamant and insisted that Man could have no more than twenty years of normal sex life.Then, the Lord called the monkey and gave him twenty years.""But, I don't need twenty years, ""protested the monkey.""Ten years is plenty for me.""Man spoke up eagerly, ""Can I have the other ten years?"" The monkey graciously agreed.Then, the Lord called the lion and gave him twenty years. The lion, like the monkey, only wanted ten years.Again, man spoke up, ""can I have the other ten years?"" The lion graciously agreed.Then, along came a donkey and he too was given twenty years. But, like the others, ten years was more than sufficient. Once again, man pleaded, ""can I have the other ten years?""And so, it all makes perfect sense now... Man has twenty years of normal sex life, ten years of monkeying around, ten years of lion about it and ten years of making an ass of himself.</p>

18679,"<p>July 18 - I just tried to connect to America Online. I've heard it is the best online service I can get. They even included a free disk! I'd better hold onto it incase they don't ever send me anther one! I can't connect. I don't know what is wrong. </p>
<p>July 19 - Some guy at the tech support center says my computer needs a modem. I don't see why. He's just trying to cheat me. How dumb does he think I am? </p>
<p>July 22 - I bought the modem. I couldn't figure out where it goes. It wouldn't fit in the monitor or the printer. I'm confused. </p>
<p>July 23 - I finally got the modem in and hooked up. that nine year old next door did it for me. But it still don't work. I cant get online. </p>
<p>July 25 - That nine year old kid next door hooked me up to America Online for me. He's so smart. I told the kid he was a prodigy. But he says that's just another service. What a modest kid. He's so smart and he does these services for people. Anyway he's smarter then the jerks who sold me the modem. They didn't even tell me about communications software. Bet they didn't know. And why do they put two telephone jack holes in the back of a modem when you only need one? And why do they have one labeled phone when you are not suppose to hook it to the phone jack on the wall? I thought the dial tone sounded funny! Boy, are modem makers dumb! But the kid figured it out by the sound. </p>
<p>July 26- What's the internet? I thought I was on America Online. Not this internet thing. I'm confused. </p>
<p>July 27 - The nine year old kid next door showed me how to use this America Online stuff. I told him he must be a genius. He says that he is compared to me. Maybe he's not so modest after all. </p>
<p>July 28 -I tried to use chat today. I tried to talk into my computer but nothing happened. maybe I need to buy a microphone. </p>
<p>July 29 - I found this thing called usenet. I got out of it because I'm connected to America Online not usenet. </p>
<p>July 30 - These people in this usenet thing keep using capital letters. How do they do that? I never figured out how to type capital letters. Maybe they have a different type of keyboard. </p>
<p>JULY 31 - I CALLED THE COMPUTER MAKER I BOUGHT IT FROM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT NOT HAVING A CAPITOL LETTER KEY. THE TECH SUPPORT GUY SAID IT WAS THIS CAPS LOCK KEY. WHY DIDN'T THEY SPELL IT OUT? I TOLD HIM I GOT A CHEAP KEYBOARD AND WANTED A BETTER ONE. AND ONE OF MY SHIFT KEYS ISNT THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER. HE SAID THATS A STANDARD. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T WANT A STANDARD KEYBOARD BUT ANOTHER BRAND. I MUST HAVE HAD AN IMPORTANT COMPLAINT BECAUSE I HEARD HIM TELL THE OTHER SUPPORT GUYS TO LISTEN IN ON OUR CONVERSATION. </p>
<p>AUGUST 1- I FOUND THIS THING CALLED THE USENET ORACLE. IT SAYS THAT IT CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK IT. I SENT IT 44 SEPARATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTERNET. I HOPE IT RESPONDS SOON.</p>
<p>AUGUST 2 - I FOUND A GROUP CALLED REC.HUMOR. I DECIDED TO POST THIS JOKE ABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT CROSSED THE ROAD. TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE! HA! HA! I WASNT SURE I POSTED IT RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 56 MORE TIMES. </p>
<p>AUGUST 3 - I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE WORLD WIDE WEB. I DON'T NOW SPIDERS GREW THAT LARGE. </p>
<p>AUGUST 4 - THE ORACLE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS TODAY. GEEZ IT WAS RUDE. I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I POSTED AN ANGRY MESSAGE ABOUT IT TO REC.HUMOR.ORACLE. I WASNT SURE IF I POSTED RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 22 MORE TIMES. </p>
<p>AUGUST 5 - SOMEONE TOLD ME TO READ THE FAQ. GEEZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO USE PROFANITY. </p>
<p>AUGUST 6 - SOMEONE ELSE TOLD ME TO STOP SHOUTING IN ALL MY MESSAGES. WHAT A STUPID JERK. IM NOT SHOUTING! IM NOT EVEN TALKING! JUST TYPING! HOW CAN THEY LET THESE RUDE JERKS GO ON THE INTERNET? </p>
<p>August 7 - Why have a Caps Lock key if you're not suppose to use it? Its probably an extra feature that costs more money. </p>
<p>August 8 - I just read this post called make money fast. I'm so exited. I'm going to make lots of money. I followed his instructions and posted it to every newsgroup I could find. </p>
<p>August 9 - I just made my signature file. Its only 6 pages long. I will have to work on it some more. </p>
<p>August 10 - I just looked at a group called alt.aol.sucks. I read a few posts and I really believe that aol should be wiped off the face of the earth. I wonder what an aol is. </p>
<p>August 11 - I was asking where to find some information about something. Some guy told me to check out ftp.netcom.com. I've looked and looked but I can't find that group. </p>
<p>August 12 -I sent a post to every usenet group on the Internet asking where the ftp.netcom.com is. hopefully someone will help. I cant ask the kid next door. His parents said that when he comes back from my house he's laughing so hard he can't eat or sleep or do his homework. So they wont let him come over anymore. I do have a great sense of humor. I don't know why the rec.humor group didn't like my chicken joke. Maybe they only like dirty stuff. Some people sent me posts about my 56 posts of the joke and they used bad words. </p>
<p>August 13 - I sent another post to every usenet group on the Internet asking where the ftp.netcom.com is. I had forgot yesterday to include my new signature file which is only 8 pages long. I know everyone will want to read my favorite poem so I included it. I'm also going to add that short story I like. </p>

<p>My father died on Jan 02, 1995. He left no forwarding address.</p>
<p>Therefore, it fell to me to collect his mail. I didn't expect much really, since my sisters and I had been careful to notify his bank, insurance agent and a host of other businesses that one of their customers was no more. You would think a death notice would cut down on the amount of correspondence from those firms. Quite the contrary. Instead -- for months, mind you -- my deceased father continued to receive mail from companies that had been told of his passing but<br /> pressed on, determined to con tact him anyway. The first to hope for a reply from beyond the grave was my father's bank.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Our records indicate payment is due for overdraft protection on your checking account. Efforts to contact you have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, we are automatically withdrawing your monthly $28.00 service charge from you account. Please adjust your records accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> The Phoenix Branch</p>
<p>Dear Phoenix Branch,<br /> This is to notify you once again that Mr. Hanson died Jan 02, 1995. It is therefore unlikely he will be overdrawing his account. Please close his account, and adjust your books accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>
<p>Later that same week, I receive this note from Dad's insurance company. Again, this is a firm that had been told in no uncertain terms of his death.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> It's time to renew your auto insurance policy! To continue your coverage, you must send $54.17 to this office immediately. Failure to do so will result in the cancellation of your policy, and interruption of your coverage.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Insurance Agent</p>
<p>Dear Insurance Agent,<br /> This is to remind you that Mr. Hanson has been dead since January. As such, the odds he'll be involved in a collision are quite minimal. Please cancel the policy, and adjust your books<br /> accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson.</p>
<p>The next day, I went to my mailbox to find this:</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Let me introduce myself. I am a psychic reader, and it is very important that you contact me immediately. I sense that you are about to enter a time of unprecedented financial prosperity. Please call the enclosed 900 number immediately, so I can tell you how best to take full advantage of the opportunities that are coming your way.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Psychic Reader</p>
<p>Dear Psychic Reader,<br /> My father regrets he will be unable to call you 900 number. As a psychic reader, I'm sure you already know my father is dead, and had been for more than three weeks when you mailed your letter to him. I sense my father would be more than happy to take you up on your offer of a psychic reading, should you care to meet with him personally.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson<br /> P.S. Should you be in contact with my father in the future, please ask him if he'd like to renew his car insurance.</p>
<p>A few months of calm passed, and then these arrived:</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Our records indicate a balance of $112 has accrued for overdraft protection on your checking account. Efforts to contact you have proven unsuccessful. Please pay the minimum amount due, or contact this office to make other  arrangements. We appreciate your business and look forward to serving all of your future borrowing needs.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Bank's San Diego District Office</p>
<p>Dear San Diego District Office, I am writing to you for the third time now to tell you my father died in January. Since then, the number of checks he's written has dropped dramatically. Being dead, he has no plans to use his overdraft protection or pay even the minimum amount due for a service he no longer needs. As for future borrowing needs, well, don't hold your breath.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Records show you owe a balance of $54.17 to your insurance agent. Efforts to contact you have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, the matter has been turned over to us for collection. Please remit the amount of $54.17 to our office or we will be forced to take legal action to collect the debt.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Insurance Agent's Collection Agency</p>
<p>Dear Collection Agency,<br /> I told your client. Now I'm telling you. Dad's dead. He doesn't need insurance. He's dead. Dead, dead, dead. I doubt even your lawyers can change that. Please adjust your books accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>
<p>A few more months, and:</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> Our records show an unpaid balance of $224 has accrued for overdraft protection on your checking account. Our efforts to contact you have proven unsuccessful. Please remit the amount in full to this office, or the matter will be turned over to a collection agency. Such action will adversely affect your credit history.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Bank's Los Angeles Regional Office</p>
<p>Dear Los Angeles Regional Office,<br /> I am writing for the fourth time to the fourth person at the fourth address to tell your bank that my father passed away in January. Since that time, I've watched with a mixture of amazement and amusement as your bank continues to transact business with him. Now, you are even threatening his credit history. It should come as no surprise that you have received little response from my deceased father. It should also be small news that his credit history is of minor importance to him now. For the fourth and final time, please adjust your books accordingly.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Hanson,<br /> This is your final notice of payment due to your insurance agent. If our firm does not receive payment of $54.17, we will commence legal action on the matter. Please contact us at once.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Your Insurance Agent's Collection Agency</p>
<p>Dear Insurance Agent's Collection Agency, You may contact my father via the enclosed 900 number.<br /> Sincerely,<br /> Scott Hanson</p>
<p>It has now been a couple of months since I've heard from these firms. Either the people writing these letters finally believe my father is Dead, or they themselves have died and are now receiving similar correspondence. Actually, there has been a lesson in these letters. Any one of them would be cause for great worry, if sent to a living person. The dead are immune from corporate bullying. There's nothing like dying to put business correspondence in its proper perspective. Perhaps that's the best reason not to fear death. There's no post office there.</p>

18723,"<p>One evening a man was at home watching TV and eating peanuts.<br /> He'd toss them in the air, then catch them in his mouth. In the<br /> middle of catching one, his wife asked a question, and as he<br /> turned to answer her, a peanut fell in his ear.</p>
<p>He tried and tried to dig it out but succeeded in only pushing<br /> it in deeper. He asked his wife for assistance, and after hours<br /> of trying they became worried and decided to go to hospital.</p>
<p>As they were ready to go out the door, their daughter came home<br /> with her date. After being informed of the problem, their<br /> daughter's date said he could get the peanut out.</p>
<p>The young man told the father to sit down, then shoved two<br /> fingers up the father's nose and told him to blow hard. When the<br /> father blew, the peanut flew out. The mother and daughter jumped<br /> and yelled for joy.</p>
<p>The young man insisted that it was nothing and the daughter<br /> brought the young man out to the kitchen for something to eat.<br /> Once he was gone the mother turned to the father. The mother<br /> said, ""That's wonderful. Isn't he smart? What do you think he's<br /> going to be when he grows older?""</p>

<p>15. Most Southerners do not use turn signals, and they ignore those who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a Southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the car was purchased. </p>
<p>16. Northerners can be identified by the spit on the inside of their car's windshield that comes from yelling at other drivers. </p>
<p>17. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase one it is to be positioned directly in front of your trailer. This is logical bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the trailer and should, therefore, be displayed. </p>

They had been visiting units most of the day and the General came back to the chopper only to see the engine torn apart and the warrant deep in the inner workings of the chopper. The general asked the warrant what was wrong and the warrant, as warrants do, launched into an extremely complex and detailed technical explanation of exactly what was wrong with the engine. The general listened to him for a couple of minutes and then said ""Stop! Now Chief, you're paid for your technical expertise and skill, and its obvious you have that, but the other thing you need to do is to be able to communicate to others what's wrong in terms they can understand. Now what I want you to do is to tell me what's wrong with that chopper in words I can understand"". The warrant thought for a moment and then got a big grin on his face.""OK General"", he said, ""I think I can do that.""

18765,"<p>It seems when Apollo Mission Astronaut, Neil Armstrong first<br /> walked on the moon, he not only gave his famous ""One small Step<br /> for Man, One Giant Leap for Mankind"" statement, but followed it<br /> by several remarks -- usual communication traffic between him,<br /> the other astronauts and mission control. Before he reentered<br /> the lander, he made the enigmatic remark ""Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.""</p>
<p>Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning<br /> some rival Soviet Cosmounaut. However, upon checking, there was<br /> no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs.</p>
<p>Over the years many people have questioned as to what the ""Good<br /> luck, Mr. Gorsky"" statement meant. A few months ago, (Jul 05<br /> Tampa Bay, Fl), while anwering questions following a speech, a<br /> reporter brought up the 26 year old question. He finally<br /> responded.</p>
<p>It seems that Mr. Gorsky had finally died so Niel Armstrong felt<br /> he could answer the question.</p>
<p>When he was a kid, he was playing baseball with his brother in<br /> the backyard. His brother hit a fly ball which landed in front<br /> of his neighbors bedroom window. His neighbors were Mr. and Mrs.<br /> Gorksy. As Neil leaned down to pick it up, he heard Mrs. Gorsky<br /> shouting at Mr. Gorsky.</p>

So, the husband  went to  his doctor (who also treated mules) and told him that he and his wife/cousin  didn't want to have any more children.<br /> The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy<br /> that could fix the problem. The doctor instructed him to go home, get a<br /> cherry  bomb  (fireworks are legal in Alabama), light it, put it in a<br /> beer can, then  hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.</p>
<p>The Alabamian said to the doctor, ""I may not be the smartest man,<br /> but I  don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear  is going  to help me.""</p>
<p>So, the couple drove to Georgia to get a second opinion. The Georgia<br /> physician was just about to tell them about the procedure for a<br /> vasectomy  when he noticed that they were from Alabama. This doctor<br /> instead told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it,<br /> place  it  in a beer can, hold it to his ear and count to 10.<br /> Figuring that both of the physicians couldn't be wrong, the man<br /> Went  home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can. He held the can<br /> up To  his  ear  and began to count.</p>
<p>""1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . . . "", at which point he paused, placed the beer<br /> can  between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand.</p>

18778,"<p>There was a perfect man who met a perfect woman. After a perfect<br /> courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life together was,<br /> of course, perfect.</p>
<p>One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving<br /> their perfect car (a Grand Caravan) along a winding road, when<br /> they noticed someone at the side of the road in distress. Being<br /> the perfect couple, they stopped to help. There stood Santa<br /> Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to disappoint any<br /> children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded<br /> Santa and his toys into their vehicle.</p>
<p>Soon they were driving along delivering the toys. Unfortunately,<br /> the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and<br /> Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of them survived the<br /> accident. Who was the survivor?</p>
<p>(Scroll down for the answer.)</p>
<p>The perfect woman. She's the only one that really existed in the<br /> first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is<br /> no such thing as a perfect man...</p>
<p>(Women, end e-mail here.!!!! Men, keep scrolling.)</p>
<p>So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect<br /> woman must have been driving. This explains why there was a car<br /> accident. (By the way if you are a woman, and you are reading<br /> this...this brings up another point...women never listen<br /> either....)</p>

<p>The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the<br /> offer. St.Peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the<br /> reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria<br /> and finally, they come to a HUGE room full of clocks.</p>
<p>The guy asks, ""What's up with these clocks?""</p>
<p>St. Peter explains, ""Everyone on earth has a clock that shows<br /> how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of<br /> time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged."" The<br /> guy thinks this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks<br /> are going faster than others. He asks why is that?</p>
<p>St. Peter explains, ""Every time a living person tells a lie, it<br /> speeds his clock.""</p>
<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the<br /> room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the<br /> ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an<br /> unbelievable rate. So he asks, ""What's the story with that<br /> clock?""</p>

<p>In 1976 a twenty-two-year-old Irishman, Bob Finnegan, was<br /> crossing the busy Falls Road in Belfast, when he was struck by a<br /> taxi and flung over its roof. The taxi drove away and, as<br /> Finnegan lay stunned in the road, another car ran into him,<br /> rolling him into the gutter. It too drove on. As a knot of<br /> gawkers gathered to examine the magnetic Irishman, a delivery<br /> van plowed through the crowd, leaving in its wake three injured<br /> bystanders and an even more battered Bob Finnegan. When a fourth<br /> vehicle came along, the crowd wisely scattered and only one<br /> person was hit-Bob Finnegan. In the space of two minutes<br /> Finnegan suffered a fractured skull, broken pelvis, broken leg,<br /> and other assorted injuries. Hospital officials said he would<br /> recover. </p>

While he sat idling, he was joined by a farmer<br /> with a goat, which the farmer tethered to the crossing gate. A<br /> few moments later a horse and cart drew up behind Falatti,<br /> followed in short order by a man in a sports car. When the train<br /> roared through the crossing, the horse startled and bit Falatti<br /> on the arm. Not a man to be trifled with, Falatti responded by<br /> punching the horse in the head. In consequence the horse's owner<br /> jumped down from his cart and began scuffling with the<br /> motorcyclist. The horse, which was not up to this sort of<br /> excitement, backed away briskly, smashing the cart into the<br /> sports- car. At this, the sports-car driver leaped out of his<br /> car and joined the fray. The farmer came forward to try to<br /> pacify the three flailing men. As he did so, the crossing gates<br /> rose and his goat was strangled. At last report, the insurance<br /> companies were still trying to sort out the claims. </p>

<p>I'm not in touch with my feelings and I like it that way.<br /> I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child, it takes two<br /> parents.<br /> I think owning a gun doesn't make you a killer. </p>
<p>I want to know which church is it exactly where the Reverend Jesse Jackson<br /> preaches. And where does he get his money. And why is he always part of the<br /> problem and not the solution. </p>
<p>I believe if she has her lips on your willie, it is sex, and it is sex for<br /> both of you. This even applies when you are President of the United States. </p>
<p>I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment than<br /> working at Blockbuster. In fact, if your parents are footing the bill to put<br /> your pansy ass through 4-7 years of college, you haven't begun to be<br /> enlightened. </p>
<p>I believe everyone has a right to pray to his or her God or gods, just leave<br /> the rest of us out of it. This also applies to sexuality. </p>
<p>I believe it's called the Boy Scouts for a reason.<br /> I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized.<br /> I don't use the excuse ""it's for the children"" as a shield for unpopular<br /> opinions or actions.<br /> I think fireworks should be legal on the 4th of July.<br /> My heroes are John Wayne, the Simpsons, and whoever canceled Dr. Quinn,<br /> Medicine Woman.<br /> I don't hate the rich.

<p>I think global warming is a big lie. Where are all those experts now, when I<br /> am freezing my ass through a long winter? </p>
<p>I've never owned a slave, or was a slave, I didn't wander forty years in the<br /> desert after getting chased out of Egypt, I haven't burned any witches or been<br /> persecuted by the Turks and neither have you, so shut up already. </p>
<p>I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry ass if you're running<br /> from them. I also think they have the right to pull your ass over if you are<br /> breaking the law, regardless of what color you are. </p>
<p>I think if you are too stupid to know how a ballot works, I don't want you<br /> deciding who should be running the most powerful nation of the world for the<br /> next four years. </p>
<p>I think if you are in the passing lane, and not passing, your license should<br /> be revoked, and you should be forced to ride the bus until you promise to never<br /> delay the rest of us again. </p>
<p>I think beef jerky could quite possibly be the perfect food.<br /> I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but please don't<br /> pretend they are a political statement.<br /> I think Dr. Seuss was a genius.<br /> I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the<br /> mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise. </p>
<p>If that makes me a BAD American, then yes, I'm a BAD American.<br /> If you too are a BAD American please forward this to everyone you know. </p>

18813,"<p>Dear Mr. Johnson:Ann Landers wouldn't print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain.It's about my son, Billy. He's always been a good, normal 10 year old boy. Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy.We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire -- you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying.I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It's where he went last year. Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago.I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED. He's changed. I can't explain it. See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy's letters:----------------------------------- Letter # 1---------- The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only good part. We're learning how to program. Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up. Love, Billy. Letter # 2------------- Dear Mom, Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We all get to choose what we want to drink. By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I'm getting used to it now. Gotta go, it's time for the flowchart class. Love, Billy.P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It's spell checked too. Letter # 3------------- Dear Mom, Don't worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I don't have much of a tan cause we don't go outside very often. You can't see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I'm okay, really.Love, Billy. Letter # 4------------- Dear Mom, I'm fine. I'm sleeping enough. I'm eating enough. This is the best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Can you send more money? I've got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad.Love, Billy. Letter # 5------------- Dear Mother, Forget the money for the telephone. We've got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven't written. I've been learning a lot. I'm real good at getting onto any computer in the country. It's really easy! I got into the university's in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five, he's going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He's really smart. He says that I shouldn't call myself Billy anymore. So, I'm not.Signed, William. Letter # 6------------- Dear Mother, How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why'd you get so upset? I haven't gained that much weight. The glasses aren't real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you'd be proud of my program. After all, I've made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I've paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won't be home until late August.Regards, William. Letter # 7------------- Mother, Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.? I won't write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me.Sincerely, William.-------------What can I do, Mr. Johnson?See what I mean? It's been two weeks since I've heard from my little boy. I know that it's probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so. Thank you very much.Sally Gates, Concerned Parent</p>

And all you sons of bitches who are returning and want to get on, get your asses on the train now, cause we're going down the tracks!"" </p>
<p>The mother went into the living room and told her son, ""We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now go to you room and stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may go back and play with your train, but only if you use nice language."" </p>
<p>Two hours later, the boy came out of the bedroom and resumed playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say ""All passengers who are disembarking the train, please remember to take all of you belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon."" </p>
<p>She hears the little boy continue. ""For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under you seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today."" </p>
<p>Then, the child added, ""And for those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR DELAY, see the bitch in the kitchen.""</p>

He grabs two bars of soap in his hands and heads back to the showers. He is halfway down the hall when he sees three nuns heading his way.Having no place to hide, he stands against the wall and freezes like he's a statue. The nuns stop and comment on how life-like he looks.The first nun suddenly reaches out and pulls his dick.Startled, he drops a bar of soap. 'Oh look,' says the second nun, 'a soap dispenser.'To test her theory she also pulls his dick... and sure enough he drops the last bar of soap.The third nun then pulls, first once, then twice and three times. Still nothing happens. So she tries once more and to her delight she yells, 'Look, hand cream!'</p>

<p>The priest became a bit flustered but politely answered ""I wear this collar because I am a Father"". </p>
<p>The old man thought a second and responded ""Sir I am also a Father but I wear my collar front-ways. Why do you wear your collar so differently?"" </p>
<p>The priest thought for a minute and said ""Sir, I am the father for many"". </p>
<p>The old man quickly answered, ""I too am the father of many. I have four sons, four daughters and too many grandchildren to count. But I wear my collar like everyone else does. Why do you wear it your way?"" </p>
<p>The priest who was beginning to get exasperated thought and then blurted out ""Sir, I am the father for hundreds and hundreds of people.""</p>
<p>The old man from the far-away country was taken aback and was silent for a long time. As he got up to leave the subway train, he leaned over to the priest and said, ""Mister, maybe you should wear your pants backwards.""</p>

18832,"<p>A young man wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetheart's birthday, and as they had not been dating very long, after careful consideration he decided a pair of gloves would strike just the right note: romantic, but not too personal. Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to Nordstrom's and bought a pair of white gloves. The sister purchased a pair of panties for herself. During the wrapping the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties. Without checking the contents, the young man sealed the package and sent it to his sweetheart along with this note:</p>
<p>I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. If it had not been for your sister I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears the short ones that are easier to remove. These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart. I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year. I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night.</p>
<p>All my love,</p>

She stopped her car and went over to the shepherd who was tending to them.""If I can guess the exact number of sheep here will you let me have one?"" she asked. The shepherd, thinking this was a pretty safe bet, agreed. ""You have 171 sheep,"" said the blonde in triumph. Surprised, the shepherd told her to pick out a sheep of her choice. She looked around for a while and finally found one that she really liked. She picked it up and was petting it when the shepherd walked over to her and asked, ""if I can guess your real hair color, will you give me my sheep back?"" The blonde thought it was only fair to let him try. Your a blonde! Now give me back my dog.</p>

18895,"<p>Jack was a COBOL programmer in the mid to late 1990s. After years of being<br /> taken for granted and treated as a technological dinosaur by all the<br /> Client/Server programmers and website developers, he was finally getting some<br /> respect. He'd become a private consultant specializing in Year 2000<br /> conversions.</p>
<p>Several years of this relentless, mind-numbing work had taken<br /> its toll on Jack. He began having anxiety dreams about the Year 2000. All he<br /> could think about was how he could avoid the year 2000 and all that came with<br /> it.</p>
<p>Jack decided to contact a company that specialized in cryogenics. He made<br /> a deal to have him frozen until March 15th, 2000. The next thing he would know<br /> is he'd wake up in the year 2000; after the New Year celebrations and computer<br /> debacles; after the leap day. Nothing else to worry about except getting on with<br /> his life.</p>
<p>He was put into his cryogenic receptacle, the technicians set the revive date,<br /> he was given injections to slow his heartbeat to a bare minimum, and that was<br /> that.</p>
<p>The next thing that Jack saw was an enormous and very modern room<br /> filled with excited people. They were all shouting ""I can't believe it!"" and<br /> ""It's a miracle"" and ""He's alive!� There were cameras (unlike any he'd ever<br /> seen) and equipment that looked like it came out of a science fiction movie.</p>
<p>Someone who was obviously a spokesperson for the group stepped forward. Jack<br /> couldn't contain his enthusiasm. ""Is it over?"" he asked. ""Is the year 2000<br /> already here? Are all the millennial parties and promotions and crises all over<br /> and done with?""</p>
<p>The spokesman explained that there had been a problem with the programming of<br /> the timer on Jack's cryogenic receptacle; it hadn't been year 2000 compliant. It<br /> was actually eight thousand years later, not the year 2000. Technology had<br /> advanced to such a degree that everyone had virtual reality interfaces which<br /> allowed them to contact anyone else on the planet.</p>
<p>""That sounds terrific,"" said Jack. ""But I'm curious. Why is everybody so<br /> interested in me?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" said the spokesman. ""The year 10000 is just around the corner, and it<br /> says in your files that you know COBOL"".</p>

They could agree on everything but whose igloo was the coldest, so they decided to determine who, indeed, had the coldest igloo.They went to the first Eskimo's igloo, where he said ""Watch this!"" and poured a cup of water into the air. Well, the water froze in mid-air and fell onto the floor solid. ""Not bad"" said the other Eskimos, but each maintained their igloo was colder still.So they went to the second Eskimo's igloo, and he said ""Watch this!"" and took a big breath and exhaled, whereupon his breath froze into a big lump and fell to the floor.""Wow, that's colder than mine!""said the first Eskimo.But the third Eskimo exclaimed his was colder still. So they ended up at the third Eskimo's igloo. He said ""Watch this!"" and went into the bedroom, threw back the thick furs, and retrieved one of several small balls of ice there. He took it, put it in a spoon, and held a match under it. When it heated up enough, it went ""FFFAAAARRRRTTT"".</p>

<p>COSTELLO: I don't own a computer. I want to buy one.</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Mac?</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I told you, my name is Lou.</p>
<p>ABBOTT: What about Windows?</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Why? Does it get stuffy?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Do you want a computer with Windows?</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I don't know. What do I see when I look out the windows?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Wallpaper.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software.</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Software that runs on Windows?</p>
<p>COSTELLO: No, on the computer! I need something I can use to write proposals, track expenses. You know, run a business. What have you got?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Office.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: I just did.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: You just did what?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Recommended something.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: You recommended something?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Yes.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: For my office?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Yes.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Okay, what did you recommend for my office?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Office.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Yes, for my office.</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Office for Windows.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I already have an office and it already has windows! Let's say I'm sitting at my computer, and I want to type a proposal. What do I need?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Word.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: If I'm writing a proposal, I'm going to need lots of words. But what program do I load?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Word.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: What word?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: The Word in Office.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: The only word in office is office.</p>
<p>ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Which word in ""office for windows?""</p>
<p>ABBOTT: The Word you get when you click the blue W.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I'm going to click your big W if you don't give me a straight answer. Let's forget about words for a minute. What do I need if I want to watch a movie over the Internet?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Real One.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Maybe a real movie, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. But what do I need to watch it?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Real One.</p>

<p>COSTELLO: I click the blue one what?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: The blue 1.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Is that different from the blue W?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Of course it is. The blue 1 is Real One. The blue W is Word.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: What word?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: But there's three words in ""office for windows!""</p>
<p>ABBOTT: No, just one. But it's the most popular Word in the world.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: It is?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Yes, although to be fair there aren't many other Words left. It pretty much wiped out all the other Words.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: And that word is the real one?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: No. Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn't even part of Office.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Never mind; I don't want to get started with that again. But I also need something for bank accounts, loans, and so on. What do you have to help me track my money?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Money.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: That's right. What do you have?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Money.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I need money to track my money?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: No, not really. It comes bundled with your computer.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: What comes bundled with my computer?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Money.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Money comes bundled with my computer?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Exactly. No extra charge.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer at no extra charge? How much money do I get?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Just one copy.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I get a copy of money. Isn't that illegal?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: No. We have a license from Microsoft to make copies of Money.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Microsoft can license you to make money?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Why not? They own it.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Well, it's great that I'm going to get free money, but I'll still need to track it. Do you have anything for managing your money?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Managing Your Money? That program disappeared years ago.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Well, what do you sell in its place?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Money.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: You sell money?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Of course. But if you buy a computer from us, you get it for free.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: That's all very wonderful, but I'll be running a business. Do you have any software for, you know, accounting?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Simply Accounting.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Probably, but it might get a little complicated.</p>
<p>ABBOTT: If you don't want Simply Accounting, you might try M.Y.O.B.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: M..Y.O.B.? What does that stand for?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Mind Your Own Business.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: No, that would be I.B.Y.P. I said M.Y.O.B.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Look, I just need to do some accounting for my home business. You know--accounting? You do it with money.</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Of course you can do accounting with Money. But you may need more.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: More money?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: More than Money. Money can't do everything.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: I don't need a sermon! Okay, let's forget about money for the moment. I'm worried that my computer might...what's the word? Crash. And if my computer crashes, what can I use to restore my data?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: GoBack.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: Okay. I'm worried about my computer smashing and I need something to restore my data. What do you recommend?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: GoBack.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: How many times do I have to repeat myself?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: I've never asked you to repeat yourself. All I said was GoBack.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: How can I go back if I haven't even been anywhere? Okay, I'll go back. What do I need to write a proposal?</p>
<p>ABBOTT: Word.</p>
<p>COSTELLO: But I'll need lots of words to write a proposal.</p>

18939,"<p>How to buy a stero1.  Carefully calculate power requirements, based on room dimensions, etc. Multiply by a factor of 100.2. The ideal system should have as many lights as possible, preferably blinking and flashing in time with the music.3. The components should all have black metal finish, and generally look very cool.4.  The system should be broken up into as many components as possible. (e.g. pre-amp, pre-pre-amp, pre-menstrual-amp, post-amp, post-menopause-amp, etc.)5.  The most important part of a stereo system is the speakers, they should look very cool.  Size and number of sub-speakers and varieties of components pointed at the listener is important. (e.g. tweeters, hooters, sub-woofers, super-sub-woofers, seismic noise generators, etc.)6.  The system should resemble the cockpit of an F16 or 757 aircraft; the more knobs and dials you can turn, the better.7.  The system should have full remote control capability, including over the mobile auto cellular phone so that the stereo can be playing as you get home.8.  Should have the capability of playing different music in every room of the house.9.  Components should have a cool names; this means no department store brands.10. The complete set-up should put a major recording studio or large radio station to shame.  After all, you may be trying to duplicate the exciting feeling of being at a heavy metal concert in a football stadium with 70,000 screaming fans.11. Having state-of-the-art equipment is not enough.  You should be a year or two ahead of everyone else.  Equipment over the warranty period is obsolete and should be disposed of promptly.12. The most important factor--out of everyone you know who owns stereo equipment, yours should be better.</p>

18944,"<p>The National Institutes of Health have announced that they will no longer be<br /> using rats for medical experimentation. In their place, they will use attorneys.<br /> They have given three reasons for this decision:<br /> 1. There are now more attorneys than there are rats.<br /> 2. The medical researchers don't become as emotionally attached to the<br /> attorneys as they did to the rats.<br /> 3. No matter how hard you try, there are some things that rats won't do.</p>

God meets them at the gate with the same offer he made to the cat.'All our life,' the mice say, 'we've had to run. Cats, dogs, women with brooms have chased us. If we had roller skates, we wouldn't have to run any more.'God says he can take care of it and, instantly, each mouse is fitted with a beautiful pair of tiny roller skates. A week later God checks on the cat, which is asleep on its pillow. God gently nudges him awake and asks, 'How are you doing? Are you happy here?''Never been happier,' says the cat, stretching and yawning. 'And those meals on wheels you've been sending over are great.'</p>

18983,"<p>Cracking an international market is a goal of most growing corporations. It<br /> shouldn't be that hard, yet even the big multi-nationals run into trouble<br /> because of language and cultural differences. For example, observe the following<br /> examples below.</p>
<p>The name Coca-Cola in China was first rendered as Ke-kou-ke-la. Unfortunately,<br /> the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of signs had been<br /> printed that the phrase means, ""bite the wax tadpole"" or ""female horse stuffed<br /> with wax"" depending on the dialect. Coke then researched 40,000 Chinese<br /> characters and found a close phonetic equivalent, ""ko-kou-ko-le,"" which can be<br /> loosely translated as ""happiness in the mouth.""</p>
<p>In Taiwan, the translation of the Pepsi slogan ""Come alive with the Pepsi<br /> Generation"" came out, as ""Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead.""</p>
<p>Also in Chinese, the Kentucky Fried Chicken slogan ""finger-licking' good"" came<br /> out as ""eat your fingers off.""</p>
<p>The American slogan for Salem cigarettes, ""Salem - Feeling Free,"" got<br /> translated in the Japanese market into ""When smoking Salem, you feel so<br /> refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty.""</p>
<p>When General Motors introduced the Chevy Nova in South America, it was<br /> apparently unaware that ""no va"" means ""it won't go."" After the company figured<br /> out why it wasn't selling any cars, it renamed the car in its Spanish markets to<br /> the Caribe.</p>
<p>When Parker Pen marketed a ballpoint pen in Mexico, its ads were supposed to<br /> say, ""It won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you."" However, the company<br /> mistakenly thought the Spanish word ""embarazar"" meant embarrass. Instead the ads<br /> said that ""It won�t leak in your pocket and make you pregnant.""</p>
<p>An American t-shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the spanish market which<br /> promoted the Pope's visit. Instead of the desired ""I Saw the Pope"" in Spanish,<br /> the shirts proclaimed ""I Saw the Potato.""</p>
<p>Colgate introduced a toothpaste in France called Cue, the name of a notorious<br /> porno magazine.</p>
<p>In Italy, a campaign for Schweppes Tonic Water translated the name into<br /> Schweppes Toilet Water.</p>
