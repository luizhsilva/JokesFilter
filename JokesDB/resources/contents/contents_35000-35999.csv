35000,"<p>Jesus, in a very worried state, convened all of his apostles and disciples to an emergency meeting because of the high drug consumption problem all over the earth.After giving it much thought they reached the conclusion that in order to better deal with the problem, that they should try the drugs themselves and then decide on the correct way to proceed. It was therefore decided that a commission made up of some of the members return to earth to get the different types of drugs.The secret operation is effected and two days later the commissioned disciples begin to return to heaven. Jesus, waiting at the door, lets in the first disciple:""Who is it?"" ""It's Paul"" Jesus opens the door.""What did you bring Paul?""

<p>""Is your Daddy home?"" the boss quickly asked. ""Yes"", whispered the small<br /> voice. May I talk with him?"" the man asked, feeling somewhat put-off by this<br /> delay. To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, ""No."" </p>

<p>Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter<br /> through the ear piece on the phone the boss asked, ""What is that noise?"" ""A<br /> hello-copper."", answered the whispering voice. ""What is going on there?"" asked<br /> the boss, now alarmed. In an awed voice the child answered, ""The police just<br /> landed the hello-copper!"" </p>

35005,"<p>Billy's Mom's LettersThe following appeared in a computer magazine in Mr. Dvorak's column:Dear Mr. Dvorak:Ann Landers wouldn't print this.  I have nowhere else to turn.  I have to get the word out. Warn other parents.  I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain.  It's about my son, Billy.  He's always been a good, normal ten year old boy.  Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy.  We sorted through the camp brochures.  There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire -- you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying.  I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo.  It's where he went last year. (He made an adorable picture out of painted pinto beans and macaroni).  Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket.  It was for a COMPUTER CAMP! We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known.  He left three weeks ago.  I don't know what's happened.  He's changed.  I can't explain it. See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy's letters.Dear Mom,    The kids are dorky nerds.  The food stinks.  The computers are the only good part.  We're learning how to program.  Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up.                  Love, Billy.Dear Mom,    Camp is O.K.  Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night.    We all get to choose what we want to drink.  I drink Classic Coke. By the way, can you make Szechuan food?  I'm getting used to it now. Gotta go, it's time for the flowchart class.                  Love, Billy.P.S. This is written on a wordprocessor. Pretty swell, huh? It's spellchecked too.Dear Mom,    Don't worry.  We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens.  It was real neat.  I don't have much of a tan 'cause we don't go outside very often.  You can't see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway.  That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I'm okay, really.                   Love, Billy.Dear Mom,    I'm fine. I'm sleeping enough. I'm eating enough.  This is the best camp ever.  We scared the counselor with some phony worm code.  It was real funny.  He got mad and yelled.  Frederick says it's okay. Can you send more money? I spent mine on a pocket protector and a box of blankdiskettes. I've got to chip in on the phone bill.  Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer?  Give my regards to Dad.                   Love, Billy.Dear Mother,    Forget the money for the telephone.  We've got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven't written. I've been learning a lot. I'm real good at getting onto any computer in the country.  It's really easy! I got into the university's in less than fifteen minutes.  Frederick did it in five, he's going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner.  He's really smart.  He says that I shouldn't call myself Billy anymore.  So, I'm not.                   Signed, William.Dear Mother,    How nice of you to come up on Parents Day.  Why'd you get so upset?    I haven't gained that much weight.  The glasses aren't real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in.  Believe me, the tape on them is cool.  I thought that you'd be proud of my program. After all, I've made some money on it.  A publisher is sending a check for $30,000.Anyway, I've paid for the next six weeks of camp.  I won't be home until late August.                   Regards, William.Mother,    Stop treating me like a child.  True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me.  Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding.  O.K.?  I won't write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me.                   Sincerely, William.    See what I mean? It's been two weeks since I've heard from my little boy. What can I do, Mr.Dvorak?  I know that it's probably too late to save my little Billy.  But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming, please,  I beg of you to doso. Thank you very much. Sally Gates, Concerned Parent</p>

C'est magnifique!' and continued to watch, remembering good times.Suddenly he drew in a gasp and said, 'Mais... Sacre bleu!! Ze woman - she is dead!' and he hurried along as fast as he could to the town to tell Albert, the police chief.He came, out of breath, to the police station and shouted, 'Albert... Albert zere is zis man zis woman .. . naked in Farmer Gaston's field making love.'The police chief smiled and said; 'Come, come, Henri, you are not so old to not remember ze young love, ze springtime, ze air, ze flowers. Ah, L'amour! Zis is okay.''Mais non! You do not understand - ze woman she is dead!'Hearing this Albert leapt from his seat and rushed out of the station and, the police car being serviced, he ran down to the field, confirmed Henri's story, and ran all the way back nonstop to call the doctor.'Pierre, Pierre... this is Albert. I was in Gaston's field... zere is a young couple naked 'aving sex.'To which Pierre replied, 'Albert, I am a man of science. You must remember, it is spring, ze air, ze flowers. Ah, Uamour!

35023,"<p>As you are aware, ships have long been characterized as    being female (e.g.,<br /> ""Steady as she goes"", or ""She's listing    to starboard, Captain!""). Recently, a<br /> group of computer scientists (all males) announced that computers should also be<br /> referred to as being female. Their reasons for drawing this conclusion follow:<br />     Five reasons to believe computers are female:<br />     1.  No one but the Creator understands their   internal logic.<br />     2.  The native language they use to communicate with other computers is<br /> incomprehensible to everyone else.<br />     3.  The message ""Bad command or file name"" is about as informative as, ""If<br /> you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm certainly not going to tell you"".<br />     4.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later<br /> retrieval.<br />     5.  As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending<br /> half your paycheck on accessories for it. </p>
<p>However, another group of computer scientists (all female) think that<br /> computers should be referred to as if they were male.</p>
<p> Their reasons follow:<br />     Five reasons to believe computers are male:<br />     1.  They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.<br />     2.  They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they<br /> are the problem.<br />     3.  As soon as you commit to one you realize that, if you had waited a<br /> little longer, you could have obtained a better model.<br />     4.  In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br />     5.  Big power surges knock them out for the rest of the night.</p>

35041,"<p>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br /> Not a creature was stirring, except Papa's mouse.<br /> The computer was humming, the icons were hopping,<br /> As Papa did last-minute Internet shopping.<br /> The stockings were hung by the modem with care<br /> In hope that St. Nicholas would bring new software.<br /> The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br /> While visions of computer games danced in their heads. </p>
<p>PageMaker for Billy, and Quicken for Dan,<br /> And Carmen Sandiego for Pamela Ann.<br /> The letters to Santa had been sent out by Mom,<br /> To santaclaus@toyshop.northpole.com - </p>

<p>From where Bill has his mansion. The old fellow preens<br /> In black Gucci boots and red Calvin Klein jeans.<br /> The elves have stock options and desks with a view,<br /> Where they write computer code for Johnny and Sue. </p>
<p>No more dolls or toy soldiers or little toy drums (ahem - pardon me)<br /> No more dolls or tin soldiers or little toy drums<br /> Will be under the tree, only compact disk ROMS<br /> With the Microsoft label. So spin up your drive,<br /> From now on Christmas runs only on Win95. </p>
<p>More rapid than eagles the competitors came,<br /> And Bill whistled, and shouted, and called them by name.<br /> ""Now, ADOBE! now, CLARIS! now, INTUIT! too,<br /> Now, APPLE! and NETSCAPE! you are all of you through, </p>
<p>It is Microsoft's SANTA that the kids can't resist,<br /> It's the ultimate software with a traditional twist -<br /> Recommended by no less than the jolly old elf,<br /> And on the package, a picture of Santa himself. </p>

<p>And there on the screen was a smiling Bill Gates<br /> Next to jolly old Santa, two arm-in-arm mates.<br /> And I heard them exclaim in voice so bright,<br /> Have a MICROSOFT CHRISTMAS, and TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.</p>

<p>That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints. </p>
<p>Every night, the maintenance man would remove them and the next day, the girls would put them back. </p>
<p>Finally the principal decided that something had to be done. </p>
<p>She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance man. </p>
<p>She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night. </p>
<p>To demonstrate how difficult it had been to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort was required. He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the mirror with it. </p>
<p>Ever since this demonstration, there have been no lip prints on the mirror. </p>

35074,"<p>These two hunters went moose hunting every year without success.<br /> Finally they came up with a foolproof plan. (emphasis on fool)</p>
<p>They got themselves a very authentic cow moose costume and learned the<br /> mating call of a cow moose. The plan was to hide in the costume, lure in the bull, then come out of the costume and shoot the bull.</p>
<p>So, they set themselves up on the edge of a clearing, in their costume, and began to give the moose love call. Before too long their call was answered by bull in the forest.</p>
<p>They called again, the bull answered closer to them. They called again, The bull answered, and came crashing out of the forest and into the clearing. As the bulls' pounding hoof beats got closer the guy in front said, ""OK, lets get out and get him""!</p>
<p>After a moment, that seemed like an eternity, the guy in the back shouts -<br /> ""THE ZIPPER IS STUCK, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO!?!""</p>

35075,"<p>DEFINING SOCIETIES VIA THE OWNERSHIP OF 2 COWS</p>
<p>FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.</p>
<p>PURE SOCIALISM: You have two cows. The government takes them and puts them in a barn with everyone else's cows. You have to take care of all the cows.  The government gives you as much milk as you need.</p>
<p>BUREAUCRATIC SOCIALISM: You have two cows. The government takes them and puts them in a barn with everyone else's cows. They are cared for by ex-chicken farmers. You have to take care of the chickens the government took from the chicken farmers. The government gives you as much milk and as many eggs as the regulations say you should need.</p>
<p>FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them, and sells you the milk.</p>
<p>PURE COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbors help you take care of them, and you all share the milk.</p>
<p>RUSSIAN COMMUNISM: You have two cows. You have to take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.</p>
<p>DICTATORSHIP: You have two cows. The government takes both and shoots you.</p>
<p>SINGAPOREAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The government fines you for keeping two unlicensed farm animals in an apartment.</p>
<p>MILITARISM: You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you.</p>
<p>PURE DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. Your neighbors decide who gets the milk.</p>
<p>REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.</p>
<p>AMERICAN DEMOCRACY: The government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it. After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures. The press dubs the affair ""Cowgate.""</p>
<p>BRITISH DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. You feed them sheep's brains and they go mad. The government doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>BUREAUCRACY: You have two cows. At first the government regulates what you can feed them and when you can milk them. Then it pays you not to milk them.  After that it takes both, shoots one, milks the other and pours the milk down the drain. Then it requires you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.</p>
<p>ANARCHY: You have two cows. Either you sell the milk at a fair price or your neighbors try to kill you and take the cows.</p>
<p>CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.</p>
<p>HONG KONG CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax deduction for keeping five cows. The milk rights of six cows are transferred via a Panamanian intermediary to a Cayman Islands company secretly owned by the majority shareholder, who sells the rights to all seven cows' milk back to the listed company. The annual report says that the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.  Meanwhile, you kill the two cows because the fung shui is bad.</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTALISM: You have two cows. The government bans you from milking or killing them.</p>
<p>FEMINISM: You have two cows. They get married and adopt a veal calf.</p>
<p>TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes them and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.</p>
<p>POLITICAL CORRECTNESS: You are associated with (the concept of ""ownership"" is a symbol of the phallo-centric, war mongering, intolerant past) two differently-aged (but no less valuable to society) bovines of non-specified gender.</p>
<p>COUNTER CULTURE: Wow, dude, there's like . . . these two cows, man. You got to have some of this milk.</p>
<p>SURREALISM: You have two giraffes. The government requires you to take harmonica lessons.</p>

35111,"<p>First, these basics       Knowledge is Power       Time is Money and as every engineer knows,       Power is Work over Time.So, substituting algebraic equations for these time worn bits of wisdom, we get:       K = P    (1)       T = M    (2)       P = W/T  (3)Now, do a few simple substitutions:       Put W/T in for P in equation (1), which yields:       K = W/T  (4)Put M  in for T into equation (4), which yields:       K = W/M  (5).Now we've got something.  Expanding back into English, we get:       Knowledge equals Work over Money.What this MEANS is that:       1. The More You Know, the More Work You Do, and       2. The More You Know, the Less Money You Make.Solving for Money, we get:       M = W/K  (6)       Money equals Work Over Knowledge.From equation (6) we see that Money approaches infinity as Knowledge approaches 0, regardless of the Work done.What THIS MEANS is:       The More you Make, the Less you Know.Solving for Work, we get       W = M K  (7)       Work equals Money times KnowledgeFrom equation (7) we see that Work approaches 0 as Knowledge approaches 0.What THIS MEANS is:        The stupid rich do little or no work.Working out the socioeconomic implications of this breakthrough is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

Tell him I sent you and he will turn the counter in your car back to 50,000 miles. Then it should not be a problem to sell your car anymore."" The following weekend, the blonde made the trip to the mechanic. About one month after that, the brunette asked the blonde, ""Did you sell your car?"" ""No,"" replied the blonde, ""why should I? It only has 50,000 miles on it.""</p>

35118,"<p>A deer hunter was hunting in West Virginia one sunny afternoon,<br /> and after getting a kill, proceeded to drag the deer back to his<br /> vehicle. On his way, he was stopped by a redneck game warden.<br /> ""Boy, I see you got you one of them deer today! But, I'm afraid<br /> I have to check your license and make sure you're on the<br /> up-and-up."" So the man produces a valid license and upon it's<br /> return, proceeds towards his vehicle.</p>
<p>""Hold up, boy"" says the warden, ""I still gotta check that deer<br /> there."" Puzzled and confused, the hunter stops. The warden then<br /> steps up to the deer, shoves his finger up the deer's ass, takes<br /> it out and sniffs it. ""Boy, I hate to tell you this, but this<br /> deer is from Virginia and your license is from West Virgina...do<br /> you have a Virginia license?"" As luck would have it, the hunter<br /> had one from the week before and showed it to the warden.</p>
<p>The next week, the same hunter got another kill and was headed<br /> back to his vehicle. The same redneck warden stops him and asks<br /> for a license. Once again, the hunter produces the license and<br /> was once again told that the warden needed to check the deer.<br /> The warden shoves his finger up the deer's ass, takes it out and<br /> sniffs it. ""Boy, this here buck is from Georgia...do you have a<br /> license from Georgia?"" As luck would have it, he did have one in<br /> his glove box and showed it to the warden.</p>
<p>The next week, the same thing happened with deer and licenses<br /> being from Tennessee, South Carolina and Alabama. Finally, after<br /> the Alabama deer, the warden asks the hunter...""Son, you got<br /> licenses from practically every state in the south...where are<br /> you from anyway?"" With that, the hunter drops his pants, bends<br /> over and says...""Why don't you tell me?""</p>

35124,"<p>Jake is struggling through an airport terminal with two huge and<br /> obviously heavy suitcases when a stranger walks up to him and<br /> asks: ""Have you got the time?""</p>
<p>Jake sighs, puts down the suitcases and glances at his wrist.<br /> ""It's a quarter to six"", he says. </p>
<p>""Hey, that's a pretty fancy watch!"" exclaims the stranger. </p>
<p>Jake brightens a little. ""Yeah, it's not bad. Check this out...""<br /> And he shows him a time zone display not just for every time<br /> zone in the world, but for the 86 largest metropolis. He hits a<br /> few buttons and from somewhere on the watch a voice says ""The<br /> time is eleven till six"" in a very West Texas accent. A few more<br /> buttons and the same voice says something in Japanese. Jake<br /> continues, ""I've put in regional accents for each city. The<br /> display is unbelievably high quality and the voice is simply<br /> astounding."" The stranger is struck dumb with admiration. </p>
<p>""That's not all..."", says Jake. He pushes a few more buttons and<br /> a tiny but very hi-resolution map of New York City appears on<br /> the display. ""The flashing dot shows our location by satellite<br /> positioning"", explains Jake. ""View recede ten,"" Jake says, and<br /> the display changes to show eastern New York state.</p>
<p>""I want to buy this watch!"" Says the stranger. </p>
<p>""Oh, no, it's not ready for sale yet; I'm still working out the<br /> bugs,"" says the inventor. ""But look at this,"" and he proceeds to<br /> demonstrate. ""The watch is also a very creditable little FM<br /> radio receiver with a digital tuner, a sonar device that can<br /> measure distances up to 125 meters, a pager with thermal paper<br /> printout and, most impressive of all, the capacity for voice<br /> recordings of up to 300 standard-size books, though I only have<br /> 32 of my favorites in there so far."" Says Jake.</p>
<p>""I've got to have this watch!"" Says the stranger. </p>
<p>""No, you don't understand; it's not ready.""</p>
<p>""I'll give you $1000 for it!""</p>
<p>""Oh, no, I've already spent more than...""</p>
<p>""I'll give you $5000 for it!""</p>
<p>""But it's just not...""</p>
<p>""I'll give you $15,000 for it!"" And the stranger pulls out a<br /> checkbook. </p>
<p>Jake stops to think. He's only put about $8,500 into materials<br /> and development, and with $15,000 he can make another one and<br /> have it ready for merchandising in only six months. The stranger<br /> frantically finishes writing the check and waves it in front of<br /> him. </p>
<p>""Here it is, ready to hand to you right here and now. $15,000.<br /> Take it or leave it."" </p>
<p>Jake abruptly makes his decision. ""OK"", he says, and peels off<br /> the watch and hands it to the stranger.</p>
<p>They make the exchange and the stranger starts happily away. </p>
<p>""Hey, wait a minute."" Calls Jake after the stranger, who turns<br /> around warily. Jake points to the two suitcases he had been<br /> trying to wrestle through the terminal. ""Don't forget your<br /> batteries.""</p>

<li>""Your seat cushions can be used for floatation, and in the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments.""</li>
<li>""We do feature a smoking section on this flight; if you must smoke, contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort you to the wing of the airplane.</li>
<li>Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane immediately.</li>
<li>Good morning. As we leave Dallas, it's warm, the sun is shining, and the birds are singing. We are going to Charlotte, where it's dark, windy and raining. Why in the world y'all wanna go there I really don't know.""</li>
<li>Pilot - ""Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I  am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till we land... it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern.""</li>
<li>And, after landing:  ""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.""</li>
<li>As we waited just off the runway for another airliner to cross in front of us, some of the passengers were beginning to retrieve luggage from the overhead bins.  The head steward announced on the intercom, ""This aircraft is equipped with a video surveillance system that monitors the cabin during taxiing.  Any passengers not remaining in their seats until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop at the gate will be strip-searched as they leave the aircraft.</li>
<li>As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella...WHOA..!</li>
<li>""Here are a few heard from Northwest: ""Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting children or adults acting like children.</li>
<li>As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.</li>

35153,"<p>Unusual Case<br /> by William A. Morton, Jr, MD</p>
<p>From ""Medical Aspects Of Human Sexuality""  July, 1991  p. 15</p>
<p>Scrotum Self-Repair</p>
<p>One morning, I was called to the emergency room by the head ER nurse. She directed me to a patient who had refused to describe his problem other than to say that he ""needed a doctor who took care of men's troubles."" The patient, about 40, was pale, febrile, and obviously uncomfortable, and had little to say as he gingerly opened his trousers to expose a bit of angry red skin and black-and-blue scrotal skin.</p>
<p>After I asked the nurse to leave us, the patient permitted me to remove his trousers, shorts, and two or three yards of foul-smelling stained gauze wrapped about his scrotum, which was swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit and extremely tender. A jagged zig-zag laceration, oozing pus and blood, extended down the left scrotum.</p>
<p>Amid the matted hair, edematous skin, and various exudates, I saw some<br /> half-buried dark linear objects and asked the patient what they were. Several days earlier, he replied, he had injured himself in the machine shop where he worked, and had closed the laceration with a heavy-duty stapling gun. The dark objects were one-inch staples of the type used in putting up wallboard.</p>
<p>We X-rayed the patient's scrotum to locate the staples; admitted him to the hospital; and gave him tetanus antitoxin, broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, and hexachlorophene sitz baths prior to surgery the next morning. The procedure consisted of exploration and debridement of the left side of the scrotal pouch. Eight rusty staples were retrieved, and the skin edges were trimmed and freshened. The left testis had been avulsed and was missing. The stump of the spermatic cord was recovered at the inguinal canal, debrided, and the vessels ligated properly, though not much of a hematoma was present. Through-and-through Penrose drains were sutured loosely in site, and the skin was loosely closed.</p>
<p>Convalescence was uneventful, and before his release from the hospital less than a week later, the patient confided the rest of his story to me. An unmarried loner, he usually didn't leave the machine shop during lunchtime with his co-workers. Finding himself alone, he had begun the regular practice of masturbating by holding his penis against the canvas drive belt of a large floor-based piece of running machinery. One day, as he approached orgasm, he lost his concentration and leaned too close to the belt. When his scrotum suddenly became caught between the pulley-wheel and the drive-belt, he was thrown into the air and landed a few feet away. Unaware that he had lost his left testis, and perhaps too stunned to feel much pain, he stapled the wound closed and resumed work. I can only assume he abandoned this method of self gratification.</p>

35158,"<p>A mother had three daughters and, on their wedding night, she tells each one to write back about their married life.</p>
<p>To avoid possible embarrassment to their new husbands by openly discussing their love lives, the mother and daughters agree to use newspaper advertisements as a 'code' to let the mother know how their love lives are going.</p>
<p>The first one gets married and the second day the letter arrives with a single message, simply: 'Maxwell House Coffee'.</p>
<p>The mother got the newspaper and checked the Maxwell House advertisement, and it says, 'Satisfaction to the last drop...' </p>
<p>So the mother is happy.</p>

Do you have any idea what you might do once you're released?""The patient thinks for a moment, then replies, ""Well, I went to school for mechanical engineering. That's still a good field, good money there. But on the other hand, I thought I might write a book about my experience here in the hospital, what it's like to be a patient here. People might be interested in reading a book like that. In addition, I thought I might go back to college and study art history, which I've grown interested in lately.""Dr. Jones nods and says, ""Yes, those all sound like intriguing possibilities.""The patient replies, ""And the best part is, in my spare time, I can go on being a teapot.""</p>

35168,"<p>Three desperately ill men met with their doctor one day to discuss their options. One was an alcoholic, one was a chain smoker, and one was a homosexual. The doctor, addressing all three of them, said, ""If any of you indulge in your vices one more time, you will surely die."" The men left the doctor's office, each convinced that he would never again indulge himself in his vice. While walking toward the subway for their return trip to the suburbs, they passed a bar. The alcoholic, hearing the loud music and seeing the lights, could not stop himself. His buddies accompanied him into the bar, where he had a shot of whiskey. No sooner had he replaced the shot glass on the bar, he fell off his stool, stone cold dead. His companions, somewhat shaken, left the bar, realising how seriously they must take the doctor's words. As they walked along, they came upon a cigarette butt lying on the ground, still burning. The homosexual looked at the chain smoker and said, ""If you bend over to pick that up, we're both dead.""</p>

35214,"<p>This is the private diary of a Viagra housewife...</p>
<p>Day 1<br /> Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to<br /> celebrate. When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, he<br /> locked himself in the bathroom and cried.</p>
<p>Day 2<br /> Today, he says he has a big secret to tell me. He's impotent, he<br /> says, and he wants me to be the first to know. Why doesn't he<br /> tell me something I don't know! I mean, he actually thinks I<br /> haven't noticed.</p>
<p>Day 3<br /> This marriage is in trouble. A woman has needs. Yesterday, I saw<br /> a picture of Nelson's Column and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Day 4<br /> A miracle has happened! There's a new drug on the market that<br /> will fix his ""problem."" It's called Viagra. I told him that if<br /> he takes Viagra, things will be just like they were on our<br /> wedding night. I think this will work. I replaced his Prozac<br /> with the Viagra, hoping to lift something other than his mood.</p>
<p>Day 5<br /> What absolute bliss!!</p>
<p>Day 6<br /> Isn't life wonderful?! But it's difficult to write while he's<br /> doing that.</p>
<p>Day 7<br /> This Viagra thing has gone to his head. No pun intended!<br /> Yesterday, at Burger King, the manager asked me if I'd like a<br /> Whopper. He thought they were talking about him. But, have to<br /> admit it's very nice - I don't think I've ever been so happy.</p>
<p>Day 8<br /> I think he took too many over the weekend. Yesterday, instead of<br /> mowing the lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed wacker.<br /> I'm also getting a bit sore down there.</p>
<p>Day 9<br /> No time to write. He might catch me.</p>
<p>Day 10<br /> Okay, I admit it. I'm hiding. I mean, a girl can only take so<br /> much. And to make matters worse, he's washing the Viagra down<br /> with neat whisky! What am I going to do? I feel tacky all<br /> over....</p>
<p>Day 11<br /> I'm basically being screwed to death. It's like living with a<br /> Black and Decker drill. I woke up this morning hot-glued to the<br /> bed. Even my armpits hurt. He's a complete pig.</p>
<p>Day 12<br /> I wish he was gay. I've stopped wearing make-up, cleaning my<br /> teeth or even washing but he still keeps coming after me! Even<br /> yawning has become dangerous...</p>
<p>Day 13<br /> Every time I shut my eyes, there's a sneak attack! It's like<br /> going to bed with a scud missile. I can hardly walk and if he<br /> tries that ""Oops, sorry"" thing again, I'll kill the bastard.</p>
<p>Day 14<br /> I've done everything to turn him off. Nothing is working. I even<br /> started dressing like a nun but this just seems to make him more<br /> horny. Help me!</p>
<p>Day 15<br /> I think I'll have to kill him. I'm starting to stick to<br /> everything I sit on. The cat and dog won't go near him and our<br /> friends don't come over any more. Last night I told him to go<br /> and fuck himself and he did.</p>
<p>Day 16<br /> The bastard has started to complain about headaches. I hope the<br /> bloody thing explodes. I did suggest he might try stopping the<br /> Viagra and going back on Prozac.</p>
<p>Day 17<br /> Switched the pills but it doesn't seem to have made any<br /> difference...Christ! Here he comes again!</p>
<p>Day 18<br /> He's back on Prozac. The lazy sod just sits there in front of<br /> the TV all day with that remote control in his hand and expects<br /> me to do everything for him. What absolute bliss!</p>

35215,"<p>A successful businessman flew to Vegas for the weekend to gamble. He lost the shirt off his back, and had nothing left but a quarter and the second half of his round trip ticket-If he could just get to the airport he could get himself home. So he went out to the front of the casino where there was a cab waiting. </p>
<p>He got in and explained his situation to the cabbie. He promised to send the driver money from home, he offered him his credit card numbers, his drivers license number, his address, etc. but to no avail. The cabbie said (adopt appropriate dialect), ""If you don't have fifteen dollars, get the hell out of my cab!"" </p>
<p>So the businessman was forced to hitch-hike to the airport and was barely in time to catch his flight. </p>
<p>One year later the businessman, having worked long and hard to regain his financial success, returned to Vegas and this time he won big. Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. </p>
<p>The businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy payfor his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan. He got into the first cab in the line, ""How much for a ride to the airport,"" he asked? </p>
<p>""Fifteen bucks,"" came the reply. ""And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?"" </p>
<p>""What??? Get the hell out of my cab!!"" </p>
<p>The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions,... with the same result. When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked ""How much for a ride to the airport?"" The cabbie replied ""fifteen bucks."" </p>
<p>The businessman said ""ok"" and off they went. </p>
<p>As they drove past the cabs in the long line, the businessman gave a big smile and thumbs-up sign to each driver.</p>

35217,"<p>The Lord spoke to Noah and said, ""Noah, in six months I am going to make it rain until the whole world is covered with water and all the evil things are destroyed. But, I want to save a few good people and two of every living thing on the planet. I am ordering you to build an ark."" And, in a flash of lightning, he delivered the specifications for the ark.</p>
<p>""OK,"" Noah said, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints, ""I'm your man.""</p>
<p>""Six months and it starts to rain,"" thundered the Lord. ""You better have my ark completed or learn to swim for a long, long time!""</p>
<p>Six months passed, the sky began to cloud up, and the rain began to fall in  torrents. The Lord looked down and saw Noah sitting in his yard, weeping, and there was no ark.</p>
<p>""Noah!"" shouted the Lord, ""where is My ark?"" A lightning bolt crashed into the ground right beside Noah.</p>
<p>""Lord, please forgive me!"" begged Noah. ""I did my best, but there were some big problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the ark'sconstruction, but your plans did not meet their code. So, I had to hire an engineer to redo the plans, only to get into a long argument with him about whether to include a fire-sprinkler system.""</p>
<p>My neighbors objected, claiming that I was violating zoning ordinances by building the ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city planning board.""</p>
<p>""Then, I had a big problem getting enough wood for the ark, because there was a ban on cutting trees to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince the environmentalists and the Ministry of Natural Resources that I needed the wood to save the owls, but they wouldn't let me catch them, so no owls.""</p>
<p>""Next, I started gathering up the animals but got sued by an animal rights group that objected to me taking along only two of each kind.""</p>
<p>""Just when the suit got dismissed, Environment Canada notified me that I couldn't complete the ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your proposed flood. They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being.""</p>
<p>""Then, the Conservation Authority wanted a map of the proposed flood plan. I sent them a globe!""</p>
<p>""Right now, I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights Commission over how many minorities I'm supposed to hire.""</p>
<p>""Revenue Canada has seized all my assets claiming that I am trying to leave the country, and I just got a notice from the province that I owe some kind of use tax. Really, I don't think I can finish the ark in less than five years.""</p>
<p>With that, the sky cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow arched across the sky.</p>
<p>Noah looked up and smiled.  ""You mean you are not going to destroy the world?""  he asked hopefully.</p>
<p>""No,"" said the Lord, ""the government already has!""</p>

35220,"<p>One fine day in Ireland, a guy is out golfing and gets up to the 16th hole. He tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the fairway.He goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. 'Goodness,' says the golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy.Upon awaking, the little guy says, 'Well, you caught me fair and square. I am a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes.'The man says, 'I can't take anything from you, I'm just glad I didn't hurt you too badly,' and walks away.Watching the golfer depart, the leprechaun thinks, 'Well, he was a nice enough guy, and he did catch me, so I have to do something for him. I'll give him the three things that I would want. I'll give him unlimited money, a great golf game, and a great sex life.'Well, a year goes past (as they often do in jokes like this) and the same golfer is out golfing on the same course at the 16th hole. He gets up and hits one into the same woods and goes off looking for his ball. When he finds the ball he sees the same little guy and asks how he is doing.The leprechaun says, 'I'm fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?'The golfer says, 'It's great! I hit under par every time.'The leprechaun says, 'I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is holding out?'The golfer says, 'Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note.'The leprechaun smiles and says, 'I did that for you. And might I ask how your sex life is?'The golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, 'Well, maybe once or twice a week.'The leprechaun is floored and stammers, 'Once or twice a week?!'The golfer, a little embarrassed, looks at him and says, 'Well, that's not too bad for a Catholic priest in a small parish.'</p>

<p>One day, after about six months, she came in and said she would have to quit. ""But why?"" asked the disappointed wife.</p>

35250,"<p>A man was looking around a small gift shop when he came across an amazingly<br /> ugly statue of a rat. As he was staring at this statue, the shopkeeper came up<br /> to him and began to speak.<br /> ""Sir, I couldn't help but notice your interest in the statue. It's only five<br /> dollars, sir, but the story behind it will cost you fifty."" The man turned back<br /> around and looked in shock.<br /> ""Let me get this straight. If I buy the statue and the story behind it, I'll<br /> be paying fifty-five dollars. But if I can bear to live without the story, I'll<br /> only pay five?""<br /> The Shopkeeper grinned and nodded. Not believing what a bargain he'd got, the<br /> man quickly paid and walked out of the store. A few moments later, he noticed<br /> that a lone rat was following him. He shrugged, and ignored the rodent, hoping<br /> it would leave. When he looked back again, some five minutes later, he saw that<br /> the number of rodents had grown to maybe fifty rats. A little nervous, he turned<br /> back to his path and continued walking.<br /> When he looked around the third time, he saw thousands of rats following him.<br /> Horribly frightened, the man rushed to a dock overlooking the ocean and threw<br /> the statue as far out to sea as he possibly could. The rats followed the statue,<br /> sinking into the waves like stones.<br /> The man then rushed back to the shop, elated, panicked, and still in shock.<br /> When he burst through the door, the shopkeeper gave a little chuckle. He had a<br /> smug grin on his face as he said,<br /> ""I expect you've come back to buy the story."" The shopkeeper held out his hand<br /> for the fifty dollars. The customer looked confused for a second, then said.<br /> ""Hell no! I want to know if you've got a statue of a lawyer!""</p>

35261,"<p>One day, a 12 year old boy walks into a whorehouse dragging a<br /> dead frog on a string. He stomps up to the counter and says to<br /> the madam, ""I wanna woman.""</p>
<p>""I'm sorry,"" she says, ""but we don't let boys your age have a<br /> woman."" The little boy slams a hundred dollar bill down on the<br /> counter and says, ""I wanna woman!"" So the madam asks him what<br /> kind of woman he wants.</p>
<p>""A skanky one,"" he replies. ""I want her to have AIDS, Syphilis,<br /> crabs, the works. I want the nastiest whore in the place.""</p>
<p>Offended, the madam says, ""We don't have women like that here.""<br /> So the boy slams another hundred down, and the madam points to a<br /> room down the hall and says ""last door on the right.""</p>
<p>The boy walks down the hall, dragging his dead frog on a string,<br /> and goes into the room. He screws the hell out of the woman, and<br /> then leaves (still dragging his dead frog on a string). Just as<br /> he's getting ready to leave, the madam calls him over and asks<br /> why on earth he would want someone so nasty.</p>
<p>""Well, it's like this,"" he says, ""I'm gonna go home about seven<br /> o'clock tonight, and I'm gonna have sex with my babysitter. Then<br /> when mom and dad come home about nine o' clock, dad's gonna take<br /> the babysitter home, and he's gonna screw her.

In the morning, dad will leave for work, and the milkman<br /> will stop by, and mom will have sex with him. Now here's where<br /> it all comes down you see!!

35262,"<p>A man goes to the confessional and begins ""Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.""</p>
<p>""What is your sin, my son?"" the priest asks back.""Well,"" the man starts, ""I used some horrible language this week and I feel absolutely terrible."" ""When did you use this awful language?"" asks the priest.</p>
<p>""I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was going to go over 250 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only about 100 yards.""</p>
<p>""Is that when you swore?"" ""No, Father,"" says the man.</p>
<p>""After that, a squirrel ran out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in his mouth and began to run away.""</p>
<p>""Is THAT when you swore?"" asks the Father again. ""Well, no,"" says the man.</p>
<p>""You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!""</p>
<p>""Is THAT when you swore?"" asks the amazed Priest. ""No, not yet,"" the man replies.</p>
<p>""As the eagle carried the squirrel away in his claws, it flew toward the green. As it passed over a a bit of forest near the green, the squirrel dropped my ball.""</p>
<p>""Did you swear THEN?"" asks the now impatient Priest.</p>
<p>""No, because as the ball fell it struck a tree, bounced through some bushes, careened off a big rock, and rolled through a sand trap onto the green and stopped within six inches of the hole.""</p>
<p>The Priest sighs, ""You missed the putt, didn't you?!?""</p>
"
35263,"<p>""Oh, no!"" he gasped as he surveyed the disaster before him. Never in his 40<br /> years of life had he seen anything like it. How anyone could have survived he<br /> did not know. He could only hope that somewhere amid the overwhelming<br /> destruction he would find his 16-year-old son. Only the slim hope of finding<br /> Danny kept him from turning and fleeing the scene.<br /> He took a deep breath and proceeded. Walking was virtually impossible with so<br /> many things strewn across his path. He moved ahead slowly. ""Danny! Danny!"" he<br /> whispered to himself.<br /> He tripped and almost fell several times. He heard someone, or something,<br /> move. At least he thought he did. Perhaps, he was just hoping he did. He shook<br /> his head and felt his gut tighten. He couldn't understand how this could have<br /> happened. There was some light but not enough to see very much. Something cold<br /> and wet brushed against his hand. He jerked it away.<br /> In desperation, he took another step then cried out, ""Danny!""<br /> From a nearby pile of unidentified material, he heard his son. ""Yes, Dad,"" he<br /> said, in a voice so weak it could hardly be heard.<br /> ""It's time to get up and get ready for school,"" the man sighed, ""And for<br /> heaven's sake, clean up this room!""</p>

<p>""No"" replied the blind man, "" I do not have to see it, all I have to do is smell it"".He then asked the manager to test him on this by placing any size and type of lumber he wanted on his desk and without touching it he would identify it. </p>

35300,"<p>Bush and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all. They sat down and<br /> decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. They would have 5 years<br /> to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side's dog won would<br /> be entitled to dominate the world.<br /> Osama found the biggest, meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the<br /> world and bred them with the meanest Siberian wolves. They selected only the<br /> biggest and strongest puppy from the litter, and removed his siblings, which<br /> gave him all the milk. After 5 years, they came up with the biggest, meanest dog<br /> the world had ever seen. Its cage needed steel bars that were 5 "" thick and<br /> nobody could get near it. </p>
<p>When the day came for the dog fight, Bush showed up with a strange looking<br /> animal. It was a 9 foot long Dachshund. Everyone felt sorry for Bush because<br /> there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the<br /> Afghanistani dog. When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it's<br /> cage, and slowly waddled over towards Osama's dog. Osama's dog snarled and<br /> leaped out of its cage and charged the American Dachshund---but when it got<br /> close enough to bite, the Dachshund opened its mouth and consumed Osama's dog in<br /> one bite. There was nothing left of his dog at all. </p>
<p>Osama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, ""We don't understand how<br /> this could have happened. We had our best people working for 5 years with the<br /> meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest,<br /> meanest Siberian wolves."" </p>
<p>""That's nothing,"", said Bush. ""We had Michael Jackson's plastic surgeons<br /> working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog."" </p>

35334,"<p>Bill Gates, Andy Grove, &amp; Jerry sanders (CEOs of Microsoft, Intel &amp; AMD) were in a high-powered business meeting. During the serious, tense discussions, a beeping noise was suddenly emitted from where Bill was sitting.</p>
<p>Bill said : ""Oh! that's my emergency beeper. Gentlemen, excuse me, I really need to take this call.: So Bill lifted his wrist-watch to his ear and began talking into the end of his tie. Having completed the call, he noticed the others were staring at him. So Bill explained : ""Oh, this is my new emergency communication system. I have an earpiece built into my watch and a microphone sewn into the end of my tie. That way, I can take a call anywhere."" The others nodded, and the meeting continued.</p>
<p>5 min later, the discussion was again interrupted when this time round, from Andy started a beeping sound. ""Oh that's my emergency beeper"" he said. ""Excuse me gentlemen, this must be an important call."" Andy tapped his earlobe and began talking into thin air. When he completed the call, he noticed the others staring at him and thus explained, ""I also have an emergency communication system. But my earpiece is actually implanted in my earlobe, and the microphone is embedded in this fake tooth, isn't that neat?""</p>
<p>The others nodded and the meeting continue. Later still, the discussion was again interrupted when Jerry emitted a thunderous fart. He looked up at the others staring at him and said, ""Uhh, somebody get me a piece of paper..... I'm receiving a FAX.""</p>

35336,"<p>One day 3 guys met in a hotel. A gambler who always won money, A<br /> show off, and a lonely guy who had no friends. This lonely guy<br /> needed money. He decided to place a bet with the gambler and the<br /> show off. He knew that there was a huge problem with his watch,<br /> but he didn't know what, so he decided to place a bet with it.<br /> We will all throw our watch out the window on the 14th floor the<br /> lonely guy said.<br /> You will have to run down those stairs, go out the door, and<br /> catch it. The person who catches it at the bottom wins. If no<br /> one catches it no one wins anything. The other two guys thought<br /> this was realy dumb, but they decided to give it a shot. The<br /> gambler went first. He got to the 6th floor when the watch hit<br /> the ground. MAN! The show off went next. He got to the 4th floor<br /> when it hit the ground. SHOOT! The lonely guy went last. He<br /> threw it out the window. He walked down the stairs, went to his<br /> favorite coffee shop, went home to watch his favorite television<br /> show, and came back and caught the watch. They both owed him<br /> $500.00! Wow the 2 guys said. Here's your money. But how did you<br /> do that? The lonely guy finally found out what was wrong with<br /> his watch. I don't know how I won he said. I guess my watch is<br /> slow.</p>

35349,"<p>I know the myth is that men want Traci Lords in the bedroom, Julia Child in the kitchen, Hazel around the house, Lesley Visser during a game, Mary Poppins for the children, Cha Cha Muldowney in traffic, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Chick when we're sick, Mary Richards at work, Mother Theresa when we come home with leprosy, Gertrude Stein in conversation, the body of Sophia Loren in 'Boy on a Dolphin' combined with the voice of Sade, and to top it all off, the IQ of Anna Nicole Smith, because of course we don't want to feel too threatened. So if that's the myth of what we want, what's the reality? Well, first put that Cosmo article down right now and back slowly away from the magazine. Now go to the window and take a deep breath. You must clear your head of bullshit articles like ""How to Trick Your Man into Cooking Tex-Mex"". Trick me? How about asking me? And then I'll be able to tell you I don't have a fucking clue what Tex-Mex is, okay?! All right, I'm not supposed to do this. I'm not supposed to reveal the master list to all you non-tripods, but what the hell; here goes: Here's what men want from women.</p>
<p>One through Ten: </p>
<p>ONE- We want you to understand that we don't give a shit about clothes, all right? Yours OR ours. All we need is one pair of tennies and one pair of church shoes. That's it. </p>
<p>TWO- Don't talk to us while the television is on, all right? Very simple: Television is off, we talk. Television is on, we don't talk. </p>
<p>THREE- When you're behind the wheel of a car, if you want to get aggressive, that's fine, but don't give somebody the finger and expect me to defend your honor when Steroid Lad comes over swinging a pair of nunchucks, all right? </p>
<p>FOUR- Would it kill you to watch 'The Godfather' with me for the fifty-seventh time? </p>
<p>FIVE- Hey I'm sorry, but some of us see a beautiful sunset and think, ""You know, I betcha my accountant is boning me up the ass."" </p>
<p>SIX- You go see Nell by yourself, all right? I met enough chicks like that at ""The Drink"" when I was single. </p>
<p>SEVEN- Have a sense of humor. Without a sense of humor, a relationship lasts about as long David Duke at a Black Panther meeting. </p>
<p>EIGHT- Work out your job-related anger before we have sex. Just because Helmut, the office boy, brought you the cup of lima bean consomme instead of the bowl of lima bean consomme from Soup Plantation, I don't want to end up in the friction burn groin ward at Cedars-Sinai, all right? </p>
<p>NINE- Don't ask us to cry. As much as you say you want us to cry, you don't really want us to cry. You hate it when we cry. I've tried crying in front of my wife. She enjoyed it for about thirty seconds and then started thinking, ""Why in the fuck did I marry this hamster?"" </p>
<p>TEN- be patient. Hold us. Love us unconditionally. Help us out of this testosterone-induced fog we dwell in and lead us into the light. Or if that's asking too much, how's about a big sloppy blowjob once in a while?</p>

<p>Three hours later the police officer returned to the same area and,<br /> sure enough, the blonde is still waiting at the same bus stop. </p>

35352,"<p>There were three men stranded on an island. They had been there for a very long time, when one morning a magic lamp washed up on the shore. The men saw it and picked it up. The men rubbed the lamp and a genie appeared. After the genie rose up he granted the men one wish each. The first man thought about his wish and made it count. After thinking, the man finally said, ""I wish I was back at home."" Then, poof, he disappeared. The second man thought about his wish also. Finally, the man said, ""I wish I was at home with my family."" Then, poof, he vanished. The last wish went to the last man on the island. He looked around and felt very lonely. It took a while to think of a good wish and finally an idea came to him. The third man said, ""I wish that my two best friends were back on this island with me.""

35353,"<p>The bride tells her husband, ""Honey, you know I'm a virgin and I don't know anything about sex. Can you explain it to me first?""</p>
<p>""OK, Sweetheart, putting it simply, we will call your private place 'the prison' and call my private thing 'the prisoner'.</p>
<p>So what we do is: put the prisoner in the prison.</p>
<p>And then they made love for the first time. Afterwards, the guy is lying face up on the bed, smiling with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Nudging him, his bride giggles, ""Honey, the prisoner seems to have escaped.""</p>
<p>Turning on his side, he smiles. ""Then we will have to re-imprison him.""</p>
<p>After the second time they spent, the guy reaches for his cigarettes.</p>
<p>But the girl, thoroughly enjoying the new experience of making love, gives him a suggestive smile, ""Honey, the prisoner is out again!""</p>
<p>The man rises to the occasion, but with the unsteady legs of a recently born foal. Afterwards, he lays back on the bed, totally exhausted.</p>
<p>She nudges him and says, ""Honey, the prisoner escaped again.""</p>
<p>Limply turning his head, He yells at her, ""Hey, it's not life imprisonment!""</p>

"
35373,"<p>It was the first day of school and a new student named Suzuki, the son of a<br /> Japanese businessman, entered the fourth grade.</p>
<p>The teacher said, ""Let's begin by reviewing some American history. Who said<br /> ""Give me Liberty, or give me Death?""</p>
<p>She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Suzuki, who had his hand up.<br /> ""Patrick Henry, 1775.""</p>
<p>""Very good! Who said 'Government of the people, by the people, for the<br /> people, shall not perish from the earth'""?</p>
<p>Again, no response except from Suzuki: ""Abraham Lincoln, 1863.""</p>
<p>The teacher snapped at the class, ""Class, you should be ashamed. Suzuki who<br /> is new to our country, knows more about its history than you do.""</p>
<p>She heard a loud whisper: ""F--k the Japanese.""</p>
<p>""Who said that?"" she demanded.</p>
<p>Suzuki put his hand up. ""Lee I Acocca, 1982.""</p>
<p>At that point, a student in the back sighed, ""I'm gonna puke.""</p>
<p>The teacher glares and asks 'All right! Now, who said that?""</p>
<p>Again, Suzuki says, ""George Bush to Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.""</p>
<p>Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!""</p>
<p>Suzuki jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher,</p>
<p>""Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!""</p>
<p>Now with almost a mob hysteria someone said, "" You little shit if you ever<br /> say anything else I will have you killed.""</p>
<p>Suzuki is frantic and yells at the top of his voice,</p>
<p>""Gary Condit to Chandra Levy 2001.""</p>
<p>The teacher fainted.</p>

35377,"<p>13&gt; It had been tough growing up in the spotlight, alone, separated from her by the jail house bars of a system that didn't understand their love.  But someday they would be together again, and he would wait, counting the days until she was released. After all, it was Mary who had turned him from a little lamb into a young ram.</p>
<p>12&gt; His nose was cold.  Colder than any nose that dared sniff her before.  She backed further into his muzzle.</p>
<p>11&gt; The muscular ram grabbed her by the wooly tuft on the back of her neck and with a sinful gleam in his eye said, ""You've been a very baa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aad girl.""</p>
<p>10&gt; His torrid affair with the donkey left him smelling like ass.</p>
<p> 9&gt; His every pant brought forth a musky scent, and he growled low in his throat and said, ""Moan like a human, bitch!""</p>
<p> 8&gt; My master crossed his legs provocatively, dangling one taut lean calf over his knee. As his leg bobbed rhythmically, his cuff climbed higher, revealing--  Hey! A squirrel!</p>
<p> 7&gt; Squeezing his octopus companion tightly with his tentacles, Oliver felt shame as he prematurely released his ink.</p>
<p> 6&gt; Polly's new man was like all the others.  He never seemed to ask what she really wanted, choosing instead to insistently repeat his offer of a cracker.</p>
<p> 5&gt; Timmy and Sally rested for several seconds, then began anew. Then rested again.  Followed by more loving.  A brief nap. Once again with the coitus.  The bunnies simply could not help themselves.</p>
<p> 4&gt; In all of the streams in all of the mountains in all of the northwest, she had to come swimming into mine.  Not really a surprise, I suppose.  We all *had* to swim into this particular stream... or die trying.</p>
<p> 3&gt; He didn't need the love of a female.  He didn't need a male, either, for that matter.  He was a worm.  He had it all.</p>
<p> 2&gt; ""Hold me closer,"" the gorgeous white kitten purred.  ""Closer,  closer... now leave me alone!  Don't look at me -- I'll go over here.  Okay, now hold me closer again....""</p>
<p>1&gt; ""Your bulging green eyes, your powerful jaws -- I think I'm losing my head over you, darling."" ""You have no idea how right you are, loverboy.""</p>

""Yes, Jimmy?<br /> What can I do for you?""<br /> Seizing the opportunity, Jimmy asked, ""God?  What is a million years like to<br /> you?""<br /> Knowing that Jimmy could not understand the concept of infinity, God responded<br /> in a manner to which Jimmy could relate.  ""A<br /> million years to me, Jimmy, is like a minute.""<br /> ""Oh,"" said Jimmy.  ""Well, then, what's a million dollars like to you?""<br /> ""A million dollars to me, Jimmy, is like a penny.""<br /> ""Wow!"" remarked Jimmy, getting an idea.

35432,"<p>******************************************************************WARNING, CAUTION, DANGER, AND BEWARE! Gullibility Virus Spreading over the Internet!******************************************************************WASHINGTON, D.C.-The Institute for the Investigation of Irregular Internet Phenomena announced today that many Internet users are becoming infected by a new virus that causes them to believe without question every groundless story, legend, and dire warning that shows up in their inbox or on their browser.  The Gullibility Virus, as it is called, apparently makes people believe and forward copies of silly hoaxes relating to cookie recipes, e-mail viruses, taxes on modems, and get-rich-quick schemes.'These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy lottery tickets based on fortune cookie numbers', a spokesman said.  'Most are otherwise normal people, who would laugh at the same stories if told to them by a stranger on a street corner'.  However, once these same people become infected with the Gullibility Virus, they believe anything they read on the Internet.'My immunity to tall tales and bizarre claims is all gone', reported one weeping victim.  'I believe every warning message and sick child story my friends forward to me, even though most of the messages are anonymous.'Another victim, now in remission, added, 'When I first heard about Good Times, I just accepted it without question.  After all, there were dozens of other recipients on the mail header, so I thought the virus must be true'.  It was a long time, the victim said, before she could stand up at a Hoaxees Anonymous meeting and state, 'My name is Jane, and I've been hoaxed'.  Now, however, she is spreading the word. 'Challenge and check whatever you read,' she says. Internet users are urged to examine themselves for symptoms of the virus, which include the following:-- The willingness to believe improbable stories without thinking.-- The urge to forward multiple copies of such stories to others.-- A lack of desire to take three minutes to check to see if a story is true.T.C. is an example of someone recently infected. He told one reporter, 'I read on the Net that the major ingredient in almost all shampoos makes your hair fall out, so I've stopped using shampoo'. When told about the Gullibility Virus, T. C. said he would stop reading e-mail, so that he would not become infected.Anyone with symptoms like these is urged to seek help immediately. Experts recommend that at the first feelings of gullibility, Internet users rush to their favorite search engine and look up the item tempting them to thoughtless credence.  Most hoaxes, legends, and tall tales have been widely discussed and exposed by the Internet community. Courses in critical thinking are also widely available, and there is on-line help from many sources, including:-- Department of Energy Computer Incident Advisory Capability at http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html-- Symantec Anti Virus Research Center at http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/index.html-- McAfee Associates Virus Hoax List at http://www.mcafee.com/support/hoax.html-- Dr. Solomons Hoax Page at http://www.drsolomons.com/vircen/hoax.html-- The Urban Legends Web Site at http://www.urbanlegends.com-- Urban Legends Reference Pages at http://www.snopes.com-- Datafellows Hoax Warnings at http://www.Europe.Datafellows.com/news/hoax.htmThose people who are still symptom free can help inoculate themselves against the Gullibility Virus by reading some good material on evaluating sources, such as:-- Evaluating Internet Research Sources at http://www.sccu.edu/faculty/R_Harris/evalu8it.htm-- Evaluation of Information Sources at http://www.vuw.ac.nz/~agsmith/evaln/evaln.htm-- Bibliography on Evaluating Internet Resources at http://refserver.lib.vt.edu/libinst/critTHINK.HTMIt *is* possible to design responsible alerts for people to circulate on the Internet.  Here is a how-to that draws positive conclusions from long experience with the evils of badly designed alerts:-- Designing Effective Action Alerts for the Internet at http://weber.ucsd.edu/~pagre/alerts.htmlLastly, as a public service, Internet users can help stamp out the Gullibility Virus by sending copies of this message to anyone who forwards them a hoax.</p>

<p>Reading his mom's thoughts, John volunteered, ""I know what you must be<br /> thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just roommates."" </p>
<p>About a week later, Julie came to John and said, ""Ever since your mother came<br /> to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful gravy ladle. You don't suppose<br /> she took it, do you?""</p>
<p>John said, ""Well, I doubt it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure�.</p>
<p>So, he sat down and wrote, ""Dear Mother, I'm not saying you 'did' take a gravy<br /> ladle from my house, and I'm not saying you 'did not' take a gravy ladle. But,<br /> the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for<br /> dinner.""</p>

<p>El ejecutivo mira por el espejo retrovisor y ve que la vaca casi lo alcanza y acelera a m�s de 100 km/h, mira por el espejo retrovisor y ve que la vaca est� detr�s de ellos. Entonces acelera a 150 km/h y la vaca detr�s de ellos, acelera a 180 km/h y mira por el espejo retrovisor. Ve que la vaca va sacando la lengua, recarg�ndola hacia el lado izquierdo y le dice al rancherito:</p>
<p>""Creo que tu vaca ya se cans�.""</p>
<p>A lo cual el rancherito pregunta:</p>
<p>""�Por qu� dice eso?""</p>
<p>El ejecutivo le contesta:</p>
<p>""Porque va sacando la lengua.""</p>
<p>Y el rancherito le pregunta:</p>

<p>She had always wanted a parrot, but had found them to be too expensive, so she rushed in and asked the proprietor, ""Why is this parrot so cheap?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" he replied, ""You see, that parrot was in a brothel for awhile, and learned some bad language, so nobody seems to want it.""</p>
<p>How bad could it be?, the woman thought.<br /> Finally, she decided to buy it anyway, as it was such a beautiful bird. She took it home in a cage and put it on the table.</p>

35456,"<p>Due to budget constraints, the following corporate policies are announced regarding employees traveling on official business. The policies are effective immediately.</p>
<p>Transportation:<br /> Hitchhiking in lieu of commercial transportation is strictly encouraged. Luminescent safety vests will be issued to all employees prior to their departure on company business trips. Bus service will be another prime method of transportation. Airline tickets will only be authorized for purchase in extreme circumstances, and only the lower fares will be used. If, for example, a meeting is scheduled in Seattle, but a lower fare can be obtained by traveling to Detroit, then travel to Detroit will be substituted for travel to Seattle.</p>
<p>Lodging:<br /> All employees are encouraged to stay with relatives or friends while on company business. If weather permits, public areas such as parks and parking lots should be used as temporary lodging. Bridges may provide shelter in periods of inclement weather.</p>
<p>Meals:<br /> Meals expense are cut to the absolute minimum. It should be noted that some grocery chains provide free samples of promotional items. Entire meals may be obtained in this manner. Travelers should also become familiar with indigenous roots, berries, and other protein sources available enroute to their destination. If restaurants must be utilized, travels should seek places offering ""all  you can eat"" salad bars. This will be especially cost effective for employees traveling together, as a single plate could be used to feed an entire group. Employees are also encouraged to bring their own food while on company business. Cans of tuna, Spam, Pork-N-Beans, etc. can be conveniently consumed at your leisure without the unnecessary bother of heating or other costly preparation.</p>
<p>Entertainment:<br /> Entertainment while traveling is strictly discouraged. If such extravagances are required on customer contracts, the customer should be encouraged top pick up the tab. Such action will save the company money, and will convince the customers that we are concerned about providing a good product, not spending money on useless frivolities. The hospitality provided to customers who will visit our facilities should also be tasteful, yet cost effective. In lieu of extravagant dinners, a picnic bench will be provided in the parking lot, next to the dumpster, and a garden hose will be made available so that liquid refreshment can be furnished to our guests.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous:<br /> All employees are encouraged to employ innovative techniques in our team effort to save corporate dollars. One enterprising individual has already suggested that the money raised during airport layover periods could be used to defray travel costs. In support of this idea, ""Red Caps"" will be  issued to all departing employees. Tips can be earned by helping others with their luggage. Also, when you are in a restaurant don't forget to pick up little things like packs of sugar and packaged condiments for our company cafeteria.</p>

<p>3. Obtain the cat and soothe him while you carry him to the bathroom. </p>
<p>4. In one smooth movement, put the cat into the toilet and close both lids. (You may need to stand on the top so he cannot escape.) CAUTION: Do not get any part of your body too close to the cat, as his paws will be reaching for anything they can find. </p>
<p>5. Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a ""power wash and rinse"" which I have found to be quite effective. </p>
<p>6. Have someone open the back door and ensure that there are no people between the toilet and the garden. </p>
<p>7. Stand behind the toilet as much as you can and lift both lids quickly. </p>
<p>8. The freshly cleaned cat will rocket out of the toilet and run outside, where he will dry himself. </p>

35460,"<p>An old farmer, attending a fair with his wife, Bessie, was much taken with the open-cockpit airplane in which fairgoers could buy a ride. The $5 fee was rather steep for him, so he began to bargain with the pilot. The pilot, annoyed, said, ""I'll make a deal with you. I'll take you up for nothing if you keep your mouths shut. But if either of you makes a single sound, you pay the full $5.""</p>
<p>""Done,"" the farmer said.</p>
<p>The couple climbed into the plane and wedged themselves into the cockpit well behind the pilot's seat, and the pilot took off.</p>
<p>There was dead silence behind, which surprised the pilot, who counted on the splendid view to elicit cries of admiration and, therefore, his full fee. Suddenly, the pilot banked and went into a series of loops and spins designed to force cries of dismay from even the stoutest heart. Yet still there was absolute silence from the farmer and his wife. Defeated, the pilot landed his craft.</p>
<p>Helping the farmer out of the plane, the pilot said, ""I have to hand it to you. You sure kept your mouths shut. Both""</p>
<p>""Yup,"" said the farmer, ""For a minute there I thought Bessie'd give a little scream when she fell out.""</p>

"
35483,"<p>1. Because baby eats. Eating is a messy job for a baby. If you wrap a baby in a towel sized bib...baby will find the tiny gap of space left around the neck and dump food in.</p>
<p>2. Because baby sleeps. Sleeping is an unplanned job for baby. If you don't have a clean dry diaper on baby when baby decides to doze...or even if you do...baby will figure out a way to sleep and still whiz on everything.</p>
<p>3. Because baby drools. Baby may look clean to the unexpecting admirer... but beware of picking up the little water fountain unless your clothing has flood insurance.</p>
<p>4. Because baby moves. If your house is spotless...baby will find spot.</p>
<p>5. Because baby has Grandma. Grandma thinks the little suit with ears and a tail is SOOOOOO CUTE!!! Not to mention the Santa suit, pumpkin suit, turkey suit, bunny suit, or cowboy suit.</p>
<p>6. Because baby grows. Size 1 today...size 3 on Wednesday...</p>
<p>7. Because baby things disappear. Even washing machines enjoy a light lunch once in a while.</p>
<p>8. Because baby has relatives. Aunt Bertha made a bright orange sundress out of wool for baby. Gee...let's see if the washing machine has eaten today...</p>
<p>9. Because baby hates getting dressed. If mom cannot get baby in and out of clothing easily and quickly during any part of any day or night...that set of annoying clothing will be gift wrapped and sent to one of the in-laws..</p>
<p>10. Because baby travels. It is not humanly possible to carry around all of the clothing a baby will need. Therefore, stashes of baby clothing must be hidden all over the neighborhood. (If you happen to find someone else's stash and the clothes look cleaner...just trade...they will probably be too tired to notice...)</p>

35492,"<p>One day, a guy was on his way home from work when the most remarkable thing happened. Traffic was heavy as usual, and as he sat there at a red light, out of nowhere a bird slammed into his windshield. If that wasn't strange enough, the poor creature got its wing stuck under the windshield wiper. Just then the light turned green and there the guy was with a bird stuck on his windshield. Without any other apparent options, he turned on the windshield wipers to try to get rid of the bird. It actually worked. On the upswing, the bird flew off, and it slammed right onto the windshield of the car behind him. Unfortunately, the car behind him was a police car. Immediately the lights went on and he was forced to pull over. The officer walked up and told him that he saw what had happened at the light. Trying to plead his case fell on deaf ears. The officer simply stated, ''I am going to have to write you up for flipping me the bird.''</p>

<p>9.If you have `cleared' all the rooms and met no resistance, you and your entry team have probably kicked in the door of the wrong house. </p>
<p>10.If a cop swings a baton in a fight, he will hit other cops more often than he will hit the bad guys he swings at. </p>
<p>11.Domestic arguments will always migrate from an area of few available weapons (living room), to an area with many available weapons (kitchen). </p>
<p>12.If you have just punched out a handcuffed prisoner for spitting at you, you are about to become a star on `Eyewitness News'. </p>

35521,"<p>One day a Pope and a lawyer die. They arrive at the Pearly Gates together and are ushered in. Angel Gabriel accompanies them with much fanfare on his trumpet. </p>
<p>Gabriel leads the two along a huge corridor lined with doors. After a while he stops at one of the doors and opens it. He tells the Pope, ''this is your room, I hope it is satisfactory''. The Pope sees that the room has a bed, chair, desk and a small radio/TV. </p>
<p>Gabriel then leads the lawyer to the end of the hall, and stops at a huge double-doorway. He opens the massive door and the lawyer is stunned to see a kingsize waterbed, a pool table, a massive home entertainment unit and a well stocked wine bar. The lawyer gasped when told that this was his room. ''There must be some mistake!'' exclaimed the lawyer. ''Surely a room so grand as this would be reserved for someone like the Pope''. </p>
<p>Angel Gabriel turned to the lawyer and said, ''Oh,no, there is no mistake. We have dozens of Popes. But you are our first lawyer!!''</p>

35545,"<p>This is more embarrassing for my mother than for me because I wasn't quite four years old when it happened. My mother taught me to read when I was 3 years old (her first mistake). One day, I was in the bathroom and noticed one of the cabinet door was ajar. I read the box in the cabinet. I then asked my mother why she was keeping napkins in the bathroom. Didn't they belong in the kitchen? Not wanting to burden me with unnecessary facts she told me that those were for special occasions. Now fast forward a few months. It's Thanksgiving Day, and my folks are leaving to pick up the pastor and his wife for dinner. Mom had assignments for all of us while they were gone. Mine was to set the table. When they returned, the pastor came in first and immediately burst into laughter. Next came his wife who gasped, then began giggling. Next came my father, who roared with laughter. Then came mom, who almost died of embarrassment when she saw each place setting on the table with a 'special occasion' napkin at each plate, with the fork carefully arranged on top. I had even tucked the little tails in so they didn't hang off the edge. My mother asked me why I used these and, of course, my response sent the other adults into further fits of laughter. 'But Mom, you SAID they were for special occasions!</p>

35552,"<p>During the French revolution, hundreds of people were guillotined. One<br /> day, three men were led up to die. One was a lawyer, one was a doctor,<br /> and the third was an engineer.</p>
<p>The lawyer was to die first. He was led to the guillotine, the attending priest blessed him, and he knelt with his head on the guillotine. The blade was released, but stopped halfway down its path. The priest, seeing an opportunity, quickly said, ""Gentlemen, God has spoken and said this man is to be spared; we cannot kill him."" The executioner agreed, and the lawyer was set free.</p>
<p>The doctor was next. He was blessed by the priest, then knelt and placed his head down. The blade was released, and again stopped halfway down. Again the priest intervened: ""Gentlemen, God has again spoken; we cannot kill this man."" The executioner agreed and the doctor was set free.</p>
<p>At last it was the engineer's turn. He was blessed by the priest, and<br /> knelt, but before he placed his head on the guillotine he looked up.<br /> Suddenly, he leapt to his feet and cried, ""Oh, I see the problem!""</p>

35555,"<p>Beer and Ice Cream DietAs we all know, it takes 1 calorie to heat 1 gram of water 1 degree centigrade. Translated into meaningful terms, this means that if you eat a very cold dessert (generally consisting of water in large part), the natural processes which raise the consumed dessert to body temperature during the digestive cycle literally sucks the calories out of the only available source, your body fat.For example, a dessert served and eaten at near 0 degrees C (32.2 deg. F) will in a short time be raised to the normal body temperature of 37 degrees C (98.6 deg. F).  For each gram of dessert eaten, that process takes approximately 37 calories as stated above.  The average dessert portion is 6 oz, or 168 grams. Therefore, by operation of thermodynamic law, 6,216 calories (1 cal./gm/deg. X 37 deg. x 168 gms) are extracted from body fat as the dessert's temperature is normalized.Allowing for the 1,200 latent calories in the dessert, the net calorie loss is approximately 5,000 calories.Obviously, the more cold dessert you eat,the better off you are and the faster you will lose weight, if that is your goal.This process works equally well when drinking very cold beer in frosted glasses. Each ounce of beer contains 16 latent calories, but extracts 1,036 calories (6, 216 cal. per 6 oz. portion) in the temperature normalizing process.  Thus the net calorie loss per ounce of beer is 1,020 calories.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to calculate that 12,240 calories (12 oz. x 1,020 cal./oz.) are extracted from the body in the process of drinking a can of beer.Frozen desserts, e.g., ice cream, are even more beneficial, since it takes 83 cal./gm to melt them (i.e., raise them to 0 deg. C) and an additional 37 cal./gm to further raise them to body temperature. The results here are really remarkable, and it beats running hands down. Unfortunately, for those who eat pizza as an excuse to drink beer, pizza (loaded with latent calories and served above body temperature) induces an opposite effect.  But, thankfully, as the astute reader should have already reasoned, the obvious solution is to drink a lot of beer with pizza and follow up immediately with large bowls of ice cream.We could all be thin if we were to adhere religiously to a pizza, beer, and ice cream diet.Happy eating!</p>

<p>Slowly I remove what wraps, around your body so tightly, fitting you like a glove. Exposing your tender pale skin. From your neck I remove your charms, and carry you off in my arms,to the warm water that awaits.</p>
<p>The water cascades down your neck, flowing over your soft breasts then, making your legs glisten with wetness. Droplets of water cover your taut skin. My hands rub your body, ummmm running them threw the beads of water. Making them trickle down off your body.</p>
<p>I place my fingers inside you.<br /> You are warm and moist, so ready.<br /> I carry your still dripping body, to a laying place, so that I can put<br /> inside you what was well prepared to enter you before we even came through the door.</p>
<p>As soon as I lay you down your legs spread open wide. You are ready now and so am I. I put a little in slowly at first, getting a feel for how much you can take in. I put in more, you take it willingly.</p>
<p>In anticipation, faster and faster I put it in, pushing it in deeply as far as I can, until I can't put any more in, you are so tight. With your legs wrapped tightly, not wanting to release any of it, I make you so hot for a very long time, until your sweet juices escape from within.</p>
<p>Then I taste you, with my tongue at first, your skin is so soft and tender. I taste more of you with my mouth, you are so hot and moist, you taste so good. Your juices coating my mouth, making me drool in anticipation of eating you more, with every taste.<br /> ""Oh yes"", I say to you, ""I must say Grace!""<br /> ""Thank God for this Butterball Turkey, Amen.""</p>
<p>(You ought to be ashamed of those thoughts you were having)</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!</p>

35569,"<p>Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure. In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where it monitors all other system activity.</p>
<p>Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Boys' Night 2.5 and Sunday Football 5.0 no longer run, crashing the system whenever they are selected. I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run some of my other favorite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the un-install does not work on this program. Can you help me, please?! Thanks, Joe</p>
<p>Dear Joe,<br /> This is a very common problem men complain about but is mostly due to a primary misconception.<br /> Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES &amp; ENTERTAINMENT program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by its creator to run everything. It is unlikely you would be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0. Hidden operating files within your system would cause Girlfriend 7.0 to emulate Wife 1.0 so nothing is gained. It is impossible to uninstall, delete, or purge the program files from the system once installed.</p>
<p>You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this. Some have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than the original system. Look in your manual under 'Warnings - Alimony/Child Support.' I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and just deal with the situation.<br /> Having Wife 1.0 installed myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding General Partnership Faults (GPFs). You must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur, regardless of their cause.</p>
<p>The best course of action will be to enter the command C:APOLOGISE. In any case, avoid excessive use of the ESC key because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGISE command before the operating system will return to normal. The system will run smoothly as long as you take the blame for all the GPFs. Wife 1.0 is a great program, but very high maintenance.</p>
<p>Consider buying additional software to improve the performance of Wife 1.0. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Chocolates 5.0. Do not, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and is likely to cause irreversible damage to the operating system. </p>
<p>Best of Luck. </p>

Ahead of them, lying on the tracks, is a dead buzzard....maggots crawling all over the badly decomposed bird...green flies swarming the stinking mass. Stopping to stare at the smelly thing, one hobo says, ""Let's eat this bastard."" The other hobo says, ""Naw, I'm gonna wait and have a HOT meal."" The first hobo replies, ""Well, I'm too damned hungry to wait, I'm eatin' this fuckin' buzzard"". The second hobo says, ""Suit yourself, but I ain't waitin' on you"", and starts down the tracks again. Ravenously, the first hobo begins stuffing the rotton bird into his mouth. After licking the last maggot from his lips, he looks down the tracks and sees his buddy....by now about a mile away... and takes off running to catch up. After running 10 minutes in the hot August sun, the hobo catches up to his buddy.....sweating...panting....stomach churning from the rotten buzzard he'd just eaten. Suddenly he begins to puke....every bit of the rotten buzzard is now laying in a putrid mass on the tracks. The second hobo smiles at the first hobo and says, ""See??

35590,"<p>Hello, lovers young and old. Was 14th February good for you?After all the anticipation, the tension, the commercialism and the hype, was Valentine's Day worth it?If you're feeling a little used today, you're not alone. Valentine's Day is a ""Hallmark"" holiday, a sham.Year after year, poor besotted (or simply obligated) lovers throw themselves into this mass hysteria, buying up silly trinkets and flocking to mediocre restaurants, and for what? To declare their love, on the same day as everyone else, all because the calendar says so?Let's get this straight: V-Day was created to sell cards, dinners and flowers and to allow couples to feel superior to single people (who have lots more fun the rest of the year).I say anyone who buys into it is crazy. Roses priced at $60 a dozen. Cheesy gifts. Restaurant ""specials"" consisting of mass-cooked rubber chicken with some sort of gooey chocolate dessert at the end.This is romantic?Yet, judging by reports that most major restaurants in town were already fully booked by last Thursday,- some a week or two before that, even. a lot of folks out there haven't got the message.So I'm breaking out a brand-new weapon. For your consideration, please, a new magazine: Mars and Venus. That's right, it's the brainchild of self-help guru John Gray, the man who brought us Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus and all its million-dollar sequels, and its ""preview issue"" landed on news-stands just in time for V-Day.Gray, as most Earthlings know, propagates the cutesy theory that men and women can't communicate because we're from different planets - but if we learn to accept each other's alien ways, love will triumph.And in Gray's world of male-female stereotypes, Valentine's Day is the most important day of the year.He instructs us that women (or, in Gray's parlance, Venusians), are all Valentine addicts who must be ministered to every Feb. 14. Men, he says, ignore this at their peril.""You owe it to your wife,"" he says.""It is the day that can make the difference to the rest of the year.NEGLECTED AND UNLOVED?""Quite often during the span of a year, a woman will feel neglected and unloved, but she is able to suspend her disappointment. If he shows his love on Feb. 14, then she finds it easy to let go of all the resentment.""Ladies, are you going to take this? Hang on, it's not just women who are made to feel like saps. Here's Gray's advice for us, when our poor man still doesn't live up to the hype: ""Try to remember that he is from Mars and is doing his best.""The mag goes on like that, with one article gushing: ""How many women expect love and kisses wrapped in hearts and flowers on Valentine's Day? Every single one of us."" (Hello?) ""Men,"" it adds, ""can be trained to get in the proper spirit.""On shopping for the all-important Valentine gift, contributor Lynn Shnurnberger writes, ""The whole point of Valentine's Day is to prove your love."" (Gee, not much pressure there, eh? And you thought it was just to prove you could find the last heart shaped box of chocolates in town.)There's also step-by-step instructions on how to write a love letter (warning to anyone who received a letter beginning: ""Have I told you lately that I love you? If not, allow me to make up for lost time...""- your lover's a plagiarist).And to top it off, there's a helpful calendar that schedules loving gestures for rest of the month. Mark these down:On Feb. 20: ""Martians: As she walks by, whisper in her ear just how much you love her."" On Feb. 24, ""Venusians: thank him for everything he does."" On Feb. 27: ""Martians: empty the dishwasher without being asked.""Had enough? You say you're not one of these lemmings in love, you really do have your own romantic imagination?Beautiful. Start a romantic revolution.Lovers of the world, unite - or should I say, disperse. Refuse to be dictated to by card companies and magazines.This is the first day of your post-Valentine life. Resolve that next year, you will in fact prove and celebrate your love. But you'll choose your first date anniversary, the day you learned you'd be parents, the day you first met, the day you first kissed ... any day but Feb. 14.Forget the rest of the world. It'll be your secret. Trust me, the flowers will be fresher, the food will be tastier, and the mood will be, well, yours alone to create. Isn't that romantic?</p>

35591,"<p>A fire started on some grassland near a farm in Indiana. The fire department from the nearby town was called to put the fire out. The fire proved to be more than the small town fire department could handle, so someone suggested that a rural volunteer fire department be called. Though there was doubt that they would be of any assistance, the call was made.The volunteer fire department arrived in a dilapidated old fire truck. They drove straight towards the fire and stopped in the middle of the flames. The volunteer firemen jumped off the truck and frantically started spraying water in all directions. Soon they had snuffed out the center of the fire, breaking the blaze into two easily controllable parts.The farmer was so impressed with the volunteer fire department's work and so grateful that his farm had been spared, that he presented the volunteer fire department with a check for $1000.  A local news reporter asked the volunteer fire captain what the department planned to do with the funds.""That should be obvious,"" he responded, ""the first thing we're gonna do is get the brakes fixed on that stupid fire truck.""</p>

35595,"<p>A wealthy man decided to go on a safari in Africa. He took his faithful pet dog along for company. One day the dog starts chasing butterflies and before long he discovers that he is lost. So, wandering about he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the obvious intention of having lunch. The dog thinks, ""Boyo, I'm in deep doodoo now.""....</p>
<p>Then he noticed some bones on the ground close by, and immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. Just as the leopard is about to leap, the dog exclaims loudly, ""Man, That was one delicious leopard. I wonder if there are any more around here?""</p>
<p>Hearing this the leopard halts his attack in mid stride, as a look of terror comes over him, and slinks away into the trees.</p>
<p>""Whew"", says the leopard."" That was close. That dog nearly had me.""</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put his knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So, off he goes. But the dog saw him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figured that something must be up.</p>
<p>The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The cat is furious at being made a fool of and says, ""Here monkey, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine.""</p>
<p>Now the dog sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks,"" What am I going to do now?"" But instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers pretending he hasn't seen them yet. And just when they get close enough to hear, the dog says, ""Where's that monkey. I just can never trust him. I sent him off half an hour ago to bring me another leopard, and he's still not back!!""</p>

"
35737,"<p>A. Why do blondes always smile during lightning storms?<br /> Q. They think their picture is being taken.</p>
"
35738,"<p>1. WHY ARE MEN SUCH JERKS?<br /> It's a testosterone thing. Much similar to your PMS thing. We men suffer<br /> from testosterone poisoning. Why do you think the average life span of a<br /> male is typically 10 years shorter (and it's not just from all the griping<br /> and nagging we have to endure)? Hormones modify behavior. We're just<br /> misunderstood.</p>
<p>2. WHY DO MEN ALWAYS HAVE TO OGLE AT OTHER WOMEN?<br /> Again, this is a testosterone thing. Do you honestly think that all the<br /> testosterone just fell out of our bodies the moment we met you? Besides,<br /> women do it as well. Women are just much better at not getting caught. I'm<br /> fairly certain it's some sort of photographic memory deal. Women take one<br /> quick look and memorize it for later reference. Since men lack this<br /> ability, we try to burn it into our memory by staring as much as we can.</p>
<p>3. WHY DO MEN ALWAYS TOUCH THEMSELVES, ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC?<br /> We occasionally need to adjust our little friend and make him happy. It's<br /> much like adjusting your bra. Being in public is just an added bonus.</p>
<p>4. WHY DO MEN ALWAYS SAY SUCH STUPID THINGS?<br /> We like to. It's actually a whole lot of fun to see our partner frustrated<br /> by a few simple (and well-chosen) words.</p>
<p>5. WHY ARE MEN SO UNCOMMUNICATIVE?<br /> You'd learn to keep your big mouth shut too if every time you open it you<br /> get into trouble with your partner.</p>
<p>6. WHY DO MEN HAVE TO ACT LIKE SUCH RETARDS?<br /> Well, we don't actually have to; we do it because we enjoy it. It's the<br /> old fashioned pride in a job well done that's missing in so much of the<br /> world nowadays.</p>
<p>7. WHY CAN'T MEN JUST SHARE THEIR FEELINGS?<br /> Do we look like women to you? Why is it so hard to understand that men and<br /> women are different? How are we supposed to share how we feel when we have<br /> no idea how we feel? Unless we're experiencing some extreme emotion like<br /> rage, hatred, disgust, or a brick on our foot, we have no idea how we<br /> feel. Personally, I get a headache whenever I try to figure out how I feel.</p>
<p>8. WHY CAN'T MEN CUDDLE MORE (I.E., LIE DOWN AND HUG)?<br /> Please, how many hours do you think there are in a day? We oblige you as<br /> much as we can, but who the hell (besides women) can stand lying around<br /> for hours on end? We men...men hunters...need go roam...starve in<br /> cave...must go find wilde beast.... Now sitting on our butts for hours on<br /> end on the other hand is a whole other story.</p>
<p>9. HOW CAN MEN SIT ON THEIR BUTTS ALL DAY WITHOUT MOVING<br /> Men have very powerful sets of sitting muscles developed by evolution that<br /> enable us to sit for extended periods of time without getting tired. In<br /> prehistoric times, it was often necessary to sit in one spot for extended<br /> periods of time while hunting for prey. The more successful hunters were<br /> able to sit very still for very extended periods of time thereby passing<br /> on this ability to their progeny. The fidgety types were all gobbled up by<br /> saber-toothed tigers etc. The end result is that almost all modern men are<br /> born with this innate ability.</p>
<p>10. WHY CAN'T MEN JUST SAY, ""I LOVE YOU?""<br /> Men are taught from a tender young age to be self-sufficient. To say that<br /> we love you is equivalent to saying that we need you. Most men consider<br /> that a character fault. It's not easy to admit to one's own character<br /> faults.</p>
<p>11. WHY DO MEN SAY, ""I LOVE YOU"" WHEN THEY HARDLY KNOW ME?<br /> Ho, Ho, Ho. Aren't you special? Well, some men think it's a sure-fire way<br /> to get into your pants. Surprisingly, it actually still works quite well.</p>
<p>12. WHY DOESN'T MY PARTNER EVER ANSWER ME?<br /> We just simply don't have the energy to answer every single one of your<br /> questions. If we think we do not have the answer, or that you will not<br /> like the answer, we simply remain quiet and save the energy for other<br /> things.</p>
<p>13. WHY WON'T MEN EVER PICK UP AFTER THEMSELVES?<br /> Why should we? It doesn't really bother us that much. Besides, we know<br /> darn well that you'll pick it up.</p>
<p>14. WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BELCHING AND FARTING?<br /> This usually only occurs after months of courting. It's our way to let you<br /> know that we're comfortable with you. Believe it or not, it's actually a<br /> sign of affection. Besides, holding it for extended periods of time gives<br /> us stomach cramps.</p>
<p>15. WHY DO MEN HATE SHOPPING?<br /> It's an evolutionary thing. Men hunt. Women gather. We just want to go<br /> out, kill it, and bring it back. Who wants to spend hours and hours to<br /> look at things we have no intention of killing? Err...buying?</p>

<p>So he gets out and walks to the front door. He rings it once....No answer. He<br /> rings it again.....Still no answer. So, he thinks, ��this is a big house,, big<br /> party, maybe the party is outside, in the backyard.'' So he walks around the<br /> house to the back, there was no one out there either. As he approached the back<br /> door, he was surprised to find it unlocked, and opened. There was obviously no<br /> one home, so he figured he'd just quietly run inside real quick, and use his or<br /> her bathroom, no one would know. So, he goes inside but he can't find the<br /> bathroom anywhere. So, he quickly ran up the stairs and searched, and searched,<br /> till finally as he opened a door to a small room, he was amazed to find a GOLDEN<br /> TOILET. He had never seen anything like it, but remembering that he was in a<br /> stranger's house, and that they could at anytime return home, he quickly did his<br /> business and walked out. As he got in the car he excitedly told his friends of<br /> the AMAZING GOLDEN TOILET. They laughed in disbelief at his crazy tale. They<br /> pulled out of the driveway, arguing about it. They argued the whole way to the<br /> party. </p>

''Excuse me mama, but could you please let me show<br /> my friends here your GOLDEN TOILET, they don't believe me!'' ''So YOU'RE the<br /> guy!''

Accordingly, he heads for the nearest building which, as luck would have it, is a small farm. He strides up to the door, bangs on it and shouts 'A horse! A horse!. I must have a horse!"".The door opens to reveal a young girl. She looks at Sir Edgbert and says, ""Your pardon, good night but my father and brothers are returning from the village on the other side of the forest and will not be back before noon tomorrow. They are riding all our horses"".Sir Edgbert is saddened by this and says ""But I must return home immediately. Have you any idea where I may accuire alternative transportation?"".The young girl says ""I know of no other horses hereabouts, but sometimes my brothers ride our Great Dane dog when the need arises.

35809,"<p>The End of the Raven  By Edgar Allen Poe's Cat  On a night quite unenchanting,   when the rain was downward slanting, I awakened to the ranting of the man I catch mice for. Tipsy and a bit unshaven, in a tone I found quite craven,  Poe was talking to a Raven perched   above the chamber door. 'Raven's very tasty,' thought I,   as I tiptoed o'er the floor, 'There is nothing I like more'  Soft upon the rug I treaded,   calm and careful as I headed Towards his roost atop that dreaded   bust of Pallas I deplore. While the bard and birdie chattered,   I made sure that nothing clattered, Creaked, or snapped, or fell, or shattered,   as I crossed the corridor; For his house is crammed with trinkets,   curios and wierd decor -     Bric-a-brac and junk galore.  Still the Raven never fluttered,   standing stock-still as he uttered, In a voice that shrieked and sputtered,   his two cents' worth -     'Nevermore.'  While this dirge the birdbrain kept up,   oh, so silently I crept up, Then I crouched and quickly lept up,   pouncing on the feathered bore. Soon he was a heap of plumage,   and a little blood and gore -     Only this and not much more.  'Oooo!' my pickled poet cried out,   'Pussycat, it's time I dried out! Never sat I in my hideout talking to a bird before; How I've wallowed in self-pity,   while my gallant, valiant kitty Put and end to that damned ditty'   - then I heard him start to snore. Back atop the door I clambered,   eyed that statue I abhor,      Jumped - and smashed it on the floor.</p>

<p>For example, an avid duck hunter was in the market for a new bird dog. His search ended when he found a dog that could actually walk on water to retrieve a duck. Shocked by his find, he was sure none of his friends would ever believe him.</p>
<p>He decided to try to break the news to a friend of his, a pessimist by nature, and invited him to hunt with him and his new dog.</p>
<p>As they waited by the shore, a flock of ducks flew by. they fired, and a duck fell. The dog responded and jumped into the water. The dog, however, did not sink but instead walked across the water to retrieve the bird, never getting more than his paws wet. This continued all day long; each time a duck fell, the dog walked across the surface of the water to retrieve it.</p>
<p>The pessimist watched carefully, saw everything, but did not say a single word.</p>
<p>On the drive home the hunter asked his friend, ""Did you notice anything unusual about my new dog?""</p>
<p>""I sure did,"" responded the pessimist. ""Your dog can't swim!""</p>

Five hours later she staggered out of the theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.

Then it was off to a movie, the latest Star Wars epic, and hot dogs, popcorn, Pepsi Cola, and M&amp;Ms. What a fabulous adventure! Finally she wobbled home with her husband and collapsed into bed.

35823,"<p>There was an opening with the CIA as an assassin. These highly classified positions are hard to fill, and there's a lot of testing and background checks involved before you can even be considered for the position. After sending some applicants through the background checks, training and testing, they narrowed the possible choices down to three men but only one position was available.So the day came for the final test to see which man would get the extremely secretive job. The CIA men administering the test took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. `We must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances,' they explained. 'Inside this room you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her.'The man got a shocked look on his face and said, 'You can't be serious! I could never shoot my own wife.''Well,' says the CIA man, 'you're definitely not the right man for the job then.'So they bring the second man to the same door and hand him a gun. 'We must know that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances,' they explained to the second man. `Inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her�The second man looked a bit shocked, but nevertheless took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about five minutes, and then the door opened and the man came out with tears in his eyes. 'I tried to shoot her but I just couldn't pull the trigger and shoot my own wife.

Again they lead him to the same door of the same room and give him the same gun. 'We must be sure that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances. This is your final test. Inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair, take this gun and kill her.'The third man took the gun and opened the door and before the door had even closed all the way, the CIA heard the gun start firing, one shot after another for 13 shots. Then all hell broke loose in the room. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. This went on for several minutes, and then all went quiet. The door opened slowly, and there stood the third man. He wiped the sweat from his brow and said, `You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with f***ing blanks. I had to beat the bitch to death with the chair.'</p>

35869,"<p>How do most men define marriage? A very expensive way to get your laundry done free.<br /> The most effective way to remember your wife's birthday is to forget it once.<br /> Getting married is very much like going to a restaurant with friends. You order what you want, then when you see what the other fellow has, you wish you had ordered that.<br /> At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, ""Aren't you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger?"" The other replied, ""Yes, I am, I married the wrong man.""<br /> Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is finished.<br /> A little boy asked his father, ""Daddy, how much does it cost to get married?"" And the father replied, ""I don't know son, I'm still paying.""<br /> Young Son: Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her? Dad: That happens in every country, son.<br /> Then there was a man who said, ""I never knew what real happiness was until I got married; and then it was too late.""<br /> After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband, ""You know, I was a fool when I married you."" The husband replied, ""Yes, dear, but I was in love and didn't notice.""<br /> A man inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds: ""Wife wanted"". Next day he received a hundred letters. They all said the same thing: ""You can have mine.""<br /> When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let him keep her. -Sacha Guitry<br /> Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe. - Jackie Mason<br /> Marriage is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. Second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience.</p>

35870,"<p>A butcher is working, and really busy. He notices a dog in his<br /> shop and shoos him away. Later, he notices the dog is back<br /> again. He walks over to the dog, and notices the dog has a note<br /> in his mouth. The butcher takes the note, and it reads, ""Can I<br /> have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please.""</p>
<p>The butcher looks, and lo and behold, in the dog's mouth, there<br /> is a ten dollar bill. So the butcher takes the money, puts the<br /> sausages and lamb in a bag, and places it in the dog's mouth.<br /> The butcher is very impressed, and since it's closing time, he<br /> decides to close up shop and follow the dog.</p>
<p>So, off he goes. The dog is walking down the street and comes to<br /> a crossing. The dog puts down the bag, jumps up and presses the<br /> crossing button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the<br /> lights to change. They do, and he walks across the road, with<br /> the butcher following. The dog then comes to a bus stop, and<br /> starts looking at the timetable. The butcher is in awe at this<br /> stage. The dog checks out the times, and sits on one of the<br /> seats to wait for the bus. Along comes a bus. The dog walks to<br /> the front of the bus, looks at the number, and goes back to his<br /> seat. Another bus comes. Again the dog goes and looks at the<br /> number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on. The butcher,<br /> by now open-mouthed, follows him onto the bus. The bus travels<br /> thru town and out to the suburbs. Eventually the dog gets up,<br /> moves to the front of the bus, and standing on his hind legs,<br /> pushes the button to stop the bus. The dog gets off, groceries<br /> still in his mouth, and the butcher still following. They walk<br /> down the road, and the dog approaches a house. He walks up the<br /> path, and drops the groceries on the step. Then he walks back<br /> down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!-<br /> against the door. He goes back down the path, takes another run,<br /> and throws himself -whap!- against the door again! </p>
<p>There's no answer at the door, so the dog goes back down the<br /> path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter<br /> of the garden. He gets to a window, and bangs his head against<br /> it several times. He walks back, jumps off the wall, and waits<br /> at the door. The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door,<br /> and starts laying into the dog, really yelling at him.</p>
<p>The butcher runs up and stops the guy. ""What the heck are you<br /> doing? This dog is a genius. He could be on TV, for God's sake!""</p>
<p>To which the guy responds, ""Clever, my ass. This is the second<br /> time this week he's forgotten his key!""</p>

35871,"<p>A young woman was preparing a ham dinner. After she cut off the end of the<br /> ham, she placed the ham in a pan for baking.</p>
<p>Her friend asked her, ""Why did you cut off the end of the ham""?</p>
<p>And she replied, ""I really don't know but my mother always did, so I thought<br /> you were supposed to.""</p>
<p>Later when talking to her mother she asked her why she cut off the end of the<br /> ham before baking it, and her mother replied, ""I really don't know, but that's<br /> the way my mom always did it.""</p>
<p>A few weeks later while visiting her grandmother, the young woman asked,<br /> ""Grandma, why is it that you cut off the end of a ham before you bake it?""</p>
<p>Her grandmother replied, ""Well dear, it would never fit into my baking pan.""</p>

<p>Upon her recovery, she decided to stay in the hospital and have<br /> collagen shots, cheek implants, a face lift, liposuction and<br /> breast augmentation. She even had someone dye her hair. She<br /> figured since she had another 30 to 40 years, she might as well<br /> make the most of it.</p>
<p>She walked out of Cedars Sinai lobby after the last operation<br /> and was killed by an ambulance speeding up to the hospital. She<br /> arrived in front of God and said, ""I thought you said I had<br /> another 30 to 40 years?""</p>
<p>God replied, ""Sorry, I didn't recognize you!""</p>

35905,"<p>The Lord decided it was time to make a companion for Adam. He summoned St. Peter and told him of His decision. He told St. Peter that he wanted to make a being who was similar to man, yet was different, and could offer him comfort, companionship and pleasure. The Lord said He would call this being woman. So St. Peter went about creating this being, which was similar to man yet was different in ways that would be appealing and could provide physical pleasure to man. When St. Peter had finished creating this being who could now be called woman he summoned The Lord. 'Ah, St. Peter, once again you have done an excellent job', said The Lord'Thank You, O Great One, I live but to serve.' replied St. Peter.  'I am now ready to provide the brain, nerve endings and senses to this....  ... woman.  I require your assistance on this matter Lord.' 'You shall make her brain, slightly smaller, yet more intuitive, more feeling, more compassionate, and more adaptable than man's,' said God.'The nerve endings, said St. Peter.  'How many will I put in her hands?''How many did we put in Adam?', asked The Lord. 'Two hundred, O Mighty One', replied St. Peter.'Then we shall do the same for this woman,' said The Lord. 'And how many nerve endings shall we put in her feet?''How many did we put in Adam?', asked The Lord. 'Seventy five, O Mighty One', replied St. Peter.'Ah yes, these beings are constantly on their feet so they benefit from having less nerve endings there, do the same for woman', said He.'How many nerve endings should we put in woman's genitals', inquired St. Peter. 'How many did we put in Adam?', asked The Lord.'Four hundred and twenty, O Mighty One', replied St. Peter.'Of course, we did want Adam to have a means of receiving extra pleasure in his life, didn't we?  Do the same for woman', said The Lord. 'Oh Yes, Great Lord', said St. Peter.'No, wait.' said The Lord. 'Let's give her ten thousand, I want her to scream my name EVERY Time!'</p>

35906,"<p>There once was a lowly snail, who was busily crawling through the forrest one<br /> day when he happens upon a Leprechaun, perched upon a toadstool. The Leprechaun<br /> looks down at the poor snail, crawling on his belly all his life, and takes pity<br /> on him. ""Snail,"" he says. ""I am going to grant you a wish. Whatever you want,<br /> you have only to ask.""<br /> The snail can't believe his luck! He thinks for a moment, and then excitedly<br /> exclaims, ""Yes! I do have a wish! I want a brand new, shiny red Corvette<br /> Stingray!"" The Leprechaun at first thinks that this is pretty strange, but then,<br /> considering that he is talking to a snail, perhaps not. </p>
<p>""And"" continues the snail. ""I want a bright, golden ""S"" painted on the doors,<br /> the hood and the trunk of my corvette."" </p>
<p>""You shall have your wish,"" responds the Leprechaun. With the wave of his<br /> hand, the snail's wish is granted. </p>
<p>And now, whenever the snail roars through the forrest in his shiny new<br /> corvette, with the big ""S"" on the side, all the other animals of the forrest<br /> say... ""Wow! Look at that crazy ""S"" car go!""</p>

35910,"<p>It seems that when God was making the world, he called man over and bestowed upon him twenty years of normal sex life. Man was horrified. ""Only twenty years of normal sex life?"" but the Lord was very adamant that was all man could have.Then the Lord called the monkey and gave him twenty years. ""But I don't need twenty years"", he protested, ""Ten is plenty for me."" Man spoke up eagerly. ""Can I have the other ten?"" The monkey graciously agreed.Then the Lord called the lion and gave him twenty years, and the lion, like the monkey, wanted only ten. Again the man spoke up, ""Can I have the other ten?"" The lion said of course he could.Then came the donkey and he was given twenty years - but like the others, ten was sufficient - and again man pleaded, ""Can I have the other ten?""This explains why man has twenty years of normal sex life, plus ten years of monkeying around, ten years of lion about it, and ten years of making an ass of himself.</p>

<p>It's like before my wife and I moved. Our house was full of boxes and there was a U-Haul truck in our driveway. My friend comes over and says ""Hey, you moving?"" ""Nope. We just pack our stuff up once or twice a week to see how many boxes it takes. Here's your sign!""</p>

""Okay Jimmy, you got that shark suit on, it looks good... Now you need to jump into this pool of sharks, and you tell us if it hurts when they bite you."" ""Well, all right, but hold my sign. I don't wanna lose it.""</p>
<p>Last time I had a flat tire, I pulled my truck into one of those side-of-the-road gas stations. The attendant walks out, looks at my truck, looks at me, and I SWEAR he said, ""Tire go flat?"" I couldn't resist. I said, ""Nope. I was driving around and those other three just swelled right up on me. Here's your sign!""</p>
<p>We were trying to sell our car about a year ago. A guy came over to the house and drove the car around for about 45 minutes. We get back to the house, he gets out of the car, reaches down and grabs the exhaust pipe, then says, ""Darn that's hot!"" See? If he'd been wearing his sign, I could have stopped him.</p>
<p>I learned to drive an 18 wheeler in my days of adventure. Wouldn't ya know I misjudged the height of a bridge. The truck got stuck and I couldn't get it out no matter how I tried. I radioed in for help and eventually a local cop shows up to take the report. He went through his basic questioning, ok no problem. I thought sure he was clear of needing a sign...until he asked ""So...is your truck stuck?"" I couldn't help myself! I looked at him, looked back at the rig and then back to him and said ""No, I'm delivering a bridge... here's your sign!""</p>

35979,"<p>CLINTON DEPLOYS VOWELS TO BOSNIA </p>
<p>Cities of Sjlbvdnzv, Grzny to Be First Recipients </p>
<p>Before an emergency joint session of Congress yesterday, President Clinton announced US plans to deploy over 75,000 vowels to the war-torn region of Bosnia. The deployment, the largest of its kind in American history, will provide the region with the critically needed letters A,E,I,O and U, and is hoped to render countless Bosnian names more pronounceable. </p>
<p>""For six years, we have stood by while names like Ygrjvslhv and Tzlynhr and Glrm have been horribly butchered by millions around the world,"" Clinton said. ""Today, the United States must finally stand up and say `Enough.' It is time the people of Bosnia finally had some vowels in their incomprehensible words. The US is proud to lead the crusade in this noble endeavour."" </p>
<p>The deployment, dubbed Operation Vowel Movement by the State Department, is set for early next week, with the Adriatic port cities of Sjlbvdnzv and Grzny slated to be the first recipients. Two C-130 transport planes, each carrying over 500 24-count boxes of ""E's,"" will fly from Andrews Air Force Base across the Atlantic and airdrop the letters over the cities. Citizens of Grzny and Sjlbvdnzv eagerly await the arrival of the vowels. </p>
<p>""My God, I do not think we can last another day,"" Trszg Grzdnjkln, 44, said. ""I have six children and none of them has a name that is understandable to me or to anyone else. Mr. Clinton, please send my poor, wretched family just one `E.' Please."" Said Sjlbvdnzv resident Grg Hmphrs, 67: ""With just a few key letters, I could be George Humphries. This is my dream."" </p>
<p>The airdrop represents the largest deployment of any letter to a foreign country since 1984. During the summer of that year, the US shipped 92,000 consonants to Ethiopia, providing cities like Ouaouoaua, Eaoiiuae, and Aao with vital, life-giving supplies of L's, S's and T's.</p>
