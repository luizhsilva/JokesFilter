17005,"<p>There was this guy who really took care of his body. He lifted weights and jogged six miles a day. One morning as he looked into the mirror to admire his body he noticed that he was suntanned all over, with one exception, his penis, which he really decided to do something about. He went to the beach, completely undressed and buried himself in the sand, except for his penis, which he left sticking out.</p>
<p>Two little old ladies were strolling along the beach, one using a cane. Upon seeing the thing sticking out of the sand, she began to move it around with her cane, remarking to the other old lady, ""There really is no justice in the world!""</p>
<p>The other little old lady said, ""What do you mean by that?"" </p>
<p>The first old lady said, ""Look at that.""<br /> When I was 20, I was curious about it.<br /> When I was 30, I enjoyed it.<br /> When I was 40, I asked for it.<br /> When I was 50, I paid for it.<br /> When I was 60, I prayed for it.<br /> When I was 70, I forgot about it.<br /> And now that I'm 80, the damn things are growing wild and I'm to old to squat.</p>

17009,"<p>10&gt; As we aimed all those surgical strikes</p>
<p>    At the target of all our dislikes,</p>
<p>       We grew slowly aware</p>
<p>       That Saddam's facial hair</p>
<p>    Was the lamest since, well, the Third Reich's.</p>
<p> 9&gt; Saddam once had sensitive skin</p>
<p>    And no hair on his chinny-chin-chin.</p>
<p>       But his lip was pubescent,</p>
<p>       A real fertile crescent,</p>
<p>    Where follicles quickly grew in.</p>
<p> 8&gt; The dictator ruling Iraq</p>
<p>    Grew a mustache all shaggy and black.</p>
<p>       A little while later</p>
<p>       He lay in a crater,</p>
<p>    As vultures approached for a snack.</p>
<p> 7&gt; ""Dad's mustache exceeds any other!""</p>
<p>    Cried young Uday to Qusay, his brother,</p>
<p>       ""It will always be there</p>
<p>       Because thick facial hair</p>
<p>    Is the one trait he shared with his mother.""</p>
<p> 6&gt; In order to set an example,</p>
<p>    Hussein was the right guy to trample.</p>
<p>       Now his bushy mustache</p>
<p>       And a bit of eyelash</p>
<p>    Are what's left for his DNA sample.</p>
<p> 5&gt; Next to Hitler's, it's not trimmed as well.</p>
<p>    More like Stalin's, as best I can tell.</p>
<p>       Lenin, too, might dispute</p>
<p>       Saddam's 'stache was a beaut.</p>
<p>    They can argue about it in hell.</p>
<p> 4&gt; Saddam cut a figure quite charming --</p>
<p>    Stalin-like, but perhaps less alarming.</p>
<p>       His lip was hirsute,</p>
<p>       Which he thought made him cute.</p>
<p>    It's too bad that he wasn't disarming.</p>
<p> 3&gt; Samson's strength was dependent on hair.</p>
<p>    Can Saddam Hussein's mustache compare?</p>
<p>       We could tell our troops: ""Wait!</p>
<p>       Spend a buck ninety-eight --</p>
<p>    You can rub out the bastard with Nair!""</p>
<p>2&gt; While Saddam grew his 'stache with no trouble,</p>
<p>    Not so lucky was Chuckie, his double.</p>
<p>       Though Hussein in his wrath</p>
<p>       Threw Rogaine in the Baath,</p>
<p>    He could still hardly sprout more than stubble.</p>
<p>1&gt; Saddam, now most likely ""the late,""</p>
<p>    Suffered one final, humbling fate:</p>
<p>       His mustache ditched his lip</p>
<p>       Like a rat from a ship,</p>
<p>    And was seen crawling south t'wards Kuwait.</p>

17034,"<p>The 5 Levels of Drinking </p>
<p>Level 1: </p>
<p>It's 11:00 on a weeknight, you've had a few beers. You get up to leave because you have </p>
<p>work the next day and one of your friends buys another round. One of your unemployed </p>
<p>friends. Here at level I you think to yourself, ""Oh come on, this is silly. Why, as long as I </p>
<p>get seven hours of sleep (snap fingers), I'm cool."" </p>
<p>Level 2: </p>
<p>It's midnight. You've had a few more beers. You've just spent 20 minutes arguing against </p>
<p>artificial tuff. You get up to leave again, but at level </p>
<p>2, a little devil appears on your shoulder. And now you're thinking, ""Hey! I'm out with </p>
<p>my friends! What am I working for anyway? These are the good times! Besides, as long </p>
<p>as I get five hours sleep (snaps fingers), I'm </p>
<p>COOl."" </p>
<p>Level 3: </p>
<p>One in the morning. You've abandoned beer for tequila. You've just spent 20 minutes </p>
<p>arguing for artificial tuff. And now you're thinking, ""Our waitress is the most beautiful </p>
<p>woman I've ever seen!"" At level 3, you love the world. On the way to the bathroom you </p>
<p>buy a drink for the stranger at the end of the bar just because you like his face. You get </p>
<p>drinking fantasies (like, ""Hey fellas, if we bought our own bar, we could live together </p>
<p>forever. We could do it. Tommy, you could cook."") But at level 3, that devil is a little bit </p>
<p>bigger.., and he's buying. And you're thinking </p>
<p>""Oh, come on, come on now. As long as I get three hours sleep.., and a complete change </p>
<p>of blood (snaps fingers), I'm cool."" </p>
<p>Level 4: </p>
<p>Two in the morning. And the devil is bartending. For last call, you ordered a bottle of </p>
<p>rum and a Coke. You are artificial tutti. This time on your way to the bathroom, you </p>
<p>punch the stranger at the end of the bar just because you don't like his face! And now </p>
<p>you're thinking, ""Our busboy is the best looking man I've ever seen."" You and your </p>
<p>friends decide to leave, right after you get thrown out, and one of you knows an at, er </p>
<p>hours bar. And here, at level 4, you actually think to yourself, ""Well .... as long as I'm </p>
<p>only going to get a few hours sleep anyway, I may as well .... stay up all night!!!! Yeah! </p>
<p>That'd be good for me. I don't mind going to that board meeting looking like Keith </p>
<p>Richards. Yeah, I'll turn that around, make it work for me. And besides, as long as I get </p>
<p>31 hours sleep tomorrow ................... cool. </p>
<p>Level 5: </p>
<p>Five in the morning, alter unsuccessfully trying to get your money back at the tattoo </p>
<p>parlor (""But I don't even know anybody named Ruby!!!""), you and your friends wind up </p>
<p>across the state line in a bar with guys who have been in prison as recently as that </p>
<p>morning. It's the kind of place where even the devil is going, ""Uh, I gotta turn in. I gotta </p>
<p>be in Hell at nine.I've got that brunch with Hitler, I can't miss that."" At this point, </p>
<p>you're ail drinking some kind of thick blue liquor, like something from a Klingon </p>
<p>wedding. A waitress with fresh stitches comes over, and you think to yourself, ""Someday </p>
<p>I'm gonna marry that girlt!"" One of your friends stands up and screams, ""We're drivin' to </p>
<p>floridaf Y!!!""- and passes out. </p>
<p>You crawl outside for air, and then you hit the worst part of level 5 - </p>
<p>the sun. You weren't expecting that were you? You never do. You walk out ora bar in </p>
<p>daylight, and you see people on their way to work, or jogging. And they look at you-and </p>
<p>they know. And they say... ""Who's Ruby?"" Let's be honest, if you're 19 and you stay up </p>
<p>ail night, it's like a victory, like you've beat the night.., but if you're over 27, then that sun </p>
<p>is like </p>
<p>God's flashlight. We all say the same prayer then, ""I swear, I will never </p>
<p>do this again (how long?) as long as I live!"" And some of us have that </p>
<p>little addition, ""and this time, I mean it!""</p>

The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold. </p>
<p>The New Liberal Version<br /> The ant busts his tail in the withering heat all summer long, building his<br /> house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool<br /> and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter the ant is warm and<br /> well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter.<br /> Shivering, the grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why<br /> the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and<br /> starving. CBS, NBC, and ABC show up and provide pictures of the shivering<br /> grasshopper next to a film of the ant in his comfortable home with a table<br /> filled with food.<br /> America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can it be that, in a country of<br /> such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?<br /> Then a representative of the NAAGB (The National Association of Green Bugs)<br /> shows up on Night Line and charges the ant with ""Green Bias"" and makes the case<br /> that the grasshopper is the victim of 30 million years of greenism. Kermit the<br /> frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when he sings<br /> ""its Not Easy Being Green.""<br /> Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening<br /> News and tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they can for<br /> the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by those who<br /> benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to it, the<br /> ""Temperature Of The 80's.""<br /> Finally, the EEOC drafts the ""Economic Equity and Anti-Greenism Act""<br /> RETROACTIVE to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire<br /> a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his<br /> retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.<br /> Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation<br /> suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges<br /> that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare moms who can only hear<br /> cases on Thursday afternoon between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when there are no talk<br /> shows scheduled. The ant loses the case.<br /> The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the<br /> ant's food while the government house he's in, which just happens to be the<br /> ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't know how to maintain it.<br /> The ant has disappeared in the snow.<br /> And on the TV, which the grasshopper bought by selling most of the ant's food,<br /> they are showing Bill Clinton standing before a wildly applauding group of<br /> Democrats announcing that a new era of ""Fairness"" has dawned in America.</p>

<p>The girl then said ""OK drop your pants and I'll tell you what size you are"", the guy then, not being the shy type, drops his trousers and the girl has a feel with her hand and then says in the microphone ""1 packet of large condoms to aisle 3 Please"", he pulls up his trousers, the condoms are brought to him and he pays his bill and goes on his way </p>

17097,"<p>Dear Santa,</p>
<p>This year i've been an extremely ______ person. Infact I think<br /> its safe to say that i've been much, much ______ than in<br /> previous years.</p>
<p>Everything started off quite well; there was the incident with<br /> the ______ but I don't like to think about that too much, and<br /> anyway lots of people have been caught in the ____ doing _____<br /> with _____, and they got away with it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, then there was the time during winter when I forgot to<br /> cover up my _____, which of course meant that my _____ caught a<br /> very bad cold and nearly died.</p>
<p>After that I thought that things could only get _____, to my<br /> surprise however they got steadily _____ and _____.</p>
<p>There was the time I took _____ home to meet my _____. At first<br /> everything was great! but then of course my _____ couldn't hold<br /> back and _____ all over _____'s face, it was perhaps the most<br /> _____ moment of my life.</p>
<p>And getting that _____ stuck in my throat over dinner didn't<br /> help either.</p>
<p>One of my _____est moments from this year was when, for the<br /> first time in my life, I bought my very own _____. _____only<br /> cost me _____ and went for hours and hours. Unfortunately I had<br /> to take it back to the shop the next day because it was _____.<br /> They refused to give me my money back too, the bastards, they<br /> said it was because I should never have _____ed it in the first<br /> place.</p>
<p>Anyway Santa, apart from these minor occurences, I think that I<br /> should be allowed some presents and my top three requests are<br /> these:</p>
<p>_____, _____, and most importantly _____ with lots of ______<br /> please.</p>
<p>I promise not to call you a _____ this year if you don't give me<br /> what I want, even though you're as old as _____ and probably<br /> twice as _____.</p>

"
17101,"<p>When I was in high school I used to be terrified of my girlfriend's father, who I believe suspected me of wanting to lay hands on his daughter. He would open the door and immediately affect a good-naturedly murderous expression, holding out a handshake that, when gripped, felt like it could squeeze carbon into diamonds.<br /> Now, years later, it is my turn to be the dad. Remembering how unfairly persecuted I felt when I would pick up my dates, I do my best to make my daughter's suitors feel even worse. My motto: wilt them in the living room and they'll stay wilted all night.<br /> ""So,"" I'll call out jovially. ""I see you have your nose pierced. Is that because you're stupid, or did you merely want to APPEAR stupid?""<br /> As a dad, I have some basic rules, which I have carved into two stone tablets that I have on display in my living room.<br /> Rule One: If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package, because you're certainly not picking anything up.<br /> Rule Two: You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my daughter, I will remove them.<br /> Rule Three: I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, In order to assure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter, I will take my electric staple gun and fasten your trousers securely in place around your waist.<br /> Rule Four: I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a ""barrier method"" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I WILL kill you.<br /> Rule Five: In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do This. The only information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from you on this subject is ""early.""<br /> Rule Six: I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I will make YOU cry.<br /> Rule Seven: As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process which can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?<br /> Rule Eight: The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka zipped up to her chin. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay.<br /> My daughter claims it embarrasses her to come downstairs and find me attempting to get her date to recite these eight simple rules from memory. I'd be embarrassed too--there are only eight of them, for crying out loud! And, for the record, I did NOT suggest to one of these cretins that I'd have these rules tattooed on his arm if he couldn't remember them. (I checked into it, and the cost is prohibitive.) I merely told him that I thought writing the rules on his arm with a ball point might be inadequate--ink washes off--and that my wood burning set was probably a better alternative.<br /> One time, when my wife caught me having one of my daughter's would-be suitors practice pulling into the driveway, get out of the car, and go up to knock on the front door (he had violated rule number one, so I figured he needed to run through the drill a few dozen times) she asked me why I was being so hard on the boy. ""Don't you remember being that age?"" she challenged.<br /> Of course I remember. Why do you think I came up with the eight simple rules?<br /> From The 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Daughter<br /> Copyright 1998 W. Bruce Cameron http://www.wbrucecameron.com</p>

17127,"<p>This one woman who was in her late 40's went to the plastic surgen. She wanted<br /> an entire face lift and so the doctor said he had this new technique. The woman<br /> asked how it was done so the doctor explained it. He said that he would cut two<br /> slits on top of her head and tie them into a knot. The woman asked why he would<br /> put a knot, and the doctor said that it was so if her face felt a little droopy,<br /> when she twisted it to the right, it would tighten the skin on her face. The<br /> woman decided to get the surgery done.The doctor told her to come back in four<br /> months so he could check up on how she was doing. During the four months the<br /> woman had tightened the knot quite a bit. When the woman had finally gone back<br /> to see the doctor, she had been complaining about her bags under her eyes being<br /> heavy.The doctor examined her for one minute and said, lady, those aren't bags<br /> under your eyes, they're your tits! And then the lady said, that would explain<br /> the gotee on my chin!</p>

17160,"<p>There are five things that women should never, ever ask a guy, according to an article in an issue of Sassy magazine. The five questions are:<br /> 1 - ""What are you thinking?""<br /> 2 - ""Do you love me?""<br /> 3 - ""Do I look fat?""<br /> 4 - ""Do you think she is prettier than me?""<br /> 5 - ""What would you do if I died?"" </p>
<p>What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does not answer properly, which is to say dishonestly. For example: </p>
<p>1 - ""What are you thinking?"" The proper answer to this question, of course is, ""I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you."" Obviously, this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things: </p>
<p>a - Football<br /> b - Baseball<br /> c - How fat you are.<br /> d - How much prettier she is than you.<br /> e - How he would spend the insurance money if you died. </p>
<p>According to the Sassy article, the best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who was asked it by his wife, Peg. ""If I wanted you to know,"" Al said, ""I'd be talking instead of thinking."" </p>
<p>The other questions also have only one right answer but many wrong answers: </p>
<p>2 - ""Do you love me?"" The correct answer to this question is, ""Yes."" For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, ""Yes, dear."" </p>
<p>Wrong answers include: </p>
<p>a - I suppose so.<br /> b - Would it make you feel better if I said yes.<br /> c - That depends on what you mean by ""love"".<br /> d - Does it matter?<br /> e - Who, me? </p>
<p>3 - ""Do I look fat?"" The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, ""No, of course not"" and then quickly leave the room. Wrong answers include: </p>
<p>a - I wouldn't call you fat, but I wouldn't call you thin either.<br /> b - Compared to what?<br /> c - A little extra weight looks good on you.<br /> d - I've seen fatter.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>
<p>4 - ""Do you think she's prettier than me?"" The ""she"" in the question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passer-by you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw. In any case, the correct response is, ""No, you are much prettier."" Wrong answers include: </p>
<p>a - Not prettier, just pretty in a different way.<br /> b - I don't know how one goes about rating such things.<br /> c - Yes, but I bet you have a better personality.<br /> d - Only in the sense that she's younger and thinner.<br /> e - Could you repeat the question? I was thinking about your insurance policy. </p>
<p>5 - ""What would you do if I died?"" Correct answer: ""Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would perforce hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino's Pizza truck that came my way."" This might be the stupidest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke: </p>
<p>""Dear,"" said the wife. ""What would you do if I died?"" </p>
<p>""Why, dear, I would be extremely upset,"" said the husband. ""Why do you ask such a question?"" </p>
<p>""Would you remarry?"" persevered the wife. </p>
<p>""No, of course not, dear"" said the husband. </p>
<p>""Don't you like being married?"" said the wife. </p>
<p>""Of course I do, dear"" he said. </p>
<p>""Then why wouldn't you remarry?"" </p>
<p>""Alright,"" said the husband, ""I'd remarry."" </p>
<p>""You would?"" said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. </p>
<p>""Yes"" said the husband. </p>
<p>""Would you sleep with her in our bed?"" said the wife after a long pause. </p>
<p>""Well yes, I suppose I would."" replied the husband. </p>
<p>""I see,"" said the wife indignantly. ""And would you let her wear my old clothes?"" </p>
<p>""I suppose, if she wanted to"" said the husband. </p>
<p>""Really,"" said the wife icily. ""And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?"" </p>
<p>""Yes. I think that would be the correct thing to do."" </p>
<p>""Is that so?"" said the wife, leaping to her feet. ""And I suppose you'd let her play with my golf clubs, too."" </p>
<p>""Of course not, dear,"" said the husband. ""She's left-handed.""</p>

17161,"<p>Queridos pap� y mam�:</p>
<p>Hace ya tres meses que estoy en la universidad y me demor� para escribirles. Siento mucho la demora, pero ahora voy a ponerlos al tanto de todo. Antes de continuar, por favor, si�ntense. �No contin�en leyendo antes de sentarse! �Est� bien?</p>
<p>Ahora ya estoy mejor, la fractura y el traumatismo que tuve al saltar por la ventana de mi cuarto en llamas al llegar aqu�, est�n pr�cticamente curados.</p>
<p>Pas� s�lo 2 semanas en el hospital, mi visi�n est� casi normal y aquellas terribles jaquecas s�lo vuelven una vez por semana.</p>
<p>Como el incendio fue causado por un descuido m�o, tenemos que pagar 50 mil d�lares a la facultad por los da�os causados, pero eso no es nada, pues lo importante es que estoy vivo.</p>
<p>Felizmente, la empleada de la lavander�a que queda al frente lo vio todo. Fue ella quien llam� a la ambulancia y avis� a los bomberos. Ella tambi�n fue a verme al hospital y, como yo no ten�a a donde ir, con mi apartamento reducido a cenizas, tuvo la gentileza de invitarme a vivir con ella.</p>
<p>En verdad es un cuarto en un s�tano, pero es muy agradable. Ella tiene el doble de mi edad, estamos perdidamente enamorados y nos queremos casar. Todav�a no fijamos la fecha, pero ser� antes de que su embarazo sea muy evidente.</p>
<p>Queridos padres, ser� pap�. S� como ustedes ans�an ser abuelos y estoy seguro que acoger�n a los beb�s (son trillizos) con todo el amor y cari�o que me dieron cuando yo era peque�o.</p>

<p>S� que ustedes la recibir�n con los brazos abiertos en nuestra familia; ella es muy amable, y a�n no habiendo estudiado, tiene mucha ambici�n. Aunque no sea de nuestra misma religi�n, s� que ustedes son tolerantes y que tampoco les importar� el hecho de que su piel sea un poco m�s oscura que la nuestra.</p>

17167,"<p>Why did the chicken cross the road? Pat Buchanan:    To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American. Louis Farrakhan:    The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken    crossed the ''black man'' in order to trample him and keep him down. The Bible:    And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken,    ''Thou shalt cross the road.'' And the chicken crossed the road, and  there  was much rejoicing. Colonel Sanders:    I missed one? L.A. Police Department:    Give us five minutes with the chicken and we'll find out. Richard M. Nixon:    The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did not    cross the road. I don't know any chickens. I have never known any    chickens. Dr. Seuss:    Did the chicken cross the road?    Did he cross it with a toad?    Yes! The chicken crossed the road,    but why it crossed, I've not been told! Ernest Hemingway:    To die. In the rain. Martin Luther King, Jr.:    I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads    without having their motives called into question. Grandpa:    In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone    told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough  for  us. Aristotle:    It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. Karl Marx:     It was an historical inevitability. Saddam Hussein    This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified    in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.                       Ronald Reagan:    What chicken? Captain James T. Kirk:    To boldly go where no chicken has gone before. Fox Mulder:    You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more    chickens have to cross before you believe it? Machiavelli:    The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The    end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was. Freud:    The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the    road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. Bill Gates:    I have just released Chicken Coop 98, which will not only cross    roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance  your cheque book, and Explorer is an inextricable part of the operating  system. Einstein:    Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath    the chicken? Bill Clinton:    I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. However, I did ask    Vernon Jordan to find the chicken a job in New York.</p>

17170,"<p>Shit is a powerful word. Just think of all the concepts and ideas you can communicate with it. Shit may just be the most powerful word in the English language. </p>
<p>CONSIDER THIS: You can be shit faced, be shit out of luck, or have shit for brains. With a little effort you can get your shit together, find a place for your shit or decide to shit or get off the pot. You can smoke shit,buy shit, sell shit, lose shit, find shit, forget shit, and tell others to eat shit and die. You can shit or go blind, have a shit fit or just shit your life away. People can be shit headed, shit brained, shit blinded, and shit over. </p>
<p>Some people know their shit while others can't tell the difference between shit and shineola. There are lucky shits, dumb shits, crazy shits, and sweet shits. There is bull shit, and horse shit and chicken shit. You can throw shit,sling shit, catch shit, or duck when the shit hits the fan. You can take a shit, give a shit, or serve shit on a shingle. You can find yourself in deep shit, or be happier than a pig in shit. Some days are colder than shit, some days are hotter than shit, and some days are just plain shitty. Some music sounds like shit, things can look like shit, and there are times when you feel like shit. </p>
<p>You can have too much shit, not enough shit, the right shit, the wrong shit or a lot of weird shit. You can carry shit, have a mountain of shit, or find yourself up shit creek without a paddle. Sometimes you really need this shit and sometimes you don't want any shit at all. Sometimes everything you touch turns to shit and other times you swim in a lake of shit and come out smelling like a rose. </p>
<p>Shit! When you stop to consider all the facts, it's the basic building block of creation. And remember, once you know your shit, you don't need to know anything else.</p>

17182,"<p>The other day I went to the local religious book store, where I saw a<br /> HONK IF YOU LOVE JESUS bumper sticker. I bought it and put it on the back<br /> bumper of my car, and I'm really glad I did. What an uplifting experience<br /> followed.<br /> I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought<br /> about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper<br /> sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy<br /> behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love the lord because<br /> pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, ""Jesus Christ!"" as loud as<br /> he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, ""GO JESUS CHRIST,<br /> GO!!!""<br /> Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved<br /> and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from<br /> Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny<br /> beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck<br /> up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed,<br /> looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck<br /> sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.<br /> Several cars behind, a very nice black man stepped out of his car and<br /> yelled something. I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like,<br /> ""Mother trucker,"" or ""Mother's from there."" Maybe he was from Florida, too.<br /> He must really love the lord. A couple of the people were so caught up in<br /> the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking<br /> toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the<br /> light had changed, and stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because<br /> I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them<br /> standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held<br /> up the Hawaiian good luck sign, as I drove away.<br /> Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks.</p>

<p>""Yeah man, at the dance, X and Y went behind the gym and they<br /> got to second base!"" </p>
<p>Well that was cool and all, but what the hell was second base?<br /> Tongue kissing? Up the shirt? No one was really sure. Also, the<br /> bases tended to get progressively more intense as you got older.<br /> What's a person to do? Here, we mourn the passing of using<br /> baseball analogies to describe sexual activity. But let's face<br /> it, there are more than four stages in today's day and age of<br /> sex play. So, in the interests of both bringing baseball sex<br /> metaphors in line with the complications of modern romance and<br /> with standardizing the bases, we present the Standardized Guide<br /> to the Bases. </p>
<p>First, let's examine what the bases could have meant in the old<br /> days. </p>
<p>First Base: This was almost always kissing, although one guy I<br /> knew thought it meant holding hands. Sometimes it was tongue<br /> kissing and sometimes not. </p>
<p>Second Base: Variously this meant tongue kissing, breast<br /> feeling, or outside the clothes genital contact. </p>
<p>Third Base: Usually this was a hand down the pants of you or<br /> your partner. </p>
<p>Home Run: This was ALWAYS sex, although it was rarely reached in<br /> the times when you had to refer to it in terms of bases. </p>
<p>That system is ok, if you are a young teenager with a repressed<br /> sex drive. But what happens when you reach maturity and new<br /> factors enter the equation, such as oral sex? And what about the<br /> exact definitions? We have attempted to answer such puzzling<br /> questions and present without further ado... The Standardized<br /> Guide to the Bases! </p>
<p>On Deck: Having plans for a date.</p>
<p>Strike-Out: Duh!!</p>
<p>Walk: Kissing.</p>
<p>Bunt: Masturbation.</p>
<p>Single: Tongue kissing.</p>
<p>Double: Breasts/chest touched, some clothes off, lots of<br /> grabbing and feels.</p>
<p>Triple: Most of the clothes off, genital contact, mutual<br /> masturbation.</p>
<p>Inside the park home run: Oral Sex.</p>
<p>Home Run: SEX!</p>
<p>Ground Rule Double: would have sex, but no condom.</p>
<p>Error: Condom breaks during sex.</p>
<p>Banned for life for gambling: sex without a condom.</p>
<p>Hall of Fame: Marriage.</p>
<p>Now that we've got the basics, let's introduce some terms to<br /> better explain all the things that can happen now a days. </p>
<p>Balk: Premature ejaculation.</p>
<p>Pine Tar: KY jelly.</p>
<p>Relief pitcher: Vibrator.</p>
<p>Rain Delay: parents/roommate return home unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Box Seats: Waterbed.</p>
<p>Seventh Inning Stretch: Unusual positions.</p>
<p>Rookie: Virgin.</p>
<p>Minor Leagues: Under 18.</p>
<p>Loaded Bases: manage a trois.</p>
<p>Grand Slam: Sex three times in twelve hours.</p>
<p>Foul tip: VD.</p>
<p>Three up and three down: impotency.</p>
<p>Now that we have the definitions, lets quickly contrast the old<br /> confusion with current clarity. </p>
<p>OLD WAY: we um got to third base I guess and then we um got like<br /> past third base, but not to home plate. I really like her. </p>
<p>NEW WAY: first, there was a triple, then we got and inside the<br /> park home run, and started thinking, it's hall of fame time. NEW<br /> WAY- So there I was with the bases loaded and nobody out, when I<br /> balked during the seventh inning stretch and I had to call in a<br /> relief pitcher. </p>
<p>Well, there you have it, I hope it has cleared up a lot of the<br /> confusion and helps you out.</p>

17197,"<p>Back in 1947 the government was experimenting with a Marine's ability to<br /> complete his mission after suffering a serious head injury.<br /> They took a well trained, physically-fit, hard-charging Cpl. and told him to<br /> row a canoe up a river.  The Cpl. jumped in the canoe, started rowing up stream<br /> with ease and began singing, ""From the Halls of Montezuma, To the Shores of<br /> Tripoli.""<br /> The next day a team of surgeons performed a frontal lobotomy on the<br /> Marine.   Again, they took him to the river and said' ""row.""<br /> Again the Cpl. jumped in, took a second to find his seat, started rowing with<br /> a little difficulty and began singing.  It took a little more effort this time,<br /> ""From     Da   Hallls   of    Montayuma,     Two   Da   Stores    in<br /> Tripoli.""  But he made it up river and completed the task.<br /> The next day the surgeons removed the majority of the Marines brain and took<br /> him to the river.<br /> The Cpl. jumped in, fell out, and began swimming up stream, singing ""For    Da<br />   Hails  of  Monte puma,  to  'e  hall inn  monopoly.""  But again, he made it up<br /> river and completed his task.<br /> The next day the surgeons removed the remainder of the Marines brain.  He had<br /> no brain what-so-ever and no way to think logically.  They took him to the<br /> river.

I don't think we should give free room and board to criminals. I think they should have to run twelve hours a day on a treadmill and generate electricity. And if they don't want to run, they can rest in the chair that's hooked up to the generator.Award Shows: Can you believe how many award shows they have now? They have awards for commercials. The Cleo Awards, a whole show full of commercials. I taped it. Then I fast-forwarded through the whole thing.Phone-In-Polls: You know those shows where people call in and vote on different issues? Did you ever notice there's always like 18% that say ""I don't know"". It costs 90 cents to call up and vote... They're voting ""I don't know."" ""Honey, I feel very strongly about this. Give me the phone. (Into Phone) I DON'T KNOW!"" (Hangs up looking proud.) ""Sometimes you have to stand up for what you believe you're not sure about."" This guy probably calls up phone sex girls for $2.95/min. to say ""I'm not in the mood.""</p>

17200,"<p>Two girls go out one weekend without their husbands and got somewhat inebriated.Staggering on their way home, they both desperately need a wee and with no public toilets in sight the nearest venue was a cemetery, so they both ducked behind the fence to relieve themselves. After they'dfinished, the first woman took off her knickers to wipe herself and thenthrew them away. The other woman, realising she was wearing somevery expensive knickers, didn't want to throw hers away and so lookedaround for something else and decided on using the ribbon off a nearbywreath.So now, feeling a lot better, they carried on with their stagger home. The following morning the two husbands were talking to each other on the phone. One commented, ""I think we need to start keeping a closer eye on our wives you know. I reckon they're up to no good. My wife came home last night without any knickers on!""The other one replied, ""Tell me about it! If you think that's bad, my wifecame home with a card stuck to her arse that read - ""All the members of the District Fire Brigade will never forget you"".</p>

<p>""Five dollars for both of them,"" the salesman said.</p>
<p>""Yeah right, you've got to be kidding me!"" the man replied sarcastically.</p>
<p>""No, that's the price,"" the salesman said, ""do you want to buy them or not?""</p>
<p>""Yeah, I'll take them!"" the customer responded.</p>
<p>He continued to look around and saw a car stereo system with a detachable face cassette player, a CD changer, amplifier, speakers, and subwoofers. </p>
<p>""How much?"" he asked.</p>
<p>""Five dollars for the system,"" the salesman answered.</p>
<p>""Is it stolen?"" the guy asks.</p>
<p>""No,"" said the salesman, ""It's brand new, do you want it or not?""</p>
<p>""Sure,"" the customer replied. He looked around some more.</p>
<p>Next he found a top of the line computer with printer and monitor. ""How much?""</p>
<p>""Five dollars,"" was the familiar response.</p>
<p>""I'll take that too!"" the man said.</p>
<p>As the salesperson is ringing up the purchases, the man asked him, ""Why are your prices so cheap?""</p>
<p>The salesman said, ""Well, the owner of the store is at my house right now with my wife. What he's doing to her, I'm doing to his business!""  </p>

<p>The mule answered, ""To live like this for 40 years is too much. Please,<br /> give me no more than 20."" And it was so.</p>
<p>Then God created the dog, and told him, ""You will hold vigilance over the<br /> dwellings of Man, to whom you will be his greatest companion. You will eat<br /> his table scraps and live for 30 years."" </p>
<p>And the dog responded, ""Lord, to live 30 years as a dog is too much.<br /> Please, no more than 15 years."" And it was so.</p>
<p>God then created the monkey, and told him, ""You are Monkey. You shall<br /> swing from tree to tree, acting like an idiot. You will be funny, and you<br /> shall live for 20 years."" </p>
<p>And the monkey responded, ""Lord, to live 20 years as the clown of the<br /> world is too much. Please, Lord, give me no more than 10 years."" And it<br /> was so.</p>
<p>Finally, God created Man and told him, ""You are Man, the only rational<br /> being that walks the earth. You will use your intelligence to have mastery<br /> over the creatures of the world. You will dominate the earth and live for<br /> 20 years.""</p>
<p>And the man responded, ""Lord, to be Man for only 20 years is too little.<br /> Please, Lord, give me the 20 years the mule refused, the 15 years the dog<br /> refused, and the 10 years the monkey rejected."" And it was so.</p>
<p>And so God made Man to live 20 years as a man, then marry and live 20<br /> years like a mule working and carrying heavy loads on his back. Then, he<br /> is to have children and live 15 years as a dog, guarding his house and<br /> eating the leftovers after they empty the pantry; then, in his old age, to<br /> live 10 years as a monkey, acting like a clown to amuse his grandchildren.</p>

17244,"<p>After a few days on the new Earth, the Lord called to Adam and said, ''It is time for you and Eve to begin the process of populating the earth, so I want you to kiss her.'' Adam answered, ''Yes, Lord, but what is a 'kiss'?'' The Lord gave a brief description to Adam, who took Eve by the hand and took her to a nearby bush. A few minutes later, Adam emerged and said, ''Thank you Lord, that was enjoyable.'' And the Lord replied, ''Yes Adam, I thought you might enjoy that. Now, I'd like you to caress Eve.'' And Adam said, ''What is a 'caress'?'' So, the Lord again gave Adam a brief description and Adam went behind the bush with Eve. Quite a few minutes later, Adam returned, smiling, and said, ''Lord, that was even better than the kiss.'' And the Lord said, ''You've done well Adam. And now, I want you to make love to Eve.'' And Adam asked, ''What is 'make love', Lord?'' So, the Lord again gave Adam directions and Adam went again to Eve behind the bush, but this time he re-appeared in two seconds. And Adam said, ''Lord, what is a 'headache'?''</p>

17250,"<p>One day when the teacher walked to the black board, she noticed someone had<br /> written the word 'penis' in tiny small letters. She turned around, scanned the<br /> class looking for the guilty face. Finding none, she quickly erased it, and<br /> began her class.<br /> The next day she went into the room and she saw, in larger letters, the word<br /> 'penis' again on the black board. Again, she looked around in vain for the<br /> culprit, but found none, so she proceeded with the day's lesson. </p>
<p>Every morning, for about a week, she went into the classroom and found the<br /> same word written on the board, and each day it was written in larger letters. </p>
<p>Finally, one day, she walked in, expecting to be greeted by the same word on<br /> the board, but instead, found the words, ""The more you rub it, the bigger it<br /> gets!""</p>

17251,"<p>One day a hunter took his trusty Winchester to the mountains to<br /> hunt for bear. He hid behind a rock that overlooked a beautiful<br /> valley and waited.</p>
<p>Soon a bear appeared by the stream which ran through the valley.<br /> The hunter aimed and fired. When the smoke cleared he couldn't<br /> see the bear.</p>
<p>Then there was a tap, tap, tap on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The man turned around and there was the bear, standing 7 feet<br /> high,<br /> towering over him. The bear said, ""you tried to shoot me didn't<br /> you?"" To which the Hunter replied, ""Yes, I'm afraid I did.""<br /> ""Well,"" said the Bear, ""in that case you will have to give me a<br /> blow job.""</p>
<p>Having no choice in the matter, the Hunter did as he was told.</p>
<p>That night the Hunter was really angry and vowed to get revenge.<br /> So the next day he went to the same spot, only this time he<br /> brought a huge elephant gun. Once again the bear appeared and<br /> the hunter fired. After the smoke cleared the hunter couldn't<br /> see no carcass.</p>
<p>Tap, tap, tap. ""You tried to shoot me didn't you?""</p>
<p>""Why, yes, I'm afraid I did.""</p>
<p>""Well take your pants down and bend over. I'm going to have to<br /> fuck you up the ass. Having no choice the Hunter did what he was<br /> told.</p>
<p>That night the Hunter was really, really angry and resolved that<br /> he would get the Bear no matter what.</p>
<p>This time he brought an M16. He went to the same spot and waited<br /> until the bear appeared by the stream. He fired off fifty<br /> rounds. When the smoke cleared, he could'nt see the bear.</p>
<p>Tap, tap, tap. ""You tried to shoot me didn't you?""</p>
<p>Gulp. ""Yes, I'm afraid I did.""</p>

<p>The Scottsman </p>
<p>Well a Scottsman clad in kilt left a bar one  evening fair<br /> And one could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his share<br /> He fumbled 'round until he could no longer keep his feet<br /> And he stumbled off in to the grass to sleep beside the street </p>
<p>Ring-ding didle lidle la deo<br /> Ring dye didley eye oh<br /> He stumbled off in to the grass to sleep beside the street </p>
<p>About the thime two young and lovely girls just happened by<br /> One says to the other, with a twinkle in her eye<br /> ""See yon sleeping  Scottsman, so strong a  handsome built<br /> I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt"" </p>
<p>Ring-ding didle lidle la deo<br /> Ring dye didley eye oh<br /> I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath the kilt </p>
<p>They crept up on the sleeping Scottsman quiet as could be<br /> They lifted up his kilt about an inch so they  could see<br /> And there, behold, for them to view beneath his Scottish skirt<br /> Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth </p>
<p>Ring-ding didle lidle la  deo<br /> Ring dye didley eye oh<br /> Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth </p>
<p>They marveled for a moment, then one said ""We must be gone.""<br /> ""Let's leave a present for our friend before we move along""<br /> As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow<br /> Around the bonnie star the Scotts kilt did lift and show </p>
<p>Ring-ding didle lidle la deo<br /> Ring dye didley eye oh<br /> Around the bonnie star the scotts kilt did lift and show </p>
<p>Now the Scottsman woke to natures call and stumbled for the trees<br /> Behind the bush he lifts his kilt, and gawks at what he sees<br /> And in a startled voice he says, to what's before  his eyes,<br /> ""Lad, I don't know where you;ve been, but I see  you've won first prize"" </p>

So, I wish for a road to be built from here to Hawaii.""The genie was taken aback a bit, but after some thought said, ""No, I don't think I can do that; think about the pilings needed to hold up the highway and how deep they would have to be to reach the bottom of the ocean.

Again proceed as in 1, except when you have cat firmly cradled in bottle-feeding position, sit on edge of chair, fold your torso over cat, bring your right hand over your left elbow, open cat's mouth by lifting the upper jaw &amp; pop pill in - quickly!  Since your head is down by your knees, you won't be able to see what you are doing. That's just as well.6. Leave cat hanging on drapes.  Leave pill in your hair.7 If you are a woman, have a good cry.  If you are a man, have a good cry.8. Now pull yourself together.  Who's the boss here anyway? Retrieve cat &amp; pill. Assuming position 1, say sternly, ""Who's the the boss here anyway?"" Open cat's mouth, take pill &amp; ....Oooops!9. This isn't working, is it?  Collapse &amp; think.  Aha!

The husband rushes her to a local<br /> hospital where an x-ray is performed on her. A few minutes later<br /> her doctor comes back with the results. ""Mrs. Davis, apparently<br /> a wasp flew into you, but fear not, there is a simple solution.""<br /> He discusses it quietly with the husband, ""all you do is rub<br /> some honey on the head of your penis, insert it and as soon as<br /> you feel the wasp yank your penis out and the wasp should fly<br /> out."" </p>

17285,"<p>So Why Did the Chicken Cross the Road? </p>
<p>GEORGE W BUSH </p>
<p>We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. Our side of the road is the right side of the road and the chicken is either against us or for us. There is no middle ground for any chicken. </p>
<p>COLIN POWELL </p>
<p>Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road. </p>
<p>DONALD RUMSFELD </p>
<p>I have known about the chicken crossing the road for several months. I was investigating why the chicken moved but didn't feel it was necessary to alert anyone. </p>
<p>HANS BLIX </p>
<p>We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road. </p>
<p>JOHN KERRY </p>
<p>Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road I am now against it! </p>
<p>RALPH NADER </p>
<p>The chicken's habitat on the other side of the road had been polluted by unchecked industrial greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV. </p>
<p>PAT BUCHANAN </p>
<p>To steal the job of a decent, hard-working American. </p>
<p>RUSH LIMBAUGH </p>
<p>I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but I'll bet it was getting a government grant to cross the road, and I'll bet that somebody out there is already forming a support group to help chickens with crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars. And when I say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money, money the government took from you to build road for chickens to cross. </p>
<p>MARTHA STEWART </p>
<p>No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any inside information. </p>
<p>DR SEUSS </p>
<p>Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told. </p>
<p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY </p>
<p>To die in the rain. Alone. </p>
<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR </p>
<p>I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question. </p>
<p>GRANDPA </p>
<p>In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough. </p>
<p>BARBARA WALTERS </p>
<p>Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road. </p>
<p>JOHN LENNON </p>
<p>Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together -- in peace. </p>
<p>ARISTOTLE </p>
<p>It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. </p>
<p>KARL MARX </p>
<p>It was a historic inevitability. </p>
<p>CAPTAIN KIRK </p>
<p>To boldly go where no chicken has ever gone before. </p>
<p>SIGMOND FREUD </p>
<p>The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. </p>

<p>ALBERT EINSTEIN </p>
<p>Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken? </p>

Andre creep... Andre creep.'6)  'Stanislaus Smedley, a man always on the cutting edge of narcissism, was about to give his body and soul to a back-alley sex-change surgeon to become the woman he loved.'5)  'Although Sarah had an abnormal fear of mice, it did not keep her from seeking out a living at a local pet store.'4)  'Stanley looked quite bored and somewhat detached, but then penguins often do.'3)  'Like an overripe beefsteak tomato rimmed with cottage cheese, the corpulent remains of Santa Claus lay dead on the hotel floor.'2)  'Mike Hardware was the kind of private eye who didn't know the meaning of the word 'fear,' a man who could laugh in the face of danger and spit in the eye of death -- in short, a moron with suicidal tendencies.AND THE BEST OF ALL:1)  'The sun oozed over the horizon, shoved aside darkness, crept along the greensward, and, with sickly fingers, pushed through the castle window, revealing the pillaged princess, hand at throat, crown asunder, gaping in frenzied horror at the sated, sodden amphibian lying beside her, disbelieving the magnitude of the frog's deception, screaming madly, 'You lied!'</p>

"
17311,"<p>Dear Alcohol,</p>
<p>I thought I'd take a minute to discuss some troubling factors with you.</p>
<p>First and foremost, let me tell you that I'm a huge fan of yours... your many sides and dimensions are mind-boggling (different than beer goggling, which I'll touch upon shortly.)</p>
<p>Yes, my friend, you always seem to be there when needed - the perfect post work cocktail, a beer with the gang ... and you're even around in the holidays - hidden inside chocolates you warm us when we're stuck in the midst of endless family gatherings.</p>
<p>Yet lately, I've been wondering about your intentions. You see, I want to believe that you have my best interests at heart, but I feel that your influence has led to unwise consequences, briefed below for your review:</p>
<p>1. Phone calls: While I agree with you that communication is important, I question the suggestion that any conversation of substance or necessity occurs at 5am.</p>
<p>2. Eating: Now, you know I love a good meal and, though cooking is far from my speciality, why you suggested that I eat a kebab with chilli sauce coupled with a pot noodle and some stale crisps (washed down with chocolate nesquik and topped off with a Kit Kat) is beyond me. Eclectic eater I am, but I think you went a bit too far this time.</p>
<p>3. Clumsiness: Unless you're subtly trying to tell me I need to do yoga more to increase my balance, I see NO need to hammer the issue home by causing me to fall down the stairs. Completely unnecessary. Similarly, it should not take me more than 30 seconds to get the key into the front door lock.</p>
<p>4. Pictures: This is a blessing in disguise, as it can often clarify the last point below, but the following costumes are heretofore banned from being placed on my head in public: Indian Wigs, Sombreros, Bows, Ties, Boxes, upside-down cups, inflatable balloon animals, traffic cones, bras.</p>
<p>5. Beer Goggles: If I think I may know him/her from somewhere, I most likely do not. PLEASE do not request that I go over and see if in fact, I do actually know that person. This is similar to the old ""Hey, you're in my class"" syndrome circa 1986 at SU, and should heretofore be rendered illegal. Coupled with this is the phrase, 'Let's shag'. While I may be thinking this, please reinstate the brain-to-mouth block that would keep this thought from being a statement, especially in public.</p>
<p>Further, the subsequent hangovers have GOT to stop. Now, I know a little penance for our previous evenings' debauchery may be in order, but the 2pm Hangover Immobility is completely unacceptable. I ask that if the proper steps are proactively taken on my part (i.e. water, vitamin B, bread products, aspirin) prior to going to bed/passing out facedown on the kitchen floor with a bag of popcorn, the hangover should be quite minimal and no way interfere with my daily Saturday or Sunday (or any day, for that matter) activities. Come on now ... it's only fair - you do your part, I'll do mine.</p>
<p>Alcohol, I have enjoyed our relationship for some years now, and want to ensure that we remain on good terms. You've been the invoker of great stories, the provocation for much laughter, and the needed companion when we just don't know what to do with the extra money in our pockets. In order to continue this relationship, I ask that you carefully review my grievances above and address them immediately. I will look for an answer no later than Friday at 6 pm (pre happy hour) on your possible solutions and hopefully we can continue this fruitful partnership.</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt attention to these matters.</p>
<p>Sincerely, your biggest fan.</p>

17322,"<p>A traveling salesman checked into a futuristic motel. Realizing he needed a haircut before his next day's meeting, he called down to the desk clerk and asked if there was a barber on the premises. ''I'm afraid not, sir,'' the clerk told him, ''but down the hall is a special machine that should serve your purposes.'' Skeptical but intrigued, the salesman located the appropriate machine, inserted fifty cents, and stuck his head in the opening, at which time the machine started to buzz and whirl. Fifteen seconds later the salesman pulled out his head and surveyed his head in the mirror, which reflected the best haircut he ever received in his life. Down the hall was another machine with a sign that read, ''Manicures - 25 cents.'' ''Why not?'' thought the salesman. He paid the money, inserted his hands into the slot, and pulled them out perfectly manicured. The next machine had a huge sign that read, ''This Machine Provides What Men Need Most When Away from Their Wives - cost 50 cents.'' The salesman was embarrassed and looked both ways. Seeing nobody around he put in fifty cents, then unzipped his pants and stuck his ''thing'' into the opening - with great anticipation, since he had been away from his wife for two weeks. When the machine started buzzing, the guy let out a shriek of agony. Fifteen seconds later it shut off and, with trembling hands, the salesman was able to withdraw his ''thingy''... Which now had a button sewed on the tip.</p>

17324,"<p>Top Ten Reasons Why God Created Eve 10. God was worried that Adam would frequently become lost in the Garden. 9. God knew that one day Adam would require someone to locate and hand him the remote. 8. God knew Adam would never go out and buy himself a new fig leaf when his wore out and would therefore need Eve to buy one for him. 7. God knew Adam would never be able to make a doctor's, dentist, or haircut appointment for himself. 6. God knew Adam would never remember which night to put the garbage on the curb. 5. God knew if the world was to be populated, men would never be able to handle the pain and discomfort of childbearing. 4. As the Keeper of the Garden, Adam would never remember where he left his tools. 3. Apparently, Adam needed someone to blame his troubles on when God caught him hiding in the garden. 2. As the Bible says, It is not good for man to be alone. And finally, the Number 1 reason why God created Eve... 1. When God finished the creation of Adam, He stepped back, scratched his head, and said, ""I can do better than that!""</p>

17350,"<p>There once was a successful rancher who died and left everything to his devoted wife.  She was determined to keep the ranch and make a go of it, but she knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for ranch hands.</p>
<p>Two men applied for the job... One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied, she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.</p>
<p>He turned out to be a fantastic worker, worked long hard hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.</p>
<p>For weeks the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing really well. </p>
<p>Then one day the rancher's wife said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job and we've both done nothing but work for weeks.  The ranch looks great, and I'm taking Saturday night off and going into town to kick up my heels and paint the town red, and I think you should do the same.""</p>
<p>The hired hand agreed readily, and Saturday night each went to town.  The rancher's wife had dinner and drinks with friends, and talked and joked and danced, and had a great time, getting home about midnight.  The hired hand wasn't home yet, so she decided to wait up for him.</p>
<p>One o'clock and no hired hand yet.  Two o'clock and no hired hand and she began to worry. At two-thirty in came the hired hand.  The rancher's wife was sitting by the fireplace and called him over by her. ""Now I'm the boss"", she said, ""and you have to do what I tell you, right?""</p>
<p>""Well... yes"", he answered.</p>
<p>""Then unbutton my blouse and take it off"", she said. He did as she asked.</p>
<p>""Now take off my boots.""  He did.</p>
<p>""Now take off my socks.""  He did.</p>
<p>""Now take off my skirt.""   He did.</p>
<p>""Now take off my bra.""  Again he did as she asked.</p>
<p>""Now take off my panties."" And again he did what she told him.</p>

<p>As director of communications, I was asked to prepare a memo reviewing our<br /> company's training programs and materials.

Finally he showed me<br /> her copy of the memo, with her demand that I be fired, with the word<br /> ""pedagogical"" circled in red. The HR Manager was fairly reasonable, and once he<br /> looked the word up in his dictionary and made a copy of the definition to send<br /> to my boss, he told me not to worry. He would take care of it. Two days later a<br /> memo to the entire staff came out, directing us that no words which could not be<br /> found in the local Sunday newspaper could be used in company memos.

<p>The doctor was shocked, but agreed to give it a try. The next day, still<br /> feeling slightly guilty, the doctor prepared the bills. When he went to<br /> place them in his mailbox, he found a bill from the lawyer.</p>

17380,"<p>A little old lady walked into the head branch of the Chase Manhattan<br /> Bank holding a large paper bag in her hand.  She told the young man<br /> at the window that she wished to take the 3 million she had in the<br /> bag and open an account with the bank.  She said that first, though,<br /> she wished to meet the president of Chase Manhattan Bank due to the<br /> amount of money involved.</p>
<p>The teller seemed to think that was a reasonable request and after<br /> opening the paper bag and seeing the bundles of 1,000 bills which<br /> amounted to right around 3 million, telephoned the bank's secretary<br /> to obtain an appointment for the lady.</p>
<p>The lady was escorted upstairs and ushered into the president's<br /> office.  Introductions were made and she stated that she would like<br /> to get to know the people she did business with on a more personal<br /> level.  The bank president then asked her where she came into such a<br /> large amount of money. ""Was it an inheritance?"" he asked. ""No."" she<br /> answered.  ""Was it from playing the stock market?""  ""No."" she<br /> replied.</p>
<p>He was quiet for a minute, trying to think of where this little old<br /> lady could possibly come into 3 million.  ""I bet."" she stated.  ""You<br /> bet?"" repeated the bank president.  ""As in horses?""  ""No."" she<br /> replied, ""I bet people.""</p>
<p>Seeing his confusion, she explained that she justs bets on different<br /> things with different people.  All of a sudden she said, ""I'll bet<br /> you $25,<br /> 000.00 that by 10:00 o'clock tomorrow morning, your balls will be<br /> square.""</p>
<p>The bank president figured she must be off her rocker and decided to<br /> take her up on the bet.  He didn't see how he could lose.  For the<br /> rest of the day, the bank president was very careful.  He decided to<br /> stay home that evening and take no chances; there was $25,<br /> 000.00 at stake.</p>
<p>When he got up in the morning and took his shower, he checked to<br /> make sure everything was okay.  There was no difference- he looked<br /> the same as he always had.  He went to work and waited for the<br /> little old lady to come in at 10:00 o'clock, humming as he went.  He<br /> knew this would be a good day- how often do you get handed $25,<br /> 000.00 for doing nothing.  At 10:00 o'clock sharp the little old<br /> lady was shown into his office.  With her was a younger man. When he<br /> inquired as to the man's purpose for being there, she informed him<br /> that he was her lawyer and she always took him along when there was<br /> this much money involved.</p>
<p>""Well,"" she asked, ""what about our bet?""  ""I don't know how to tell<br /> you this,"" he replied, ""but I am the same as I've always been only<br /> $25,<br /> 000.00 richer.""  The lady seemed to accept this, but requested that<br /> she be able to see for herself.  The bank president thought this was<br /> reasonable and dropped his trousers. She instructed him to bend over<br /> and then grabbed a hold of him.  Sure enough, everything was fine.<br /> The bank president then looked up and saw her lawyer standing across<br /> the room banging his head against the wall.</p>
<p>""What' wrong with him?"" he inquired.  ""Oh him,""  she replied, ""I bet<br /> him $100,<br /> 000.00 that by 10:00 o'clock this morning that I'd have the<br /> president of Chase Manhattan Bank by the balls.""</p>

<p>On the seventeenth tee the wife said to her husband: 'Honey, since we're being honest I have something to tell you. Fifty-two years ago I had a sex change. I was a man before we met. </p>
<p>The husband went into a fit! He cursed, threw his driver into the water, broke his clubs one by one and tore at his clothes as he screamed and ranted. 'You liar, you despicable liar! How could you? I trusted you! And to think that you've been hitting off the red tees all this time!'</p>

<p>He smiles at the young girl and she strikes up a conversation with him. As they talk, her robe slips open, and it quite obvious that she has nothing on under the robe. Poor guy breaks out into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, she places her hand on his arm and says, ""Let's go in my apartment, I hear someone coming..."" He precedes her into the apartment, and after she closes the door, she leans against it allowing her robe to fall completely open. She purrs at him, ""What would you say is my best feature?""</p>
<p>The flustered, embarrassed guy stammers, clears his throat several times, and finally squeaks out ""Oh, it's got to be your ears!""</p>

<p>Clearing his throat once again, he stammers - ""Outside when you said you heard someone coming - THAT WAS ME!""</p>

<p>At the very last minute, she realized that she didn't have any snails for this dinner party, so she asked her husband to run down to the beach with the bucket she was handing him to gather some snails.<br /> Very grudgingly he agreed. </p>
<p>He took the bucket, walked out the door, down the steps, and out to the beach. As he was collecting the snails, he noticed a beautiful woman strolling alongside the water just a little further down the beach. He kept thinking to himself ""Wouldn't it be great if she<br /> would even just come down and talk to me."" He went back to gathering the snails. </p>
<p>All of a sudden he looked up, and the beautiful woman was standing right over him. They got to talking, and she invited him back to her place. They were at her apartment a ways down the beach, and they started messing around. It got so hot and heavy, that he was exhausted afterwards and passed out there. </p>

17409,"<p>On the WBAM FM morning show in Chicago, the DJs play a game<br /> where they award winners great prizes. The game is called ""Mate<br /> Match."" The DJs call someone at work and ask if they are married<br /> or seriously involved with someone. If the contestant answers<br /> yes, he or she is then asked 3 random yet highly personal<br /> questions.</p>
<p>The person is also asked to divulge the name of their partner<br /> (with phone number) for verification. If their partner answers<br /> those same three questions correctly, they both win the prize.</p>

<p>DJ: ""Question #2 - How long did it last?""</p>
<p>Brian: ""About 10 minutes.""</p>

I don't owe you anything for this.""<br /> A lawyer, sitting nearby and overhearing the conversation, then says to the<br /> bartender, ""You know, he's got you there. In the original offer, which<br /> constitutes a binding contract upon acceptance, there was no stipulation of<br /> remuneration."" </p>

17412,"<p>A wife and her husband were having a dinner party for some important guests. The wife was very excited about this and wanted everything to be perfect. At the very last minute, she realized that she didn't have any snails for the dinner party, so she asked her husband to run down to the beach with the bucket and get some.Very grudgingly he agreed.  He took the bucket, walked out the door, down the steps, and out to the beach.  As he was collecting the snails, he noticed a beautiful woman strolling alongside the water just a little further down the beach.He kept thinking to himself, 'Wouldn't it be great if she would just come down and talk to me?'  He went back to gathering the snails.  All of a sudden he looked up and the beautiful woman was standing right over him. They started talking and she invited him back to her place.  They ended up spending the night together.  At seven o'clock the next morning he woke up and exclaimed 'Oh no' 'My wife's dinner party'.  He gathered all his clothes, put them on real fast, grabbed his bucket and ran out the door.  He ran down the beach all the way to his apartment.  He ran up the stairs of his apartment. He was in such a hurry that when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the bucket of snails.There were snails all down the stairs.  The door opened just then, with a very angry wife standing in the doorway wondering where he's been all this time.He looked at the snails all down the steps, then looked at her, then back at the snails and said, 'Come on guys we're almost there'.</p>

<p>Eventually, it was Little Johnny's turn. The teacher held her breath. Little Johnny walked to the front of<br /> the classroom and dumped a box full of cash on the teacher's desk. ""$2,467,"" he said.</p>
<p>""$2,467!"" cried the teacher, ""What in the world were you selling?""</p>
<p>""Toothbrushes,"" said Little Johnny.</p>
<p>""Toothbrushes?"" echoed the teacher, ""How could you possibly sell enough toothbrushes to make that much money?""</p>
<p>""I found the busiest corner in town,"" said Little Johnny, ""I set up a Dip &amp; Chip stand. I gave everybody who walked by a sample. </p>

17420,"<p>One day, a man complained to his friend, ""My elbow really hurts, guess I should see a doctor.""</p>
<p>His friend said, ""Don't do that. There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. And it only costs $10.00.""</p>
<p>The guy figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise andvarious lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read:<br /> You have tennis elbow.<br /> Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor.<br /> It will be better in two weeks.</p>
<p>That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this computer could be fooled.</p>
<p>He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in thisample and deposited the $10.00. The machine again made the usual noises,flashedlights, and printed out the following analysis:<br /> Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.<br /> Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.<br /> Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br /> Your wife is pregnant....twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.</p>

17425,"<p>Three blondes were witnesses to a crime, so they went to the police station to identify the suspect. The police chief said he would show them a mug shot of someone for thirty seconds, then ask each one for a description. After showing the photo to the first blonde, he covered it, then asked her how she would recognize the suspect. </p>
<p>""Easy,"" she replied. ""He only has one eye.""</p>
<p>The chief was stunned. ""He only has one eye because it is a profile shot! Think about it!"" He repeated the procedure for the second blonde and again asked how she would recognize him. </p>
<p>""He only has one ear,"" was her answer.</p>
<p>""What is the matter with you people?!? It is a profile shot! You are seeing him from the side!"" He repeated the procedure for the third blonde, then said, ""How would you recognize the suspect? Now think before you give me a stupid answer.""</p>
<p>After viewing the photo, she thought for a minute, then said, ""He's wearing contact lenses.""</p>
<p>This took the chief by surprise. He looked real hard at the picture and couldn't tell if the suspect had contacts or not, so he went into the database and looked at the report. Sure enough, when the mug shot was taken, he was wearing contact lenses! He went back to her and asked, ""How could you tell he was wearing contact lenses? Nobody else here in this precinct saw that!""</p>
<p>""Well,"" she said, ""he can't wear regular glasses with only one eye and one ear, now, can he?""</p>

<p>If you lick your envelopes...You won't anymore!!!! A woman was<br /> working in a post office in California. One day she licked the<br /> envelopes and postage stamps instead of using a sponge. That<br /> very day the lady cut her tongue on the envelope. A week later,<br /> she noticed an abnormal swelling of her tongue. She went to the<br /> doctor, and they found nothing wrong. Her tongue was not sore or<br /> anything.</p>
<p>A couple of days later, her tongue started to swell more, and it<br /> began to get really sore, so sore, that she could not eat. She<br /> went back to the hospital, and demanded something be done. The<br /> doctor took an x-ray of her tongue, and noticed a lump. He<br /> prepared her for minor surgery. When the doctor cut her tongue<br /> open, a live roach crawled out. There were roach eggs on the<br /> seal of the envelope. The egg was able to hatch inside of her<br /> tongue, because of her saliva. It was warm and moist... </p>

To All: I used to work for<br /> a print shop (32 years ago) and we were told NEVER to lick the<br /> envelopes. I never understood why until I had to go into storage<br /> and pull out 2500 envelops that were already printed for a<br /> customer who was doing a mailing and saw several squads of<br /> roaches roaming around inside a couple of boxes with eggs<br /> everywhere. They eat the glue on the envelopes. I think print<br /> shops have a harder time controlling roaches than a restaurant.<br /> I always buy the self sealing type.

<p>  Tom goes up to the pharmacy counter and asks the<br /> pharmacist for some Trojans, (just like the kid in Summer of<br /> '42).  The pharmacist looks at Tom disgustedly and says,<br /> ""What's wrong with you kids today, ya go on two dates and you<br /> wanna go to bed with each other.  Why can't ya save sex for<br /> when ya get married.  You should wait until you're married!<br /> Sex before marriage is a sin ya know.""</p>
<p>  Well Tom calmed down the pharmacist and explained that<br /> his generation was a little different.  He said that he and<br /> his girlfriend were just trying to act responsibly and take<br /> precautions against pregnancy and disease.  The pharmacist<br /> conceded that times were changing and finally sold him the<br /> condoms.</p>

17495,"<p>TRUE STORY (SO I'M TOLD)If you think computers are a great invention!In March 1997, a man living in Newton near Boston Massachusetts received a bill for his as yet unused credit card stating that he owed $0.00.He ignored it and threw it away.   In April he received another and threw that one away too. The following month the credit card Company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn't send them $0.00 by return of post.  He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they'd take care of it.The following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. However, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been canceled.He called the credit card Company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it.The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue.  Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out.The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt.Finally giving in he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all.A week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check processing software to fail.  The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the computer to crash.  The following month the man received a letter from the credit card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check by return of post they would be taking steps to recover the debt.  The man, who had been considering buying his wife a Computer for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.</p>

17499,"<p>A man with a 25 inch penis went to his doctor and complained he<br /> was unable to establish an intimate relationship with a lady due<br /> to his size. ""Doctor,"" he asked in total frustration, ""is there<br /> any way you can shorten it?"" The doctor replied, ""medically son,<br /> nothing can be done; but, I know of a witch who may be able to<br /> help you"", and he gave him directions to the witch's house.</p>
<p>The man calls upon the witch and explains his dilemma: ""Witch,<br /> my penis is 25 inches long, so I cannot establish an intimate<br /> relationship with a lady?"" The witch stares in amazement,<br /> scratches her head, and then replies, ""I think I have a solution<br /> to your problem. You need to go deep in the forest to Hidden<br /> Pond. You will see a frog sitting on a log who can solve your<br /> dilemma. You must ask the frog, 'will you marry me?' Each time<br /> the frog says 'NO' to your proposal, your penis will shrink five<br /> inches."" </p>
<p>The man couldn't hide his excitement as he dashed into the<br /> forest and located Hidden Pond. He called out to the frog, ""will<br /> you marry me?"" The frog looked at him dejectedly and replied,<br /> ""NO!"" The man looked down and suddenly his penis was 5 inches<br /> shorter. ""WOW,"" he screamed, ""this is great!! But it's still too<br /> long at 20 inches, so I'll ask the frog to marry me again.""<br /> ""Frog, will you marry me?"", he shouted. The frog rolled its eyes<br /> back in its head and screamed back, ""NO!"" The man felt another<br /> twitch in his penis, looked down, and it shrank another 5<br /> inches. The man reflected, ""this is fantastic, but 15 inches is<br /> still a monster; just a little shorter would be ideal"".<br /> Grinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, ""Frog will<br /> you marry me?"" The frog looked back across pond shaking its head<br /> in disgust, ""How many times do I have to tell you? NO! ... NO!<br /> ... and for the last time, NO!""</p>

17511,"<p>A man in a bar has a couple of beers and the bartender tells him he owes $4. ''But I paid, don't you remember?'' says the customer. ''Okay,'' says the bartender, ''if you said you paid, you did.'' The man then goes outside and tells the first person he sees that the bartender can't keep track of whether his customers have paid. The second man then ruses in, orders a beer and later pulls the same stunt. The barkeep replies, ''If you say you paid, I'll take your word for it.'' Soon the customer goes into the street, sees an old friend, and tells him how to get free drinks. The man hurries into the bar and begins to drink highballs when suddenly, the bartender leans over and says, ''You know, a funny thing happened in here tonight. Two men were drinking beer, neither paid and both claimed that they did. The next guy who tries that is going to get punched right in the nose.'' ''Don't bother me with your troubles,'' the final patron responds. ''Just give me my change and I'll be on my way.''</p>

She shook it, held it up and said, ""I bet I know what it is � it's some flowers!"" ""That's right!"", shouted the little boy. Then the candy store owner's daughter handed the teacher a gift. She held it up, shook it and said, ""I bet I know what it is � it's a box of candy!"" ""That's right!"" shouted the little girl. The next gift was from the liquor store owner's son. The teacher held it up and saw that it was leaking. She touched a drop with her finger and tasted it. ""Is it wine?"", she asked. ""No"", the boy answered. The teacher touched another drop to her tongue. ""Is it champagne?"", she asked. ""No"", the boy answered. ""What is it?""""A puppy!""</p>

17520,"<p>Rose Bushel, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered that her<br /> presidential husband's great-great uncle, Gunther Bushel, a fellow lacking<br /> in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Texas in<br /> 1889. The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing on the<br /> gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:</p>
<p>""Gunther Bushel; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885, escaped 1887,<br /> robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times.  Caught by Pinkerton Detectives,<br /> convicted and hanged in 1889.""</p>
<p>After letting her husband and his political staff of professional image<br /> consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther's picture,<br /> scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with image processing<br /> software so that all that's seen is a head shot.</p>
<p>The following accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the Associated<br /> Press:</p>
<p>""Gunther Bushel was a famous rancher in early Texas history. His business<br /> empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and<br /> intimate dealings with the Texas railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted<br /> several years of his life to service at a government facility, finally<br /> taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad.  In 1887,  he was a<br /> key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective<br /> Agency.  In 1889, Gunther passed away during an important  civic function<br /> held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.""</p>

Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds<br /> you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the<br /> bouncer kicked you out at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were<br /> in your bed with a dozen donuts and a litre of coke watching Good Morning with<br /> Richard and Judy. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 2 Sausage<br /> Rolls and a litre of diet coke - yet you haven't peed once.<br /> 4 star hangover ****<br /> Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else you might honk.<br /> You have lost the will to live. Your boss has already lambasted you for being<br /> late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes,<br /> but that can't hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving,<br /> (girls, it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars),<br /> your teeth have sweaters, your eyes look like one big vein<br /> and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the class picture of<br /> Moss side secondary school circa 1976. You would give a weeks pay for one the<br /> following: 1. Home time, 2. A duvet and somewhere to be alone, or 3. A time<br /> machine so you could go back and NOT have gone out the night before.<br /> 5 star hangover (aka Dante's 4th Circle of Hell) *****<br /> You have a second heartbeat in your head which is actually scaring the<br /> employee who sits next to you. Death seems pretty good right now. You can't<br /> focus as your eyes are scrunched up against the overpowering glare from your<br /> computer screen Rancid vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore, staining your<br /> shirt and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of<br /> your mouth, at least you think it's toothpaste crust. You don't give a damn<br /> either way. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva and your tongue is<br /> suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in<br /> your body. Talking is not an option. Your boss doesn't even get mad at you and<br /> your co-workers think that your dog just died because you look so pathetic. You<br /> should have called in sick because all you can manage to do is breathe....very<br /> gently.</p>

17570,"<p>A very wealthy lawyer vacationed for several weeks each year at his summer<br /> home in the backwoods of Maine. Each summer, he would invite friends to come to<br /> visit him. </p>
<p>One summer he invited a lawyer from the Czech Republic to visit. The friend,<br /> eager to see how a wealthy American vacationed, gratefully agreed. They had a<br /> wonderful vacation, and spent a great deal of time exploring the woods and<br /> enjoying the natural setting.</p>
<p>One morning, as the lawyer and his Czech friend were walking through the<br /> woods, they were approached by two huge bears -- a male and a female. The lawyer<br /> noticed them in time to run for cover. His friend, however, was not so lucky.<br /> The male bear reached him and swallowed him whole.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the lawyer ran to his Mercedes and sped for the nearest town to<br /> get the local sheriff. The sheriff grabbed a high-powered rifle and they raced<br /> back to the berry patch. Luckily, the bears were still there. </p>
<p>""He's in THAT one!"" cried the lawyer, pointing at the bear that had consumed<br /> his friend. ""Quick -- shoot it. Maybe we can still save my friend!""</p>
<p>The sheriff looked at the bears, leveled his gun, took careful aim, and shot<br /> the female. His aim was true, and the female bear collapsed to the ground. The<br /> startled male fled into the woods.</p>
<p>""Why did you do that?"" demanded the lawyer, ""I said he was in the other bear!"" </p>
<p>""Exactly,"" replied the sheriff. ""Would YOU believe a lawyer who told you<br /> that the Czech was in the male?</p>

17589,"<p>I've been to Nascar races at Charlotte, Rockingham, and the track at North Wilkesboro.  This is what I learned.</p>
<p>How To Turn Your House Into The Nascar Experience A Humorous Look at Race Fans and the Sport They Love</p>
<p>If you're like me, you'd like to attend more Nascar races, but you don't have the time or money to go.  So I put together a list of things you can do to your home so you and your friends can enjoy the race as if you were there.</p>
<p>1. Invite 15 to 20 of your closest friends to your house for the race.  Make everyone dress in shirts and hats with their favorite driver on them.  But don't invite them to show up the day of the race, invite them to come over on Friday for qualifying and camp out for the weekend.</p>
<p>2. Some of your friends will show up in cars, and some will rent a U-haul truck.  A few of them will pool their money together and get an RV.  Stand outside with two flashlights and direct traffic to the grassy areas in your front yard.  Charge everybody 8 bucks to park except the RV.  Charge them 15 bucks for the weekend cause they're twice as big.</p>
<p>3. Since they're not allowed to use your kitchen, make your buddies do all their cooking on the beat-up barbeque grill they brought in the U-Haul.  The friends that didn't bring a grill can build a campfire.  They'll cut down several of the limbs on the Oak tree in your yard for firewood.</p>
<p>4. When the guys need more ice for their beer coolers, charge them 3 dollars for a one-dollar bag of ice.</p>
<p>5. Tell your friends they can't use the bathroom in the house.  They have to use the port-a-john you rented for the weekend and placed off the driveway.</p>
<p>6. If any of females in the neighborhood drive or walk by your house and stare at the congregation of people in the yard, hold up a crudely made cardboard sign that says ""SHOW ME YOUR TITS!""</p>
<p>7. On Saturday, have everyone climb on top of the RV to sunbathe and drink while listening to coverage of the Busch race.</p>
<p>8. When the booze runs out, send someone on a beer run with the four-wheeler one of your friends brought in his truck.</p>
<p>9. After the party winds down, let'em crash in the back of the U-haul on some old mattresses and sleeping bags.  Or they can sleep in their car.</p>
<p>10. On Sunday morning have the friend with the loudest car stereo system crank up some Lynard Skynard so loud that it wakes all up all your friends.  It will also annoy the neighbors down the street.</p>
<p>11. Nutrition is important, so start your race day with Pop-tarts and beer for breakfast.</p>
<p>12. Finally it's time for the big race.  Take all the comfortable furniture out of your living room.  Then put in twenty metal folding chairs in rows of five with a narrow aisle down the middle.</p>
<p>13. Before letting them in, inspect all your friends' coolers to make sure they don't have more than a 12 pack.  Make them store the coolers under their seats.</p>
<p>14. Space the chairs tightly together so no one has any leg room.  That way when someone wants to go to the bathroom everyone has to get up to let'em by.</p>
<p>15. When driver introductions are on television, stand up and give the finger to the driver you hate.  If it's Jeff Gordon, put down your beer and use both hands.</p>
<p>16. Run the television signal through your stereo system and turn the volume up so loud it sounds like the cars are in the room.  Have everyone wear AM radio headphones tuned to the race.  When you want to talk to the guy sitting next to you, scream at the top of your lungs so they can hear you.</p>
<p>17. To recreate the Men's room at a typical Nascar track, let your friends pee in the bathtub to simulate the urine trough.  Then throw an entire roll of toilet paper into the toilet so if anybody tries to flush it will overflow.  To avoid the long line in the bathroom, some of your friends will pee in the sink.</p>
<p>18. Walk up and the down the aisle in the living room with a food tray.  When one of your friends wants something to eat, offer them a 32-ounce Pepsi for 4 dollars and a small serving of nacho chips with melted cheese for another 5 bucks.</p>
<p>19. When there's a wreck, immediately stand up to see the tv better, forcing the people behind you to stand also.  If it's a driver you hate, cheer for the accident.  If the driver's in a close up, start chanting ""YOU SUCK!  YOU SUCK!"" as if he can actually hear you.</p>
<p>20. Turn up the thermostat in your house until it's unbearably hot.  Your friends will take off their shirts because they're sweating profusely.  Use this as an opportunity to sell them some more 4-dollar sodas and five-buck Miller Lite tallboys.</p>
<p>21. At the end of the race, have the Dale Jr. fan pick on the Jeff Gordon fan by accusing Gordon of intentionally knocking Junior into the wall to win the race.  After the alcohol-fueled fistfight breaks out, call the cops and have the two drunks hauled away without their shirts.</p>
<p>22. Once the race coverage is over, leave all your trash on the floor next to your chair.  Since the seats are so close together, your friends will ruin your carpet stepping on leftover nachos, peanut shells, half filled cups of Pepsi and empty beer cans.</p>
<p>23. Run out to the parking lot in your front yard.  Then move your car to a spot that blocks all the other vehicles from exiting.  Make your friends wait an hour or two before letting them leave. A number of them will relieve themselves in the yard during the wait due to all the beer they consumed during the race.</p>
<p>24. Before your friends go, they'll throw the leftover trash in their cars on the ground where they parked.</p>
<p>25. The next day hire some Mexicans to clean up the yard and all the trash left in your living room.  Then discover that someone puked on your azaleas.</p>
<p>If you follow the steps listed above, you'll enjoy the race just as much as the people at the track.  By the way, tickets are still available for the last fall race at Rockingham.</p>
<p>But don't look for me there.  I'll be at home.</p>

17591,"<p>A nursery school teacher was delivering a station wagon full of kids home one day when a fire truck zoomed by.</p>
<p>Sitting in the front seat of the fire truck was a Dalmation dog. </p>
<p>The children started discussing what the dog's duties might be.</p>
<p>""They use him to keep crowds back,"" said one youngster.</p>
<p>""No,"" said another. ""He's just for good luck."" </p>
<p>A third child concluded, ""No, silly, they use the dogs to find the fire hydrant!"" </p>

<p>The second guy says, ""Wow, you have an airplane? Let's go!""</p>
<p>So they go for a tour around the city in the plane. Eventually they run<br /> low on fuel and need to land. The blond pilot starts circling around<br /> looking for a place to land. He sees an airstrip close by. He says his new<br /> buddy along for the ride, ""Let's land here. It looks like it's as good a<br /> place as any.""</p>
<p>So he circles around and goes in for a landing, but at the last minute he<br /> swerves and pulls back up. ""Damn!"" he says, ""That is the shortest runway I<br /> have ever seen! How is anyone supposed to land on it?"" Since it's the only<br /> runway nearby, he decides to try again, with the same result.</p>
<p>Getting pretty irritated, the pilot says to his friend, ""All right, I'm<br /> going to try one more time, and if I can't land it we're just going to<br /> crash and hope we don't die."" So they end up crashing, and miraculously<br /> neither is hurt.</p>
<p>When they crawl out of the wreckage, the first guy is swearing and<br /> gesticulates wildly at the runway. ""I'm gonna find whoever designed this<br /> crazy runway and wring his neck! He must be total moron! No one could land<br /> on anything that short!""</p>
<p>The second guy looks around and says ""Yeah, but look how wide it is!""</p>

17689,"<p>A lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long<br /> flight from LA to NY. The lawyer leans over to her and asks if<br /> she would like to play a fun game. The blonde just wants to take<br /> a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to<br /> catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the<br /> game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains ""I ask you a<br /> question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and<br /> visa-versa."" Again, she politely declines and tries to get some<br /> sleep.</p>
<p>The lawyer, now some what agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't<br /> know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I<br /> will pay you $50!"" figuring that since she is a blonde that he<br /> will easily win the match. This catches the blonde's attention<br /> and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless<br /> she plays, agrees to the game.</p>
<p>The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from<br /> the earth to the moon?"" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches<br /> in to her purse, pulls out a $5 bill and hands it to the lawyer.<br /> Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer: ""What goes up<br /> a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?"" The lawyer<br /> looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop<br /> computer and searches all his references. He taps into the<br /> Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of<br /> Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his coworkers and<br /> friends. All to no avail.</p>
<p>After over an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $50. The<br /> blonde politely takes the $50 and turns away to get back to<br /> sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the<br /> blonde and asks, ""Well, so what IS the answer!?"" Without a word,<br /> the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes<br /> back to sleep.</p>

17690,"<p>Twas the night before Christmas, and God it was neat.<br /> The kids were both gone, and my wife was in heat.</p>
<p>The doors were all bolted, the phone off the hook,<br /> It was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook.</p>
<p>Momma in her teddy and I in the nude,<br /> Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube. </p>
<p>When out on the lawn there arose such a cry,<br /> That I lost my boner, and  momma went dry.</p>
<p>Up to the window I sprang like an elf,<br /> Tore back the shade while she played with herself. </p>
<p>The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built,<br /> Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.</p>
<p>When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br /> But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangey reindeer. </p>
<p>With a fat little driver, half out of the sled,<br /> A sock in his ear and a bra on his head.</p>
<p>Sure as I'm speaking, he was high as a kite,<br /> And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right. </p>
<p>Woa Shithead, woa Asshole, woa Stupid, woa Putz,<br /> Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your nuts.</p>
<p>Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree,<br /> Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee.</p>
<p>They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub,<br /> Just as Santa leaned out and threw up on my shrub.</p>
<p>And then from the roof we heard such a clatter,<br /> As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder.</p>
<p>I was donning my jockies, to cover my ass,<br /> When down the chimney Santa came with a crash.</p>
<p>His suit was all smelly with perfume galore,<br /> He looked like a bum and he smelled like a whore. </p>
<p>""That was some brothel,"" he said with a smile,<br /> ""The reindeer are pooped, and I'll just stay awhile"" </p>
<p>He walked to the kitchen for himself poured a drink,<br /> Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink.</p>
<p>I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee,<br /> The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee.</p>
<p>Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack,<br /> But his toys were all gone, and some new things were packed. </p>
<p>The first thing he found was a pair of false tits,<br /> The next was a handgun with a penis that spits.</p>
<p>A box filled with condoms was Santa's next find,<br /> And six pair of panties, the edible kind.</p>
<p>A bra without nipples, a penis extension,<br /> And several more things I shouldn't even mention. </p>
<p>A fuck ring, a G-string, and all types of oil,<br /> And a dildo so long that it lay in a coil.</p>
<p>""This stuff ain't for kids, Mrs. Santa will shit,<br /> So I'll leave 'em here, and then I'll just split.""</p>
<p>He filled every stocking and then took his leave,<br /> With one tiny butt plug stuck under his sleeve.</p>
<p>He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead,<br /> Thus he fell on his ass and broke wind instead.</p>
<p>In time he was seated, took reigns of his hitch,<br /> Saying, ""Take me home, Rudolf. This night's been a bitch!"" </p>
<p>The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout,<br /> ""The best thing about pussy is you can't wear it out!!""</p>

The<br /> first old lady said she enjoyed sex now just as much as ever.<br /> The second old lady was surprised and asked her what her secret<br /> was. The first old lady said when she hears her husband pulling<br /> the car into the garage she hurries and takes a shower, jumps<br /> into bed and throws her feet up over her head. When her husband<br /> comes into the bedroom he gets turned on and has his way with<br /> her.</p>
<p>The second old lady decides to try this approach so that night<br /> when she heard her husband coming home, she takes a quick<br /> shower, jumps into bed and throws her feet up over her head.

<p>""Now just hang on a minute, give me a chance to explain chief,"" says the Missionary. ""You're jumping to conclusions here. Let me tell you a story. See all those white sheep out in the field and how there's one black one amongst them."" </p>

So these three men<br /> travelled to the bridge.  The first man stood at the side of the<br /> bridge, jumped off, shouted 'billions of thousand dollar bills'<br /> and he land in a huge pile of money.  The second guy stood at<br /> the side of the bridge, jumped off, shouted 'naked supermodels'<br /> and he landed in the arms of hundreds of naked supermodels<br /> (female and MALE).  The third guy had no idea what to wish for.<br /> He stood at the edge of the bridge for a long time, finally he<br /> took a step forward, tripped, screamed 'shit' and landed...in a<br /> pile of poo.</p>

17695,"<p>I can please only one person per day. Today is not your day.    And tomorrow isn't looking good either.   I don't have an attitude problem. You have a perception problem.   Everyone has a right to be stupid. Some just abuse the privilege.   Young at Heart. Slightly Older in Other Places.   Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky and I    thought to myself, 'Where the hell is the ceiling?!'   Show me a man with both feet firmly on the ground, and I will show   you a  man who can't get his pants off!   We have a strange and wonderful relationship. You're strange and I'm    wonderful, or should that be I'm strange and you're wonderful?   Never put off until tomorrow what you can avoid doing altogether.   If swimming is so good for your figure, how do you explain whales?   It's gonna be like threading a needle with a haystack.    The trouble with being in the rat race is that even if you win,    you're still a rat.   Am I getting smart with you? ....How would you know?   Not one shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea that life is    serious.   The more you run over a dead cat, the flatter it gets.   I put the 'fun' in dysfunctional.   Life is like a box of chocolates. It's full of nuts.   All I ask is that you treat me no differently than you would the    Queen.   Does 'anal retentive' have a hyphen?    I get plenty of exercise -- jumping to conclusions, pushing my    luck, and dodging deadlines.   Please, Lord, let me prove that winning the lottery won't spoil me.   Does vacuuming count as Aerobic Exercise?   I have not yet begun to procrastinate.   You're slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut    butter.   I don't suffer from stress. I'm a carrier.   I'd give my right arm to be ambidextrous.   Just remember, no matter where you go, there you are. --   It is much easier to apologize than to ask permission.   There are two rules for ultimate success in life. 1. Never tell    everything you know.   Just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they're NOT out to    get you................   I'd explain it to you, but your brain would explode.   When I get to where I'm going, will somebody please tell me where I   am?   Tell me what you need, and I'll tell you how to get along without it.   Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and    taste good with ketchup.   Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.   The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.   Do not meddle in the affairs of cats, for they are subtle and will    Whiz on your computer.   Someday we'll look back on all this and plow into a parked car.</p>

<p>""Suicidal Twin kills sister by mistake""!</p>
"
17701,"<p>Two sisters inherited the family ranch. Unfortunately, after<br /> just a few years, they were in financial trouble. In order to<br /> keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they needed to<br /> purchase a bull so that they could breed their own stock. </p>
<p>The sister who balanced their checkbook, a brunette, took their<br /> last 600 dollars out west to a ranch where a man had a prize<br /> bull for sale. Upon leaving, she told her blonde sister, ""When I<br /> get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to<br /> drive out after me and haul it home."" </p>
<p>The brunette arrived at the man's ranch, inspected the bull, and<br /> decided she did want to buy it. The man told her that he would<br /> sell it for 599 dollars, no less. After paying him, she drove to<br /> the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the<br /> news. </p>
<p>She walked into the telegraph office, and said, ""I want to send<br /> a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for<br /> our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck<br /> and drive out here so we can haul it home."" </p>
<p>The telegraph operator explained that he'd be glad to help her,<br /> then added, ""It's just 99 cents a word."" Well, after paying for<br /> the bull, the brunette only had 1 dollar left. She realized that<br /> she'd only be able to send her sister one word. </p>
<p>After thinking for a few minutes, she nodded, and said, ""I want<br /> you to send her the word, 'comfortable.'""</p>
<p>The telegraph operator shook his head. ""How is she ever going to<br /> know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck<br /> and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you<br /> send her the word, 'comfortable'?"" </p>
<p>The sister explained, ""She'll read it very slowly:<br /> Come-for-the-bull""</p>

17713,"<p>Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean, two prawns were swimming around in the sea. One was called Justin and the other was called Christian. Life was good, except that the prawns were constantly being chased and threatened by sharks. Finally one day, Justin said to Christian, ""I'm tired of being a prawn. I wish I was a shark, then I wouldn't have to worry about being eaten.""<br /> Just then a mysterious cod appeared and said, ""Your wish is granted,"" and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark. Horrified, Christian swam off, afraid of being eaten up by his old friend.</p>
<p>Time went by and Justin found himself bored and lonely as a shark. All his old pals were afraid of him and swam away whenever he came near. Then one day he was out swimming and saw the mysterious cod. </p>
<p>""I want to be a prawn again,"" said Justin. ""Please change me back!"" And lo and behold, the cod changed him back to a prawn. With tears of joy in his little eyes, Justin swam to Christian's house and knocked on the door. ""It's me, Justin, your old friend! Come out and see me!"" he shouted. </p>
<p>""No,"" said Christian. ""I'll not be tricked. You're a shark and you will eat me!""</p>
<p>Justin cried back, ""No, I'm not! That was the old me. I've changed. I've found Cod, I'm a prawn again, Christian!""</p>

17732,"<p>Subject: Going Toastal  -- a tale for the dilbert age Day 1: My boss, an engineer from the pre-CAD days, has successfully brought a generation of products from Acme Toaster Corp's engineering labs to market. Bob is a wonder of mechanical ingenuity. All of us in the design department have the utmost respect for him, so I was honored when he appointed me the lead designer on the new Acme 2000 Toaster.Day 6: We met with the president, head of sales, and the marketing vice president today to hammer out the project's requirements and specifications. Here at Acme, our market share is eroding to low-cost imports. We agreed to meet a cost of goods of $9.50 (100,000). I've identified the critical issue in the new design: a replacement for the timing spring we've used since the original 1922 model. Research with the focus groups shows that consumers set high expectations for their breakfast foods. Cafe latte from Starbuck's goes best with a precise level of toastal browning. The Acme 2000 will give our customers the breakfast experience they desire. I estimated a design budget of $21,590 for this project and final delivery in seven weeks. I'll need one assistant designer to help with the drawing packages. This is my first chance to supervise!Day 23: We've found the ideal spring material. Best of all, it's a well-proven technology. Our projected cost of goods is almost $1.50 lower than our goal. Our rough prototype, which was completed just 12 days after we started, has been servicing the employee cafeteria for a week without a single hiccup. Toastal quality exceeds projections.Day 24: A major aerospace company that had run out of defense contractors to acquire has just snapped up that block of Acme stock sold to the Mac-kenzie family in the '50s. At a companywide meeting, corporate assured us that this sale was only an investment and that nothing will change.Day 30: I showed the Acme 2000's exquisitely crafted toastal-timing mechanism to Ms Primrose, the new engineering auditor. The single spring and four interlocking lever arms are things of beauty to me.Day 36: The design is complete. We're starting a prototype run of 500 toasters tomorrow. I'm starting to wrap up the engineering effort. My new assistant did a wonderful job.Day 38: Suddenly, a major snag happened. Bob called me into his office.  He seemed very uneasy as he informed me that those on high feel that the Acme 2000 is obsolete--something about using springs in the silicon age.  I reminded Bob that the consultants had looked at using a microprocessor but figured that an electronic design would exceed our cost target by almost 50% with no real benefit in terms of toastal quality. 'With a computer, our customers can load the bread the night before, program a finish time, and get a perfect slice of toast when they awaken,' Bob intoned, as if reading from a script.Day 48: Chuck Compguy, the new microprocessor whiz, scrapped my idea of using a dedicated 4-bit CPU. 'We need some horsepower if we're gonna program this puppy in C,' he said, while I stared fascinated at the old crumbs stuck in his wild beard. 'Time-to-market, you know. Delivery is due in three months. We'll just pop this cool new 8-bitter I found into it, whip up some code, and ship to the end user.'Day 120: The good news is that I'm getting to stretch my mechanical-design abilities. Chuck convinced management that the old spring-loaded, press-down lever control is obsolete. I've designed a 'motorized insertion port,' stealing ideas from a CD-ROM drive. Three cross-coupled, safety-interlock microswitches ensure that the heaters won't come on unless users properly insert the toast. We're seeing some reliability problems due to the temperature extremes, but I'm sure we can work those out.Day 132: New schedule: We now expect delivery in three months. We've replaced the 8-bitter with a Harvard- architecture, 16-bit, 3-MIPS CPU.Day 172: New schedule: We now expect delivery in three months.Day 194: The auditors convinced management we really need a graphical user interface with a full-screen LCD. 'You're gonna need some horsepower to drive that,' Chuck warned us. 'I recommend a 386 with a half-meg of RAM.' He went back to design Revision J of the pc board.Day 268: New schedule: We now expect delivery in three months. We've cured most of the electronics' temperature problems with a pair of fans, though management is complaining about the noise. Bob sits in his office all day, door locked, drinking Jack Daniels. Like clockwork, his wife calls every night around midnight, sobbing. I'm worried about him and mentioned my concern to Chuck. 'Wife?' he asked. 'Wife? Yeah, I think I've got one of those and two or three kids, too. Now, let's just stick another meg of RAM in here, OK?'Day 290: We gave up on the custom GUI and are now installing Windows CE.  The auditors applauded Chuck's plan to upgrade to a Pentium with 32 Mbytes of RAM. There's still no functioning code, but the toaster is genuinely impressive. Four circuit boards, bundles of cables, and a gigabit of hard-disk space. 'This sucker has more computer power than the entire world did 20 years ago,' Chuck boasted proudly.Day 384: Toastal quality is sub-par. The addition of two more cooling fans keeps the electronics to a reasonable temperature but removes too much heat from the toast. I'm struggling with baffles to vector the air, but the thrust of all these fans spins the toaster around.</p>

17773,"<p>Once upon a time there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for<br /> baked beans. She loved them but unfortunately they had always had a<br /> very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her.</p>
<p>Then one day she met a guy and fell in love. When it became apparent<br /> that they would marry she thought to herself, ""He is such a sweet<br /> and gentle man, but he would never go for this carrying on.""</p>
<p>So she made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Some months<br /> later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived<br /> in the country she called her husband and told him that she would<br /> be late because she had to walk home. On her way she passed a small<br /> diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand.<br /> Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk<br /> off any ill effects by the time she reached home.</p>
<p>So, she stopped at the &nbsp;diner and before she knew it, she had<br /> consumed three large orders of baked beans. She putt-putted all the<br /> way home, and upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could<br /> control any lingering effects.</p>
<p>Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly,<br /> ""Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.""</p>
<p>He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She<br /> seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from<br /> his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the<br /> blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the phone.</p>
<p>The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the<br /> pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was<br /> out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to<br /> one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a<br /> rotten egg gone worse.</p>
<p>When her husband returned, he instructed her to remove her<br /> blindfold. And when she did, 50 people around her said ""Surprise!""</p>

The stewardess, aware of his predicament suggested that he go ahead and use the ladies room, but cautioned him against using any of the buttons inside. The buttons were marked ""WW, WA, PP and ATR"". Making the mistake that so many men make in disregarding the importance of what a woman says, the man let his curiosity get the best of him and decided to try the buttons anyway. He carefully pressed the first button marked ""WW"" and immediately warm water sprayed all over his entire bottom. He thought, ""WOW, the women really have it made!"". Still curious, he pressed the button marked ""WA"" and a gentle breeze of warm air quickly dried his hind quarters. He thought that was out of this world! The button marked ""PP"" yielded a large powder puff which delicately applied a soft talc to his rear. Well, naturally he couldn't resist the last button marked ""ATR"". When he woke up in the hospital he panicked and buzzed for the nurse.When she appeared, he cried out, ""What happened to me?! The last thing I remember is I was in the ladies room on a business trip!"" The nurse replied, ""Yes, you were having a great time until you pressed the ""ATR"" button which stands for Automatic Tampon Remover... Your penis is under your pillow!""</p>

17790,"<p>One day a blonde woman was so fed up with all of the dumb blonde<br /> jokes that she decided to kill herself. She took a rope outside<br /> and found a suitable tree. She threw the rope over a branch and<br /> proceeded to hang herself.</p>
<p>Soon two men came along and asked, ""what are you doing?"". She<br /> replied, ""I'm hanging myself."" The two men looked at her and<br /> said, ""well usually if your trying to kill yourself you put the<br /> rope around your neck.""

17791,"<p>Dear Santa: </p>
<p>Listen you fat little troll, I've been helping you out every year, playing at being the perfect Christmas present, wearing skimpy bathing suits in frigid weather, and drowning in fake tea from one too many tea parties, and I hate to break it to ya Santa, but IT'S DEFINITELY PAYBACK TIME! There had better be some changes around here by next Christmas, or I'm gonna call for a nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you won't wanna be around to smell it). So, here's my holiday wish list for 1997: </p>
<p>1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized sweatshirt. I'm sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these bathing suits gonna get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have nylon and Velcro crawling up your butt? </p>
<p>2. Real underwear that can be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What bonehead at Mattel decided to cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my skin?!? It looks like cellulite! </p>
<p>3. A REAL man...maybe G.I. Joe. Hell, I'd take Tickle-Me Elmo over that wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend Ken. And what's with that earring anyway? If I'm gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him (and me) anatomically correct. </p>
<p>4. Arms that actually bend so I can push the aforementioned Ken-wimp away once he is anatomically correct. </p>
<p>5. Breast reduction surgery. I don't care whose arm you have to twist, just get it done. </p>
<p>6. A jogging bra. To wear until I get the surgery. </p>
<p>7. A new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don't cut it. How about a systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account exec! </p>
<p>8. A new, more 90's persona. Maybe ""PMS Barbie"", complete with a miniature container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips; ""Animal Rights Barbie"", with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake fur coat and handcuffs; or ""Stop Smoking Barbie"", sporting a removable Nicotrol patch and equipped with several packs of gum. </p>
<p>9. No more McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl. </p>
<p>10. Mattel stock options. It's been 37 years - I think I deserve it. </p>
<p>Ok, Santa, that's it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I don't think these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can find yourself a new bimbo doll for next Christmas. It's that simple. </p>
<p>Yours truly -- Barbie</p>

17838,"<p>About 2 years ago, there was a big flap when a 6 year old boy and his 3 year old sister disappeared from their home. The police searched, the parents freaked, and the media-types looked solemn as they announced that there was still no trace of the children. The kids showed up a few days later. It seems that they had run away from home due to some dispute over second helpings of Ovaltine or some such. The funny part was when the media-type was interviewing the boy. </p>
<p>Interviewer: ""Weren't you cold at night?"" </p>
<p>Boy: ""Naw. We just slept under a porch."" </p>
<p>Interviewer: ""Didn't you get hungry? What did you eat?"" </p>
<p>Boy: ""Slugs."" </p>
<p>Interviewer: (Turning a delightful shade of green but still game.) ""How did you eat them?"" </p>

17844,"<p>Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at Stanford Hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. </p>
<p>Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her five-year-old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness. </p>
<p>The doctor explained the situation to her little brother and asked the boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, 'Yes, I'll do it if it will save Liz.'</p>
<p>As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks.</p>
<p>Then his face grew pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, 'Will I start to die right away?'</p>
<p>Being young, the boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood.</p>

17845,"<p>To the citizens of the United States of America: </p>
<p>In light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. </p>
<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. </p>
<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: </p>
<p>1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. </p>
<p>Then look up ""aluminium"" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. </p>
<p>Look up ""vocabulary"". Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"". </p>
<p>2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. </p>
<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. </p>
<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. </p>
<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen, but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through. </p>
<p>6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. </p>
<p>Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005. </p>
<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for ""shit"" </p>
<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day. </p>
<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. </p>
<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy. </p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

17867,"<p>Let's say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named<br /> Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a<br /> pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner,<br /> and again they enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while<br /> neither one of them is seeing anybody else.</p>
<p>And then, one evening when they're driving home, a thought<br /> occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it<br /> aloud: ""Do you realize that, as of tonight, we've been seeing<br /> each other for exactly six months?""</p>
<p>And then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a<br /> very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it<br /> bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined<br /> by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into<br /> some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of.</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months.</p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this<br /> kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little<br /> more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really<br /> want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward . .<br /> . I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing<br /> each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward<br /> marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I<br /> ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this<br /> person?</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: . . . so that means it was . . . let's<br /> see ...February when we started going out, which was right after<br /> I had the car at the dealer's, which means . . . lemme check the<br /> odometer . . . Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.</p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: He's upset. I can see it on his face.<br /> Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more<br /> from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he<br /> has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some<br /> reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant<br /> to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being<br /> rejected.</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: And I'm gonna have them look at the<br /> transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's<br /> still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on<br /> the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees<br /> out, and this thing is shifting like a goddamn garbage truck,<br /> and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.</p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd<br /> be angry, too. God, I feel so guilty, putting him through this,<br /> but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure.</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: They'll probably say it's only a 90- day<br /> warranty. That's exactly what they're gonna say, the scumballs.</p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting<br /> for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm<br /> sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy<br /> being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems<br /> to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my<br /> self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give<br /> them a goddamn warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it<br /> right up their....</p>
<p>""Roger,"" Elaine says aloud.</p>
<p>""What?"" says Roger, startled.</p>
<p>""Please don't torture yourself like this,"" she says, her eyes<br /> beginning to brim with tears. ""Maybe I should never have . .Oh<br /> God, I feel so.....""</p>
<p>(She breaks down, sobbing.)</p>
<p>""What?"" says Roger.</p>
<p>""I'm such a fool,"" Elaine sobs. ""I mean, I know there's no<br /> knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and<br /> there's no horse.""</p>
<p>""There's no horse?"" says Roger.</p>
<p>""You think I'm a fool, don't you?"" Elaine says.</p>
<p>""No!"" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer.</p>
<p>""It's just that . . . It's that I . . . I need some time,""<br /> Elaine says.</p>
<p>(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he<br /> can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up<br /> with one that he thinks might work.)</p>
<p>""Yes,"" he says.</p>
<p>(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.)</p>
<p>""Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?"" she says.</p>
<p>""What way?"" says Roger.</p>
<p>""That way about time,"" says Elaine.</p>
<p>""Oh,"" says Roger. ""Yes.""</p>
<p>(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes,<br /> causing him to become very nervous about what she might say<br /> next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)</p>
<p>""Thank you, Roger,"" she says.</p>
<p>""Thank you,"" says Roger.</p>
<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted,<br /> tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets<br /> back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV,<br /> and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis<br /> match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny<br /> voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something<br /> major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure<br /> there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he<br /> figures. it's better if he doesn't think about it. (This is also<br /> Roger's policy regarding world hunger.)</p>
<p>The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two<br /> of them, and they will talk about this situation for six<br /> straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze<br /> everything she said and everything he said, going over it time<br /> and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture<br /> for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification.<br /> They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for<br /> weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions,<br /> but never getting bored with it, either.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a<br /> mutual friend of his and Elaine's, will pause just before<br /> serving, frown, and say: ""Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?'</p>

17891,"<p>The wealthy couple were celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary.  Their three grown sons joined them for dinner. The old man was rather irritated when he discovered that none of the boys had bothered to bring a gift, and after the meal, he drew them aside. 'You're all grown men,' he said, 'and old enough to hear this.  Your mother and I have never been legally married.' 'What?' gasped one of the sons. 'Do you mean to say we're all bastards?' 'Yes,' snapped the old man, closing the trap, 'and cheap ones, too!'</p>

17900,"<p>A man asked the waiter for a look at the dessert menu, which the waiter produced from a special pouch in his uniform. The man ordered a desert, and the waiter relayed the information to the kitchen via a special communications device built into his wrist watch. When desert arrived, the man was without a spoon. The waiter produced one from his breast pocket. The man was amazed. He asked the waiter how it is that the waiter is so well prepared to handle every problem without ever having to return to the kitchen. The waiter answered that the owner is an efficiency expert who wanted everything to run without a wasted moment. The man asked the purpose of the string tied to every waiters' trousers. The waiter replied that, when he uses the urinal, he avoids dirtying his hands (and therefore doesn't need to waste time washing them). He simply pulls the string, and his penis pops out. The man asked the waiter how he gets his penis back in. The waiter replied, ""That's easy.... I use the spoon.""</p>

17904,"<p>Women are under the illusion they don't have to ask men for anything - that if the man really loved her, he would automatically and instinctively know what she needed. Right! As if the dysfunctional drone even knew you were in the room, let alone knew what you were feeling. A woman has a better chance of finding a bathing suit off the rack that fits than finding a man who knows what she is going through. Ironically, however, men like to feel needed - like they're her knight in shining armor. Unfortunately, most turn out to be needy, like her nightmare from The Shining. Therefore, it is important that a woman ask a man directly for what she wants, not indirectly. He is not a mind reader. He doesn't even read a map, how's he going to read a mind?How To Ask A Man To Do Something*--------------------------------------*Always remember these five important rules when asking a man to do something:1. Make sure the man is conscious.2. Crash the hard drive on his computer and line the bird cage with the sports section.3. Be brief! Limit your nagging harangue to two, three hours, max.4. Reward him for cooperative behavior. Offer to cook him something that doesn't have a peel-back cover.5. Punish him when he refuses to cooperate. Microwave his remote on high power for 55 minutes. Rotate 1/4 turn, and microwave again for another 35 minutes.6. Use ""would you"" or ""will you"" instead of ""you'd better"" or ""do as I say and no one will get hurt"". OK, Here are the six rules.************************The Right And Wrong Way to Ask A Man*--------------------------------------*How you ask a man to do something makes all the difference. Women think that a subtle nuance or slight turn of phrase will have no effect whatsoever on the resolve of their mucho-macho muscular moron. It does! Which is why you should always use ""would you"" and ""will you"" instead of ""could you"" and ""can you"". For example:Do say: would you please take out the garbage?Do not say: could you get off your big butt and do something around here? What am I, the maid?Do say: would you like to go out to a nice dinner Saturday night?Do not say: could you please take me to any restaurant that doesn't have the words ""burger"", ""king"", or ""happy meal"" in their advertising??Do say: would you mind watching the kids while I take a night off with my girlfriends?Do not say: could you, just for one night, watch the kids you helped spawn-that I never get a break from-ever! I haven't seen my friends in so long we wear name tags to identify ourselves.Do say: would you take me to a movie this week?Do not say: could you prove to me you're not Velcroed to the couch and actually have the motor skills to take me to a motion picture? Something without Pamela Anderson in it.Do say: would you like me to listen to you talk about your day some more?Do not say: could you step up the filibuster, Sparky? Jeopardy is on in ten minutes.Do say: would you consider getting a vasectomy?Do not say: could you even imagine what it feels like taking birth control pills that make you feel like Attila the Hun one minute and Attila the Hun's evil twin the next minute? Do it or I'll do it FOR you!!Do say: would you like to take a vacation?Do not say: could you move out?Do say: would you get out of my life?Do not say: could you get out of my life?Notice how different these two statements are. A man is much more likely to get out of your life if you say ""would"".</p>

17905,"<p>It was the first day of 3rd grade, and a new school for Johnny. As a test, the teacher went around the room and asked each of the students to count to 50.<br /> Some did very well, counting as high as 30 and 40 with just a few mistakes. </p>
<p>Others couldn't get past 20. </p>
<p>Johnny, however, did extremely well. He counted past 50, right up to 83. He was so excited that he ran home and told his Dad how well he had done. His Dad nodded and told him, ""That's because you are from Arkansas, son."" </p>
<p>The next day, in language class, the teacher asked the students to recite the alphabet. Most made it about half way through without much trouble. Some made it to M and N, but Johnny rattled off the alphabet right to W. </p>
<p>That evening, Johnny once again bragged to his Dad about his prowess in his new school. His Dad, knowingly, explained to him, ""Son, that's because you are from Arkansas."" </p>
<p>The next day, after Physical Education, the boys were taking showers. Johnny noted that, compared to the other boys in his grade, he seemed overly well endowed. This confused him. That night he told his dad, ""Dad, they all have little tiny ones, but mine is ten times bigger than theirs. Is that because I'm from Arkansas?"" he asked. </p>
<p>""No, son,"" explained his Dad, ""That's because you're 18.""</p>

""Well we have plenty of<br /> dogs and men allways like dogs"" he said. ""No, that wont do<br /> because he is allergic to them"". ""I know, I have just the thing""<br /> as he says this he runs into the back of the store. A few<br /> minutes later comes back with a cage and inside it is a huge<br /> toad. ""This is one of my most valued possesions and I'm willing<br /> to give it to you for only fifty dollars"" the clerk says. ""I'm<br /> not going to pay fifty dollars for a toad"" she yells. ""Well this<br /> isn't any ordinarry toad it gives the best blow jobs in the<br /> world"". ""Well his anniversery is tomorrow and I do really need a<br /> gift so I guess I'll take it"" and then she bought the toad and<br /> went straight home. The next day the husband recieves his gift<br /> and says ""a toad is that all I get?"". ""Its not any toad it<br /> supposedlly gives the best blow jobs ever and cant you just at<br /> least try it once?"". He agrees a gives it a try and the clerk<br /> was right. The toad gave him the best blow job he has ever had.<br /> The next night the wife is about to fall asleep when she hears a<br /> lot of noise coming down stairs like pots and pans being banged<br /> togeather. So she goes down stairs to see what the noise is. The<br /> wife sees the husband doing something with the toad and she asks<br /> ""what are you doing""? The husband replies ""If I can teach this<br /> toad to cook then your out of here bitch"".</p>

17965,"<p>Jesus has just been nailed to the cross and has begun to suffer<br /> from the wounds, A crowd has gathered to watch and<br /> sympathize with Him. As Jesus looks out over the gathering he<br /> calls to one of his apostle's. ""Paul... Paul,"" He calls out.</p>
<p>Paul hears his name and comes to the front of the<br /> gathering. ""Yes Jesus,how may I serve you"" he exclaims. Just<br /> then a guard comes up to Paul, cuts Paul's right arm off with<br /> his sword, and throws him back into the crowd, saying ""No<br /> one is allowed to speak with the prisoner!"" </p>
<p>Jesus once again calls his name. ""Paul . . .Paul"", he calls.<br /> Paul, determined goes to the front of the gathering again. There<br /> he meets the same gaurd who this time cuts off the left arm, and<br /> both legs and throws him back into the crowd.</p>

17967,"<p>Microsoft Corporation has taken another step toward dominating every aspect of American life with the introduction of Contraceptive 98, a suite of applications designed for users who engage in sex. </p>
<p>Microsoft has been a pioneer in peer-to-peer connectivity and plug and play. It believes these technologies will give it substantial leverage in penetrating the copulation enhancement market. </p>
<p>The product addresses two important user concerns: the need for virus protection and the need for a firewall to ensure the non-propagation of human beings. </p>
<p>The Contraceptive98 suite consists of three products: Condom 98, DeFetus 1.0 (from Sementec), and AIDScan 2.1 (from Norton Utilities). </p>
<p>A free copy of Intercourse Explorer 4.0 is bundled in the package. The suite also comes in two expanded versions. Contraceptive 98 Professional is the Client/Server edition, for professionals in the sexual services sector. Contraceptive98 Small Business Edition is a package for start-ups, aimed at the housewife and gigolo niches. </p>
<p>While Contraceptive 98 does not address non-traditional copulatory channels, future plug-ins are planned for next year. They will be known as BackDoor, AuraLee, TitElation, and JerkOff. </p>
<p>OPERATION<br /> Only one node in a peer-to-peer connection needs to install the package. At installation, the Condom98 software checks for minimum hardware. If the user meets the requirements, the product installs and is sufficiently scaleable to meet most requirements. After installation, operation commences. One caution is that the user must have sufficient RAM to complete the session. When the session is complete, a disconnect is initiated, and the user gets the message, ""It is now safe to turn off your partner."" </p>
<p>DRAWBACKS<br /> Usability testers report that frequent failures were a major concern during beta testing. General Protection Fault was the most serious error encountered. Early versions had numerous bugs, but most of these have been eliminated. The product needs to be installed each time its used. </p>
<p>CONCLUSION<br /> Contraceptive 98 is a robust product. Despite its drawbacks, it is a reasonably good value for its $49.95 price tag, and is far superior to its shareware version. Hopefully, future releases (of the software, that is) will add missing functionality, such as Backout and Restore, Uninterruptible Power Supply, and Onboard Camera. </p>
<p>Microsoft CEO Bill Gates is optimistic about Contraceptive 98s potential. He recently said, ""Our contraceptive products will help users do to each other what we've been doing to our customers for years.""</p>

<p>Y autom�ticamente se le reduce el pito 10 cm. El tipo reflexiona y decide que 40 cm todav�a es demasiado y por ende le vuelve a preguntar al sapito:</p>
<p>""�Sapito, sapito, me chupas el pito?""</p>
<p>Y ante el segundo NO del sapito se le reduce el pito a 30 cm.</p>
<p>""Bueno,"" piensa este hombre, ""30 cm no est� nada mal pero todav�a puede que sea demasiado.""</p>
<p>Entonces decide acercarse al sapito por �ltima vez y preguntarle:</p>

17976,"<p>Translated from latin scroll dated 2BCDear Cassius:Are you still working on the Y zero K problem?  This change from BC to AD is giving us a lot of headaches and we haven't much time left.  I don't know how people will cope with working the wrong way around.  Having been working happily downwards forever, now we have to start thinking upwards.  You would think that someone would have thought of it earlier and not left it to us to sort it all out at this last minute.I spoke to Caesar the other evening.  He was livid that Julius hadn't done something about it when he was sorting out the calendar.  He said he could see why Brutus turned nasty.  We called in Consultus, but he simply said that continuing downwards using minus BC won't work and as usual charged a fortune for doing nothing useful.Surely we will not have to throw out all our hardware and start again? Macrohard will make yet another fortune out of this I suppose.The money lenders are paranoid of course!  They have been told that all usury rates will invert and they will have to pay their clients to take out loans.  Its an ill wind ......As for myself, I just can't see the sand in an hourglass flowing upwards.We have heard that there are three wise men in the East who have been working on the problem, but unfortunately they won't arrive until it's all over.I have heard that there are plans to stable all horses at midnight at the turn of the year as there are fears that they will stop and try to run backwards, causing immense damage to chariots and possible loss of life.Some say the world will cease to exist at the moment of transition. Anyway, we are still continuing to work on this blasted Y zero K problem.I will send a parchment to you if anything further develops. If you have any ideas please let me know,Plutonius</p>

17977,"<p>Osama bin Laden has a heart attack and dies. </p>
<p>He immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him. </p>
<p>""I don't know what to do here,"" the devil says. ""You're on my list, but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do...</p>
<p>I've got a couple of people here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""</p>
<p>Osama thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil led him into the first room.</p>
<p>In it was Manuel Noriega and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty-handed. Over and over and over. Such was his fate in hell.</p>
<p>""No,"" bin Laden said, ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long.""</p>
<p>So the devil led him to the next room. In it was the Ayatollah Khomeini with a sledgehammer and a huge pile of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.</p>
<p>""No, I've got this problem with my shoulder. I'd be in constant agony if all I did was break rocks all day,"" bin Laden commented.</p>
<p>So the devil opened a third door. In it, bin Laden saw Bill Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in a spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was his girl Monica, doing what she does best. Osama bin Laden stared in disbelief and finally said, ""Yeah, I can handle this.""</p>
<p>The devil smiled and said, ""OK, Monica, you're free to go.""</p>

17984,"<p>In the 16th and 17th centuries, before synthetic fertilizer, large shipments of manure were commonly shipped by sea. It was dried and then shipped in order to reduce cargo weight, but once seawater soaked in, it not only became heavier, it began to decompose, producing methane gas. </p>
<p>Because it was stored below decks in bundles you can see what could (and did) happen. Methane began to build up below decks and the first time someone unsuspectingly came below with a lantern was the last time in many cases.</p>
<p>Several ships were destroyed in this manner before they realized what was happening. After that, the bundles of manure were always stamped with  the term ""Ship High In Transit"" on them.  Meaning that the sailors were to stow it high enough off the lower decks, so that any water that flowed into the  hold would not drench the manure.</p>
<p>Thus, evolved the term ""S.H.I.T "" (Ship High In Transport), which we all know very well, explains why many things happen today.  Many mistakingly thought it originated on a golf course in Scotland. </p>
<p>~~<br /> Editor's Note: According to Urban Legends at about.com, shit is derived from the Indo-European root skei-, meaning ""to cut"" or ""to split.""  For most of its history ""shit"" was spelled ""shite"" (and sometimes still is, euphemistically).</p>
<p>Doesn't mean the ships weren't blown to shit, though...</p>

17985,"<p>A blonde decides to learn and try horse back riding unassisted without prior experience or lessons. She mounts the horse with great effort, and the tall, shiny horse springs into motion.It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the saddle. Out of shear terror, she grabs for the horse's mane but cannot seem to get a firm grip. She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway. The horse gallops along, seemingly oblivious to its slipping rider.Finally, giving up her frail grip, she leaps away from the horse to try and throw herself to safety.Unfortunately, her foot has become entangled in the stirrup. She is now at the mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground again and again. As her head is battered against the ground, she is mere moments away from unconsciousness or even death when Frank, the Wal-Mart manager runs out to shut the horse off.</p>
