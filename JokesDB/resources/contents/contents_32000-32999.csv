32001,"<p>A man and his girlfriend are having a sexual encounter. </p>
<p>He asks her to ""go downtown"" so, with a sigh, she gets on her knees in front of him and starts peering at his genitals, looking and tipping her head this way and that, studying the whole business. </p>
<p>After about five minutes of this, he asked her in a sort of peeved voice, ""Well, just what are you doing?"" </p>
<p>She said, ""I'm doing what I always do when I'm downtown with no money!""</p>

The mathematicians were glad their stupid colleagues were going to pay a fine. However, when the conductor was approaching their compartment, all three economists went to the nearest toilet. The conductor, noticing that somebody was in the toilet, knocked on the door. In reply he saw a hand with one ticket. He checked it and the economists saved 2/3 of the ticket price. </p>
<p>The next day, the mathematicians decided to use the same strategy- they bought only one ticket, but economists did not buy tickets at all! When the mathematicians saw the conductor, they hid in the toilet, and when they heard knocking they handed in the ticket. They did not get it back. </p>

32039,"<p>This is supposedly a true story from a recent Defence Science Lectures<br /> Series, as related by the head of the Australian DSTO's Land<br /> Operations/Simulation division.</p>
<p>They've been working on some really nifty virtual reality simulators, the<br /> case in point being to incorporate Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters into<br /> exercises (from the data fusion point of view). Most of the people they<br /> employ on this sort of thing are ex- (or future) computer game programmers.<br /> Anyway, as part of the reality parameters, they include things like trees<br /> and animals. For the Australian simulation they included kangaroos.  In<br /> particular, they had to model kangaroo movements and reactions to<br /> helicopters (since hordes of disturbed kangaroos might well give away a<br /> helicopter's position).</p>
<p>Being good programmers, they just stole some code (which was originally used<br /> to model infantry detachments reactions under the same stimuli), and changed<br /> the mapped icon, the speed parameters, etc. The first time they've gone to<br /> demonstrate this to some visiting Americans, the hotshot pilots have decided<br /> to get ""down and dirty"" with the virtual kangaroos. So, they buzz them, and<br /> watch them scatter. The visiting Americans nod appreciatively... then gape<br /> as the kangaroos duck around a hill, and launch about two dozen Stinger<br /> missiles at the hapless helicopter.  Programmers look rather embarrassed at<br /> forgetting to remove that part of the infantry coding... and Americans<br /> leave muttering comments about not wanting to mess with the Aussie<br /> wildlife...</p>
<p>As an addendum, simulator pilots from that point onwards avoided kangaroos<br /> like the plague, just like they were meant to do in the first place...</p>

32046,"<p>One night in the bar, the owner is lamenting the fact that business is so<br /> quiet on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.</p>
<p>As he moans to some of the regulars a stranger, dressed in a tweed jacket and<br /> wearing glasses wanders over and says, ""I'm sorry, but I couldn't help<br /> overhearing your conversation. I'm a doctor at the lunatic asylum up the road<br /> and I'm trying to integrate some of the more sane individuals into the<br /> community. Why don't I bring some of my patients along, say next<br /> Tuesday. You'll have some customers and my patients will have a night out.""</p>
<p>Well, the publican isn't sure but the thought of more paying customers on a<br /> quiet night appeals, so he agrees.</p>
<p>So, the following Tuesday the guy in the tweed jacket and glasses shows up<br /> with about ten lunatics.</p>
<p>He says to the publican, ""They might try to pay for their drinks in unusual<br /> ways, please just accept whatever they give you, put it all on a tab and I'll<br /> settle up at closing time.""</p>
<p>The barman has a great time selling loads of drinks and encouraging the<br /> loonies to eat chips and peanuts. The loonies have a great time, getting drunk<br /> and paying for their drinks with empty Coke cans, banana peels, used tea bags<br /> and plastic shopping bags.</p>
<p>At closing time the barman adds up the bill and it comes to just over two<br /> hundred dollars! The guy with the glasses and the tweed jacket starts to<br /> organize the loonies ready to take them back to the asylum. Finally he comes<br /> over and asks for the bill. The publican, feeling that he's charged them rather<br /> a lot and feeling he should do his bit to help these poor<br /> unfortunate people give him a discount.</p>
<p>""Let's call It $150,"" he says.</p>
<p>The guy in the tweed jacket smiles and says, ""That's fine. Have you got change<br /> for a garbage can?""</p>

Tell the guy I sent you and get<br /> him to turn the miles on your car back to 50,000 miles. That<br /> should make it easier to sell.""</p>
<p>Well, a week after that, the brunnete saw the blonde driving in<br /> the same car. ""Didn't you sell the car?"" she asked the blonde.<br /> She replied, ""Why should I? The car only has 50,000 miles on it.""</p>

<p>Still not satisfied, the others keep saying, ""Ask him the last part, Dopey, ask him the last part!""<br /> The Pope asks Dopey, ""Is there still more to your question?""<br /> To which Dopey replies, ""Well, uh, yeah.....are there, uh, are there any midget black nuns in Alaska?""<br /> The startled Pope replies, ""Well, no, my son, I really don't think there are any midget black nuns in Alaska.""</p>

<p>As� el tercero, el cuarto y todos los siguientes, hasta que el cura se cans�. Entonces llam� al monaguillo y le dijo que le sustituyera en el confesionario.</p>
<p>""Todos te diran que se masturbaron 3 veces. Los mandas a la esquina a que recen 10 padrenuestros y ya est�."", le dice el cura.</p>

32079,"<p>A young blonde female stock broker was bored with driving her<br /> BMW. It lacked individuality and besides that, every other girl<br /> in the office had one. She fancied something a bit more<br /> individual, perhaps an MG convertible.</p>
<p>That week she visited her local car dealer and spied a beautiful<br /> Jaguar XK140 convertible. It was wonderfully restored and she<br /> fell in love with it's gorgeous red paintwork. An empty check<br /> stub later and off she was tearing down the leafy country lanes<br /> enjoying her beautiful new car. Her long blonde hair was flowing<br /> in the wind, music blaring from the radio, what could possibly<br /> go wrong?</p>
<p>At that thought there was a splutter from the engine and the car<br /> slowly coasted to a stop. She got out and lifted the hood and<br /> concluded after a few minutes that she didn't have a bloody clue<br /> what was wrong. Luckily she had her mobile phone with her and a<br /> quick phone call to the AutoClub and a short wait saw a bright<br /> shiny yellow van pull up behind her.</p>
<p>""That's a lovely car,"" said the mechanic. ""What seems to be the<br /> matter?""</p>
<p>""Well, it just conked out I'm afraid.""</p>
<p>""Let me have look."" He set to work and ten minutes later the<br /> engine was purring like a cat again.</p>
<p>""Thank goodness,"" she said. ""What was the matter?""</p>
<p>""Simple really, just crap in the carburetor,"" he replied.</p>
<p>Looking shocked she asked, ""Oh, okay. How many times a week do I<br /> have to do that?""</p>

(search for cust acct by last name, find a million Smiths.. finally find their acct.) We have your user name listed as ''wolf231''.<br /> Cust: Yep.<br /> Tech: Not John Smith.<br /> Cust: Yep.<br /> Tech: ... </p>
<p>---- </p>
<p>Tech: What error message are you getting?<br /> Cust: I'm not getting an error, it just won't connect.<br /> Tech: Nothing comes up when you try to connect?<br /> Cust: Nope, nothing happens at all. It doesn't say anything.<br /> Tech: .. and nothing appears on the screen what-so-ever..?<br /> Cust: Nope.<br /> Tech:  - Well.. What happens to lead you to believe that it isn't working?<br /> Cust: It says Error 691, User Name or Password..<br /> Tech: That's what we in the buisness call an ERROR MESSAGE. </p>
<p>---- </p>
<p>Tech: What error message are you getting?<br /> Cust: Uhhh... cannot connect to you guys because it's not working,  is having problems.<br /> Tech: Hmm.. well, I don't think that is one of the standard RAS errors listed in the MS database.. </p>
<p>---- </p>
<p>Cust: What in the hell is wrong with your server now!?!?!<br /> Tech: Nothing, what error are you getting?<br /> Cust: Error 666 Your modem or other connecting device is not functioning! (Or alternately) Error 680, There is no dial tone! </p>
<p>.. Now lets think about this one, I've gotten it many, MANY times. The error says there is no dial tone. Your modem cannot get a dial tone, so naturally, our server must be down. - Or the error says your modem is hosed.. once again, our server must be down. The point being, 90% of all callers assume it is automatically YOUR fault, no matter what the error says. </p>

<p>Customer cannot read, or pronounce anything correctly. (Examples: Dis-enable soft-war comprehension..?) </p>
<p>Customer only has one phone line, but still insist that you stay on the phone while they try to connect.. </p>

<p>Tech: Goto My Computer on your desktop.<br /> Cust: Yes, I have a computer on my desk.<br /> Tech: No. There is an ICON on your desktop called My Computer, double click on it and it will open.<br /> Cust: I don't see Your Computer.<br /> Tech: No, it is called My Computer, not literally mine, it's just the name of it.<br /> Cust: Ok.. just a sec..  - hm.. Now what is the desktop again?<br /> Tech:  .. It's where the background is.. you know. It has all the little small pictures of stuff that you click on on it. </p>

32105,"<p>THINGS I'VE LEARNED FROM MY CHILDREN By a Weary Father (thanks craigs)- There is no such thing as child-proofing your house.- If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with  roller blades, they can ignite.- A 4 year-old's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded  restaurant.- If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan the motor is not strong  enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing pound puppy underwear and a  superman cape.- It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of a  20 by 20 foot room.- Baseballs make marks on ceilings.- You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on.- When using the ceiling fan as a bat you have to throw the ball up a  few times before you get a hit.- A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.- The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit  by a ceiling fan.- When you hear the toilet flush and the words Uh-oh, it's already too late.- Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.- A six year old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36  year old man says they can only do it in the movies.- A magnifying glass can start a fire even on an overcast day.- If you use a waterbed as home plate while wearing baseball shoes it  does not leak -- it explodes.- A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 square foot  house 4 inches deep.- Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four year old.- Duplos will not.- Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence.- Super glue is forever.- McGyver can teach us many things we don't want to know.- Ditto Tarzan.- No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't  walk on water.- Pool filters do not like Jell-O.- VCR's do not eject PB&amp;J sandwiches even though TV commercials show  they do.- Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.- Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.- You probably do not want to know what that odor is.- Always look in the oven before you turn it on.- Plastic toys do not like ovens.- The fire department in San Diego has at least a 5 minute responsetime.- The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms dizzy.- It will however make cats dizzy.- Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy.- Quiet does not necessarily mean don't worry.- A good sense of humor will get you through most problems in life  (unfortunately, mostly in retrospect).</p>
"
32106,"<p>Sometimes we need to remember WHAT the Rules of life really are.</p>
<p>1. Never give yourself a haircut after three alcoholic beverages of any kind.</p>
<p>2. You need only two tools: WD-40 and duct tape. If it doesn't move and it should, use WD-40. If it moves and<br /> shouldn't, use the tape.</p>
<p>3. The five most essential words for a healthy, vital relationship are ""I apologize"" and ""You are right"".</p>
<p>4. Everyone seems normal until you get to know them.</p>
<p>5. When you make a mistake, make amends immediately.  It's easier to eat crow while it's still warm.</p>
<p>6. The only really good advice that your mother ever gave you was:  ""Go! You might meet somebody!""</p>
<p>7. If he/she says that you are too good for him/her - believe them.</p>
<p>8. Learn to pick your battles. Ask yourself, 'Will this matter one year from now? How about one month?<br /> One week? One day?'</p>
<p>9. Never pass up an opportunity to pee.</p>
<p>10. If you woke up breathing, congratulations! You have another chance!</p>
<p>11. Living well really is the best revenge. Being miserable because of a bad or former relationship just<br /> might mean that the other person was right about you.</p>
<p>12. Work is good, but it's not that important.</p>
<p>13. And finally, be really nice to your friends and family. You never know when you are going to need them to empty your bedpan.</p>

One said to the other, 'Man, have you got anything to drink?' 'Nah, but I hear you can drink jet fuel and that'll kinda give you a buzz.' So, Bill and Bob drank jet fuel, get smashed and had a great time. The following morning, Bill woke up and figured his head would probably start pounding as soon as he stood up. But it didn't. He felt good. In fact, he felt great - no hangover! Bill's phone rang, it was Bob. Bob asked, 'Hey, how do you feel?' 'I feel great!' replied Bill. 'I feel great too! You don't have a hangover?' 'No. That jet fuel is great stuff - no hangover. We ought to do this more often!' 'Yeah, we could, but there's just one thing...' 'What's that?' 'Did you fart yet?' 'What?' 'Did you fart yet?' 'No...' 'Well, don't, because I'm in Melbourne!'</p>

32127,"<p>If you have raised kids (or been one), and gone through the pet syndrome including toilet-flush burials for dead goldfish It's a long story but one that will have you laughing out LOUD!!</p>
<p>Overview: I had to take my son's hamster to the vet. Here's what happened:</p>
<p>Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was something wrong with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room. ""He's just lying there looking sick,"" he told me, ""I'm serious, Dad. Can you help?""</p>
<p>I put my best hamster-healer look on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do. (Call my wife.)</p>
<p>""Honey,"" I called, ""come look at the hamster!"" ""Oh, my gosh,"" my wife diagnosed after a minute. ""She's having babies."" ""What?"" My son demanded.</p>
<p>""But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!""</p>
<p>I was equally outraged. ""Hey, how can that be?! I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce!"" I accused my wife. ""Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?!"" She inquired. (I actually think she had the gall to say this sarcastically.)</p>
<p>""No, but you were supposed to get two boys!"" I reminded her (in my most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth together). ""Yeah, Bert and Ernie!"" My son agreed. ""Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know,"" she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm, ya think?)</p>
<p>By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on.  I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. ""Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience,"" I announced. ""We're about to witness the miracle of birth.""</p>
<p>""OH, Gross!"" They shrieked.</p>
<p>""Well, isn't THAT just great! What are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?"" My wife wanted to know. (I really do think she was being snotty here, too. Don't you?)</p>
<p>We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. ""We don't appear to be making much progress,"" I noted.</p>
<p>""It's breech,"" my wife whispered, horrified. ""Do something, Dad!"" My son urged. ""Okay, okay."" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gingerly tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results.</p>
<p>""Should I call 911?"" My eldest daughter wanted to know,"" Maybe they could talk us through the trauma."" (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?)</p>
<p>""Let's get Ernie to the vet,"" I said grimly.</p>
<p>We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in hislap. ""Breathe, Ernie, breathe,"" he urged.</p>
<p>""I don't think hamsters do Lamaze,"" his mother noted to him. (Women can be so cruel to their own young. I mean what she does to ME is one thing, but this boy is of her womb.)</p>
<p>The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass. ""What do you think, Doc, a c-section?""  I suggested scientifically. My son appeared impressed by my observation.</p>
<p>""Oh, very interesting,"" he murmured.  ""Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?""  I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.</p>
<p>""Is Ernie going to be okay?""  My wife asked.  ""Oh, perfectly,"" the vet assured us.</p>
<p>""This hamster is not in labor.  In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen Ernie is a boy.""</p>
<p>""What?""</p>
<p>""You see, Ernie is a young male AND occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um .... er ... masturbate, just the way he did, lying on his back."" He blushed, glancing at my wife. ""Well, you know what I'm saying, Mr. Cameron.""</p>
<p>We were silent, absorbing this.</p>
<p>""So Ernie's just ... just ... excited?""! My wife offered.</p>
<p>""Exactly,"" the vet replied, relieved that we understood. More silence.  Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle.  And laugh.  And then even laugh loudly!</p>
<p>""What's so funny?"" I demanded, knowing, but not believing that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless manliness.  Tears were now running down her face.</p>
<p>""It's just ... that ... I'm picturing you pulling on its ... its teeny little ..."" she gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.</p>
<p>""That's enough,"" I warned.</p>
<p>We thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be okay.</p>
<p>""I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad,"" he told me.</p>
<p>""Oh, you have NO idea,"" my wife agreed, once again collapsing into laughter.</p>
<p>Enough said.</p>

<p>Once again, the farmers wife says nothing.  The farmer leaves the lunch table to do his afternoon chores.  At dinner he comes in and his wife is bent over at the kitchen sink doing dishes.  The farmer says to his wife, ""Honey I thought about it all afternoon.  Your butt is so big it is bigger than an 8 row corn picker.""</p>
<p>Again, the wife says nothing.  They have a nice dinner and she picks up the dishes and cleans the kitchen up.  The farmer is in the livingroom when his wife enters and walks by him saying, ""Honey, I am bushed.  I think I am going to hit the sack.""  The farmer gets up and starts to walk up the stairs behind his wife and get a little ""Frisky.""  </p>
<p>The farmers wife turns and looks at her husband and says, ""If you think I am going to warm up this $100,000 piece of machinery for a half an ear of corn you gotto be kidden!""</p>

<p>The rabbi comes, and he and the priest are in the confessional. In a few minutes, a woman comes in and says, 'Father, forgive me for I have sinned.'</p>

He got as far as Black Canyon City before<br /> the mountains justbecame too much and he could go no farther. He<br /> stuck his thumb out, but after 3 hours hadn't gotten a single<br /> person to stop. Finally, a guy in a Corvette pulled over and<br /> offered him a ride. Of course, the bike wouldn't fit in the car.<br /> The owner of the Corvette found a piece of rope lying by the<br /> highway and tied it to his bumper.</p>
<p>He tied the other end to the bike and told the man that if he<br /> was going too fast, to honk the horn on his bike and that he<br /> would slow down. Everything went fine for the first 30 miles.<br /> Suddenly, another Corvette blew past them. Not to be outdone,<br /> the Corvette pulling the biketook off after the other. A short<br /> distance down the road, the Corvettes, both going well over 120<br /> mph, blew through a speed trap. The police officer noted the<br /> speeds from his radar gun and radioed to the other officer that<br /> he had two Corvettes headed his way at over 120 mph. He then<br /> relayed, ""...and you're not going to believe this, there is a<br /> guy on a bike honking his horn trying to pass....</p>

<p>At a morning press conference, Attorney General John Ashcroft said he believes the man is a member of the notorious Al-Gebra movement. </p>
<p>He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.</p>
<p>""Al-Gebra is a fearsome cult,"" Ashcroft said. ""They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. </p>
<p>They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as 'unknowns', but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with co-ordinates in every country. </p>
<p>As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'there are 3 sides to every triangle'.""</p>

32181,"<p>Recently, a magazine ran a contest. They were looking for people to submit quotes from their real-life managers. Here are some of the submissions:</p>
<p>1. As of tomorrow, employees will only be able to access the building using individual security cards. Pictures will be taken next Wednesday and employees will receive their cards in two weeks. (This was the winning quote from Fred Dales at Microsoft Corp in Redmond, WA.)</p>
<p>2. What I need is a list of specific unknown problems we will encounter. (Lykes Lines Shipping)</p>
<p>3. E-mail is not to be used to pass on information or data. It should be used only for company business. (Accounting manager, Electric Boat Company)</p>
<p>4. This project is so important, we can't let things that are more important interfere with it. (Advertising/Marketing manager, United Parcel Service)</p>
<p>5. Doing it right is no excuse for not meeting the schedule. No one will believe you solved this problem in one day! We've been working on it for months. Now, go act busy for a few weeks and I'll let you know when it's time to tell them. (R&amp;D supervisor, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing/3M Corp.)</p>
<p>6. My Boss spent the entire weekend retyping a 25-page proposal that only needed corrections. She claims the disk I gave her was damaged and she couldn't edit it. The disk I gave her was write-protected. (CIO of Dell Computers)</p>
<p>7. Quote from the Boss: ""Teamwork is a lot of people doing what I say."" (Marketing executive, Citrix Corporation)</p>
<p>8. ""How About Friday?"" My sister passed away and her funeral was scheduled for Monday. When I told my Boss, he said she died so that I would have to miss work on the busiest day of the year. He then asked if we could change her burial to Friday. He said, ""That would be better for me."" (Shipping executive, FTD Florists)</p>
<p>9. ""We know that communication is a problem, but the company is not going to discuss it with the employees."" (Switching supervisor, AT&amp;T Long Lines Division)</p>
<p>10. We recently received a memo from senior management saying: ""This is to inform you that a memo will be issued today regarding the subject mentioned above."" (Microsoft, Legal Affairs Division)</p>
<p>11. One day my Boss asked me to submit a status report to him concerning a project I was working on. I asked him if tomorrow would be soon enough. He said ""If I wanted it tomorrow, I would have waited until tomorrow to ask for it!"" (New business manager, Hallmark Greeting Cards.)</p>
<p>12. Speaking the Same Language: As director of communications, I was asked to prepare a memo reviewing our company's training programs and materials.</p>
<p>In the body of the memo one of the sentences mentioned the ""pedagogical approach"" used by one of the training manuals. The day after I routed the memo to the executive committee, I was called into the HR director's office, and told that the executive vice president wanted me out of the building by lunch. When I asked why, I was told that she wouldn't stand for ""perverts"" (pedophilia?) working in her company. Finally he showed me her copy of the memo, with her demand that I be fired - and the word ""pedagogical"" circled in red. The HR manager was fairly reasonable, and once he looked the word up in his dictionary, and made a copy of the definition to send back to her, he told me not to worry. He would take care of it. Two days later a memo to the entire staff came out directing us that no words which could not be found in the local Sunday newspaper could be used in company memos. A month later, I resigned. In accordance with company policy, I created my resignation memo by pasting words together from the Sunday paper. (Taco Bell Corporation)</p>
<p>13. This gem is the closing paragraph of a nationally-circulated memo from a large communications company: ""(Company name) is endeavorily determined to promote constant attention on current procedures of transacting business focusing emphasis on innovative ways to better, if not supersede, the expectations of quality!""

When I opened it to see what was inside, a beautiful genie appeared and told me that I would be granted three wishes. My first wish was for a luxurious boat to take me home."" The man continues, ""A large yacht appeared just off shore. Then for my second wish, I asked to be wealthy, so I would want for nothing when I got home."" The man goes on, ""After a large pile of gold coins appeared on the deck of the yacht, I asked to make passionate love to the genie for my third wish. The genie told me that she could not do that, so I asked, 'How about a little head?'""</p>

32209,"<p>For all of you with teenagers or who have had teenagers, or are a teenager, you may want to know why they really have a lot in common with cats:1.  Neither teenagers nor cats turn their heads when you call them by name.2.  No matter what you do for them, it is not enough. Indeed, all humane efforts are barely adequate to compensate for the privilege of waiting on them hand and foot.3.  You rarely see a cat walking outside of the house with an adult human being, and it can be safely said that no teenager in his or her right mind wants to be seen in public with his or her parents.4.  Even if you tell jokes as well as Jay Leno, neither your cat nor your teen will ever crack a smile.5.  No cat or teenager shares you taste in music.6.  Cats and teenagers can lie on the living-room sofa for hours on end without moving, barely breathing.7.  Cats have nine lives. Teenagers carry on as if they did.8.  Cats and teenagers yawn in exactly the same manner, communicating that ultimate human ecstasy -- a sense of complete and utter boredom.9.  Cats and teenagers do not improve anyone's furniture.10. Cats that are free to roam outside sometimes have been known to return in the middle of the night to deposit a dead animal in your bedroom. Teenagers are not above that sort of behavior.Thus, if you must raise teenagers, the best sources of advice are not other parents, but veterinarians. It is also a good idea to keep a guidebook on cats at hand at all times. And remember, above all else, put out the food and do not make any sudden moves in their direction.  When they make up their minds, they will finally come to you for some affection and comfort, and it will be a triumphant moment for all concerned.&gt;&gt;</p>

32253,"<p>A newlywed farmer and his wife were visited by her mother, who immediately demanded an inspection of the place. The farmer had genuinely tried to be friendly to his new mother-in-law, hoping that it could be a friendly, non-antagonistic relationship. All to no avail though, as she kept nagging them at every opportunity, demanding changes, offering unwanted advice, and generally making life unbearable to the farmer and his new bride.While they were walking through the barn, during the forced inspection, the farmer's mule suddenly reared up and kicked the mother-in-law in the head, killing her instantly. It was a shock to all no matter their feelings toward her demanding ways...At the funeral service a few days later, the farmer stood near the casket and greeted folks as they walked by. The pastor noticed that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he would nod his head yes and say something. Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, however, he would shake his head no, and mumble a reply.Very curious as to this bizarre behavior, the pastor later asked the farmer what that was all about. The farmer replied, ""The women would say, 'What a terrible tragedy' and I would nod my head and say 'Yes, it was.' The men would then ask, 'Can I borrow that mule?' and I would shake my head and say, 'Can't, it's all booked up for a year.'""</p>

"
32266,"<p>1. Atlanta is comprised entirely of one way streets. The only way to get out of downtown Atlanta is to turn around and start over when you reach Greenville, South Carolina. </p>
<p>2. All directions start with, ""Go down Peachtree..."" </p>
<p>3. Peachtree Street has no beginning and no end. </p>
<p>4. Atlanta is home of Coca Cola. That's all we drink here, so don't ask for any other soft drink. </p>
<p>5. Atlantans only know their way home and their way to work. </p>
<p>6. Gate One at the Airport is 32 miles away from the Main Concourse. </p>
<p>7. It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street you started on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a ""scenic drive"". </p>
<p>8. The 8 a.m. rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30 a.m. The 5:00 p.m. rush hour is from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. Friday's rush hour starts Thursday morning. </p>
<p>9. Reversible Lanes are not understood by anybody. </p>
<p>10. ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am"" are used by the person speaking to you if there's a remote possibility that you're at least 30 minutes older than they are. </p>
<p>11. ""Sugar"" is a more common form of address than ""Miss"". So is ""Honey"". </p>
<p>12. Ponce de Leon Avenue can only be pronounced by a native, so do not attempt the Spanish pronunciation. People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you. </p>
<p>13. The falling of one rain drop causes all traffic to immediately cease; so will daylight savings time and a girl applying eye shadow across the street, or a flat tire three lanes over. </p>
<p>14. If you're standing on a corner and a MARTA Bus stops, you're expected to get on and go somewhere. </p>
<p>15. Atlanta is pronounced ""Lan-uh"". </p>
<p>16. Construction on Peachtree Street is a way of life, and a permanent form of entertainment. </p>
<p>17. Construction crews aren't doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour. (Ed. note: This appears to be a common theme in almost any major American city). </p>
<p>18. Atlanta's traffic is the friendliest around. The commuters spend hours mingling with each other twice a day. In fact, Atlanta's traffic is rated number 1 in the country. You will often see people parked beside the road and engaged in lively discussions. </p>
<p>19. Atlantans are very proud of their race track, known as Road Atlanta. It winds throughout the city on the Interstates, hence its name. </p>
<p>20. Georgia 400 is the southern equivalent of the AutoBahn. You will rarely see a semi-truck on GA400, because the truck drivers are intimidated by the oversized-SUV-wielding housewives racing home after a grueling day at the salon or the tennis match to meet their children at the school bus.</p>

32269,"<p>One day this fellow noticed that a new couple had moved into the house next door.

He made it a point to water and trim his lawn as much as possible, hoping for yet another look. </p>
<p>Finally, he could stand it no more. Walking to the front door of the new neighbour's house, he knocked and waited. The husband, a large, burly man, opened the door. ""Excuse me,"" the man stammered, ""But I couldn't help noticing how beautiful your wife is."" </p>
<p>""Yeah? So?"" his hulking neighbour replied. </p>
<p>""Well, in particular, I am really struck by how beautiful her breasts are. I would gladly pay you ten thousand dollars if I could kiss those breasts."" </p>
<p>The burly gorilla is about to deck our poor guy when his wife appears and stops him. She pulls him inside and they discuss the offer for a few moments. Finally, they return and ask our friend to step inside. </p>
<p>""OK,"" the husband says gruffly, ""For ten thousand dollars you can kiss my wife's breasts."" </p>
<p>At this the wife unbuttons her blouse, and the twin objects of desire hang free at last. Our man takes one in each hand, and proceeds to rub his face against them in total ecstasy. This goes on for several minutes, until the husband gets annoyed. </p>
<p>""Well, come on already, kiss 'em!"" he growls. </p>
<p>""I can't,"" replies our awe-struck man, still nuzzling away. </p>

32279,"<p>""East Texas Driving Tips""</p>
<p>- Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun<br />   is loaded and the deer is in sight.<br /> - When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest<br />   tires always gets the right of way.<br /> - Never tow another car using pantyhose and duct tape.<br /> - When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is<br />   impolite to ask her to bring back beer.<br /> - Never relieve yourself from a moving vehicle, especially when<br />   driving.<br /> - Do not remove the seats from the car so that all your kids can<br />   fit in.<br /> - Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.</p>
<p>""East Texas Personal Hygiene""</p>
<p>- Unlike clothes and shoes, a toothbrush should never be a<br />   hand-me-down item.<br /> - If you have to vacuum the bed, it's time to change the sheets.<br /> - While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that<br />   should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.<br /> - Plucking unwanted nose hair is time-consuming work. A cigarette<br />   lighter and a small tolerance for pain can accomplish the same<br />   goal and save hours. Note: It's a good idea to keep a bucket of<br />   water handy when using this method.</p>
<p>""East Texas Dating (outside the family)""</p>
<p>- Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first<br />   date.<br /> - Be aggressive. Let her know you are interested: ""I've been<br />   wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the men's<br />   bathroom wall two years ago"".</p>
<p>""East Texas Theater Etiquette""</p>
<p>- Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up<br />   immediately after the movie had ended.<br /> - Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have<br />   proven they can't hear you.</p>
<p>""East Texas Wedding Etiquette""</p>
<p>- Livestock is usually a poor choice for a wedding gift.<br /> - It's not OK for the groom to bring a date to the wedding.<br /> - A bridal veil made of window screen is not only cost effective<br />   but also a proven fly deterrent.<br /> - For the groom, at least rent a tux. A leisure suit with a<br />   cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a natty<br />   appearance. Though uncomfortable, say yes to socks and shoes<br />   for this special occasion.</p>
<p>""East Texas Etiquette for All Occasions""</p>
<p>- Never take a beer to a job interview or ask if they press<br />   charges.<br /> - Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.<br /> - Always say ""Excuse me"" after getting sick in someone's else's<br />   car.<br /> - It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church,<br /> - Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, you<br />   should refrain from driving a U-Haul to the funeral home.<br /> - The socially refined never fish coins out of public toilets,<br />   especially if other people are around.<br /> - Always provide an alibi to the police for family members.</p>

32280,"<p>I had eighteen bottles of whiskey in the cellar and my wife insisted I empty the contents of each bottle down the sink, or else... After careful consideration, I reluctantly agreed and finally proceeded with the unpleasant task. </p>

<p>I then withdrew the cork from the third bottle and poured the whiskey down the sink which I drank. I pulled the cork from the fourth bottle down the sink and poured the bottle down the glass, which I drank. I pulled the bottle from the cork of the next and drank one sink out of it, and threw the rest down the glass. </p>

Sure enough there was his teacher and she motioned us<br /> to sit down. She was a very religous person, so when we were<br /> settled she said ""Let us pray.""

32303,"<p>After having their 10th child, an Arkansas couple decided that that was enough. So the husband went to his doctor and told him that he and his wife didn't want to have any more children.</p>
<p>The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. The doctor told the man that he was to go home, get a cherry bomb, put it in a can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.</p>
<p>The Arky said to the doctor ""I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a can next to my ear is going to help me.""</p>
<p>So the couple drove to Missouri to get a second opinion. The doctor was just about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed they were from Arkansas. This doctor also told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, place it in a tin can, hold it next to his ear and count to 10.</p>
<p>Figuring that both doctors couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count, ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5..."" at which point he paused, placed the can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand.</p>

32330,"<p>'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the trailer<br /> Not a creature was stirrin' 'Cept a redneck named Taylor.<br /> His first name was Bubba, Joe was his middle,<br /> And a-runnin' down his chin Was a trickle of spittle.<br /> His socks, they were hung by the chimney with care,<br /> And therefore there was a foul stench in the air.</p>
<p>That Bubba got scared And rousted the boys.<br /> There was Rufus, 12; Jim Bob was 11;<br /> Dud goin' on 10; Otis was 7.<br /> John, George and Chucky Were 5,4, and 3:<br /> The twins were both girls So they let them be.</p>
<p>They jumped in their overalls, No need for a shirt,<br /> Threw a hat on each head, Then turned with a jerk.<br /> They ran to the gun rack That hung on the wall.<br /> There were 17 shotguns; They grabbed them all.</p>
<p>Bubba said to the young'uns, ""Now hesh up ya'll!<br /> The last thing we wanna do Is wake up yer Maw.""<br /> Maw was expecting And needed her sleep,<br /> So out they crept out the door without making a peep.</p>
<p>They all looked around, and then they all spit.<br /> The young'uns asked Bubba, ""Paw, what is it?""<br /> Bubba just stared; He could not say a word.<br /> This was just like all of the stories he'd heard.</p>
<p>It was Santy Claus on the roof, Darn tootin'<br /> But the boys didn't know; They was about to start shootin'!<br /> They aimed their shotguns and nearly made a mistake<br /> That would have resulted in venison steak.<br /> Bubba hollered out, ""Don't shoot, boys!""<br /> That's Santy Claus And he's brought us some toys.</p>
<p>The dogs were a-barkin' And a-raisin' cain,<br /> And Bubba whistled, and shouted, And called them by name.<br /> ""Down, Spot! Shut up Bullet! Quiet, Pete and Roscoe!<br /> Git, Turnip and Tater and Sam and Bosco!""</p>
<p>""Git down from that porch! Git down off that wall!<br /> Quit shakin the trailer, Or you'll make Santy fall!""<br /> The dogs kept a-barkin' And wouldn't shut up,<br /> And they trampled poor Pete Who was only a pup.</p>
<p>Santy opened his bag, And threw out some toys.<br /> Bubba got most, But left a few for the boys.<br /> Since the guns had been dropped He just might not die.</p>
<p>He jumped in his sleigh, Told his reindeer to hurry.<br /> The trailer started to wobble Santa started to worry.<br /> Just as the reindeer Got into the air,<br /> The trailer collapsed, But Bubba didn't care.</p>
<p>He was busy lookin' At all his new toys.<br /> Then a thought hit him, And he said to the boys:<br /> ""Go check on yer Maw, Make sure she's all right.<br /> That roof fallin' on her Could-a hurt just a might.""</p>
<p>But Maw was OK, And the girls were too.<br /> They fixed up the trailer; It looked good as new.<br /> And as for Bubba, He liked Old St. Nick,<br /> But Santa thought Bubba Was a pure-in-tee hick!</p>
<p>Bubba had a nice Christmas,  And the boys did, too.<br /> And the Taylors wish A Merry Christmas to you!</p>

<p>The poor cashier said, ""I'm sorry. We asked for more from the<br /> headquarters, but they haven't come yet."" The lady shouted, ""I<br /> have stock in this company, and this is why it is FAILING! I<br /> demand to see your manager, because you are obviously an idiot!""<br /> The cashier, on the verge of tears, said, ""Please don't call me<br /> an idiot. I don't deserve to have you yelling at me.""</p>
<p>The manager came forward from the back of the store. ""What is<br /> the problem here?"" The lady screeched, ""This idiot has given me<br /> horrible service, and I am never coming here again."" She stormed<br /> out. The cashier followed her out, calling, ""I'm sorry, I'm<br /> sorry."" The lady yelled back, ""You're a f***ing bitch!"" The<br /> manager came out and said, ""You are no longer welcome on this<br /> property!""</p>
<p>Finally, the lady left the parking lot and stood staring<br /> loathingly at the store from the sidewilk. The cashier came<br /> back, apologized, and got me my fries.

Como no pod�a decidirse por uno u otro, le dije que se llevara los tres. Entonces me dijo que necesitaba unos zapatos que hicieran juego, a $2,000.00 el par, conque le conteste que me parec�a bien. Luego pasamos por la joyer�a, de donde sali� con unos pendientes de diamantes. �Estaba tan emocionada!</p>

<p>''Well, I'll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite mule Bessie<br /> into the--"" </p>
<p>''I didn't ask for any details,'' the lawyer interrupted. ''Just answer the<br /> question. Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, that you were fine?"" </p>
<p>''Well I had just got Bessie into the trailer and was driving down the<br /> road--'' </p>
<p>''Judge, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident,<br /> this man told the Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now<br /> several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is<br /> a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.'' By this time the Judge<br /> was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer and told the lawyer so. </p>
<p>''Well,"" said the farmer, ""as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my<br /> favorite mule, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this<br /> huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the<br /> side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was<br /> hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear ol' Bessie<br /> moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.<br /> Shortly after the accident a Highway Patrolman came on the scene. He could hear<br /> Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her he<br /> took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across<br /> the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me. He said, 'Your mule was in<br /> such bad shape I had to shoot her. How are you feeling?'""</p>

32378,"<p>I was playing golf with my doctor friend one day.<br /> He ALWAYS hit his drives right down the middle of the fairway.<br /> My problem was that I ALWAYS hooked my ball completely off the fairway.</p>
<p>I asked him for help, and he offered to give me a physical to see if he could determine the problem.</p>
<p>Sure enough, he said that I had three times the ""normal length"" of the average male, which caused an anomaly in my swing that caused me to hook.</p>
<p>I asked him to help me, and he agreed to do surgery -- provided that I didn't play golf for four weeks. I agreed. Golf is just that important to me.</p>
<p>Four weeks later, new body and all, I teed off on the first hole and drove the ball 270 yards right down the middle. Feeling elated, I thanked the doctor.</p>
<p>Then I asked him what had become of the ""rest"" of me.</p>
<p>He just smiled, teed his ball, then hit it...<br /> and watched it duck hook two fairways away...</p>

32380,"<p>A man and his three friends are driving around one day when they happen to crash into the side of a bridge and completely wreck their car. While his three friends remained intact, the man had lost an eye and had to be rushed to the hospital.  Once he arrived there, he discovered to his horror that they were out of glass replacement eyes, so they would have to give him a wooden eye.Because he was so ashamed of becoming a freak with a wooden eye, the man refused to leave the hospital until they discharged him a week later, and then for several weeks after he stayed in his house with no contact to the outside world.  His friends, feeling incredibly guilty for their lack of injury, decided to take him out to a club to try and cheer him up.Though he was reluctant, he accepted.  Once they were at the club, his three friends began dancing with girls, while he felt too shy about his eye to ask anyone.  As the night wore on, he became more self-assured, and started asking some girls to dance, but was refused by all of them, because he was such a monster.  After several of these refusals, the man felt so dejected he was about to leave, when the dancers parted and he could see across the hall a girl with vertical lips.  These are lips that run up and down instead of side to side.  Suddenly he regained his confidence, realizing that there was no way another freak would refuse him a dance.He strode across the dance floor up to the girl, and said ""Hey, would you like to dance?""""Would I?!"" she replied.

32382,"<p>I'm looking forward to the pleasure of your company since I haven't had it yet.When you pass away and people ask me what the cause of your death was, I'll say your stupidity.Well, I'll see you in my dreams---if I eat too much.I've had many cases of love that were just infatuation, but this hate I feel for you is the real thing.You're the best at all you do---and all you do is make people hate you.Don't you realize that there are enough people to hate in the world already without your working so hard to give us another?The thing that terrifies me the most is that someone might hate me as much as I loathe you.When you get run over by a car it shouldn't be listed under accidents.All of your ancestors must number in the millions; its hard to believe that many people are to blame for producing you.Ever since I saw you in your family tree I've wanted to cut it down.I hear that when you were a child your mother wanted to hire someone to take care of you but the Mafia wanted too much.I hear that when your mother first saw you she decided to leave you on the front steps of a police station while she turned herself in.You were born because your mother didn't believe in abortion; now she believes in infanticide.No one should be punished for accident of birth but you look too much like a wreck not to be.Yours was an unnatural birth; you came from a human being.You were the answer to a prayer. Your parents prayed that the world would be made to suffer and here you came along.You're a habit I'd like to kick, with both feet.I hear the only place you're ever invited is outside.I would like the pleasure of your company but it only gives me displeasure.You've never been outspoken; no one has ever been able to.At your speed you'd better not stop your mouth too fast or your teeth will fly through your cranium.If you ever tax your brain, don't charge more than a penny.Don't you have a terribly empty feeling---in your skull?You have nothing to fear from my baser instincts; its my finer ones that tell me to kill you.It's your life---but I wish you'd let us have it.I don't consider you a vulture. I consider you something a vulture would eat.I think you should live for the moment. But after that I doubt I'll think so.Man alive! But I wish you weren't.I believe in respect for the dead; in fact I could only respect you if you WERE dead.I admire you because I've never had the courage it takes to be a liar, a thief and a cheat.You're acquitting yourself in such a way that no jury ever would.</p>

32383,"<p>THINGS I'VE LEARNED FROM MY CHILDRENBy a Weary Father- There is no such thing as child-proofing your house.- If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades, they can ignite.- A 4 year-old's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded restaurant.- If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing pound puppy underwear and a superman cape.- It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of a  20 by 20 foot room.- Baseballs make marks on ceilings.- You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on.- When using the ceiling fan as a bat you have to throw the ball up a  few times before you get a hit.- A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.- The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit  by a ceiling fan.- When you hear the toilet flush and the words Uh-oh, it's already too late.- Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.- A six year old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36  year old man says they can only do it in the movies.- A magnifying glass can start a fire even on an overcast day.- If you use a waterbed as home plate while wearing baseball shoes it  does not leak -- it explodes.- A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 square foot  house 4 inches deep.- Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four year old.- Duplos will not.- Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence.- Super glue is forever.- McGyver can teach us many things we don't want to know.- Ditto Tarzan.- No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't  walk on water.- Pool filters do not like Jell-O.- VCR's do not eject PB&amp;J sandwiches even though TV commercials show  they do.- Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.- Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.- You probably do not want to know what that odor is.- Always look in the oven before you turn it on.- Plastic toys do not like ovens.- The fire department in San Diego has at least a 5 minute response time.- The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms dizzy.- It will however make cats dizzy.- Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy.- Quiet does not necessarily mean don't worry.- A good sense of humor will get you through most problems in life  (unfortunately, mostly in retrospect).</p>

32391,"<p>One morning the Pope awoke in his bed chamber in the Vatican. To his surprise, he noticed that he had woken up with a massive erection. Perplexed, he called on his personal physician.'Doctor, this should not be possible,' he said, 'I'm the Pope, and I'm celibate! I haven't had one of these for 30 years!'The doctor's reply was, 'Well, father, this is a natural phenomenon for all men, and it will happen even to you from time to time'.The Pope exclaimed 'But you must do something about this! I have mass in an hour, and this thing isn't going away!'The doctor replied 'You have two options... either I can administer an injection to your penis to make the problem go away, which will hurt and make you feel ill, or you can just quietly go into the toilet over there and relieve yourself.' Fearing the injection, the Pope elects the second option.Unbeknown to him, a paparazzi photographer had sneaked into the Vatican, and just as the Pope reaches that point of no return, up pops the photographer and begins snapping away.The Pope immediately summoned his security guards, who arrested the photographer, and began to quite thoroughly and professionally beat him up. The photographer shouted out, 'Hey, I thought you were a Christian organization! What has happened to your forgiveness?'His anger having passed, the pope agreed with the photographer, and relented, saying 'Yes, my son, you are right, we shall release you.  Unfortunately, we cannot return your camera, as we cannot allow the scandal of what is contained on the film to be seen in the outside world.' Never slow to take an opportunity, the photographer replied, 'But this is how I make my living! If you take my camera, I'll lose the money I could have sold the photographs for!'The Pope, feeling guilty, agreed.  'Very well, we will compensate you. How about $100,000?' Ecstatic, the paparazzi agreed, and was soon on his way. The Pope, in time, attended confession. Of course the whole story came out. For his penance, he was ordered to walk three times around St.  Peter's, with the offending camera around his neck.Out on his walk, he meets a Japanese tourist who said: 'Ah, so, very nice Japanese camera you got there, Mr. Pope, ah, may I ask how much you pay for it?'Being the Pope, he cannot tell a lie, so he replied, 'I must confess that I paid $100,000 for it.' 'Ah.... so....' said the Japanese gentleman, 'look like someone saw you coming!'</p>

32430,"<p>A mechanical engineer died &amp; went to heaven. Upon arrival Saint Peter checked ""THE BOOK"" and didn't find his name, so he informed the engineer that he must get on the elevator and go DOWNSTAIRS.</p>
<p>Reluctantly the engineer boarded the elevator for the long trip DOWNSTAIRS and upon arrival in hell found that he was very uncomfortable due to the excessive heat. He asked to see the devil and was granted an interview, at which time he requested a large of materials with which to build an air conditioner. The devil replied that he could have anything he wished, and what he couldn't find, they would steal. So the engineer spent a month and a half building an air conditioner, which, when completed, cooled hell off only a few degrees.</p>
<p>Somewhat unsatisfied the engineer requested additional materials, with which he spent another month and a half building a sprinkler system to add to the cooling effect of his air conditioner. Hell was getting much cooler now and folks were beginning to almost enjoy it.</p>
<p>About a month later the red phone rang. The devil answered, and found that God was on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>""Remember that mechanical engineer we sent down about 4 months ago?"" God queried.</p>
<p>""Hell yes, I remember!"" Said the devil.</p>
<p>""Well, Saint Peter missed that man's name on the last page of our book because the page was stuck to the one in front of it. So I want you to send the engineer back UPSTAIRS, as is our agreement. If they're on THE BOOK, then they stay UPHERE and if not, they go DOWNSTAIRS.""  God exclaimed!</p>
<p>""I'll be damned if your going to get that engineer back. He's put in an air conditioner and a sprinkler system down here and folks are almost happy to be here. I expect that when some folks hear about this they may begin to request to be sent DOWNSTAIRS!""  said the devil.</p>
<p>""Now look here!  We have an agreement!  In the book---UPSTAIRS and not in the book---DOWNSTAIRS!! If you don't send that engineer back right away I believe I'll have to sue you!!!""  shouted God!!</p>

32459,"<p>MICROSOFT Bids to Acquire Catholic ChurchBy Hank VorjesVATICAN CITY (AP) -- In a joint press conference in St. Peter's Square this morning, MICROSOFT Corp. and the Vatican announced that the Redmond software giant will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for an unspecified number of shares of MICROSOFT common stock. If the deal goes through, it will be the first time a computer software company has acquired a major world religion.With the acquisition, Pope John Paul II will become the senior vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software Division, while MICROSOFT senior vice-presidents Michael Maples and Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said MICROSOFT Chairman Bill Gates.""We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years,"" said Gates.""The combined resources of MICROSOFT and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people.""Through the MICROSOFT Network, the company's new on-line service, ""we will make the sacraments available on-line for the first time"" and revive the popular pre-Counter-Reformation practice of selling indulgences, said Gates.""You can get Communion, confess your sins, receive absolution -- even reduce your time in Purgatory -- all without leaving your home.""A new software application, MICROSOFT Church, will include a macro language which you can program to download heavenly graces automatically while you are away from your computer.An estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St Peter's Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello -- in character as Father Guido Sarducci -- hosted the event, which was broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide.Pope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello chided Gates, ""Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats,"" the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained.The deal grants MICROSOFT exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such masters as Michelangelo and Da Vinci. But critics say MICROSOFT will face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to these key intellectual properties.""The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures,"" said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia.""You take the parting of the Red Sea -- we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came on the scene.""But others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a common Abrahamic heritage.""The Catholic Church has just been more successful in marketing it to a larger audience,"" notes Notre Dame theologian Father Kenneth Madigan. Over the last 2,000 years, the Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted by Christianity, lags behind.Historically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor, leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and entering into exclusive licensing arrangements in various kingdoms whereby all subjects were instilled with Catholicism, whether or not they planned to use it. Today Christianity is available from several denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used. The Church's mission is to reach ""the four corners of the earth,"" echoing MICROSOFT's vision of ""a computer on every desktop and in every home"".Gates described MICROSOFT's long-term strategy to develop a scalable religious architecture that will support all religions through emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of interfaces according to the religion desired -- ""One religion, a couple of different implementations,"" said Gates.The MICROSOFT move could spark a wave of mergers and acquisitions, according to Herb Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Baptist Conference, as other churches scramble to strengthen their position in the increasingly competitive religious market.</p>

32460,"<p>Got this off the list a couple of years ago. I don't know who to give credit to as I deleted the author's name. </p>
<p>Michael Jordan will make over $300,000 a game, $10,000 a minute assuming he averages about 30 minutes a game. Assuming $40 mil in endorsements next year, he'll be making $178,100 a day (working or not)! </p>
<p>Assuming he sleeps 7 hours a night, he makes $52,000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head. </p>
<p>If he goes to see Independence Day, it'll cost him $7.00, but he'll make $18,550 while he's there. </p>
<p>If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'll make $618 while boiling it. </p>
<p>He makes $7,415/hr more than minimum wage (after the wage hike) </p>
<p>He'll make $3,710 while watching each episode of Friends. </p>
<p>If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX ($90,000) it would take him a whole 12 days. </p>
<p>If someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of $2.00 every second. </p>
<p>A quickie will net him $1855. </p>
<p>He'll probably pay around $200 for a nice round of golf, but will be 'reimbursed' $33,390 for that round. </p>
<p>He could take 1/100,000th of his income and buy some poor college student 5200 packages of Ramen. </p>
<p>Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15% of his income into his tax deferred account (401k), he will hit the federal cap of $9500 for such accounts at 8:30 a.m. on January 1st, 1997. </p>
<p>If you were given a tenth of a penny for every dollar he made, you'd be living comfortably at $65,000 a year. </p>
<p>He'll make about $19.60 while watching the 100 meter dash in the Olympics. </p>
<p>He'll make about $15,600 while the Boston Marathon is being run. </p>
<p>While the common person is spending about $20 for a meal in his trendy Chicago restaurant, he'll pull in about $5600. </p>
<p>Next year, he'll make more than twice as much as all of our past presidents for all of their terms combined. </p>
<p>And something to cheer you up after all of this........ Jordan will only have to have this income for 270 more years to have a net worth equivalent to that of Bill Gates. </p>
<p>Or does that make you more sick?</p>

"
32478,"<p>Si alguna vez se encuentra en la necesidad de manejar por las calles del Ecuador, el contenido de este manual lo ayudar� a llegar a su destino en una sola pieza... al menos eso esperamos.</p>
<p>Al encender su veh�culo:</p>
<p>Implore al Poder Supremo y encomi�ndese al cuidado divino para su protecci�n contra los peligros que encontrar� en las calles ecuatorianas.</p>
<p>Tenga mucho cuidado con los conductores 'marcha atr�s'. Esta clase de conductores es famosa por salir marcha atr�s sin importarle mucho lo que pueda haber en el camino. Si se topa con uno de estos conductores, entonces usted se encuentra en condiciones de poner en pr�ctica 'el saludo ecuatoriano de conductores' (ver pr�ximo p�rrafo).</p>
<p>El saludo ecuatoriano de conductores:</p>
<p>Para saludar a un conductor ecuatoriano, baje lentamente su ventana y, con tono grave y fuerte, pronuncie: la puta que te pari�. Pueden incluirse, al final de la expresi�n, sustantivos calificativos como: gordo de mierda, cabr�n hijo de puta, reflechucha tu madre, pelado cabeza de rodilla, vieja infeliz, etc. (escoger el m�s adecuado para la ocasi�n). De todas maneras, est� siempre preparado para responder con un '�ndate a la concha de tu madre', en caso de que el otro conductor lo haya saludado primero.</p>
<p>Luces de giro:</p>
<p>Si un conductor en otro carril enciende su luz de giro, no lo deje ingresar a su carril. De hecho, presione el acelerador y mant�ngase pr�ximo a �l. Es probable que el conductor intente saludarlo, pero usted ya sabe exactamente qu� hacer (ver p�rrafo anterior).</p>
<p>Sem�foros:</p>
<p>Estos interesantes artefactos suelen encontrarse en las intersecciones de las calles sin tener ninguna raz�n aparente, pero si est�n ah�, por algo ser�. Es muy probable encontrar conductores detenidos observando como cambian las luces de colores (una experiencia fascinante). Los oficiales de tr�nsito creen que cada color tiene un significado que el conductor debe respetar. De la observaci�n efectuada se ha determinado el significado de cada color:</p>
<p>Luz amarilla: acelere su veh�culo tanto como sea posible.<br /> Luz roja: esta luz permite pasar a 5 o 6 veh�culos m�s despu�s de su encendido.<br /> Luz verde: reduzca la velocidad y espere a que los 5 o 6 veh�culos atraviesen su luz roja.</p>
<p>Nota: es vital tocar la bocina a los 1.5 segundos del encendido de la luz verde.</p>
<p>Cambio de carril:</p>
<p>Antes que nada, no importa lo que vaya a hacer: nunca encienda su luz de giro, de lo contrario, estimular� la reacci�n del otro conductor (vea 'Luces de giro'). Observe al conductor que viene por el carril al que desea pasarse y, ante su menor descuido, introd�zcase descontroladamente con su veh�culo; se sorprender� al darse cuenta que no es necesario m�s que un par de cent�metros entre veh�culo y veh�culo. En ese momento ser� saludado por no menos de tres conductores. Para perfeccionar su cambio de carril existen diversas t�cnicas, por ejemplo: intente desacelerar su veh�culo dr�sticamente y en cuesti�n de segundos; no deje de observar el fen�meno de reacci�n en cadena producido por el conductor de atr�s. En medio del caos, cambie de carril y acelere.</p>
<p>Embotellamientos:</p>
<p>Durante los embotellamientos de tr�fico se realizan varias actividades divertid�simas, tales como:</p>
<p>- Toque su bocina r�tmicamente.<br /> - Retoque su maquillaje (generalmente, repito, s�lo generalmente, esto se da en conductoras).<br /> - Pierda peso, sudando como un cerdo, debido a la falta de aire acondicionado.<br /> - Salude a otros conductores. No necesariamente a los que provocan el embotellamiento.<br /> - Perfeccione su cambio de carril.<br /> - Juegue a ver que tan cerca puede detenerse del parachoques del veh�culo de adelante.</p>
<p>Peatones:</p>
<p>Estos individuos son una molestia para los conductores ecuatorianos. En caso de encontrar a alguno de estos singulares personajes, acelere y mu�strele qui�n es el jefe. En las intersecciones ceda el paso al peat�n y, en cuanto lo tenga en la mira, t�rele su veh�culo encima. Si no llega a tocarlo, puesto que suelen ser bastante h�biles, no se preocupe, seguramente lo habr� asustado lo suficiente.</p>
<p>Cambio de carril 'triple' (pre-requisito: dominar 'Cambio de carril'):</p>
<p>Este movimiento requiere de much�sima precisi�n y creatividad. Debe ser ejecutado rodeado del mayor n�mero de autos posible y en cuesti�n de segundos, para crear lo que algunos catalogan como 'p�nico general'.</p>
<p>Peajes de autopista:</p>
<p>Todos sabemos lo que es estar apurado y no tener cambio para ingresar a los carriles de 'Pago Exacto'. Con ese fin, se han desarrollado t�cnicas para su comodidad. Introd�zcase en el carril de 'Pago Exacto', aunque tenga un billete de S/.50.000. Cuando llegue a la cabina de pago, exclame con cara de asombro: '�Chuta, me confund� de carril!' Si el cobrador se niega a aceptar su billete, entonces se�ale la imponente cola de veh�culos que se ha formado detr�s y diga: '�puede decirles que muevan sus veh�culos, para sacar el m�o'?. Ignore los millones de saludos que recibir�, y sonr�a (usted va a ganar). Esta t�cnica es tambi�n aplicable cuando quiera cambiar d�lares, pero no espere obtener el mejor tipo de cambio.</p>
<p>�Ahora s�! Usted se encuentra totalmente capacitado para conducir en las calles del Ecuador, adelante y... �Feliz viaje!</p>

32480,"<p>In answer to the eternal question, ""Is it better to be a jock or a nerd?"", I submit the following:</p>
<p>Michael Jordan will make over $300,000 a game: $10,000 a minute, assuming he averages about 30 minutes per game. Assuming $40 million in endorsements next year, he'll be making $178,100 a day (working or not)! </p>
<p>Assuming he sleeps 7 hours a night, he makes $52,000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head. If he goes to see a movie, it'll cost him $7.00, but he'll make $18,550 while he's there. If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'll make $618 while boiling it. He makes $7,415/hr more than minimum wage (after the wage hike) He'll make $3,710 while watching each episode of Friends. If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX ($90,000) it would take him a whole 12 hours. If someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of $2.00 every second. He'll probably pay around $200 for a nice round of golf, but will be 'reimbursed' $33,390 for that round. Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15% of his income into his tax deferred account (401k), he will hit the federal cap of $9500 for such accounts at 8:30 a.m. on January 1st, 1997. If you were given a tenth of a penny for every dollar he made, you'd be living comfortably at $65,000 a year. He'll make about $19.60 while watching the 100 meter dash in the Olympics. He'll make about $15,600 while the Boston Marathon is being run. While the common person is spending about $20 for a meal in his trendy Chicago restaurant, he'll pull in about $5600. </p>
<p>Next year, he'll make more than twice as much as all of our past presidents for all of their terms combined. Amazing isn't it? </p>
<p>BUT: JORDAN WILL HAVE TO SAVE 100% OF HIS INCOME FOR 270 YEARS TO HAVE A NET WORTH EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF BILL GATES. NERDS RULE! NERDS RULE! NERDS RULE! NERDS RULE! NERDS RULE!</p>

32487,"<p>A blonde was driving her car one day, when she ran into a hailstorm. The hail stones were very large and made a lot of dents in the roof of her car. After the hail stopped, she went to a gas station and asked the attendant what she could do to get the dents out of her car.<br /> The attendant, being a smart-ass, told her: ""Blow real hard into the exhaust pipe, and that should push out the dents."" </p>
<p>When the blonde got home, not knowing any better, she did just that. While she was down on her hands and knees with her lips wrapped around her car's tailpipe, huffing and puffing trying to blow the dents out, her roommate-also a blonde-came home. </p>

At the end of the first week they even presented her with a pay envelope containing a dollar.  The little girl took this home to her mother who said all the appropriate words of admiration and suggested that they take her dollar pay she had received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.</p>

32514,"<p>Years ago, while lying in my hammock and drinking JD from the bottle. I noticed my dog dragging something under the fence. Upon inspection, to my dismay, I realised it was the next door neighbour's 10 year old daughter's rabbit. For years I had watch her come home from school and head straight out to it's cage, free it and play with it in the yard. I knew today would be no different and fearing for our dog, I had to think fast.The rabbit was quite dirty, as if it had put up quite a struggle, so I washed it off with the hose, combed it with the Dog brush and blew it dry with the leaf blower. Upon finishing it's grooming I jumped the fence and replaced back in it's cage, hoping it's death would be written off as ""natural causes"".Back to the hammock and JD. Within the hour the neighbour's Volvo pulled in as usual and out popped the little girl, and as usual she headed straight for the cage. Only this time she stopped about six feet away and screamed: ""DDDAAAADDDDDDDYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""Her father, panic stricken, stood looking at the cage. Being the good neighbour that I am I rushed to fence and asked if there was anything I could do.Her father less than calmly blurted, ""What kind of sick individual would dig up a little girl's dead rabbit and put it back in it's cage??""</p>

The next thing I hear is, ""Hey, where do you put the coffee?""

<p>This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before<br /> leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both<br /> hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, ""What's the story with<br /> that clock?"" </p>
<p>""Oh, that,"" St. Peter replies, ""That's President Clinton's clock. We decided<br /> to use it as a fan.""</p>

Finally, in the corner of the room, his torch came to rest on a parrot.'Did you say that?' he hissed at the parrot.'Yep,' the parrot confessed, and then squawked, 'I'm trying to warn you.'The burglar relaxed.

<p>He then calls his dog over and says: ""Bones. See the bones? Go get 'em.""</p>
<p>The dog rushes over to the pile, rummages around for a bit, and then proceeds<br /> to build a replica of the human skeleton, perfect down to the last detail. The<br /> doctor grins smugly.</p>
<p>Totally unimpressed, the engineer says: ""That's nothing. Watch this."" He calls<br /> his dog over, and points out the pile. ""Bones. Get the bones.</p>
<p>The dog rushes over, tears down the skeleton, and in its place builds a<br /> perfect replica of the Eiffel Tower. It even has little French flag waving at<br /> the top. The doctor is forced to agree the engineer's dog is smarter than his.</p>
<p>The lawyer, however, is still not impressed. ""My dog is smarter. Watch."" He<br /> then calls his dog over, points to the pile, and says simply ""Bones.""</p>
<p>The dog rushes over to the pile, tears down the tower, eats half the bones,<br /> buries the other half, screws the other two dogs, and takes the rest of the<br /> afternoon off.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs:</p>
<p>I've had a lot of time on my hands of late and believe that I may have the<br /> solution for the prevention of hijackings, and at the same time we just might<br /> get the Airline industry back on its feet. </p>
<p>Here's my plan: </p>
<p>Since Muslim men are not allowed to look at naked women, we should replace all<br /> of our flight attendants with naked females. Muslims would not then board our<br /> planes for fear of seeing a naked woman. Of course, every businessman in this<br /> country would start flying again in anticipation of seeing naked women.<br /> Hijackings would come to a screeching halt and the airline industry would<br /> probably have record sales. Hell, I'd fly all over just for the scenery. </p>
<p>It truly puzzles me that our Republican Congress didn't already come up with<br /> this. Am I the only one who thinks clearly on these issues? </p>

<p>   My happily married friend of 30 had a quick witted six year old named bobby. Rick, the father made a father-son outting out of going to the local market. Everytime they went, Rick would bring his son pick out a piece of candy, or snack.<br />    Holloween came around, and all the stores put out those little bags of chocolate coins. So when Rick would go to the market, he let his son pick out any bag he wanted. The bag had mixed big and small chocolate coins covered in gold foil wrapping. When they got home, little Bobby would always share with his dad. And like any good father, Rick always took the small ones, and left the big ones for bobby.<br />    So a few weeks had passed, and Rick made an early evening trip to the market, and bobby caught him out the door and begged and pleaded to tag along. When they got there, bobby went searching for his candy. When he passed the isle closest to the register, he caught a glimpse of what looked like the gold coin chocolate candy he liked so much. They were actually those giant gold foil wrapped condoms. So little bobby grabs them, and meets his dad at the register were an attractive woman is checking out his groceries. Bobby puts the condoms on the counter, and says-""Im getting these for my daddy- He likes the LITTLE ones!""</p>

<p>Day 1</p>
<p>Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to celebrate. When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, he locked himself in the bathroom and cried.</p>
<p>Day 2</p>
<p>Today, he says he has a big secret to tell me. He's impotent, he says, and he wants me to be the first to know. Why doesn't he tell me something I don't know! I mean, gimme a break. He's been dysfunctional for so long that he even walks with a limp.</p>
<p>Day 3</p>
<p>This marriage is in trouble. A woman has needs. Yesterday, I saw a picture of the Washington Monument and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Day 4</p>
<p>A miracle has happened! There's a new drug on the market that will fix his 'problem.' It's called Viagra. I told him that if he takes Viagra, things will be just like they were on our wedding night. He said, 'this time, I'd rather not have your mother join us.' I think this will work. I replaced his Prozac with the Viagra, hoping to lift something other than his mood.</p>
<p>Day 7</p>
<p>This Viagra thing has gone to his head. No pun intended! Yesterday, at Burger King, the manager asked me if I'd like a Whopper. He thought they were talking about him. Get over yourself! Not everything is about you!</p>

<p>I think he took too many over the weekend. Yesterday, instead of mowing the lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed wacker.</p>
<p>Day 10</p>
<p>Okay, I admit it. I'm hiding. I mean, a girl can only take so much. And to make matters worse, he's washing the Viagra down with hard cider! The photo of Janet Reno isn't working. What am I gonna do?</p>
<p>Day 11</p>
<p>The side effects are starting to get to him. Everything is turning blue. The other day, we were watching Kenneth Branaugh in Hamlet and he thought it was The Smurfs Do Denmark.</p>
<p>Day 12</p>
<p>I'm basically being drilled to death. It's like going out with a Black and Decker power tool.</p>
<p>Day 13</p>
<p>I wish he was gay. I bought 400 Liza Minelli albums and I keep saying 'fabulous,' and still he keeps coming after me!</p>
<p>Day 14</p>
<p>Now I know how Saddam Hussein's wife feels. Every time I shut my eyes, there's a sneak attack! It's like going to bed with a scud missile. Let's hope he's not like ex-President Bush and takes 100 days to pull out!</p>
<p>Day 15</p>
<p>I've done everything to turn him off. Nothing is working. I even started dressing like a nun. Now he tells me sister Wendy revs his motor.</p>
<p>Day 16</p>
<p>I may just have to kill him. Then he'll go out the way he wants to... stiff! With my luck, I won't be able to close the casket.</p>

32599,"<p>The only thing that the IRS has not yet taxed is the male penis. This is due to the fact that 40% of the time it is hanging around unemlpoyed, 30% of the time it is hard up, 20% of the time it is pissed off and 10% of the time it is in the hole. On top of that, it has two dependents and they are both nuts. </p>
<p>Effective January 1st, 2004 your penis will be taxed according to size. The brackets are as follows: </p>
<p>10""- 12"" Luxury Tax..........$30.00<br /> 8""- 10"" Pole Tax.............$25.00<br /> 5""- 8"" Privilege Tax.........$15.00<br /> 4""- 5"" Nuisance Tax..........$3.00 </p>
<p>Males exceeding 12"" must file under capital gains. Anyone under 4"" is eligible for a refund. PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR AN EXTENSION!!! </p>
<p>Sincerely, Pecker Checker IRS </p>
<p>*****NOTE***** </p>
<p>We are still waiting for answers for the following questions: </p>
<p>- Are there penalties for early withdrawals? - What if one's penis is self employed? - Do multiple partners count as a corporation? - Are condoms a deductible expense as work clothes? - Is there an additional tax if you are not circumcised?</p>

<p>Three engineers and three accountants are traveling by train to a<br /> conference. At the station, the three accountants each buy tickets<br /> and watch as the three engineers buy only a single ticket.</p>

The man comes up to a parked car, fumbles around in his pockets, gets his keys, and proceeds to drive away. The police officer, unbelieving what he saw, pulls the man over a few blocks down the road. The man gives a breathalizer for the officer and to the officer's amazement - the guy was stone cold sober.""I can't belive it! I watched you walk to this car, drive erratic all the way down the road, and my machine says you have no alcohol in your system! How can that be???""

Removing his clothes,<br /> she discovered that the young man had died with the most massive<br /> ERECTION she had ever seen.

""I<br /> enjoyed it, and HE surely didn't mind it. Besides, he can't<br /> complain and I can't get pregnant. Why don't you give it a try<br /> too?""</p>
<p>""Oh, I can't possibly,"" said the second nurse, blushing. ""First,<br /> he's dead and second, I've got my period. Anyway, listen, the<br /> doctor is looking for you."" And so the first nurse left.</p>

<p>And then there is silence in the car. . . To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: </p>
<p>Jeez, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he want, or isn't sure of.</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>
<p>Gosh. Six months.</p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: </p>
<p>But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward. I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even knog this person?</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>

Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed-even before I sensed it-that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected.</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>
<p>And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.</p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: </p>
<p>He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure.</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>
<p>They'll probably say it's only a 90-day warranty. Scumbags!</p>
<p>And Elaine is thinking: </p>
<p>Maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, school girl romantic fantasy.</p>
<p>And Roger is thinking: </p>
<p>Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it right up their...</p>
<p>""Roger,"" Elaine says aloud.</p>
<p>""What?"" says Roger, startled.</p>
<p>""Please don't torture yourself like this,"" she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. ""Maybe I should never have... Oh God, I feel so..."" (She breaks down, sobbing.)</p>
<p>""What?"" says Roger.</p>
<p>""I'm such a fool,"" Elaine sobs. ""I mean, I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse.""</p>
<p>""There's no horse?"" says Roger.</p>
<p>""You think I'm a fool, don't you?"" Elaine says.</p>
<p>""No!"" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer.</p>
<p>""It's just that... it's that I... I need some time,"" Elaine says.</p>
<p>(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.) ""Yes,"" he says.</p>
<p>(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.) ""Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?"" she says.</p>
<p>""What way?"" says Roger.</p>
<p>""That way about time,"" says Elaine.</p>
<p>""Oh,"" says Roger. ""Yes.""</p>
<p>(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)</p>
<p>""Thank you, Roger,"" she says.</p>
<p>""Thank you,"" says Roger.</p>
<p>Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn.</p>
<p>Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV, and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it.</p>
<p>The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression, and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say, ""Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?""</p>
<p>And that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the difference between men and women!</p>

32704,"<p>The world's best and most famous conductor makes a small mistake while conducting the New York Symphony Orchestra. The audience doesn't notice, the orchestra didn't notice either, but he knew he'd made the mistake and decided that he should retire. Once the performance had finished, he turned and faced the audience and said ""Ladies and Gentleman, this is my last performance as a world class conductor. I'm now announcing my retirement."" </p>
<p>After a few minutes silence from the shocked audience, and orchestra too, he was greeted with boos and hisses. He walked from the stage, only to be met by his manager, standing in between two gorilla-sized bodyguards. </p>
<p>""Oh no you don't"", his manager said, ""you're not retiring."" </p>
<p>Forced backed to work by his manager, he endured week after week of conducting he no longer wanted to do. While lying in bed one night with his wife of many years, he turned to her and said ""Dear, would you be able to get me a small hand-gun?"" </p>
<p>""Yes dear"", she said, and he rolled over and went to sleep. </p>
<p>Sure enough, at his next performance, the conductor began with the small hand-gun concealed in the his jacket. Once the concert had finished, he turned to the audience and said ""I'm announcing my retirement for the second time. This is my last performance."" </p>
<p>The tuba player from the orchestra stood up and shouted ""You can't be serious!"", and the conductor whipped out his hand-gun and shot the tuba player dead. </p>
<p>It wasn't long before the police arrived and the conductor was taken away. Days later, the conductor was taken to court. ""How do you plead to the charge of first-degree murder?"", the judge inquired. </p>
<p>""Guilty your honour"", the conductor replied. </p>
<p>""Do you realise that the sentence for first degree murder in this state is death by electrification?"", the judge added. </p>
<p>The conductor thought for a moment, but came to the conclusion that death would surely be better than continuing on like he was. </p>
<p>""Yes your honour"", the conductor said. </p>
<p>While being strapped into the electric chair, one of the guards came to the conductor and said ""You may have one last request before we terminate your life. What would you like?"" </p>
<p>After pondering for a few seconds, the conductor replied ""A silver platter with a dozen bananas."" His request was granted, and the conductor scoffed the bananas. The room was emptied, and the switch was flicked. The conductor's hair stood on end, but he survived! As one guard was about the flick the switch again, he was stopped. ""He survived the chair and the law says we have to let him go."" </p>
<p>The conductor left the building, only to be greeted by his manager and the two gorilla-sized bodyguards. </p>
<p>""Back to work"", his manager said. </p>
<p>More weeks of forced conducting went by. Lying in bed again one night with wife, he asked ""Dear, could you get me a grenade?"" </p>
<p>""Yes dear"", she replied. </p>
<p>At his next performance, the conductor waited until the end of the concert, the grenade tucked neatly in his undies. </p>
<p>""For the third time, I'm annoucing my retirement!"", he yelled. </p>
<p>The conductor took out the grenade, pulled the pin, and threw it into the audience. The grenade exploded, killing 23 members of the crowd. The police arrived, and he was taken away again. </p>
<p>""You again?"", the judge asked, ""I thought I'd sentenced you to death not long ago?"" </p>
<p>The conductor shrugged. ""Ok, how do you plead to 23 counts of first degree murder?"", the judge said. </p>
<p>""Guilty on all counts"", the conductor replied. </p>
<p>While the settings were changed to triple the voltage of the current going to the chair, the conductor was granted another last reuqest. ""A silver platter with 2 dozen bananas"" was his answer. He scoffed the bananas, the room was evacuated and the switch was flicked. </p>
<p>It appeared that they'd manage to kill him this time, but their fears were realised when the conductor regained consciousness as they were about to remove his body. His manager and the two gorilla-sized bodyguards were waiting for him as his left the building. </p>
<p>""Back to work."" </p>
<p>The weeks dragged on, and the conductor had all that he could take. </p>
<p>""Dear, could you get me a missile launcher?"", he asked his wife as they lay in bed. </p>
<p>""Yes dear"", she replied. </p>
<p>It was all too much for the conductor, and he didn't even wait for the concert to start. </p>
<p>""Fuck yas all!"" he screamed, and launched a missile into the New York Symphony Orchestra, killing all 190 odd band members. The army was called in this time, and he was dragged away. </p>
<p>""Jesus Christ, you again!?! You're supposed to be DEAD!"", the judge roared. </p>
<p>The conductor just shrugged. ""May I ask how you plead for 190 counts of first degree murder?"" </p>
<p>""Guilty as sin!"", the conductor screamed, ""The bastards deserved it!"" </p>
<p>The conductor was hauled away. A public announcement was issued to all local residents warning that there would be a short cut in the power. Meanwhile, the cities' electrical engineers were busy re-routing all the electricity they could into the electric chair. Once again, the conductor was granted a last request. </p>
<p>""Three dozen bananas on a silver platter"", he said. </p>
<p>He scoffed the bananas, the building was completely vacated, and the electric chair was activated by remote control, some 2 kilometres away. The building exploded, reducing it to rubble. They fished through the ruins to find the conductor's ruined body. His funeral was held some days later and as the casket was being lowered into the grave there was a knock on the coffin lid. </p>
<p>Women fainted as the conductor crawled out of coffin - alive! He was taken to a large press conference. One reporter stood up and asked ""You've survived three visits to the electric chair. How did you do it?""</p>
<p>""I've tried telling people before"", he said. ""I'm just a bad conductor.""</p>

<p>""Well... he said he would be home tonight and asked me to call him,"" she said in a slightly irritated voice.</p>
<p>I replied, ""Well, he went out with Karen about an hour ago, and said that he would be back at ten.""</p>

32725,"<p>The following is from the US Government Peace Corps Manual for its volunteers who work in the Amazon Jungle. It tells what to do in case you are attacked by an anaconda,the largest snake in the world. It is a relative of the boa constrictor, it grows to thirty-five feet in length and weighs between three and four hundred pounds at the maximum.<br /> This is what the manual said: </p>
<p>1. If you are attacked by an anaconda, do not run. The snake is faster than you are. </p>
<p>2. Lie flat on the ground. Put your arms tight against your sides, your legs tight against one another </p>
<p>3. Tuck your chin in. </p>
<p>4. The snake will come and begin to nudge and climb over your body. </p>
<p>5. Do not panic </p>
<p>6. After the snake has examined you, it will begin to swallow you from the feet and - always from the end. Permit the snake to swallow your feet and ankles. Do not panic. </p>
<p>7. The snake will now begin to suck your legs into its body. You must lie perfectly still. This will take a long time. </p>
<p>8. When the snake has reached your knees slowly and with as little movement as possible, reach down, take your knife and very gently slide it into the side of the snake's mouth between the edge of its mouth and your leg, then suddenly rip upwards, severing the snake's head. </p>
<p>9. Be sure you have your knife. </p>
<p>10. Be sure your knife is sharp.</p>

32748,"<p>A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his graduate students. It had one question: ""Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof."" </p>
<p>Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following: </p>
<p>First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities. </p>
<p>1) If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose. </p>
<p>2) Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. </p>
<p>So which is it? </p>
<p>If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms Therese Banyan during my Freshman year, ""That it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,"" and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then 2 cannot be true, and so Hell is exothermic. </p>
<p>The student got the only A.</p>

"
32828,"<p>Is There a Santa Claus? A Rebuttal... </p>
<p>Rebuttal: Several key points are overlooked by this callous, amateurish ''study.'' </p>
<p>Flying reindeer: As is widely known due to the excellent historical documentary ''Santa Claus is Coming to Town,'' the flying reindeer are not a previously unknown species of reindeer, but were in fact given the power of flight due to eating magic acorns. As is conclusively proven in ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' (a no-punches- pulled look at life in Santa's village), this ability has bred true in subsequent generations of reindeer--obviously the magic acorns imprinted their power on a dominant gene sequence within the reindeer DNA strand. </p>
<p>Number of households: This figure overlooks two key facts. First of all, the first major schism in the Church split the Eastern Churches, centered in Byzantium, from the Western, which remained centered in Rome. This occurred prior to the Gregorian correction to the Julian calendar. The Eastern churches (currently called Orthodox Churches) do not recognize the Gregorian correction for liturgical events, and their Christmas is, as a result, several days after that of the Western Churches'. Thus, Santa gets two shots at delivering toys. </p>
<p>Secondly, the figure of 3.5 children per household is based on the gross demographic average, which includes households with no children at all. The number of children per household, when figured as an average for households with children, would therefore have to be adjusted upward. Also, the largest single Christian denomination is Roman Catholic, who, as we all know, breed like rabbits. If you don't believe me, ask my four brothers and two sisters--they'll back me up. Due to the predominance of Catholics within Christian households, the total number of households containing Christian children would have to be adjusted downward to reflect the overloading of Catholics beyond a standard deviation from the median. </p>
<p>Also, the assertion that each home would contain at least one good child would be reasonable enough if there were in fact an even 3.5 children per household. However, since the number of children per household is distributed integrally, there is a significant number (on the order of several million) of one-child Christian households. Even though only children are notoriously spoiled--and therefore disproportionately inclined toward being naughty--since it's the holidays we'll be generous and give them a fifty-fifty chance of being nice. This removes one half of the single-child households from Santa's delivery schedule, which has already been reduced by the removal of the Orthodox households from the first delivery run. </p>
<p>Santa's delivery run (speed, payload, etc.): These all suffer from the dubious supposition that there is only one Santa Claus. The name ''Santa'' is obviously either Spanish or Italian, two ethnic groups which are both overwhelmingly Catholic. The last name Claus suggests a joint German/</p>

32839,"<p>A physicist, an engineer, and a mathematician were all zapped up by a UFO<br /> and studied by the aliens.  One of the situations given was that the three<br /> men were placed at one end of a long hallway and a nubile, young, nude<br /> woman was at the other.  The men were told that a bell would ring at a<br /> constant interval.  Within that interval, they were allowed to move half<br /> the distance from wherever they stood to the woman.  If they went too far<br /> or didn't go far enough, a laser would shoot them dead.  At the first bell,<br /> the engineer took off.  The mathematician and physicist tried to tell him<br /> that there was no way he could make it to the woman.  The engineer replied,<br /> ""Sure, but soon I'll be CLOSE ENOUGH!""</p>

<p>As the K-9 officer approached the house with his dog on a leash, the blonde ran out on the porch, shuddered at the sight of the cop and his dog, then sat down on the steps. </p>
<p>Putting her face in her hands, she moaned, ""I come home to find all my possessions stolen. I call the police for help, and what do they do? They send me a BLIND policeman!""</p>
"
32841,"<p>I was riding to work yesterday when I observed a female driver<br /> cut right in front of a pickup truck causing him to have to<br /> drive on to the shoulder to avoid hitting her. </p>
<p>This evidently angered the driver enough that he hung his arm<br /> out his window and flipped the woman off. </p>
<p>""Man, that guy is stupid!"" I thought to myself. </p>
<p>I ALWAYS smile nicely and wave in a sheepish manner whenever a<br /> female does anything to me in traffic and here's why: </p>
<p>I drive 48 miles each way every day to work, that's 96 miles<br /> each day. </p>
<p>Of these, 16 miles each way is bumper-to-bumper. </p>
<p>Most of the bumper-to-bumper is on an 8 lane highway so if you<br /> just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass<br /> something like a new car every 40 feet per lane. </p>
<p>That's 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be<br /> 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars. </p>
<p>Even though the rest of the 32 miles is not bumper to bumper, I<br /> figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. </p>
<p>That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass<br /> every day. </p>
<p>Statistically, half of these are driven by females, that's<br /> 18,000. </p>
<p>In any given group of females 1 in 28 are having the worst day<br /> of their period. That's 642. </p>
<p>According to Cosmopolitan, 70% describe their love life as<br /> dissatisfying or unrewarding. That's 449. </p>
<p>According to the National Institute of Health, 22% of all<br /> females have seriously considered suicide or homicide. That's<br /> 98. </p>
<p>And 34% describe men as their biggest problem. That's 33. </p>
<p>According to the National Rifle Association 5% of all females<br /> carry weapons and this number is increasing. </p>
<p>That means that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one<br /> female that has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest<br /> problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, is having<br /> the worst day of her period, and is armed. </p>
<p>Flip one off? </p>
<p>.....I think not.</p>

<p>(3 and final) The famous playwright George Bernard Shaw, once<br /> wrote a letter to Churchill along these lines: ""...I would be<br /> delighted if you could attend the first performance of my new<br /> play...You may bring a friend, if you have one."" Churchill was<br /> not going to take that sitting down; his reply: ""I apologize<br /> that I cannot attend the first performance of your play, but I<br /> will be happy to attend the second performance, if you have one.""</p>

32891,"<p>Jeff and Mike were in an accident and killed instantly. Upon Jeff's arrival to the Pearly Gates, he is met by St. Peter.</p>
<p>""Where is my friend Mike?"" Jeff asked.</p>
<p>St. Peter replies, ""Well, Mike was not as fortunate as you. He went in the other direction instead of getting into Heaven.""</p>
<p>Jeff was bothered by this and asked, ""Well, could I see Mike one more time just to be sure he is OK?""</p>
<p>So, Jeff and St. Peter walked over to the edge of Heaven and looked down. There was Mike, on a sandy beach, with a gorgeous sexy blonde in a bikini, and a keg of beer.</p>
<p>""I don't mean to complain, but Mike seems to have it pretty nice down there in Hell,"" says Jeff.</p>
<p>""It's not as it appears to be,"" says St. Peter.</p>

"
32893,"<p>Here are some supposedly true humorous statements by several<br /> airline flights crews. Occasionally, airline attendants make an<br /> effort to make the ""in-flight safety lecture"" a bit more<br /> entertaining. Here are some real examples that have been heard<br /> or reported:</p>
<p>""As we prepare for takeoff, please make sure your tray tables<br /> and seat backs are fully upright in their most uncomfortable<br /> position.""</p>
<p>""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4<br /> ways out of this airplane...""</p>
<p>""Your seat cushions can be used for floatation, and in the event<br /> of an emergency water landing, please take them with our<br /> compliments.""</p>
<p>""We do feature a smoking section on this flight; if you must<br /> smoke, contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort<br /> you to the wing of the airplane.""</p>
<p>""Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught<br /> smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane<br /> immediately.""</p>
<p>As we waited just off the runway for another airliner to cross<br /> in front of us, some of the passengers were beginning to<br /> retrieve luggage from the overhead bins. The head steward<br /> announced on the intercom, ""This aircraft is equipped with a<br /> video surveillance system that monitors the cabin during<br /> taxiing. Any passengers not remaining in their seats until the<br /> aircraft comes to a full and complete stop at the gate will be<br /> strip-searched as they leave the aircraft.""</p>
<p>A frequent line used at the end of a flight is, ""Our flight<br /> attendants are now walking through the aisles with trash<br /> receptacles for any garbage you might have or anything else that<br /> you might wanna give us!""</p>
<p>Once on a Southwest flight, the pilot said, ""We've reached our<br /> cruising altitude now, and I'm turning off the seat belt sign.<br /> I'm switching to autopilot, too, so I can come back there and<br /> visit with all of you for the rest of the flight.""</p>
<p>As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington<br /> National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big<br /> fella...WHOA..!""</p>
<p>""Should the cabin loose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from<br /> the overhead area. Please, place the bag over your own mouth and<br /> nose before assisting children or adults acting like children.""</p>
<p>""As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your<br /> belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly<br /> among the flight attendants. Please, do not leave children or<br /> spouses.""</p>
<p>""Last one off the plane must clean it.""</p>
<p>""If you are so lucky to be traveling with small children...""</p>
<p>And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased<br /> to have some of the best flight attendants in the<br /> industry...Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...!""</p>
<p>This is an actual joke I heard on Southwest Airlines, just after<br /> a very hard landing in Salt Lake City, one of the most bone<br /> jarring I've experienced; The steward came on the intercom and<br /> said, ""That was quite a bump and I know what ya'll are thinking.<br /> I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airlines fault, it wasn't the<br /> pilots fault, it wasn't the flight attendants fault.......it was<br /> the asphalt!""</p>
<p>From a Southwest Airlines employee...""Welcome aboard Southwest<br /> Flight XXX, to YYY. To operate your seat belt, insert the metal<br /> tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every<br /> other seatbelt, and if you don't know how to operate one, you<br /> probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event<br /> of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend<br /> from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it<br /> over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you,<br /> secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are<br /> traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love<br /> more. Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken<br /> clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive.<br /> Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more<br /> than Southwest Airlines.""</p>

32894,"<p>A young man, who worked at a driving range, picked up a couple of dozen old<br /> balls one day and took them home with him, stuffing them into his pants<br /> pockets.<br /> On the bus on his way home, an elderly old lady sat down next to him,<br /> so he had to scrunch them up to make room for her. He noticed after a while the<br /> lady was glancing sideways toward his pockets. A bit embarrassed, he said to the<br /> lady, ""It's all right ma'am, they're just golf balls.""<br /> She nodded and smiled sympathetically and a few moments later said, ""Tell me -<br /> is that something like tennis elbow?""</p>

32895,"<p>Back in the bad old days when I was working in a fast food joint... </p>
<p>There was one female type person on the night crew. A very attractive young lady with a penchant for wearing mini-skirts. Needless to say, we did not object to this in the least. In fact, we used to let her wipe down the tables up front, instead of slopping the french fryers and such. Admittedly one of our reasons was that in order to wipe down the tables she had to lean far over them and stretch. Generally facing away from the counter. </p>
<p>This was when we learned that she tended to wear panties that matched her nail polish. No kidding! She came in one day with black nail polish with silver speckles, and it turned out that she was wearing black panties with silver spangles. Another day, she came in wearing pink nail polish on one hand, and blue on the other. The panties were blue on one cheek, and pink on the other. </p>
<p>But ... one evening ... great anticipation ... When would she EVER go out and wipe the tables ??? ... She came in to work, and she was wearing no nail polish! </p>
<p>She never did tables that night, and we never knew. </p>
<p>I suspect we were set up.</p>

<p>She screams out...""I can't get pregnant...aaahhhhhhhh""! </p>

32900,"<p>A young doctor moved out to a small community to replace the aging doctor there. The older doctor suggested that the younger doctor accompany him as he made his house calls so that the people of the community could become accustomed to him.At the first house they visited, the younger doctor listened intently as the older doctor and an older lady discussed the weather, their grandchildren and the latest church bulletin. After some time, the older doctor asked his patient how she had been feeling.""I've been a little sick to my stomach,"" she replied.""Well,"" said the older physician, ""you've probably been over doing it a bit with the fresh fruit. Why don't you cut back on the amount of fresh fruit you eat and see if that helps.""As they left the house, the younger doctor asked how the older doctor had reached his diagnosis so quickly.""You didn't even examine that woman,"" the younger doctor stated.""I didn't have to,"" the elder physician explain. ""You noticed I dropped my stethoscope on the floor in there. Well when I bent over to pick it up, I looked around and noticed a half dozen banana peels in the trash can. That is probably what has been making her ill.""""That's pretty sneaky,"" commented the younger doctor. ""Do you mind if I try it at the next house?""""I don't suppose it could hurt anything,"" the elder physician replied.At the next house, the two doctors visited with an elderly widow. They spent several minutes discussing the weather and grandchildren and the latest church bulletin. After several minutes, the younger doctor asked the widow how she had been feeling lately.""I've felt terribly run down lately,"" the widow replied. ""I just don't have as much energy as I used to.""""You've probably been doing too much work for the church,"" the younger doctor suggested without even examining his patient. ""Perhaps you should ease up a bit and see if that helps.""As they left, the elder physician said, ""Your diagnosis is probably right, but do you mind telling me how you came to that conclusion?""""Sure,"" replied the younger doctor. ""Just like you, I dropped my stethoscope on the floor. When I bent down to pick it up, I looked around and there was the preacher hiding under the bed!""</p>

32904,"<p>'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the trailer<br /> Not a creature was stirrin' 'Cept a redneck named Taylor.<br /> His first name was Bubba, Joe was his middle,<br /> And a-runnin' down his chin Was a trickle of spittle.<br /> His socks, they were hung by the chimney with care,<br /> And therefore there was a foul stench in the air. </p>
<p>That Bubba got scared And rousted the boys.<br /> There was Rufus, 12; Jim Bob was 11;<br /> Dud goin' on 10; Otis was 7.<br /> John, George and Chucky Were 5,4, and 3:<br /> The twins were both girls So they let them be. </p>
<p>They jumped in their overalls, No need for a shirt,<br /> Threw a hat on each head, Then turned with a jerk.<br /> They ran to the gun rack That hung on the wall.<br /> There were 17 shotguns; They grabbed them all. </p>
<p>Bubba said to the young'uns, ""Now hesh up ya'll!<br /> The last thing we wanna do Is wake up yer Maw.""<br /> Maw was expecting And needed her sleep,<br /> So out they crept out the door without making a peep. </p>
<p>They all looked around, and then they all spit.<br /> The young'uns asked Bubba, ""Paw, what is it?""<br /> Bubba just stared; He could not say a word.<br /> This was just like all of the stories he'd heard. </p>
<p>It was Santy Claus on the roof, Darn tootin'<br /> But the boys didn't know; They was about to start shootin'!<br /> They aimed their shotguns and nearly made a mistake<br /> That would have resulted in venison steak.<br /> Bubba hollered out, ""Don't shoot, boys!""<br /> That's Santy Claus And he's brought us some toys. </p>
<p>The dogs were a-barkin' And a-raisin' cain,<br /> And Bubba whistled, and shouted, And called them by name.<br /> ""Down, Spot! Shut up Bullet! Quiet, Pete and Roscoe!<br /> Git, Turnip and Tater and Sam and Bosco!"" </p>
<p>""Git down from that porch! Git down off that wall!<br /> Quit shakin the trailer, Or you'll make Santy fall!""<br /> The dogs kept a-barkin' And wouldn't shut up,<br /> And they trampled poor Pete Who was only a pup. </p>
<p>Santy opened his bag, And threw out some toys.<br /> Bubba got most, But left a few for the boys.<br /> Since the guns had been dropped He just might not die. </p>
<p>He jumped in his sleigh, Told his reindeer to hurry.<br /> The trailer started to wobble Santa started to worry.<br /> Just as the reindeer Got into the air,<br /> The trailer collapsed, But Bubba didn't care. </p>
<p>He was busy lookin' At all his new toys.<br /> Then a thought hit him, And he said to the boys:<br /> ""Go check on yer Maw, Make sure she's all right.<br /> That roof fallin' on her Could-a hurt just a might."" </p>
<p>But Maw was OK, And the girls were too.<br /> They fixed up the trailer; It looked good as new.<br /> And as for Bubba, He liked Old St. Nick,<br /> But Santa thought Bubba Was a pure-in-tee hick! </p>
<p>Bubba had a nice Christmas, And the boys did, too.<br /> And the Taylors wish A Merry Christmas to you!</p>

32914,"<p>President Clinton was to represent the United States of America on a highly formal, orchestrated 'state visit' to Great Britain. Air Force One stopped at a bright red carpet along which the President strode to join Queen Elizabeth II in a beautiful, ornate 17th-century coach hitched to 6 enormous matched white horses.    The coach proceeded through the streets enroute to Buckingham Palace, the President and the Queen alternating between exchanging pleasantries and waving out their respective windows to the cheering throngs.    At one point, the right rear horse produced a thunderous, cataclysmic fart that reverberated through the air and rattled the doors of the coach. Presidents and Queens are, first and foremost, human beings. Their first reaction was to focus their attentions outside their respective windows, and behave as if nothing extraordinary had happened. The Queen, steeped in decades of experience living with the mundane and bizzare together, was the first to realize that ignoring what had happened was ridiculous. 'Mr. President, please accept my regrets - I'm sure you understand that there are some things that even a Queen cannot control.'    'Your Majesty, please don't give the matter another thought; why, if you hadn't said something, I would have thought it was one of the horses.'</p>

32926,"<p>* One Star Hangover </p>
<p>No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere disco nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy. Be glad that you are able to function relatively well. However, you are still parched. You can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way. Even vegetarians are craving a huge steak and a side of gravy fries.</p>
<p>** Two Star Hangover No pain. </p>
<p>Something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee/coca-cola you chug to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which is craving a Bacon &amp; Egg McMuffin combo (with orange juice!!!).Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels and even though you have a nice demeanour about the office, you are costing your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is surfing the internet and writing junk e-mails.</p>
<p>*** Three Star Hangover Slight headache. </p>
<p>Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely a space cadet and so not productive. Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd you at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your bed with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub watching the E! fashion awards. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 3 V's and a litre of diet coke - yet you haven't peed once!</p>

<p>Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but that can't hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls, it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars) your teeth have sweaters, your eyes look like one big vein and your hairstyle makes you look like a reject from the class picture of Revere High '76.</p>
<p>***** Five Star Hangover AKA Dante's 4th Circle of Hell. </p>
<p>You have a second heartbeat in your head which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the next cubical Vodka vapor is seeping out of every pour and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners on your mouth from brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body. Death seems pretty good right now. Your boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog/cat has just died because you look so pathetic.</p>
<p>You should have called in sick because, let's face it, all you can manage to do is bitch about your state -which is a mystery to you because you definitely don't remember who you were with, where you were, or what you drank. The only thing you can do is pass out. It's when you wake up a few hours later with a lesser star hangover that you eat a large pizza,an order of KFC, a ham and cheese toastie and a batch of rice krispie treats.</p>

<p>The crowd murmured their approval. The man stood up on the bar, dropped his<br /> trousers, and placed his privates in the alligator's open mouth. The gator<br /> closed his mouth as the crowd gasped. After a minute, the man grabbed a beer<br /> bottle and rapped the alligator hard on the top its head. The gator opened his<br /> mouth and the man removed his genitals, unscathed as promised. The crowd cheered<br /> and the first of his free drinks was delivered. The man stood up again and made<br /> another offer.</p>
<p>''I'll pay anyone $100 who's willing to give it a try."" A hush fell over the<br /> crowd. After a while, a hand went up in the back of the bar.</p>

32955,"<p>The prostitute's lawyer addressed the court first, ""Your Honor, my client,<br /> this lady here, is the owner of a piece of property, a garden spot surrounded by<br /> a profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she agreed to rent to the<br /> defendant for a specific length of time for the sum of $500.00. The defendant<br /> obtained exclusive possession of the property, using it extensively for the<br /> purpose for which it was rented. However, upon evacuating the premises, he paid<br /> only one-half of the amount agreed upon. The rent was not excessive since it is<br /> restricted and exclusive property and we ask that judgment be granted for<br /> plaintiff and against defendant in the amount of $250.00.<br />     The defendant's lawyer, thrown back by what he had just heard, pondered<br /> the opening remarks for a moment and stood to present his off-the-cuff version<br /> of the case, ""Your Honor, my client agrees that the young lady has a fine piece<br /> of property, and that he rented such property for a period of time, and that he<br /> even derived a degree of pleasure from the transaction. However, my client found<br /> a well on the property upon which he placed his own stones, sunk a shaft, and<br /> erected a pump. All equipment belonging to my client and all labor being<br /> performed by him. We allege that these improvements to the property were<br /> sufficient to affect an offset of the unpaid portion of rent and further allege<br /> that the plaintiff was adequately compensated for the fair market rental value<br /> of such property. We, therefore, ask that judgment not be granted for plaintiff<br /> and that the defendant be awarded his attorney's fees and costs incurred in the<br /> defense of this frivolous action.""<br />     The prostitute's lawyer replied, ""If it pleases the court your Honor, my<br /> client agrees that the defendant did find a well on the property, and that he<br /> made the improvements to the property as alleged. However, had the defendant not<br /> known the well existed; he would have never rented the property. Furthermore,<br /> upon evacuating the premises, the defendant removed the stones, pulled out the<br /> shaft, and took the pump with him. In doing so, he not only dragged his<br /> equipment through the well-manicured shrubbery, but also left the well with a<br /> hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, making it easily accessible<br /> to small children, thereby creating a possible danger to the health and general<br /> welfare of the public. We, therefore, ask that judgment be granted as requested<br /> in the complaint.<br />     Judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $250.00!</p>

Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands. </p>

32977,"<p>One of the nation's largest soup manufacturers announced today that they will<br /> be stocking America's shelves this week with their newest Soup creation,<br /> ""Clinton Soup"", that will honor one of the nation's most distinguished men. It<br /> consists primarily of a small weenie in hot water! </p>
<p>Chrysler Corporation is adding a new car to its line to honor Bill Clinton.<br /> The Dodge Drafter will begin production in Canada this year. </p>
<p>When Clinton was asked what he thought about foreign affairs, he replied: ""I<br /> don't know, I never had one."" </p>
<p>If you came across Bill Clinton struggling in a raging river and you had a<br /> choice between rescuing him or getting a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph, what<br /> shutter speed would you use?<br /> Chelsea asked her dad, ""Do all fairy tales begin with once upon a time?""<br /> Bill Clinton replied, ""No, some begin with 'After I'm elected'."" </p>
<p>Clinton's mother prayed fervently that Bill would grow up and be president. So<br /> far, half of her prayer has been answered. </p>
<p>American Indians have nicknamed Bill Clinton as ""Walking Eagle"" because he is<br /> so full of crap he can't fly. </p>
<p>Clinton only lacks three things to become one of America's finest leaders:<br /> integrity, vision, and wisdom. </p>
<p>Clinton is doing the work of three men: Larry, Curly, and Moe. </p>
<p>Revised judicial oath: ""I solemnly swear to tell the truth as I know it, the<br /> whole truth as I believe it to be, and nothing but what I think you need to<br /> know."" </p>
<p>Politicians and diapers have one thing in common. They should both be changed<br /> regularly, and for the same reason!</p>

32994,"<p>Saddam Hussein and Bill Clinton meet up in Baghdad for the first round of talks in a new peace process. When Bill sits down, he notices three buttons on the side of Saddam's chair. They begin talking. After about five minutes Saddam presses the first button. A boxing glove springs out of a box on the desk and punches Clinton in the face. Confused, Clinton carries on talking as Saddam laughs. A few minutes later the second button is pressed. This time a big boot comes out and kicks Clinton in the shin. Again Saddam laughs, and again Clinton carries on talking, not wanting to put off the bigger issue of peace between the two countries. But when the third button is pressed and another boot comes out and kicks Clinton in the privates, he's finally had enough, knowing that he can't do much without them functioning well. ""I'm going back home!"" he tells the Iraqi. ""We'll finish these talks in two weeks!"" A fortnight passes and Saddam flies to the United States for talks. As the two men sit down, Hussein notices three buttons on Clinton's chair and prepares himself for the Yank's revenge. They begin talking and Bill presses the first button. Saddam ducks, but nothing happens. Clinton snickers. A few seconds later he presses the second button. Saddam jumps up, but again nothing happens. Clinton roars with laughter. When the third button is pressed, Saddam jumps up again, and again nothing happens. Clinton falls on the floor in a fit of hysterics.""Forget this,"" says Saddam. ""I'm going back to Baghdad!""Clinton says through tears of laughter, ""What Baghdad?""</p>
