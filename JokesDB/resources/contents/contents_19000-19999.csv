19012,"<p>A magician was working on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. The<br /> audience would be different each week, so the magician allowed<br /> himself to do the same tricks over and over again. There was<br /> only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week<br /> and began to understand how the magician did every trick. </p>
<p>Once he understood, he started shouting in the middle of the<br /> show:<br /> ""Look, it's not the same hat""<br /> ""Look, he is hiding the flowers under the table""<br /> ""Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of Spades?""</p>
<p>The magician was furious but couldn't do anything; it was, after<br /> all, the captain's parrot. One day the ship had an accident and<br /> sank. The magician found himself on a piece of wood in the<br /> middle of the ocean with the parrot, of course. They stared at<br /> each other with contempt, but did not utter a word. This went on<br /> for a days. After a week the parrot said: ""OK, I give up. You<br /> got me on this one ... where's the boat?""</p>

Worse still, there were no other rooms<br /> available, so they had to make do with what had befallen.</p>
<p>That night, the old G.P. flung the windows wide for some fresh (but cold) air<br /> and climbed into bed. After a short while, the nurse announced she was cold, and<br /> would he please close the windows.</p>

19029,"<p>No nursing home for me. I am checking into the Holiday Inn! </p>
<p>With the average cost for a nursing home per day reaching $188.00, there is a better way when we get old &amp; feeble. I have already checked on reservations at the Holiday Inn. For a combined long term stay discount and senior discount, it's $49.23 per night. </p>
<p>That leaves $138.77 a day for: </p>
<p>Breakfast, lunch and dinner in any restaurant I want, or room service. </p>
<p>Laundry, movies, swimming pool, a workout room, a lounge, washer,  free toothpaste, razors, shampoo and soap. They treat you like a customer, not a patient. </p>
<p>$5 worth of tips a day will have the entire staff scrambling to help you. </p>
<p>There is a city bus stop out front, and seniors ride free. The handicap bus will also pick you up (if you fake a decent limp). </p>
<p>For a change of scenery, take the airport shuttle bus and eat at one of the nice restaurants there. </p>
<p>It takes months to get into decent nursing homes. Holiday Inn will take your reservation today. And you are not stuck in one place forever, you can move from Inn to Inn, or even from city to city. Want to see Hawaii? They have a Holiday Inn too. </p>
<p>TV broken? Light bulbs need changing? Need a mattress replaced? No problem. They fix everything. </p>
<p>The Inn has a night security person and daily room service. The maid checks to see if you are ok. If not, they will call the undertaker or an ambulance. </p>
<p>If you fall and break a hip, Medicare will pay for the hip, and Holiday Inn will upgrade you to a suite for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>And no worries about visits from family. They will always be glad to find you, and probably check in for a few days mini-vacation. The grandkids can use the pool. What more can you ask for? </p>
<p>So, when I reach the golden age I'll face it with a grin. Just forward all my email to: me@Holiday.Inn</p>

When the ride was finished,  Joe asked Rose what she wanted to do next.""Get weighed,"" she  said. So they went back to the man with the scale, who of course  guessed Rose's weight correctly.Leaving without a prize, they went for a ride on the  merry-go-round.

19040,"<p>The story behind this joke:... There's this nutball who digs things out his back yard and sends the stuff he finds to the Smithsonian Institute, labeling them with scientific names, insisting that they are actual archeological finds. The really weird thing about these letters is that this guy really exists and does this in his spare time!</p>
<p>Paleoanthropology Division<br /> Smithsonian Institute<br /> 207 Pennsylvania Avenue<br /> Washington, DC 20078</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Thank you for your latest submission to the Institute, labeled ""211-D, layer seven, next to the clothesline post. Hominid skull.""</p>
<p>We have given this specimen a careful and detailed examination, and regret to inform you that we disagree with your theory that it represents ""conclusive proof of the presence of Early Man in Charleston County two million years ago. ""Rather, it appears that what you have found is the head of a Barbie doll, of the variety one of our staff, who has small children, believes to be the ""Malibu Barbie"".</p>
<p>It is evident that you have given a great deal of thought to the analysis of this specimen, and you may be quite certain that those of us who are familiar with your prior work in the field were loathe to come to contradiction with your findings. However, we do feel that there are a number of physical attributes of the specimen which might have tipped you off to it's modern origin:</p>
<p>1. The material is molded plastic. Ancient hominid remains are typically fossilized bone.</p>
<p>2. The cranial capacity of the specimen is approximately 9 cubic centimeters, well below the threshold of even the earliest identified proto-hominids.</p>
<p>3. The dentition pattern evident on the ""skull"" is more consistent with the common domesticated dog than it is with the ""ravenous man-eating Pliocene clams"" you speculate roamed the wetlands during that time. This latter finding is certainly one of the most intriguing hypotheses you have submitted in your history with this institution, but the evidence seems to weigh rather heavily against it. Without going into too much detail, let us say that:</p>
<p>A. The specimen looks like the head of a Barbie doll that a dog has chewed on.<br /> B. Clams don't have teeth.</p>
<p>It is with feelings tinged with melancholy that we must deny your request to have the specimen carbon dated. This is partially due to the heavy load our lab must bear in it's normal operation, and partly due to carbon dating's notorious inaccuracy in fossils of recent geologic record. To the best of our knowledge, no Barbie dolls were produced prior to 1956 AD, and carbon dating is likely to produce wildly inaccurate results. Sadly, we must also deny your request that we approach the National Science Foundation's Phylogeny Department with the concept of assigning your specimen the scientific name ""Australopithecus spiff-arino."" Speaking personally, I, for one, fought tenaciously for the acceptance of your proposed taxonomy, but was ultimately voted down because the species name you selected was hyphenated, and didn't really sound like it might be Latin.</p>
<p>However, we gladly accept your generous donation of this fascinating specimen to the museum. While it is undoubtedly not a hominid fossil, it is, nonetheless, yet another riveting example of the great body of work you seem to accumulate here so effortlessly. You should know that our Director has reserved a special shelf in his own office for the display of the specimens you have previously submitted to the Institution, and the entire staff speculates daily on what you will happen upon next in your digs at the site you have discovered in your back yard. We eagerly anticipate your trip to our nation's capital that you proposed in your last letter, and several of us are pressing the Director to pay for it. We are particularly interested in hearing you expand on your theories surrounding the ""trans-positating fillifitation of ferrous ions in a structural matrix"" that makes the excellent juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex femur you recently discovered take on the deceptive appearance of a rusty 9-mm Sears Craftsman automotive crescent wrench.</p>
<p>Yours in Science,</p>

<p>""No silly! First I put the gun to my chest and I thought, I just paid $6,000<br /> for these boobs. Then I put it in my mouth and thought, I just paid $3,000 to<br /> get my teeth straightened.

Recently General Motors<br /> addressed this comment by releasing the statement:</p>
<p>""Yes, but would you want your car to crash twice a day?""</p>
<p>1. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a<br /> new car.</p>
<p>2. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you<br /> would just accept this, restart and drive on.</p>
<p>3. Occasionally, executing a maneuver would cause your car to stop and<br /> fail and you would have to re-install the engine. For some strange reason,<br /> you would accept this too.</p>
<p>4. You could only have one person in the car at a time, unless you bought<br /> ""Car95"" or ""CarNT"". But, then you would have to buy more seats.</p>
<p>5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,<br /> five times as fast, twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five<br /> percent of the roads.</p>
<p>6. The Macintosh car owners would get expensive Microsoft upgrades to<br /> their cars, which would make their cars run much slower.</p>
<p>7. The oil, gas and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a<br /> single ""general car default"" warning light.</p>
<p>8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt.</p>
<p>9. The airbag system would say ""are you sure?"" before going off.</p>
<p>10. If you were involved in a crash, you would have no idea what happened.</p>

""Thomas, you never had these kind of problems, what can I do to<br /> rally people behind me?"" Again a voice from above answers, ""WELFARE, IT'S NOT<br /> WORKING, ABOLISH IT, START OVER.""<br /> After hearing this Clinton is so excited he is planning to go to all the<br /> historic sites for guidance.  Next he goes to the Lincoln Memorial for guidance<br /> from the President who met his untimely death after winning the Civil War and<br /> keeping the country unified.

So they walk<br /> through a court yard full of clocks. A lot of clocks. ""What�s with all the<br /> clocks?"" asked the man. ""These are the clocks of all the people in the world.<br /> Every time they lie, it jumps one minute in the future of their life. Here, let<br /> me show you."" Peter moves over to a clock. ""This is Jack, a car salesman, any<br /> moment, his clock will jump."" Sure enough, about 3 seconds later it moved a<br /> minute forward. So they keep walking, and the man is seeing all his friend and<br /> family's clocks. He gets to his house and asks Peter, ""Where is President<br /> Clinton's Clock?"" ""Didn't you see it? Look up. We use it as a ceiling fan!""</p>

19053,"<p>A rabbi and a priest get into a car accident and it's a bad one. Both cars are totally demolished, but, amazingly, neither of the clerics is hurt. After they crawl out of their cars, the rabbi sees the priest's collar and says, ""So you're a priest. I'm a rabbi. Just look at our cars. There's nothing left, but we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God. God must have meant that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace the rest of our days.""The priest replies, ""I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God.""The rabbi continues, ""And look at this. Here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of Mogen David wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune."" Then he hands the bottle to the priest. The priest agrees, takes a few big swigs, and hands the bottle back to the rabbi. The rabbi takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap on, and hands it back to the priest. The priest asks, ""Aren't you having any?"" The rabbi replies, ""No...I think I'll wait for the police.""</p>

19067,"<p>There was a fly buzzing around a barn one day when he came across a pile of fresh cow manure. Due to the fact that it had been hours since his last meal, he flew down and began to eat.</p>
<p>He ate and ate and ate. Finally, he decided he had eaten enough and tried to fly away. He had eaten too much though and could not get off the ground.</p>
<p>As he looked around wondering what to do, he spotted a pitchfork leaning up against the wall. He climbed to the top of the handle and jumped off, thinking that once he got airborne, he would be able to take flight.</p>
<p>Unfortunately he was wrong, and dropped like a rock, splatting when he hit the floor. Dead.</p>

19087,"<p>An elderly gentleman, quite well to do, realized that his life<br /> was turning down the final stretch, so he summoned the three<br /> friends that he trusted the most for some advice. one was a<br /> doctor, one a priest,and one an attorney.</p>
<p>""I've been thinking lately,"" he said to them, ""that perhaps<br /> there is something to the ancient Egyptian belief that when we<br /> die, we take some things with us to the next world. So, I'm<br /> giving each of you an envelope with $1 million in it. At my<br /> funeral, I ask each of you to slip it into my casket so that I<br /> can use it on my journey to the next world."" The three agreed.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, he was dead. At the funeral, each of the<br /> three went up to the casket, and each placed an envelope into<br /> the casket. Afterwards, the three were talking, and the doctor<br /> couldn't keep it in any longer. ""I have a confession,"" he said.<br /> ""This year has been quite bad for the clinic. My cat scan<br /> machine broke, and I had to scrape to replace it. I took $80,000<br /> out of the envelope to pay for it."" As the other two cringed,<br /> the priest then added, ""I must confess, too. The poor have been<br /> especially bad this year, and to provide them with food, I took<br /> $120,000 out and used it to feed and clothe them.""</p>

19091,"<p>Butterball Turkey Talk-Line... </p>
<p>Over the years, the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line staff have had their share of memorable calls -- inquiries that stand out from the crowd because they're heartwarming or amusing. We asked some of the veteran staff members to tell us their favorites plus, we rounded up a bunch of our own personal favorites from the Talk-Line archives. Its hard to beat the call from a trucker who planned to cook his Thanksgiving turkey on the engine of his truck (''Will it cook faster if I drive faster?''), but some of these come pretty close. Warning: do not attempt to adjust your screen -- these are real incidents, true stories -- from the front lines! </p>
<p>Home alone, a Kentucky woman was in the doghouse when she called the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line. While preparing the turkey, her Chihuahua jumped into the bird's body cavity and couldn't get out. She tried pulling the dog and shaking the bird, but nothing worked. She and the dog became more and more distraught. After calming the woman down, the Talk-Line home economist suggested carefully cutting the opening in the cavity of the turkey wider. It worked and Fido was freed! </p>
<p>Birdie, eagle and turkey? Roasting a turkey doesn't have to interfere with the daily routine, so said a retired Floridian. He called ''Turkey Central'' for turkey grilling tips while waiting to tee off from the 14th hole. </p>
<p>Taking turkey preparation an extra step, a Virginian wondered, ''How do you thaw a fresh turkey?'' The Talk-Line staffer explained that fresh turkeys aren't frozen and don't need to be thawed. </p>
<p>Don't wait until the last minute! On Thanksgiving Day, a Georgian woman took the ''Be prepared'' motto to heart. She had just agreed to host Thanksgiving Dinner and called the Talk-Line a year ahead of time for turkey tips. </p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving, President Clinton! A Southern woman called to comment, ''On Thanksgiving Day, the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line is more important than the President. He can take the day off, but the Talk-Line staff can't.'' (The Butterball Turkey Talk-Line is open Thanksgiving Day, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Central Standard Time.) </p>
<p>Thanksgiving Dinner on the run. A woman called 1-800-323-4848 to find out how long it would take to roast her turkey. To answer the question, the Talk-Line home economist asked how much the bird weighed. The woman responded, ''I don't know, it's still running around outside.'' </p>
<p>Tofu turkey? No matter how you slice it, Thanksgiving just isn't Thanksgiving without turkey. A restaurant owner in California wanted to know how to roast a turkey for a vegetarian menu. </p>
<p>White meat, anyone? A West Coast woman took turkey preparation to extremes by scrubbing her bird with bleach. Afterward, she called the Talk-Line to find out how to clean off the bleach. To her dismay, she was advised to dispose of the turkey. </p>
<p>A young girl called on behalf of her mother who needed roasting advice. To provide approximate roasting tim</p>

19107,"<p>The ambassador of a small African nation chanced to visit Russia, and was entertained by his opposite number, the Russian ambassador. </p>
<p>For three days, the African ambassador was wined, dined, and generally treated to the best hospitality that Russia had to offer.</p>
<p>On the final day of his visit, the Russian ambassador said, ""As your stay is coming to an end, it is time for you to play our traditional game, Russian roulette."" </p>
<p>""One of the six chambers of this gun is loaded - you spin the cylinder, point the gun at your head, and pull the trigger.""</p>
<p>This phased the African slightly, but he was a proud man of a warrior people, and to show fear would be unthinkable. Both men took their guns, spun, and pulled the triggers.</p>
<p>Both chambers were empty, and both ambassadors breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The African ambassador was much impressed with the couragous game, and thought hard about the subject before the Russian Ambassador was due to visit his country the next year.</p>
<p>When the visit came, the African ambassador treated the Russian with all hospitality, until the final day of his stay. </p>
<p>Leading him to a private room in the palace, the African ambassador spoke, ""Now it is time for you to sample our game, African roulette"". </p>
<p>So saying, he led the Russian into the room, the only occupants of which were six beautiful, naked women.</p>
<p>The African ambassador said, ""These women are the most beautiful members of one of our tribes. Any one of them will give you a oral sex - take your pick"".</p>
<p>The Russian was not entirely averse to this idea, but he couldn't see the connection with Russian Roulette. He said, ""Well, ok, great, but where's the roulette part? Where's the danger?""</p>

19121,"<p>Jack and his friends were playing golf one Saturday. As they are getting ready<br /> to tee off, a guy walks up and asks if he can join them. The friends look at<br /> each other, look at the guy and say, 'Sure.' About two holes into the game, the<br /> friends get curious about what the guy does for a living. So they ask him. The<br /> stranger tells them he's a hitman. They all laugh. The guy says, 'No really, I<br /> am a hitman. My gun is in my golf bag. I carry it everywhere. You can take a<br /> look at it if you like.' So Jack decides to check it out. He opens the bag and,<br /> sure enough, there is a rifle with a huge scope attached. Jack gets all excited<br /> and says, 'WOW! I bet I can see my house through here! May I look?' The hit man<br /> replies, 'Sure.' So Jack looks and says, 'YEAH! You can see my house! I can even<br /> see through the windows into my bedroom. There's my wife. Wait, there's my next<br /> door neighbor! And he's naked too!' This really upsets Jack so he asks how much<br /> it would be for a hit. The hitman replies, 'I get $1000 every time I pull the<br /> trigger.' Jack responds, '$1000? Well, OK, I want two hits. I want you to shoot<br /> my wife right in the mouth. She's always nagging at me and I can't stand it.<br /> Second, I want you to shoot my neighbor in the penis, just for screwing around<br /> with my wife.' The hit man agrees, gears up and looks through the scope. He's<br /> looking for about five minutes until finally Jack starts to get really impatient<br /> and asks, 'What are you waiting for? The hitman replies, 'Relax..... I'm about<br /> to save you a thousand bucks!'</p>

<p>Tom was curious so he walked up to the man who's crying and<br /> asked, ""Who died?"" The man replied, ""My wife."" Tom asked, ""Oh,<br /> how sad. How did she die?"" ""My...my dog ate...ate her alive.""<br /> Tom thought for a minute, decided the dog was big enough and<br /> looked like he can hold a big meal so he asked, ""Can I borrow<br /> your dog?""

19171,"<p>A man is waiting for wife to give birth. The doctor comes in and informs the dad that his son was born without torso, arms or legs. The son is just a head! But the dad loves his son and raises him as well as he can, with love and compassion. After 21 years, the son is old enough for his first drink. Dad takes him to the bar and tearfully tells the son he is proud of him. Dad orders up the biggest, strongest drink for his boy. With all the bar patrons looking on curiously and the bartender shaking his head in disbelief, the boy takes his first sip of alcohol. Swoooop! A torso pops out! The bar is dead silent; then bursts into a whoop of joy. The father, shocked, begs his son to drink again. The patrons chant ""Take another drink""! The bartender still shakes his head in dismay. Swoooop! Two arms pops out. The bar goes wild. The father, crying and wailing, begs his son to drink again. The patrons chant, ""Take another drink""! The bartender ignores the whole affair. By now the boy is getting tipsy, and with his new hands he reaches down, grabs his drink and guzzles the last of it. Swoooop! Two legs pop out. The bar is in chaos. The father falls to his knees and tearfully thanks God. The boy stands up on his new legs and stumbles to the left.... then to the right.... right through the front door, into the street, where a truck runs over him and kills him instantly. The bar falls silent. The father moans in grief. The bartender sighs and says, ""That boy should have quit while he was a head.""</p>

As he reaches down to smack the dog, he notices a note and a ten dollar bill in the basket.The scribble on the note asks for three pounds of his best mince [ground beef].  The butcher figures this is too easy.  He goes to the window and reaches for the dried up stuff that's been sitting out all day.The dog growls at him.  The butcher turns around and, glaring at the pup, gets the best mince from the fridge.  Weighing out about 2 1/2 pounds, he drops in on the scale with his thumb.""Hmmmmm, a bit shy.  Who'll know?""Again, the dog growls menacingly.  ""Alright, alright,"" as he throws on a generous half pound.  He wraps it out, drops it in the basket, and drops in change from a five.  The dog threatens to chew him off at the ankles.  Another five goes in the basket.The butcher is quite impressed and decides to follow the piddy pup home.  The dog quickly enters a high-rise buildings, pushes the lift button, enters the lift, and then pushes the button for the 12th floor.  The dog walks down the corridor and smartly bangs the basket on the door. The door opens, and the dog's owner screams at the dog.""Hey, what are you doing? That's a really smart dog you've got there,"" comments the butcher.""He's a stupid dog--that's the third time this week he's forgotten his key.</p>

"
19197,"<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>I have just received your letter in regards to the bill I owe you. You said the bill should have been paid long ago and you don't understand why it wasn't. Well, I will enlighten you.</p>
<p>In 1957 I bought a sawmill on credit. In 1959 I bought an ox team, a timber cart and two ponies; a shotgun, a wine tester, a Colt revolver and five razorback hogs all on credit.</p>
<p>In 1960 the sawmill burned down. One of my ponies died and the other I loaned to a son-of-a-bitch who starved him to death. In 1961 my father died and my mother was hung for horse rustling. A mechanic named Joe knocked up my daughter and I had to pay the doctor $88.32 to keep the bastard from becoming a relative of mine.</p>
<p>In 1963 my son had the mumps and they went down on him; the doctor had to castrate him to save his life. That summer I went fishing and the boat turned over and I lost the biggest catfish you ever saw, and one of my sons drowned (not the castrated one).</p>
<p>In 1966 my wife ran away with another feller and left me with the three small children as a souvenir. I married the hired girl to keep down expenses, but I had trouble getting her off, and the doctor told me to try to create some excitement just as she was beginning to get aroused. That night I pointed the shotgun out the window while we were in bed and just as she was beginning to orgasm I pulled the trigger. Well, she shit the bed, I ruptured myself and killed the best damn milk cow I ever had.</p>
<p>The next year my troubles really started. My wife caught the clap from the ice man, my son wiped his ass with a corn cob with poison ivy on it, and someone de-nutted my best bull.</p>
<p>In 1970 I decided to go into another business on my own. I ordered six bee hives from Sears, Roebuck, and Company. I bought a swarm of bees and a queen bee all on credit on the installment plan. The queen bee died and I ordered another one. She turned out to be a whore and started running around with a horsefly. The honey tasted like shit so I couldn't sell it.</p>
<p>So now, gentlemen, you say if I do not pay you, you will cause me trouble. Right now if it costs two cents to shit, I'd have to puke. Getting money out of me would be like trying to poke butter up a wildcat's ass with a hot trowel, but you are welcome to try.</p>
<p>Yours for more credit,</p>
<p>Max</p>

<p>The blonde was trying to be friendly, so she smiled her biggest smile and said as sweetly as possibly, ""T-G-I-F"" another time. </p>

19218,"<p>Tigers really are as big and poofy and soft as they look, and they purr like a<br /> freight train going by. You find this out by taking one for a walk. To take a<br /> tiger for a walk, you first need a tiger. Tigers fresh from the bush are not<br /> recommended for the inexperienced. What you need is one who's used to the<br /> procedure. He or she is thus liable to be merely playful, rather than actively<br /> irritated. You also need a friend, whom you really, really trust. The friend<br /> carries an apple wood cane; apple, or some other wood, which will bend under<br /> stress rather than shattering. This, friend, is your backup, and the cane is his<br /> or her only tool for everything, from knocking stuff out of the way that the<br /> tiger is liable to eat, to crowd control, to hooking on and madly hanging on if<br /> things go wrong.</p>
<p>What YOU carry is a ten-foot length of pass-link chain. This is your leash.</p>
<p>Pass-link chain is the stuff where the links will fit through each other. This<br /> is important. You need this so you can hook on a safety clip. The chain is<br /> looped about the tiger's neck and acks as a giant choke chain, but the clip is<br /> there to keep a loop of some sort in case things go badly wrong. You carry the<br /> chain looped in one hand in a peculiar fashion, which permits the whole length<br /> of chain to be dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with<br /> it. You practice this beforehand till you're sure you've got it right.</p>
<p>Then you go into the cage with the tiger. Your friend does not. You gauge the<br /> tiger's mood and put the leash on the tiger. There isn't a whole lot more to say<br /> about this step except to say that that is why your friend is there, outside the<br /> cage. On your side is the fact that the tiger knows what the leash is for by<br /> this time and presumably is largely in favor of the idea.</p>
<p>This is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy. They are also much,<br /> much larger than you had ever dreamed, when you're standing next to one.</p>
<p>Then you take the tiger for a walk. Your friend walks in front with the cane<br /> to clear the way. You walk with the tiger at your side, keeping pretty good<br /> control and letting the tiger know that you are Paying Attention, because if the<br /> tiger thinks you are not Paying Attention, it will do what housecats do, let you<br /> know that you should be Paying Attention. Unlike housecats, the tiger is big<br /> enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the situation.<br /> Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your legs out from under you<br /> is generally considered good enough by most tigers. They think this is<br /> hilarious. To this extent, tigers differ from housecats in that they seem to<br /> have a sense of humor.</p>
<p>It is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants. In this case,<br /> the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to stop it. Wrapping the<br /> chain around something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away, generally<br /> does this. This will slow it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you<br /> and grab the chain as you go bulleting across the countryside. The weight of two<br /> adult humans will generally slow a tiger down enough to make things manageable,<br /> whereas one will not.</p>
<p>It is not usual for the tiger to react to freedom by turning around and<br /> turning you into fajitas, though this would actually (at least in the short<br /> term) be an eminently practical thing for the tiger to do. They enjoy their fun<br /> but are generally not ill tempered. If they are they don't get taken for walks.</p>
<p>They also purr like a freight train passing. Experts in the field claim that<br /> this is not purring, that it means something else, but you couldn't put it by<br /> me. Sure sounded like purring, at 16-2/3 RPM, but it sounded like purring.</p>
<p>All in all, an experience I highly recommend as a lifetime source of cocktail<br /> party conversation, but it sort of tends to leave you limp for the rest of the<br /> day.</p>

"
19239,"<p>Looking for savings this holiday season? When you're out shopping, take<br /> advantage of the George W. Bush discount. You will need unmitigated gall and<br /> several accomplices. Here's how it works. </p>
<p>Load up with all sorts of items that you want and take them to the checkout.<br /> When the clerk gets to an item that will not scan on the first attempt say,<br /> petulantly, ""My brother says that all these items are mine."" The clerk will<br /> insist on rescanning the item. Look bored and incredulous that anybody could be<br /> so incompetent as the clerk tries unsuccessfully to scan the item. Turn to the<br /> people in line behind you and say, ""Can you believe this is taking so long?"" </p>
<p>At this point, the clerk will attempt to enter the bar code information by<br /> hand. Insist loudly that the item is yours and that since it didn't scan after<br /> two attempts, it must be free. Get so worked up that your face starts to break<br /> out. The clerk will still attempt to enter the bar code. At this point, bring<br /> forward your first accomplice who will introduce herself as the Secretary of Bar<br /> Code Scanning and say to the clerk, ""I'll give you two seconds to enter that bar<br /> code. Ready... Set... Times up!"" </p>
<p>The clerk will probably call for the manager, and the two of them will insist<br /> on manually entering the bar code into the cash register. Have dozens of your<br /> accomplices run to the media talking about possible mistakes and mischief that<br /> could arise from manually entering the bar code. Raise questions such as, ""How<br /> can I make sure the price is being entered fairly when the clerk works for the<br /> owner?"" Say, ""These items have been scanned and rescanned. They just want to<br /> keep entering bar codes until they get the total they want."" </p>
<p>At this point, the owner might try to take you to court to get some more time<br /> to manually enter the bar code. He's really playing right into your hands. </p>
<p>While he's getting a time extension from the court, call the office of<br /> Congressman Tom DELAY and ask him to send down a couple of henchmen to lead a<br /> crowd of angry demonstrators into the store to shout and bang on the doors. </p>
<p>Simultaneously, file an appeal with the Supreme Court asking the highest court<br /> in the land to bring a halt to all manual entry of bar codes. </p>
<p>In the midst of this confusion, have your first accomplice declare that all<br /> the items are legally yours and that if the owner doesn't like it, he can take<br /> you to court. The owner will now have to drive to the state capital to file a<br /> lawsuit in which he will ask the judge to manually enter the bar code of the<br /> item that would not scan. Invite some celebrities over for a photo op and<br /> announce that you'll share the items with them once the items are found to be<br /> rightfully yours. </p>
<p>Meanwhile in court, the owner will ask the judge to transfer the item from the<br /> checkout line to the courtroom. Have your lawyer tell the judge that that is<br /> simply not enough, that the judge needs to move the entire inventory from the<br /> store lock, stock and barrel to his courtroom. </p>
<p>When the owner contemplates that this will tie up all his merchandise till<br /> well after the holidays, he will surely give up. But just to be safe, have the<br /> legislature pass a law giving the entire store to you. </p>
<p>Some people will tell you that you won't enjoy the goodies you've thus<br /> obtained because they are not really yours.</p>

19281,"<p>En un matrimonio, el hombre se quejaba ante su mujer de c�mo Dios deber�a ser m�s equitativo en los roles adjudicados a la pareja.</p>
<p>""�Dios m�o, ten compasi�n de m�, mira c�mo trabajo tanto, en cambio mi mujer tan tranquila en la casa! Yo dar�a cualquier cosa para que hicieras un milagro y convirtieras a mi mujer en m� y yo en mi mujer, para que ella aprenda como es la vida de un hombre.</p>
<p>El Creador, en su infinita misericordia, le concedi� el milagro. El primer d�a en la ma�ana corre a levantar los muchachos para que se alisten, a la vez que en la cocina estaba preparando el desayuno para todos, con el que prepar� las loncheras, no sin antes haber colocado una ropa en la lavadora y sacar de la nevera lo del almuerzo. Por un lado, termin� esta tarea y se subi� en el carro a llevarlos al colegio; de regreso pas� a surtir de gasolina al carro e ir al banco a cambiarle un cheque al marido.</p>
<p>Al salir de all� pudo notar que las horas hab�an transcurrido a velocidad luz, por lo que corri� velozmente de nuevo a recoger los hijos al colegio; con la misma lleg� a la casa para preparar el almuerzo, apurada, para cuando llegaran todos no encontraran retraso en el mismo. Despu�s de �ste, tuvo que lavar los platos y tender la ropa antes de ir a pagar la luz, el agua y el tel�fono donde hab�a unas enormes colas a morir, lo que le hizo regresar a las 6:30. Quiso relajarse un poco viendo TV, pero hab�a que preparar la cena y planchar una ropita que estaba pendiente y ayudar a los muchachos con la tarea de la escuela.</p>
<p>Por fin, lleg� la hora del descanso y a dormir, cosa que no pudo lograr tan r�pidamente por que all� estaba el marido esper�ndola para que cumpliera tambi�n con sus deberes de mujer en la cama. Al d�a siguiente volvi� a clamar a Dios:</p>
<p>""�Se�or m�o, realmente esto es agotador, te ruego me devuelvas a mi condici�n normal, por favor!""</p>

<p>How Do You Decide Who To Marry?</p>
<p>You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should keep the chips and dip coming.<br /> - Alan, age 10</p>
<p>No person really decides before they grow up who they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out later who you're stuck with.<br /> - Kirsten, age 10</p>
<p>What is the Right Age To Get Married?</p>
<p>Twenty-three is the best age because you know the person FOREVER by then.<br /> - Camille, age 10</p>
<p>No age is good to get married at. You got to be a fool to get married.<br /> - Freddie, age 6</p>
<p>How Can A Stranger Tell If Two People Are Married?</p>
<p>You might have to guess, based on whether they seem to be yelling at the same kids.<br /> - Derrick, age 8</p>
<p>What Do Your Think Your Mom and Dad Have In Common?</p>
<p>Both don't want any more kids.<br /> - Lori, age 8</p>
<p>What Do Most People Do On A Date?</p>
<p>Dates are for having fun, and people should use them to get to know each other. Even boys have something to say if you listen long enough.<br /> - Lynnette, age 8</p>
<p>On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date.<br /> - Martin, age 10</p>
<p>What Would You Do On A First Date That Was Turning Sour?</p>
<p>I'd run home and play dead. The next day I would call all the newspapers and make sure they wrote about me in all the dead columns.<br /> - Craig, age 9</p>
<p>When Is It Okay To Kiss Someone?</p>
<p>When they're rich.<br /> - Pam, age 7</p>
<p>The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't want to mess with that.<br /> - Curt, age 7</p>

<p>Is It Better To Be Single or Married?</p>
<p>It's better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need someone to clean up after them.<br /> - Anita, age 9</p>
<p>How Would The World Be Different If People Didn't Get Married?</p>
<p>There sure would be a lot of kids to explain, wouldn't there?<br /> - Kelvin, age 8</p>

On the same day the following week he is back and does the same thing with the three beers. This goes on for a month or two. The bartender is getting curious. The next time the man comes in, the bartender says, ""I don't mean to be nosy, but why do you drink from three beers at one time?""The man says, ""When my two brothers and I lived close, we would go to the bar every week and have a beer together. Now we are all married and have moved far away. We all agreed that wherever we are, every week, we will each go to a local bar and have three beers to remember old times.""The bartender nods and goes on. The man finishes his three beers and leaves. A month later the man comes in and orders only two beers. He takes a drink from one... sets it down. Takes a drink from the second beer... sets it down, and repeats this process until the two beers are gone. This goes on for about a month and the bartender gets curious. The next time the man is in the bar, the bartender inquires, ""I don't mean to be nosy, but what happened? Did one of your brothers pass away or something?""The man says, ""Oh, no, nothing like that. It's just that my wife said that I couldn't go to the bar and drink anymore... but she didn't say anything about my brothers.""</p>

<p>Finally, the family decided that maybe if she saw the statistics she'd be<br /> convinced. So they sent her to a friend of the family who was an actuary. </p>
<p>""Tell me,"" she said suspiciously, ""what are the chances that someone will have<br /> a bomb on a plane?"" </p>
<p>The actuary looked through his tables and said, ""A very small chance. Maybe<br /> one in five hundred thousand."" </p>

<p><em>Dear Mr. Dvorak: </em></p>
<p><em>Ann Landers wouldn't print this. I have nowhere else to turn. I have to get the word out. Warn other parents. I must be rambling on. Let me try and explain. It's about my son, Billy. He's always been a good, normal ten year old boy. Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to select a summer camp for Billy. We sorted through the camp brochures. There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the campfire you know. There were sports camps and specialty camps for weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in Tibetan knot tying. I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo. It's where he went last year. (He made an adorable picture out of painted pinto beans and macaroni). Billy would have none of it. Billy pulled a brochure out of his pocket. It was for a COMPUTER CAMP. We should have put our foot down right there, if only we had known. He left three weeks ago. I don't know what's happened. He's changed. I can't explain it. See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy's letters.</em></p>
<p>Dear Mom, </p>
<p>The kids are dorky nerds. The food stinks. The computers are the only good part. We're learning how to program. Late at night is the best time to program, so they let us stay up. </p>
<p>Love, </p>
<p>Billy. </p>
<p>Dear Mom, </p>
<p>Camp is O.K. Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night. We all get to choose what we want to drink. I drink Classic Coke. By the way, can you make Szechwan food? I'm getting used to it now. Gotta go, it's time for the flowchart class. </p>
<p>Love, </p>
<p>Billy. </p>
<p>P.S. This is written on a word processor. Pretty swell, huh? It's spell checked too. </p>
<p>Dear Mom, </p>
<p>Don't worry. We do regular camp stuff. We told ghost stories by the glow of the green computer screens. It was real neat. I don't have much of a tan 'cause we don't go outside very often. You can't see the computer screen in the sunlight anyway. That wimp camp I went to last year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I'm okay, really. </p>
<p>Love, </p>
<p>Billy. </p>
<p>Dear Mom, </p>
<p>I'm fine. I'm sleeping enough. I'm eating enough. This is the best camp ever. We scared the counselor with some phony worm code. It was real funny. He got mad and yelled. Frederick says it's okay. Can you send more money? I spent mine on a pocket protector and a box of blank diskettes. I've got to chip in on the phone bill. Did you know that you can talk to people on a computer? Give my regards to Dad. </p>
<p>Love, </p>
<p>Billy. </p>
<p>Dear Mother, </p>
<p>Forget the money for the telephone. We've got a way to not pay. Sorry I haven't written. I've been learning a lot. I'm real good at getting onto any computer in the country. It's really easy! I got into the university's in less than fifteen minutes. Frederick did it in five, he's going to show me how. Frederick is my bunk partner. He's really smart. He says that I shouldn't call myself Billy anymore. So, I'm not.</p>
<p>Signed, </p>
<p>William. </p>
<p>Dear Mother, </p>
<p>How nice of you to come up on Parents Day. Why'd you get so upset? I haven't gained that much weight. The glasses aren't real. Everybody wears them. I was trying to fit in. Believe me, the tape on them is cool. I thought that you'd be proud of my program. After all, I've made some money on it. A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, I've paid for the next six weeks of camp. I won't be home until late August. </p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>William. </p>
<p>Mother, </p>
<p>Stop treating me like a child. True -- physically I am only ten years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me. Do not try again. Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, and government computers). I am not kidding. O.K.? I won't write again and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal communication drain me. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>William. </p>
<p>See what I mean? It's been two weeks since I've heard from my little boy. What can I do, Mr. Dvorak? I know that it's probably too late to save my little Billy. But, if by printing these letters you can save JUST ONE ...CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so. </p>
<p>Thank you very much. </p>

19332,"<p>LONDON (AP) -- Saucy? The British? Yes, and keeping well abreast of the latest science, judging by a new exhibition of -- er -- underwear at London's Design Museum. Here, the nation famed for its reserve has raised its hem, offering a peep at sheepskin corsets, barely-there cashmere vests and a glow-in-the-dark bra.Should all the titillation prove too much, there's also a bra that detects a racing heartbeat and a pair of panties that protects against radiation. ``This exhibit is a compelling statement about British design -- but it's also quite saucy,'' said Dame Helena Kennedy, a leading lawyer and chairwoman of the British Council, which launched the show Wednesday.``The perception of British people as being strait-laced is no longer real,'' Kennedy said. To prove it, the displays are almost as provocative as the garments. Vivienne Westwood's blue sheepskin corset and ditzy, star-patterned mini-crinoline and Alexander McQueen's pink satin corset crusted with black Swarovski crystal are suspended inside giant inflatable women's legs in transparent plastic. Vacuum-packed thongs and Clements Ribeiro's red silk chiffon panties with polka dots hang from pegs on a washline. Near the entrance, a mannequin sprawls seductively on her back, a vision in pink fishnet stockings and the briefest green teddy and panties by the aptly named Agent Provocateur.And everywhere there are bras to make even 1950s ``sweater girl'' Lana Turner envious -- from Gossard's new padded Ultrabra Super Boost in patriotic red-white-and-blue, to Stella McCartney's tassels and gray beads, to Agent Provocateur's sliced-away style in sheer black net.For the traditionally minded, there are the more substantial constructions of Rigby and Peller (they put the foundation in foundation garments), suppliers of spine-stiffening unmentionables to the royal family since the 1960s. Owner June Kenton, personal bra fitter to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Mother Elizabeth, believes 80 percent of all women are wearing the wrong size bra ``and have two drawers-full of bras that they don't wear.''Rigby and Peller's offerings contrast with the futuristic Techno Bra, made of conductive textile with silicon gel inserts that contain electronic devices to detect heartbeat changes. A British industrial design company is developing the piece for the commercial market and designer Kirsty Falconer hopes it may one day incorporate a personal alarm that will sound if the wearer is attacked. Constructed in a dun-colored conductive nylon and silver fabric, the anti-radiation panties are no thing of beauty. But if, as their makers claim, they drain electricity from the body -- thereby protecting it from magnetic radiation -- can you afford to be without them? The exhibition runs through July 2, then tours Japan and Australia.</p>

19346,"<p>A preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and having been told that<br /> there was a fortune to be made in horse racing, he decided to purchase a horse<br /> and enter it in the races. At the local auction, however, the going price for a<br /> horse was so steep that he ended up buying a donkey instead. The preacher<br /> decided that he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his<br /> surprise, the donkey came in third.<br /> The next day, the racing sheets carried the following headline: PREACHER'S<br /> ASS SHOWS.<br /> The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in another<br /> race, and this time it won. The headlines blared: PREACHER'S ASS OUT IN FRONT.</p>
<p>The bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the<br /> preacher to not enter the donkey in any more races. The newspaper printed this<br /> headline: BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS.<br /> This was just too much for the bishop, and he ordered the preacher to get rid<br /> of the animal. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a neighboring<br /> village. The next day, the headlines announced: NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN.<br /> The bishop fainted.

19361,"<p>THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMASOn the first day of Christmas, my kitten ruined for me........    A batch of my special hand-print cookies. I had turned my back to grab the cookie sheet sitting on the stove. In that micro-second, Sara climbed onto the table, poked her paw into the delightfully kneady mixture and, suddenly off-balance, fell into the cookie dough. Net loss? Six cups of flour, four cups of sugar, three sticks of butter.... Of course, it would have been cheaper to remove the feline ingredient, pick out the hairs, and just rename the recipe Paw Print Cookies. On the second day of Christmas, my kitten accompanied me........    On a trip to the vet clinic. Who knew that skinny curling ribbon has feline taste appeal? I didn't. Damages: $28 for the office visit, $36 for anesthesia so the veterinarian could take $55 X-rays in case Sara had taste-tested any other Christmas decorations, and a heck of a lot of embarrassment when the vet removed the 3' curly tail in slightly less than two seconds by tugging at it with a pair of tweezers. On the third day of Christmas, my kitten wrecked for me........    13 ornaments on my Christmas tree. My mistake was forgetting to chain the decorations to the branches. My other error was leaving the room to go to the bathroom while Sara feigned sleeping under the tree. How was I to know the was actually measuring its climbing potential? Value of broken bulbs? 7.50 plus tax.    On the fourth day of Christmas, my kitten broke for me........    A statue in my Lenox Nativity. Would you believe two Wise men plus a head? Lenox nativity figurines: $55.99    On the fifth day of Christmas, my kitten scratched for me........    The kid across the street who collects for charity. It was an accident. She merely wanted to reach out and touch someone. Unfortunately, she used a unsheathed claw to do so. I settled out-of-court for the cost of a jacket to replace the boy's blood stained one and a hefty donation to the charity of their choice. Although the amount must remain secret according to our settlement, let me put it this way. You haven't seen many soldiers for the Salvation Army this year, have you? Think: Major Windfall!    On the sixth day of Christmas, my kitten opened for me........    The presents beneath my Christmas tree. It was only two, really. While doing some early shopping at a discount store, I purchased a catnip mouse for Sara's stocking. Apparently, anything in the same bag as catnip takes on its potent aroma for a very long time. Replacement costs: $3.99 for another roll of Christmas wrapping paper, $4.50 for two empty boxes, $1 each for the kind of bows Sara can't unravel.    On the seventh day of Christmas, my kitten lost for me........    The earrings I bought for my sister Mary. Actually, it was one earring but since Mary doesn't have a hole in her nose or navel, a pair of matching earrings does make a more appealing gift. Sale price: $29.95 plus tax.    On the eighth day of Christmas, my kitten helped me........    Replace my E and G guitar strings. Would you believe a kitten could fit into the itty-bitty hole in the middle of my Yamaha guitar? Neither could I, but Sara thought so. And she succeeded once she got those rascally strings out of the way. Unfortunately, her little rear end couldn't get out the way I came in. After paying through the whiskers for her previous escapades, I would have been willing to leave her in the guitar for the duration of the holiday season, except that she chose to get stuck two hours before I was due at the nursing home for our annual Christmas carol sing-a-long. Set of steel guitar strings: $12.95; jar of petroleum jelly: 79 cents.    On the ninth day of Christmas, my kitten destroyed for me........    My Christmas card list when she walked across my computer's delete key. Cost for call to Computer Country's 900/help line: $17.50. And I still don't know what happened to the listings of B through H.    On the tenth day of Christmas, my kitten hid from me........    The remote control from my 13-inch TV. This wouldn't be such a disaster if she hadn't previously stolen the power knob. I missed a week's worth of Christmas specials, including my all-time favorite, 'It's a Wonderful Life.' Rental of 'It's a Wonderful Life': $2; purchase of book, 'Good owners, great cats': $24.95. Unfortunately, it never mentions the psychological profile of kittens with kleptomania.    On the eleventh day of Christmas, my kitten ate for me........    The drumsticks off my 19-pound turkey. OK,OK, So this one time it was my fault. I knew I never should have uttered those now infamous words: 'Your first turkey, Sara. Want to try just a little piece?' Cost: Christmas Dinner.       On the 12th day of Christmas........    Sara rested. And so, thank goodness, did my VISA card.</p>

Then remove it, rewrap it, and place it back with all the others, in such a fashion as you can't tell which one it is.

It was supposed to be effective even in the most addictive of cases, such as yours is!"" answered the doctor.""Well, it kind of worked, doc. At least I was able to transfer my addiction,"" replied the patient.""What is that supposed to mean?"" demanded the doctor.""Well, I don't smoke cigars anymore, but now I can't go to sleep at night unless I have a cigar shoved up my butt.""</p>

After the 8th hole, Amanpreet is ahead by one stroke, but cuts his ball into the rough on the 9th. ''Help me find my ball. Look over there,'' he says to Jon. After a few minutes, neither has any luck. Since a lost ball carries a four point penalty, Amanpreet secretly pulls a ball from his pocket and tosses it to the ground. ''I've found my ball!'' he announces. ''After all of the years we've been partners and playing together,"" Jon says, ""you'd cheat me out of a lousy 50 bucks?'' ''What do you mean, cheat? I found my ball sitting right there!''''And you're a liar, too!'' Jon says. ''I'll have you know I've been STANDING on your ball for the last five minutes!''</p>

A very pretty girl of about 19 served the old man and the reporter, keeping them in fresh tea and running errands for them.</p>
<p>""Are these your grandkids?"" the reporter asked. </p>
<p>""Naw, sir, they all be my younguns,"" the old man replied with a sly grin. </p>

19488,"<p>This joke involves an elephant who is walking through the jungle. And all of a sudden he falls into a pit and is stuck there. The elephant is stuck in this pit and realizes that he is going to die, so naturally he start to scream.</p>
<p>By chance a chicken hears the screaming of the elephant and decides to investigate. He sees the elephant stuck in the pit and shouts to the elephant: ""Don't worry, I am going to save you"".</p>
<p>The chicken then calls on the King of the Jungle. The King of the Jungle promptly arrives in his Red Porsche. He throws a rope from the Porsche into the pit, the elephant ties it around himself and the King of the Jungle pulls him out of the pit. The elephant is saved (loud applause).</p>
<p>So grateful is the elephant to the chicken that he promises him that he will one day do the same for him (if the chicken should ever be in mortal danger). As chance would have it, the next week the elephant is walking thru' the jungle and hears the screaming of a chicken. He wanders over and sees that his friend the chicken is stuck in a pit. (ohh, gosh)</p>
<p>The elephant shouts ""Don't worry chicken I will save you"".</p>
<p>So the elephant throws his tail into the pit. However this tail is too small and the chicken cannot reach it. Undeterred by this, the elephant throws in his trunk, but, alas this also is too small. As a last desperate effort the elephant throws in his his penis. Sucess! The chicken grabs the elephants enormous penis and climbs out to safety.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: ""If you have a big dick you don't need a red Porsche to pull a chick.""</p>

19489,"<p>Last summer, down on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert, an hour east of Bakersfield, a blonde, new to boating was having a problem. No matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't get her brand new 22-ft Bayliner to perform. </p>
<p>It wouldn't get on a plane at all, and it was very sluggish in almost every maneuver, no matter how much power she applied. After about an hour of trying to make it go, she putted over to a nearby marina. Maybe they could tell her what was wrong. </p>
<p>A thorough topside check revealed everything was in perfect working order. The engine ran fine, the outdrive went up and down, the prop was the correct size and pitch. So, one of the marina guys jumped in the water to check underneath. </p>

Don't even know what my duties are yet,<br /> but I hope it's a ""hands on"" position.<br /> *** Entry 2 ***<br /> Dear Diary, You won't believe this! I snuck into the Oval Office when no one<br /> was looking. But then I dropped one of my contacts. So, I got down on my hands<br /> and knees and was looking for it when -- guess what -- the president walked in.<br /> He said, ""You must be the new intern."" That man is psychic! I hope he likes me. </p>
<p>*** Entry 3 ***<br /> Dear Diary, I think the president likes me. Today he dropped his contacts on<br /> the rug and asked me to find them.<br /> *** Entry 4 ***<br /> Dear Diary, He really likes me.<br /> *** Entry 5 ***<br /> Dear Diary, I have been sent to the stupid Pentagon to work. It is such a<br /> drag. Like they're going to put me in charge of heat-seeking missiles or<br /> something. But I still talk to my Bubba-cakes on the phone. He calls me ""1-900<br /> Monica."" (That means he thinks I'm one in nine hundred. That's pretty special.) </p>

She keeps asking me to speak<br /> louder whenever we go out for a quiet dinner.<br /> *** Entry 8 ***<br /> Dear Diary, Oh-oh. The bad news: I've been subpoenaed. The good news is that<br /> Vernon Jordan is my new best friend. I'm going job-hunting with him tomorrow.<br /> *** Entry 9 ***<br /> Dear Diary, I had to give an affidavit in that stupid Paula Jones case. What<br /> is she talking about? There are no distinguishing marks. And, by the way, I am<br /> way cuter than her. She looks like David Brenner in drag.<br /> *** Entry 10 ***<br /> Dear Diary, I've had it. I'm never going to be an intern again. I'm going back<br /> to Hollywood where they pay you for that kind of work.<br /> *** Entry 11 ***<br /> Dear Diary, Finally got home to L.A. and hugged Daddy so hard I thought I<br /> would pop. It's the first time in six months I called a man ""daddy"" that I was<br /> actually related to.<br /> *** Entry 12 ***<br /> Dear Diary, It is so totally fabulous being back in Brentwood where they<br /> really understand me. O.J. stopped by -- he said not to worry because, ""If<br /> there's no spot on the dress, it's anybody's guess.""<br /> *** Entry 13 ***<br /> Dear Diary, All my girlfriends are so jealous of all the attention I'm getting<br /> from Kenneth Starr. I think they have subpoena envy. And Linda Tripp. I hate<br /> her. I'm thinking of selling a Linda Doll. You wind it up and it stabs a Barbie<br /> doll in the back.<br /> *** Entry 14 ***<br /> Dear Diary, Got to remember to tell Bubba-cakes my totally do-able solution to<br /> this whole wacky Iraqi crisis. He forgets that I worked at the pentagon. Just<br /> have Vernon Jordan get Saddam Wahtsisname a job at Revlon. (God, it's a no<br /> brainier!)<br /> *** Entry 15 ***<br /> Dear Diary, They keep asking me if I had sexual relations with the president.<br /> I mean, give me a break. That is so crazy. I mean, just because every day, when<br /> I worked at the White House, his name was at the top of my ""To Do"" list.<br /> *** Entry 16 ***<br /> Dear Diary, Sometimes I wish some of the other girls who were in my position<br /> would stand up and be counted. But they might hit their heads on the President's<br /> desk if they did.<br /> *** Entry 17 ***<br /> Dear Diary, They keep talking about immunity...like I caught something from<br /> the President or something. The truth is, there was always a secret service man<br /> outside the Oval Office protecting us. Now, that's what I call safe sex!<br /> *** Entry 18 ***<br /> Dear Diary, Omigod. Mom and I are both going to the grand jury. What is that<br /> about anyway? Sounds like some big hotel. Anyway, I guess I shouldn't have told<br /> mom about taking dictation in the Oval Office. My big mouth and me!<br /> *** Entry 19 ***<br /> Dear Diary, I'm not really worried. I've got offers to do some really cool<br /> movies that are going straight to video and starring me! The Full Monica, a<br /> sequel to In And Out, A Pack-O-Lips Now, Wag the Willy and my most favorite,<br /> Good Bill Humping. I hope Speilberg will direct.</p>

19503,"<p>This is something to think about when negative people are doing their best to<br /> rain on your parade. So remember this story the next time someone who knows<br /> nothing and cares less tries to make your life miserable.<br /> A woman was at her hairdresser's getting her hair styled for a trip to Rome<br /> with her boyfriend. She mentioned the trip to the hairdresser, who responded,<br /> ""Rome? Why would anyone want to go there? It's crowded and dirty and full of<br /> Italians. You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?""<br /> ""We're taking Continental,"" was the reply. ""We got a great rate!""<br /> ""Continental?"" exclaimed the hairdresser. ""That's a terrible airline. Their<br /> planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. So,<br /> where are you staying in Rome?""<br /> ""We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's Tiber River called<br /> Teste.""<br /> ""Don't go any further. I know that place. Everybody thinks it's gonna be<br /> something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump, the worst hotel in the<br /> city! The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So,<br /> whatcha doing when you get there?""<br /> ""We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.""<br /> ""That's rich,"" laughed the hairdresser. ""You and a million other people trying<br /> to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of<br /> yours. You're going to need it.""<br /> A month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo. The hairdresser asked her<br /> about her trip to Rome.<br /> ""It was wonderful,"" explained the woman, ""not only were we on time in one of<br /> Continental's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to<br /> first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28-year-old<br /> steward who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel was great! They'd just<br /> finished a $5 million remodeling job and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in<br /> the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us the owner's<br /> suite at no extra charge!""<br /> ""Well,"" muttered the hairdresser, ""That's all well and good, but I know you<br /> didn't get to see the Pope.""<br /> ""Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss<br /> Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the Pope likes to meet some<br /> of the visitors and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait,<br /> the Pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope<br /> walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down and he spoke a few words<br /> to me.""<br /> ""Oh, really! What'd he say?""<br /> He said, ""Where'd you get the lousy hairdo?""</p>

<p>When the husband went out, the wife waited anxiously in the room with all the lights switched off. </p>
<p>The husband had a hard time locating a shop that sold condoms, when he finally found one, he realized that he had only 20 cents. </p>
<p>He asks the shop owner to sell him one condom and the shop owner asked him which quality he wanted. </p>
<p>""The white condom, lowest quality, is 15 cents each. The black condom, average quality, is 20 cents each. And the purple condom, highest quality, is 25 cents each."" </p>
<p>So the husband took the black condom as he had only 20 cents with him. </p>

Why don't you guys take a look at it and give me a bid?' So, to the back fence they all went to check it out. First to step up was the Florida contractor. He took out his tape measure and pencil, did some measuring and said, 'Well I figure the job will run about $900. $400 for materials, $400 for my crew, and $100 profit for me.' Next was the Texas contractor. He also took out his tape measure and pencil, did some quick figuring and said, 'Looks like I can do this job for $700. $300 for materials, $300 for my crew, and $100 profit for me.' Without so much as moving, the New York contractor said, '$2,700.' The guard, incredulous, looked at him and said, 'You didn't even measure like the other guys! How did you come up with such a high figure?' 'Easy,' he said. '$1,000 for me, $1,000 for you and we hire the guy from Texas.'</p>

19522,"<p>1. Each player will furnish his own equipment for play, normally one club and two balls. </p>
<p>2. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out of the hole. </p>
<p>3. Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole. </p>
<p>4. For the most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins. </p>
<p>5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict the length of the club to avoid damage to the hole. </p>
<p>6. The object of the game is to make as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is satisfied that the play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again. </p>
<p>7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course, with special attention paid to the well formed bunkers. </p>
<p>8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played or are currently playing to the owner of the course being played. Upset course owners have been known to damage a player's equipment for this reason. </p>
<p>9. Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time. Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else playing what they considered to be a private course. </p>
<p>10. Players should not assume that a course is in shape for play at all times. Some owners may be embarrassed if their course is temporarily under repair, and the player is advised to use tact in this determination. More advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the case. </p>
<p>11. Slow play is encouraged; however, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace at the course owner's request. </p>
<p>12. Responsible indoor golfers always use a golfbag. </p>
<p>13. It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match. </p>
<p>14. Players are not permitted to tee off on the back nine without the express permission of the course owner. </p>
<p>15. The course owner will be the sole judge of who is the best player. </p>
<p>Membership at a given course - Additional assessments may be levied by the course owner and the rules are subject to change. For this reason, many players prefer to continue to play several different courses.</p>

And of course, he farted really loudly as usual. The next morning when they woke up her husband went to the bathroom. He was in there for a pretty long time so his wife said to him, ""Honey, is everything okay.

<p>Suddenly a booming, sonorous voice speaks from above: ""You, Moses, heed<br /> Me. I have good news, and bad news.""</p>
<p>Moses is staggered. The voice continues:</p>
<p>""You, Moses, will lead the<br /> people of Israel from bondage. If the pharoah refueses to release your<br /> bonds I will smote egypt with a rain of frogs.</p>

19549,"<p>At the 1994 annual awards dinner given by the American Association for<br /> Forensic Science, AAFS President Don Harper Mills astounded his audience<br /> in San Diego with the legal complications of a bizarre death. Here is the<br /> story.</p>
<p>On 23 March 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and<br /> concluded that he died from a shotgun wound of the head. The decedent had<br /> jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide<br /> (he left a note indicating his despondency). As he fell past the ninth<br /> floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window, which<br /> killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that<br /> a safety net had been erected at the eighth floor level to protect some<br /> window washers and that Opus would not have been able to complete his<br /> suicide anyway because of this.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, a person who sets out to commit suicide ultimately succeeds,<br /> even though the mechanism might not be what he intended.</p>
<p>That Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below probably<br /> would not have changed his mode of death from suicide to homicide. But the<br /> fact that his suicidal intent would not have been successful caused the<br /> medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on his hands.</p>
<p>The room on the ninth floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied<br /> by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing and he was threatening<br /> her with the shotgun. He was so upset that, when he pulled the trigger, he<br /> completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window<br /> striking Opus.</p>
<p>When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one<br /> is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with this charge,<br /> the old man and his wife were both adamant that neither knew that the<br /> shotgun was loaded. The old man said it was his long-standing habit to<br /> threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder<br /> her; therefore, the killing of Opus appeared to be an accident. That is,<br /> the gun had been accidentally loaded.</p>
<p>The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's<br /> son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal<br /> incident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial<br /> support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the<br /> shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father<br /> would shoot his mother.</p>
<p>The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of<br /> Ronald Opus.</p>
<p>There was an exquisite twist.</p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that the son [Ronald Opus] had become<br /> increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to engineer his<br /> mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March<br /> 23, only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a ninth story window.</p>
<p>The medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.</p>

19579,"<p>Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a madding passion for Chile. He loved them, but he always has an embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to it. Then one day, he met a young woman and fell in love with her. When evidently they would marry, he thought to himself, she is so sweet and gentle. She will never go for this kind of carrying on. Therefore, he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up the chile. They married thereafter. Some months later, his car broke down on the way home from work and since they lived in the country, he called her and told her that he would be late getting home because he had to walk. On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the odor of freshly cooked chile and corn bread was overwhelming.<br /> Since he had several miles to walk, he figured that he would work off the effects before reaching home. Therefore, he stopped at the cafe. Before leaving the cafe, he had eaten three LARGE orders of chile with corn bread. All the way home he farted and farted and after arriving, felt reasonably sure that he had pooted his last. His wife seemed somewhat upset and excited to see him and exclaimed; ""Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for dinner tonight."" She then blindfolded him and led him to his chair at the head of the table. He seated himself and just as she was ready to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She made him vow that he would not touch the blindfold until she returned. She then went to answer the phone. Seizing the opportunity, he shifted his weight to one leg and ripped a good one. It was not only LOUD, but also as RIPE as a rotten egg. He took the napkin from his lap and vigorously fanned the air around him. Things were just about to return to normal, when he felt the urge come on again, so he shifted his weight to the other leg and ripped another one again, this was a true prizewinner. It rattled the windows.  While keeping his ear on the phone, he went on like this for the next 10 minutes, until he knew the phone farewell suggested the end of his freedom. He placed the napkin in his lap and folded his hands on top of it and smiling contently to himself. He was the perfect picture of innocence.<br /> When his wife returned, she asked if he had peeked and he said no. At this point, she removed the blindfold and revealed to his surprise. .<br /> Twelve dinner guests, who were seated around the table for a birthday party for him!</p>

19593,"<p>'Twas the night before Christmas and all round my hips were Fannie May candies that sneaked past my lips. Fudge brownies were stored in the freezer with care in hopes that my thighs would forget they were there.While Mama in her girdle and I in chin straps had just settled down to sugar-borne naps. When out in the pantry there arose such a clatter I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.Away to the kitchen I flew like a flash tore open the icebox then threw up the sash. The marshmallow look of the new-fallen snow sent thoughts of a binge to my body below.When what to my wandering eyes should appear: a marzipan Santa with eight chocolate reindeer! That huge chunk of candy so luscious and slick I knew in a second that I'd wind up sick.The sweet-coated Santa, those sugared reindeer I closed my eyes tightly but still I could hear; On Pritzker, on Stillman, on weak one, on TOPS a Weight Watcher dropout from sugar detox.From the top of the scales to the top of the hall now dash away pounds now dash away all. Dressed up in Lane Bryant from my head to nightdress my clothes were all bulging from too much excess.My droll little mouth and my round little belly they shook when I laughed like a bowl full of jelly. I spoke not a word but went straight to my work ate all of the candy then turned with a jerk.And laying a finger beside my heartburn I gave a quick nod toward the bedroom I turned. I eased into bed, to the heavens I cry if temptation's removed I'll get thin by and by.And I mumbled again as I turned for the night in the morning I'll starve . . . 'til I take that first bite.</p>

<p>Well, He thought for a moment and said maybe I had better send down a male<br /> angel, to get both points of view. So, God called a male angel and sent<br /> him to earth for a time. When the male angel returned, he went to God and<br /> told him yes, the earth was in decline, 95% was bad and 5% was good.</p>

Those who have it would be devastated if it      were ever cut off. 9. Those who have it think that those who don't are     somehow inferior. 8. Those who don't have it may agree that it's neat,     but think it's not worth the fuss that those who     have it make about it. 7. Many of those who don't have it would like to     try it (e-mail envy). 6. It's more fun when it's up, but this makes it     hard to get any real work done. 5. In the distant past, its only purpose was to     transmit information vital to the survival of the     species. Some people still think that's the     only thing it should be used for, but most folks     today use it for fun most of the time. 4. If you don't apply the appropriate measures,     it can spread viruses. 3. If you use it too much, you'll find it becomes     more and more difficult to think coherently. 2. We attach an importance to it that is far greater     than its actual size and influence warrant. 1. If you're not careful what you do with it,     it can get you into a lot of trouble.</p>

I said, 'If it was without my knowledge, how would I know?' He smiled and nodded knowingly, 'That's why we ask.' Sighting #3: The stoplight on the corner buzzes when it is safe to cross the street.

At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, 'Aren't you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger?' The other replied, 'Yes  I am, I married the wrong man.'Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is really finished.Marriage is an institution in which a man loses his bachelor's  degree and the woman gets her master's.A little boy asked his father, 'Daddy, how much does it cost to get married?' And the father replied, 'I don't know, son, I'm still paying for it.'Young Son: Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her? Dad: That happens in most countries, son.Then there was a man who said, 'I never knew what real happiness was until I got married; and then it was too late.When a newly married man looks happy we know why. But when a ten-year married man looks happy - we wonder why.Married life is very frustrating. In the first year of marriage, the man speaks and the woman listens. In the second year, the woman speaks and the man listens. In the third year, they both speak  and the neighbours listen.After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband, 'You know, I was a fool when I married you.' And the husband replied, 'Yes, dear, but I was in love and didn't notice it.'It doesn't matter how often a married man changes his job, he still ends up with the same boss.A man inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds : 'Wife wanted'. Next day he received a hundred letters. They all said the same thing: 'You can have mine.'When a man opens the door of his car for his wife, you can be sure of one thing: either the car is new or the wife.A perfect wife is one who helps the husband with the dishes.A woman was telling her friend , 'It is I who made my husband a millionaire.'  'And what was he before you married him.' Asked the friend. The woman replied, ' A multi-millionaire'.</p>

19644,"<p>There were two best friends ever. One was very religious, the other one not so. One day they got into a car accident and both of them died. The religious one went to heaven and his best friend went to hell.Months passed by, then the one in heaven began to miss his best friend, so he asked God if he could go visit his friend in  hell. God said yes, but you can only go for three days and If you are a second late you can't get back in. He says okay and grabbed whatever he needed for three days and went to visit his friend in hell.A month later while partying all day and night, he knocked on the heaven's door, God opened the door and told him that he couldn't get back into heaven because had broken the rule, he said that's okay, I just came to get the rest of my stuff.</p>

19661,"<p>The World's Greatest Cowboy (wgc) was captured by some Indians,<br /> who told him they would burn him at the stake at dawn. But<br /> because he was the wgc, they would give him a last request. The<br /> WGC said, let me talk to my horse.</p>
<p>So he whispers in the horse's ear, and the horse runs off, and<br /> returns in an hour with a beautiful redhead. He takes her into a<br /> teepee and makes love to her for a couple of hours. Finally she<br /> staggers out, gets on the horse, and rides away. An hour later<br /> the horse returns. </p>
<p>The Indian chief says ""Now we know why you are called the WGC!<br /> That was a good horse trick, and we are good horsemen ourselves.<br /> We will give you another last request."" So WGC asked to speak to<br /> the horse again.</p>
<p>The horse runs off, and returns in an hour with a naked,<br /> beautiful, to die for, knock you off your feet, blonde. WGC<br /> takes her into the teepee, and after 3 hours, she staggers out,<br /> and has to be helped onto the horse, which carries her away and<br /> returns in an hour.</p>
<p>The chief says ""The tribe is impressed, not only by your horse,<br /> but by your stamina and ability! Now we are certain why you are<br /> called the WGC, and are a great and honored enemy.

19671,"<p>A certain lawyer was quite wealthy and had a summerhouse in the country<br /> where he retreated for several weeks every year. Each summer, the lawyer would<br /> invite a different friend of his (no, that's not the punch line) to spend a week<br /> or two at this home, which happened to be in a backwoods. On one particular<br /> occasion, he invited a Czechoslovakian friend to stay with him. The friend,<br /> eager to get a freebee off of the lawyer, agreed. They had a splendid time in<br /> the country -- rising early and living in the great outdoors. Early one morning,<br /> the lawyer and his Czechoslovakian companion went out to pick berries for their<br /> morning breakfast. As they went around the berry patch, gathering blueberries<br /> and raspberries in tremendous quantities, along came two huge Bears -- a large<br /> male and a smaller female. The lawyer, seeing the two bears and sensing danger,<br /> immediately dashed for cover. His friend, however, being ignorant of nature, was<br /> not so lucky. The male bear charged the paralyzed Czechoslovakian, and then<br /> swallowed him whole. The lawyer, instilled with fright, rushed back to his car<br /> and sped into town to get the local sheriff. The sheriff, upon hearing the<br /> lawyer's unsettling story, grabbed his rifle and dashed back to the berry patch<br /> with the lawyer following closely behind. Sure enough, the two bears were still<br /> there. ""He's in THAT one!� cried the lawyer, pointing to the large male bear,<br /> all the while visions of lawsuits from his friend's family lagged in the back of<br /> his mind. He just had to save his friend. The sheriff looked at the two bears,<br /> and without batting an eye, leveled his rifle, took careful aim, and SHOT THE<br /> FEMALE. ""What did you do that for!� exclaimed the lawyer, ""I said he was in the<br /> other one!"" ""Exactly,"" replied the sheriff, ""Would YOU believe a lawyer who told<br /> you the Czech was in the male?""</p>

He quickly picked up the phone and shouted into it ""  ...and you<br /> tell them that we won't accept less then fifty thousand dollars, and<br /> don't even call me until you agree to that amount!""  Slamming the phone<br /> down he stood up and greeted Mr.  Jones; ""Good Morning, Mr.  Jones,<br /> what can I do for you?""</p>

19686,"<p>INTERVIEW WITH THE EASTER BUNNY With the possible exception of Santa Claus himself, there is not a busier mammal on the face of the earth than the Easter Bunny. Once a year, the Easter Bunny hops into the home of hundreds of millions of boys and girls all over the globe, dropping off chocolates, candy and eggs as part of the celebration of Easter. Our Staff spent a few minutes with the Easter Bunny as he was preparing for this year's task, for a tell-all, no-holds-barred interview. If you thought you knew the Easter Bunny, you just may be surprised.Our Staff: Thanks for talking to us.Easter Bunny: No problem. Do you mind if I eat while we talk? (takes out a packet of small green pellets) I've been in a rush recently.OS: Go right ahead. We've got a list of questions here, compiled from our members, and I'll just go down the list if you don't mind.EB:  Ready when you are.OS: The first question comes from Ted, in Dayton, Ohio. He writes: 'We all know that Santa's Workshop is located at the North Pole. Does the Easter Bunny have a workshop, and if so, where is it located?'EB:  Well, Ted, the answer is yes, I do have a workshop. It's located in San Bernardino, California.OS: San Bernardino?EB:  That's right.OS: You have to understand that most people would have figured some place like Easter Island.EB:  Have you *been* to Easter Island? What a rock! It's the single most isolated piece of land on the planet. By the time we shipped fresh eggs there, we'd have chickens. Besides, San Bernardino has the sort of motivated labor pool we need.OS: Elves?EB:  Laid-off aerospace workers.OS: They would seem to be a little overqualified.EB:  Maybe. But now we have some lovely chocolate stealth bombers.OS: Our next question comes from Cindy, in Tempe. She writes: 'Why is the Easter Bunny a bunny? Why couldn't it have been the Easter Kitty, or the Easter Puppy?'EB:  That's a very good question. In fact, in the late 70s, we as an organization decided to play around with the whole 'bunny' thing by recruiting prominent local animals to deliver Easter baskets. In 1978, when the experiment was at its height, we had an Easter Bunny, an Easter Coyote, an Easter Manatee and an Easter Komodo Dragon.OS: What happened?EB:  It just didn't work out. The Komodo dragon ate the eggs, the coyote just flaked out, and the manatee, if I may say so, was just about as dumb as a stick. There were some other problems with the program, too. The less we talk about the whole Easter Man-Eating Bengali Swamp Tiger episode, the better. Now we stick with bunnies. We know bunnies. We can work with bunnies. Bunnies don't eat anyone.OS: Bob in Honolulu asks: 'Is there is just one Easter Bunny? Moreover, has the same Easter Bunny been the Easter Bunny for the last couple of millennia?'EB:  The fact of the matter is that there are quite a few Easter Bunnies, and we've never made a secret about that. Unlike the Santa Claus operation, which works under the improbable assumption that one guy delivers all those presents -OS: Are you saying that Santa is a sham?EB:  I didn't say that. I never said that. What I am saying is that *we* don't work under the same sort of constraints. I mean, think about it. One bunny delivering baskets to several hundred million homes across the planet? The friction from the atmosphere alone would turn the poor guy into a bunny briquette. There'd be hideous charcoal smudges all over the baskets. 'Easter Bunny' is a job description, not a proper name. It's like 'Postal Carrier,' except our employees very rarely become disgruntled.OS: So why are you THE Easter Bunny?EB:  Because I'm boss. You're not an Easter Bunny until I say you are.OS: How does one become an Easter Bunny?EB:  Well, it's not just hopping down the bunny trail, I'll tell you. First, for reasons already explained, you have to be a bunny. After that, we have a psychological evaluation and a battery of physical tests you have to pass. We can't afford to have an Easter Bunny cramp up at the beginning of his run.OS: Any famous rabbits turned down for the job?EB:  I don't want to name names. But one bunny who's making a living in the breakfast cereal industry, we had to let go. Any time a child would try to get an Easter basket from him, he'd back away and start snarling. He was a silly rabbit. Easter baskets are for kids.OS: He seems to have gotten better since then.EB:  Prozac helps.OS: Albert from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, wants to know what are the occupational hazards of being the Easter Bunny.EB:  There are several. Large dogs are always a problem, of course: one moment you're delivering a basket of goodies, the next, a Rottweiler named Pinochet is on you like a meat-filled sock. Nervous homeowners with guns wing a couple of bunnies a year, as do edgy cops and private security guards. We don't even bother trying to deliver to the children of militia members anymore; first they'll plug you for being on their land, then they'll make you into jerky and a pair of gloves. But you know what our number one problem is?OS: What?EB:  Sliding glass doors. Sometimes we'll just forget they're there. Man, that's embarrassing.OS: Here's an interesting question, from Amy, in New York City. She writes: 'How does the Easter Bunny get along with Santa Claus? It seems like Santa gets all the attention.' And I have to say, I did notice some tension earlier, when you brought him up.EB   (Looking uncomfortable): Well, you know, look. I don't want to say anything bad about the guy. He does what he does, and I do what I do. Professionally, we get along fine.OS: But privately?EB:  Is that tape recorder turned off?OS: Uh.....sure.EB:  He's a big ol' pain in this bunny's bottom. For one thing, he's a prima donna: always me, me, me, where's my highball, where's my corned beef sandwich, tell this dumb bunny to get his own dressing room. I'd rather be trapped in a sack with Joan Crawford. For another, he's totally paranoid of other large men. He thinks that Luciano Pavarotti is trying to move into his territory. Last year it was John Goodman. He actually danced when Orson Welles kicked, waving his pistol and bellowing 'Rosebud!' from the top of his lungs.OS: Wow. He seems a little scary.EB:  You think? And yet he gets all the publicity. Why? We do the same job. Mine's actually tougher, since I'm moving perishable stuff. You can't have bad eggs or stale chocolate, you know.  Folks wouldn't stand for it. I have to maintain strict quality control. The only food product he has to worry about is fruitcake. You could tile the Space Shuttle with fruitcake.OS: We're sure you have your own fans.EB:  It's like opening for the Beatles, is all. And he *is* the walrus, if you know what I mean.OS: One final question, from Pat, in Rockford, Illinois; 'Does the Easter Bunny actually lay eggs? How does that happen, since the Easter Bunny is both male and a mammal?'EB:  Well, platypuses are mammals, and they lay eggs. So it's not impossible.OS: That still leaves the male part.EB:  We're quibbling on details, here.OS: Maybe there should be an Easter Platypus.EB:  Sorry. We tried that in '78.</p>

<p>13. If you get fired, get drunk. </p>
<p>14. Call your ex-wife ""Baby."" </p>
<p>15. If you've got to fix your Harley, you might as well take off your shirt and do it by the pool. </p>
<p>16. Randomly insult the people around you. </p>
<p>17. Parents will be parents. Sometimes they'll nag. Sometimes they'll be judgmental. Sometimes they'll commit you to a miserable insane asylum where you'll be bound in a straight jacket and heavily sedated. </p>
<p>18. If you lose your job, wait a few minutes and you'll get an even better job at twice the salary. </p>
<p>19. A good way to aggravate your sister is to tell her that Mom liked you best. Another good way is to sleep with her husband a bunch of times. </p>
<p>20. Just because you're in the midst of ruining someone's career doesn't mean that you can't carpool to work with them.</p>

<p>1. It contains the optimum balance of nutrients for the newborn child.</p>
<p>2. As it is contained within the mother's body, it is protected from germs and helps develop the child's immune system.</p>

19782,"<p>Tips on Love (From Those Who Should Know) </p>
<p>(all questions were answered by kids, age 5-10)</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE PROPER AGE TO GET MARRIED??</p>
<p>""Eighty-four, Because at that age, you don't have to work anymore, and you can<br /> spend all your time loving each other in your bedroom."" (Judy, 8) </p>
<p>""Once I'm done with kindergarten, I'm going to find me a wife"" (Tom, 5)</p>
<p>WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?? </p>
<p>""On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that usually gets them<br /> interested enough to go for a second date."" (Mike, 10)</p>
<p>WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE??</p>
<p>""You should never kiss a girl unless you have enough bucks to buy her a big<br /> ring and her own VCR, 'cause she'll want to have videos of the wedding."" (Jim,<br /> 10) </p>
<p>""Never kiss in front of other people. It's a big embarrassing thing if anybody<br /> sees you. But if nobody sees you, I might be willing to try it with a handsome<br /> boy, but just for a few hours."" (Kally, 9) </p>
<p>THE GREAT DEBATE: IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?? </p>
<p>""It's better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need somebody to<br /> clean up after them."" (Lynette, 9)</p>

<p>CONCERNING WHY LOVE HAPPENS BETWEEN TWO PARTICULAR PEOPLE </p>
<p>""No one is sure why it happens, but I heard it has something to do with how<br /> you smell. That's why perfume and deodorant are so popular."" (Jan, 9) </p>
<p>""I think you're supposed to get shot with an arrow or something, but the rest<br /> of it isn't supposed to be so painful."" (Harlen, 8) </p>
<p>ON WHAT FALLING IN LOVE IS LIKE </p>
<p>""Like an avalanche where you have to run for your life."" (Roger, 9) </p>
<p>""If falling in love is anything like learning how to spell, I don't want to do<br /> it. It takes too long."" (Leo, 7)</p>
<p>ON THE ROLE OF GOOD LOOKS IN LOVE </p>
<p>""If you want to be loved by somebody who isn't already in your family, it<br /> doesn't hurt to be beautiful."" (Jeanne, 8) </p>
<p>""It isn't always just how you look. Look at me. I'm handsome like anything and<br /> I haven't got anybody to marry me yet."" (Gary, 7) </p>
<p>""Beauty is skin deep. But how rich you are can last a long time.""(Christine,<br /> 9) </p>

<p>    A True Story, if she had killed herself she'd be a shoe-in for the Darwin<br /> Award (might be a problem in the gene pool).</p>
<p>    Last summer, down on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert, an hour<br /> east of Bakersfield, a blonde, new to boating was having a problem.  No matter<br /> how hard she tried, she just couldn't get her brand new 22-ft Bayliner to<br /> perform.  It wouldn't get on a plane at all, and it was very sluggish in<br /> almost every maneuver, no matter how much power she applied.</p>
<p>    After about an hour of trying to make it go, she putted over to a nearby<br /> marina.  Maybe they could tell her what was wrong.  A thorough topside check<br /> revealed everything was in perfect working order.  The engine ran fine, the<br /> outdrive went up and down, and the prop was the correct size and pitch.</p>
<p>    So, one of the marina guys jumped in the water to check underneath the<br /> boat.  He came up choking on water, he was laughing so hard.</p>
<p>    Under the boat, still strapped securely in place, was the trailer.</p>

<p>Bob recanted, ""I've got a job! I have a good, well paying job!"" </p>

<p>""I'm an asshole stretcher!!!"" </p>

<p>The cop, absorbed with the images in his mind, let down his guard and asked, ""What the hell do you do with a six foot asshole ?"" </p>

<p>7. When the rebel leader challenges me to fight one-on-one and asks, ""Or are you afraid without your armies to back you up?"" My reply will be, ""No, just sensible."" </p>

<p>12. I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a small hotel well outside my borders will work just as well. </p>
<p>13. I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat. </p>
<p>14. I will not waste time making my enemy's death look like an accident: I'm not accountable to anyone and my other enemies wouldn't believe it. </p>
<p>15. I will make it clear that I _do_ know the meaning of the word ""mercy""; I simply choose not show them any. </p>
<p>16. One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation. </p>
<p>17. All slain enemies will be cremated, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal. </p>
<p>18. My undercover agents will not have tattoos identifying them as members of my organization, nor will they be required to wear military boots or adhere to any other dress codes. </p>
<p>19. The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any other form of last request. </p>
<p>20. I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation. </p>
<p>21. I will design all doomsday machines myself. If I must hire a mad scientist to assist me, I will make sure that he is sufficiently twisted to never regret his evil ways and seek to undo the damage he's caused. </p>
<p>22. I will never utter the sentence ""But before I kill you, there's just one thing I want to know."" </p>
<p>23. When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their advice.</p>

<p>""Can I help you?"" the madam asked</p>

<p>""No, I must see Natalie,"" said the man.</p>
<p>Just then Natalie appeared and announced to the old man that she charged $1000 per visit. The man never blinked and reached into his pocket and handed her 10 $100 bills. The two went up to her room for an hour, whereupon the man calmly left.</p>
<p>The next night he appeared again demanding Natalie. Natalie explained that no-one had ever come back two nights in a row and that there were no discounts � it was still $1000.</p>
<p>Again the old man took out the money, the two went up to the room and he calmly left an hour later.</p>
<p>When he showed up the third consecutive night, no-one could believe it. Again he handed Natalie the money and up to the room they went.</p>
<p>At the end of the hour Natalie questioned the old man, ""No-one has ever used my services three nights in a row � where are you from?""</p>
<p>The old man replied, ""I am from a little town called Minsk"".</p>
<p>""Really?"" replied Natalie. ""I have a sister who lives there"".</p>

19861,"<p>Once you start playing with software you quickly become aware that each software package has a revision code attached to it.

This article provides a guide for interpreting the meaning of the revision codes and what they actually signify. </p>
<p>1.0: Also known as ""one point uh-oh"", or ""barely out of beta"". We had to release because the lab guys had reached a point of exhaustion and the marketing guys were in a cold sweat of terror. We're praying that you'll find it more functional than, say, a computer virus and that its operation has some resemblance to that specified in the marketing copy. </p>
<p>1.1: We fixed all the killer bugs ... </p>
<p>1.2: Uh, we introduced a few new bugs fixing the killer bugs and so we had to fix them, too. </p>
<p>2.0: We did the product we really wanted to do to begin with. Mind you, it's really not what the customer needs yet, but we're working on it. </p>
<p>2.1: Well, not surprisingly, we broke some things in making major changes so we had to fix them. But we did a really good job of testing this time, so we don't think we introduced any new bugs while we were fixing these bugs. </p>
<p>2.2: Uh, sorry, one slipped through. One lousy typo error and you won't believe how much trouble it caused! </p>
<p>2.3: Some jerk found a deep-seated bug that's been there since 1.0 and wouldn't stop nagging until we fixed it!! </p>
<p>3.0: Hey, we finally think we've got it right! Most of the customers are really happy with this. </p>
<p>3.1: Of course, we did break a few little things. </p>
<p>4.0: More features. It's doubled in size now, by the way, and you'll need to get more memory and a faster processor ... </p>
<p>4.1: Just one or two bugs this time... Honest! </p>
<p>5.0: We really need to go on to a new product, but we have an installed base out there to protect. We're cutting the staffing after this. </p>
<p>6.0: We had to fix a few things we broke in 5.0. Not very many, but it's been so long since we looked at this thing we might as well call it a major upgrade. Oh, yeah, we added a few flashy cosmetic features so we could justify the major upgrade number. </p>
<p>6.1: Since I'm leaving the company and I'm the last guy left in the lab who works on the product, I wanted to make sure that all the changes I've made are incorporated before I go. I added some cute demos, too, since I was getting pretty bored back here in my dark little corner (I kept complaining about the lighting but they wouldn't do anything). They're talking about obsolescence planning but they'll try to keep selling it for as long as there's a buck or two to be made.</p>

<p>To prove his point, the Air Force general calls over an airman: ""Airman! Climb that flagpole, and once you are at the top, sing 'Wild Blue Yonder', and then jump off!""</p>
<p>""YES SIR!"" replies the airman. He takes off for the flagpole like a shot, scales up it, sings the anthem, salutes and jumps off, hitting the ground at attention.</p>
<p>The general dismisses him. ""Now that's bravery!"" exclaims the general.</p>
<p>""Ah, that's nothing,"" says the Admiral, ""Seaman!"" A seaman appears, ""YES, SIR!!"" ""Take this weapon,"" as he offers him an M14, ""Scale that flagpole, balance yourself on top, stand at attention, present arms, and sing 'Anchors Aweigh.' Salute each of us, and jump off.</p>
<p>""YES SIR!!"" replies the seaman. He sprints for the flagpole with the weapon high over his head, and completes the task perfectly.</p>
<p>""Now that's courage!"" says the admiral.</p>
<p>""Courage, nothin'"" snorts the Army general. ""Get over here, private!""<br /> ""YES SIR!!"" replies the private.</p>
<p>""Put on full combat gear, load your rucksack with these rocks, scale that flagpole, come to attention, present arms, and sing the National Anthem, salute each of us, and then climb back down, head first.""</p>
<p>""YES SIR!!"" replies the private, and completes the task.<br /> ""Now that is a brave man! Beat that!!""</p>
<p>They all look to the Marine. ""Private,"" he says.<br /> ""YES SIR!!""</p>
<p>""Put on full combat gear. Put these two dogs in your pack. Using only one hand, climb that flagpole. At the top, sing 'The Halls of Montezuma', put your knife in your teeth, and dive off, headfirst.""</p>
<p>The private snaps to attention, looks at the general and says, ""FUCK YOU SIR!!""</p>
<p>The general turns to the others and says, ""Now THAT'S bravery!""</p>

19892,"<p>Three guys are sitting at the bar, when a stranger walked in and took a stool at the far end of the bar. The three guys were tranfixed on the stranger, who bear a striking resemblance to Jesus.For quite a while they were speculating if in fact it was the Son of God himself. Finally Joe stands up and said he would find out for sure and walked down to the end of the bar, but before he could even open his mouth, the stranger said, "" you have had constant pain in your lower back for many years, and so I say unto you ""Be healed"". Instantly the pain left his body. He ran back to tell the others. Tom said that it was bullshit and went down to the end of the bar, but again before he could say anything, the stranger said, ""since you were a child you have had an inferior left eye, Be heal and see the world the way God intended. Tom's bad eye was seeing as well as the other. Both 20/20. He came back to inform the others. Mack just set there, ""well I'm not going down there - come hell or high water.

19894,"<p>1. You're a Bitch. </p>
<p>2. When asked ""Is something bothering you?"" you reply ""no,"" then get pissed off when you are believed. </p>
<p>3. You become attracted to someone because he is outgoing and loves parties, start dating him, and immediately expect him to stop this behaviour. </p>
<p>4. You always take an hour longer than promised to prepare for the evening. </p>
<p>5. You always hide very important events in very unimportant terms so you can have something to be pissed about when your boyfriend declines because he has pressing business. For example, you say ""It's no big deal, but I was wondering if you would like to visit my parents with me if you are not busy this weekend,"" when you mean ""It means a great deal to me for you to see my family with me this weekend - whether it is possible or not!"" </p>
<p>6. You whine. </p>
<p>7. If you are trying to sleep, it's because you're exhausted from your almost superhuman level of daily achievement; if he is trying to sleep it's because he is lazy. </p>
<p>8. No matter what the activity, he doesn't do it as well as a past boyfriend. </p>
<p>9. If he pays attention to you, he is smothering you. </p>
<p>10. If he gives you space, he is ignoring you. </p>
<p>11. You complain. </p>
<p>12. You hate any bar he likes. </p>
<p>13. You demand to be treated as an equal in everything - except when paying for meals, airplane tickets, concerts, beers, clothes, etc. - these are required gifts proving his love. </p>
<p>14. You declare PMS at any given time.  If he is knowledgeable about your cycle, tell him you're irregular from all the stress of your life. </p>
<p>15. Any woman who so much as stares at your boyfriend is labelled a WHORE, and your network of friends is informed immediately to spread this 'fact' as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>16. You make his life miserable by making him feel guilty about doing anything other than catering to your needs. </p>
<p>17. You break into tears for no apparent reason, then use number 2. </p>
<p>18. You ask for help in some endeavour then become livid when it is given. </p>
<p>19. You insinuate yourself into your boyfriend's group of friends, break up with him, then make sure you are present at every gathering for the next month just to rub it in. </p>
<p>20. You must have two sets of clothes:  your ""Fat Clothes"" and your ""Clothes I'm Going to Fit In Someday, I Swear"".  Still, you don't like any of them. </p>
<p>21. (Corollary to #4)  You have three closets  (plus two dressers and six boxes) full of clothes, yet you stand in front of them for three hours before an important dinner declaring, ""I have nothing to wear."" </p>

So I decided I needed a girl with some stability. I found a very stable girl, but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything.Life became so dull that I decided I needed a girl with some excitement. I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad, impetuous things and flirted with everyone she met. She made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless.So I decided to find a girl with some ambition. I found a smart, ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground and married her.She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

19929,"<p>Dear employee: </p>
<p>as a result of the reduction of money budgeted for department areas, we are<br /> forced to cut down on our number of personnel. </p>
<p>Under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus<br /> permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. therefore,<br /> a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year,<br /> via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately. </p>
<p>This program will be known as slap (sever late-aged personnel). employees who<br /> are slapped will be given the opportunity to look for jobs outside the company. </p>
<p>Slapped employees can request a review of their employment records before<br /> actual retirement takes place. this review phase of the program is called screw. </p>
<p>Screw (survey of capabilities of retired early workers). all employees who<br /> have been slapped and screwed may file an appeal with upper management. </p>

<p>As she followed the snow plow she was feeling very smug as they continued and she was not having any problems with the blizzard conditions.

19949,"<p>I had to take my son's hamster to the vet. Here's what happened: Just after<br /> dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was ""something wrong"" with one<br /> of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room.<br /> ""He's just lying there looking sick,"" he told me.<br /> ""Oldest trick in the book,"" I informed him. ""You go in to see what's wrong<br /> with the sick one and the other one sneak up behind you and bonks you on the<br /> head. Then they change into your clothes and escape.""<br /> ""I'm serious, Dad. Can you help?""<br /> I put a hamster-healer expression on my face and followed him into his<br /> bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking<br /> distressed. I immediately knew what to do. ""Honey,"" I called, ""come look at the<br /> hamster!""<br /> ""Oh, my gosh,"" my wife diagnosed after a minute. ""She's having<br /> babies.""<br /> ""What?"" my son demanded. ""But their names are Bert and Ernie!""<br /> I was equally outraged. ""Hey, how can that be? I thought we said we didn't<br /> want them to reproduce,"" I accused my wife.<br /> ""Well, what did you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?"" she inquired<br /> sarcastically.<br /> ""No, but you were supposed to get two boys!"" I reminded her.<br /> ""Yeah, Bert and Ernie!"" my son agreed.<br /> ""Well, it was a little hard to tell,"" she informed me.<br /> By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I<br /> shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. ""Kids, this is going to be a wondrous<br /> experience,"" I announced. ""We're about to witness the miracle of birth.""<br /> ""Gross!"" they shrieked.<br /> ""Great; what are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?""<br /> my wife wanted to know.<br /> ""Well, when my parents' dog had puppies, I took them up to the grocery store<br /> in a cardboard box and gave them away,"" I recalled.<br /> ""So what are you going to do, go up with a pair of tweezers so people can pick<br /> out their hamster?"" she asked.<br /> We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot<br /> would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. ""We don't appear to be<br /> making much progress,"" I noted.<br /> ""A breech birth,"" my wife whispered, horrified.<br /> ""Do something, Dad!"" my son urged.<br /> ""Okay, okay."" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next<br /> appeared, giving it a gingerly tug. It disappeared. I tried again, with the same<br /> results.<br /> ""Should I dial 911?"" my daughter wanted to know. ""Maybe they could<br /> talk us through it.""<br /> ""Let's get Ernie to the vet,"" I said grimly.<br /> We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap. ""Breathe, Ernie,<br /> breathe,"" he urged.<br /> ""I don't think hamsters do Lamaze,"" I told him.<br /> The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal<br /> through a magnifying glass. ""What do you think, Doc, an epidural?"" I suggested<br /> scientifically.<br /> ""Oh, very interesting,"" he murmured. ""Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may<br /> I speak to you privately for a moment?""<br /> I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside. ""Is Ernie going to be okay?"" my<br /> wife asked.<br /> ""Oh, perfectly,"" the vet assured us. ""This hamster is not in labor. In fact,<br /> that isn't EVER going to happen....Ernie is a boy.""<br /> ""What?""<br /> ""You see, Ernie is a young male. And occasionally, as they come into maturity,<br /> male hamsters will, ah..."" He blushed, glancing at my wife. ""Well, you know what<br /> I'm saying, Mr. Cameron.""<br /> We were silent, absorbing this. ""So Ernie's just...just...""<br /> ""Excited?"" my wife offered.<br /> ""Exactly,"" the vet replied, relieved that we understood.<br /> More silence. Then my wife started to giggle. ""What's so funny?"" I demanded.<br /> Tears were now running down her face. ""Just...that...I'm picturing you pulling<br /> on it�s...it�s..."" she gasped.<br /> ""That's enough,"" I warned. We thanked the veterinarian and hurriedly bundled<br /> the hamsters and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to<br /> be okay.<br /> ""I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad,"" he told me.<br /> ""Oh, you have no idea,"" my wife agreed, collapsing into laughter as I gave her<br /> a dirty look.</p>

19951,"<p>A Press Release -</p>
<p>WASHINGTON D.C. The House Appropriations subcommittee on NASA oversight, in another effort to reduce the NASA budget, passed a resolution today to downsize the solar system. According to an unnamed congressional staffer, House Republicans felt there has been ""too much redundancy in the solar system"" and that streamlining the 4.5 billion year old planetary system is long overdue. Such action would give NASA fewer places to go and this would allow the agency to carry out its space exploration goals within the funding profile that the House proposed earlier this summer.</p>
<p>""Look, we have three terrestrial planets"" said Congressman Rip U. Apart (R, Del.), ""and only one of them really works! So why not get rid of the other two and clean up the neighborhood?"" Most subcommittee members felt that while downsizing was definitely in the cards, eliminating both Mars and Venus was going too far. ""We have too many international commitments to Mars."" said Rush N. Hater (R, Calif.). ""So I think we should keep Mars and dump Venus. Its too hot to live on, and liberal Democrats keep using it as an example of what global warming can do. So from a political and practical point of view, Venus has got to go.""</p>
<p>Also at risk is the planet Mercury which lacks support because of its small size and poor visibility from Earth. ""Who needs it?"" asked Congressman Newt Onian (R, N.C.). ""Have you ever seen it? I haven't. So what good is it? We just don't need useless planets. And speaking of useless planets, what about the asteroids? If you've seen one, you've seen them all. So I say we ought to get rid of the little boogers once and for all.""</p>
<p>However, the downsizing recommendations do not stop with the terrestrial planets. The resolution also calls for a reduction in the number of gas giants which contain most of the planetary mass in the solar system. Most subcommittee members favor retaining Jupiter and Saturn, and eliminating Uranus and Neptune. ""Jupiter employs the most molecules, and Saturn has those pretty little rings everyone likes."" said Rep. Con Mann (R, Fla.). ""On the other hand, Uranus is a bore and its rings are dirty. And Neptune, for God's sake, is just too far away. So begone with those ugly bruisers.""</p>
<p>But the influential Wright I.M. Fornow from South Carolina has publicly announced he will fight to eliminate Saturn. Fornow is especially miffed by NASA's success thus far in keeping Cassini, the next mission to Saturn, alive which he feels is waste of taxpayers money. ""If there ain't no Saturn, then there ain't no Cassini"" he exclaimed. The congressman also expressed concern about sending back-to-back spacecraft bearing Italian surnames to the outer planets (The Galileo spacecraft arrives at Jupiter this December).</p>
<p>The subcommittee was unanimous in its views towards Pluto which they deemed a moral misfit. ""Now here's a planet we can definitely do without."" continued Fornow. ""A few years ago, it was farthest from the sun. Now its not. Its just too confusing. And now they tell me its really two planets instead of one. What the hell is going on here?""</p>
<p>The resolution must now be presented to the entire House, where it is expected to pass easily since only a minority of Representatives have constituents on the affected planets. NASA Administrator Golden has vowed to resist any further reductions to the solar system, saying that ""NASA has expended considerable effort to make the planets cheaper, faster, and better. Much of this work would be wasted if the solar system were downsized"" stated Golden.</p>
<p>Critics say, however, that reducing the number of planets will not produce the expected savings to taxpayers. Textbooks, they note, would have to be revised to reflect the new arrangement, and facilities would need to be constructed to remove the planets themselves. The resolution is also likely to draw strong opposition from religious fundamentalists who have long opposed the elimination of any of the biblical planets. Thus, the matter is far from resolved.</p>

As he stood there he noticed that some souls  were  allowed to march right through the gates of heaven - others, though,  were led over to Satan who threw them into the burning pit.  But every  so  often, instead of hurling a poor soul into the fire, Satan would toss  a soul off    to one side into a small pile.After watching Satan do this several times, the fellows  curiosity  got the  better of him.  So he strolled over and tapped Satan on  the shoulder.'Excuse me, Prince of Darkness,' he said.  'Im waiting in  line for judgment, but I couldnt help wondering, why are you tossing  those  people aside instead of flinging them into the fires of hell with the  others?' 'Ah, those...' Satan said with a groan.  'They're all from  Seattle; theyre too wet to burn!'</p>
