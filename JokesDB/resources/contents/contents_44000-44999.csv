44000,"<p>Un transportista llevaba una partida de ping�inos hacia el zool�gico, cuando a medio camino se le estropea el cami�n refrigerado. Preocupado, trata de reparar el problema y al ver pasar un cami�n repartidor de leche consigue que se detenga. Entonces le dice al lechero:</p>
<p>""Mira, te voy a dar $500 para que me hagas el favor de llevar estos ping�inos al zool�gico"".</p>
<p>El lechero toma el dinero y se lleva con gusto a los p�jaros en su cami�n refrigerado. Mientras tanto, el transportista logra arreglar el da�o, y de inmediato enfila hacia el zool�gico.

<p>""Mira, ya los lleve al zool�gico, pero como me sobr� dinero los voy a llevar al cine"".</p>

44004,"<p>Two high school sweethearts who went out together for four years in high school were both virgins; they enjoyed losing their virginity to each other in 10th grade. When they graduated, they wanted both to go to the same college, but, the girl was accepted to a college on the East Coast, and the guy went to a college on the West Coast. They agreed to be faithful to each other and to spend anytime they could together. </p>
<p>As time went on, the guy would call the girl and she would never be home, and when he wrote, she would take weeks to return the letters. Even when he e-mailed her, she took days to return his messages. Finally, she confessed to him that she wanted to date around. </p>
<p>He didn't take this very well and increased his calls, letters, and e-mails trying to win back her love. She soon became very annoyed with his persistence and now with a new boyfriend, she wanted to get him off her back. </p>
<p>So, what she did is this: she took a Polaroid picture of her sucking her new boyfriend's unmentionables and sent it to her old boyfriend with a note reading, ""I found a new boyfriend, leave me alone."" </p>
<p>Well, needless to say, this guy was heartbroken, but, even more, so, he was pissed. So, what he did next was awesome. </p>
<p>He wrote on the back of the photo the following, ""Dear Mom and Dad, having a great time at college, please send more money! I'm getting pretty desperate!"" and mailed the picture to her parents.</p>

44010,"<p>This guy walks into a bar with his monkey. The guy sits down next to the bartender and has a few drinks. After a while he has to go the bathroom.  ""Will you watch my monkey while I go the bathroom?"" the guy asked the bartender.  ""Sure."", says the bartender.  As soon as the bartender hits the bathroom, the monkey jumps up, runs across the room to the pool tables and eats the cue-ball.  ""What the hell?"", the bartender exclaimed.  When the guy came out of the bathroom, the bartender says.  ""Guess what?...your damn monkey just ate my cue-ball.""  ""Oh god."", says the guy. ""Here there's $20 and after the monkey passes the cue-ball, I'll sterilize it and bring it back to you, deal?""  The bartender agrees. A week later the guy comes back with his monkey and also returns the cue-ball. He is now on good terms with the bartender. Anyway, the guy has a few drinks and after awhile he needs to go the bathroom. He looks at the bartender and says, ""Will you watch my monkey while I go the bathroom?""  ""He isn't going to eat the cue-ball is he?"", asked the bartender.  ""No he's over that."", explained the guy.  Bartender agrees. As soon as the guy hits the bathroom, the monkey jumps up, runs across the room, and gets a peanut out of the peanut bowl. The monkey examines the peanut. Then the monkey puts the peanut up it's ass, pulls the peanut out, and finally eats the peanut.  ""What innnnnnn the hellllllll"", the bartender exclaimed in a bewildered manner.  The guy comes out of the bathroom.  ""Guess what?....your monkey just stuck a peanut up it's ass, and then ate it afterwards."", the bartender explained, still overcome by the act.  ""Oh yeah..."", the guy acknowledges. ""It's just that ever since the cue-ball, he just wants to make sure everything fits.""</p>

The Prayer is the Word of the Lord and it must not be changed.""Finally, the Tyson guy says, ""This is our last offer. We will donate five billion dollars to the church if you change the Lord's Prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread...' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken...'"" and he leaves.The next day the Pope meets with the College of Cardinals to say that he has good news and some bad news.""The good news is that the Church has just received a donation of five billion dollars.""""The bad news is that we are losing The Wonderbread Account!""</p>

The guards all turned<br /> around, and he escaped by jumping over the wall.<br /> Next in line was the Florida State grad, now confident that he too will be<br /> able to escape. So, just when they were about to fire, he shouted, ""Flood!"" The<br /> guards turned around and he too managed to escape.<br /> Now it was the turn of the Auburn grad, wondering what disaster he could use<br /> (now that tornado and flood had been used).

44024,"<p>A blind man is walking down the street with his guide dog one<br /> day. They come to a busy intersection and the dog, ignoring the<br /> high volume of traffic zooming by on the street, leads the blind<br /> man right out into the thick of the traffic. This is followed by<br /> the screech of tires as panicked drivers try desperately not to<br /> run the pair down. Horns blaring, the blind man and the dog<br /> finally reach the safety of the sidewalk on the other side of<br /> the street and the blind man pulls a cookie out of his coat<br /> pocket which he offers to the dog.</p>
<p>A passerby, having observed the near fatal incident, can't<br /> control his amazement and says to the blind man, ""Why on earth<br /> are you rewarding your dog with a cookie? He nearly got you<br /> killed!""</p>
<p>The blind man turns partially in his direction and replies, ""To<br /> find out where his head is, so I can kick his ass!""</p>
"
44025,"<p>I. DOORS: Do not allow closed doors in any room. To get door opened, stand on hind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is opened, it is not necessary to use it. After you have ordered an ""outside"" door opened, stand halfway in and out and think about several things. This is particularly important during very cold weather, rain, snow, or mosquito season. Swinging doors are to be avoided at all costs. </p>
<p>II. CHAIRS AND RUGS: If you have to throw up, get to a chair quickly. If you cannot manage in time, get to an Oriental rug. If there is no Oriental rug, shag is good. When throwing up on the carpet, make sure you back up so that it is as long as the human's bare foot. </p>
<p>III. BATHROOMS: Always accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not necessary to do anything -- just sit and stare. </p>
<p>IV. HAMPERING: If one of your humans is engaged in some close activity and the other is idle, stay with the busy one. This is called ""helping"", otherwise known as ""hampering"". Following are the rules for ""hampering"":<br /> a) When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook. You cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on and then picked up and comforted.<br /> b) For book readers, get in close under the chin, between eyes and book, unless you can lie across the book itself.<br /> c) For knitting projects or paperwork, lie on the work in the most appropriate manner so as to obscure as much of the work or at least the most important part. Pretend to doze, but every so often reach out and slap the pencil or knitting needles. The worker may try to distract you; ignore it. Remember, the aim is to hamper work. Embroidery and needlepoint projects make great hammocks in spite of what the humans may tell you.<br /> d) For people paying bills (monthly activity) or working on income taxes or Christmas cards (annual activity), keep in mind the aim -- to hamper! First, sit on the paper being worked on. When dislodged, watch sadly from the side of the table. When activity proceeds nicely, roll around on the papers, scattering them to the best of your ability. After being removed for the second time, push pens, pencils, and erasers off the table, one at a time.<br /> e) When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him/her, be sure to jump on the back of the paper. They love to jump. </p>
<p>V. WALKING: As often as possible, dart quickly and as close as possible in front of the human, especially: on stairs, when they have something in their arms, in the dark, and when they first get up in the morning. This will help their coordination skills. </p>
<p>VI. BEDTIME: Always sleep on the human at night so s/he cannot move around.</p>

There will be lots of spiked eggnog and a small band playing traditional carols ... feel free to sing along. And don't be surprised if our CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus to light the Christmas tree! Exchange of gifts among employees can be done at that time; however, no gift should be over $10.<br /> Merry Christmas to you and your family.<br /> Patty Lewis - Human Resources Director</p>
<p>December 2nd<br /> TO: ALL EMPLOYEES<br /> In no way was yesterday's memo intended to exclude our Jewish employees. We recognize that Hanukkah is an important holiday that often coincides with Christmas (though unfortunately not this year). However, from now on we're calling it our ""Holiday Party."" The same policy applies to employees who are celebrating Kwanzaa at this time. There will be no Christmas tree and no Christmas carols sung.<br /> Happy Holidays to you and your family.<br /> Patty Lewis - Human Resources Director</p>
<p>December 3rd<br /> TO: ALL EMPLOYEES<br /> Regarding the anonymous note I received from a member of Alcoholics Anonymous requesting a non-drinking table, I'm happy to accommodate this request, but, don't forget, if I put a sign on the table that reads, ""AA Only,"" you won't be anonymous anymore. In addition, forget about the gifts exchange-no gifts will be allowed since the union members feel that $10 is too much money.<br /> Patty Lewis - Human Researchers Director</p>

But, you know, tomatoes have feelings, too. They scream when you slice them. I've heard them scream. I'm hearing them right now. Ha! I hope you all have a rotten holiday! Drive drunk and die, you hear me?<br /> The Bitch from Hell!</p>

<p>Kid says, ""First I sold him a small fish hook. Then I sold him a medium fish<br /> hook. Then I sold him a larger fish hook. Then I sold him a new fishing rod.<br /> Then I asked him where he was going fishing, and he said down at the coast, so I<br /> told him he was gonna need a boat, so we went down to the boat department, and I<br /> sold him that twin engine Chris Craft.

44056,"<p>THE DARWIN AWARDS are given every year to bestow upon (the remains of) those individuals, who through single-minded self-sacrifice, have done the most to remove undesirable elements from the human gene pool. </p>
<p>1997 DARWIN NOMINEES: </p>
<p>(# 1) Los Angeles, CA. Ani Saduki, 33, and his brother decided to remove a bees nest from a shed on their property with the aid of a pineapple. A pineapple is an illegal firecracker which is the explosive equivalent of one-half stick of dynamite. They ignited the fuse and retreated to watch from inside their home, behind a window some 10 feet away from the hive/shed. The concussion of the explosion shattered the window inwards, seriously lacerating Ani. Deciding Mr. Saduki need stitches, the brothers headed out to go to a nearby hospital. While walking towards their car, Ani was stung three times by the surviving bees. Unbeknownst to either brother, Ani was allergic to bee venom, and died of suffocation en route to the hospital. </p>
<p>(# 2) Derrick L. Richards, 28, was charged in April in Minneapolis with third-degree murder in the death of his beloved cousin, Kenneth E. Richards. According to police, Derrick suggested a game of Russian roulette and put a semiautomatic pistol (instead of the more traditional revolver) to Ken's head and fired. </p>
<p>(# 3) Phillipsburg, NJ. An unidentified 29 year old male choked to death on a sequined pastie he had orally removed from an exotic dancer at a local establishment. ""I didn't think he was going to eat it,"" the dancer identified only as ""Ginger"" said, adding ""He was really drunk."" </p>
<p>(# 4) In February, according to police in Windsor, Ont., Daniel Kolta, 27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a head-on collision, thus earning a tie in the game of chicken they were playing with their snowmobiles.</p>
<p>(# 5) MOSCOW, Russia-A drunk security man asked a colleague at the Moscow bank they were guarding to stab his bulletproof vest to see if it would protect him against a knife attack. It didn't, and the 25-year-old guard died of a heart wound. (It's good to see the Russians getting into the spirit of the Darwin Awards.) </p>
<p>(# 6) In France, Jacques LeFevrier left nothing to chance when he decided to commit suicide. He stood at the top of a tall cliff and tied a noose around his neck. He tied the other end of the rope to a large rock. He drank some poison and set fire to his clothes. He even tried to shoot himself at the last moment. He jumped and fired the pistol. The bullet missed him completely and cut through the rope above him. Free of the threat of hanging, he plunged into the sea. The sudden dunking extinguished the flames and made him vomit the poison. He was dragged out of the water by a kind fisherman and was taken to a hospital, where he died of hypothermia. </p>
<p>(# 7) RENTON, Washington, USA. On February 3, 1990, a Renton, Washington man tried to commit a robbery. This was probably his first attempt, as suggested by the fact that he had no previous record of violent crime, and by his terminally stupid choices as listed below: </p>
<p>1. The target was H&amp;J Leather &amp; Firearms, a gun shop. </p>
<p>2. The shop was full of customers, in a state where a substantial portion of the adult population is licensed to carry concealed handguns in public places. </p>
<p>3. To enter the shop, he had to step around a marked Police patrol car parked at the front door. </p>
<p>4. An officer in uniform was standing next to the counter, having coffee before reporting to duty. </p>
<p>Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a holdup and fired a few wild shots. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, removing him from the gene pool. Several other customers also drew their guns, but didn't fire. No one else was hurt. </p>
<p>1997 DARWIN AWARD HONORABLE MENTIONS (I.E. Non-fatalities) </p>
<p>Gulf Breeze, Florida, three unidentified teenage males were using a home video camera to film an action/adventure ""movie"" one of the boys had written. In a scene that called for each character to be ignited by fire, the ""special effects coordinator,"" age 15, prepared the ""stunt"" youth by dousing lighter fluid onto his clothes. The intentional fire, which proved unexpectedly difficult to extinguish, left the young man with third degree burns on his left arm, torso, and both legs. It was all captured on film. </p>
<p>In Bradford, PA, J. Cruwe, 28, caught a small snake in a container which he handed to his wife. She opened the container and, startled to see the snake, dropped it. The excited and poisonous snake immediately bit Mr. Cruwe on the shin. Mr Cruwe survived the wound and recovered after a short visit to the local emergency room. </p>
<p>TACOMA, WA - Kerry Bingham had been drinking with several friends when one of them said they knew a person who had bungee-jumped from the middle of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The conversation grew more heated and at least 10 men trooped along the walkway of the bridge at 4:30 a.m. Upon arrival at the midpoint of the bridge they discovered that no one had brought bungee rope. Bingham, who had continued drinking, volunteered and pointed out that a coil of lineman's cable lay nearby. One end of the cable was secured around Bingham's leg and the other end was tied to the bridge. His fall lasted 40 feet before the cable tightened and pulled his foot off at the ankle. He miraculously survived his fall into the frigid waters of the Tacoma Narrows and Puget Sound and was rescued by two nearby fishermen. ""All I can say,"" said Bingham, ""Is that God was watching out for me on that night. There's just no other explanation for it."" Bingham's severed foot was never located.</p>

44057,"<p>The eight-year old boy had never spoken a word-ever. One afternoon, as he sat eating his lunch he turned to his mother and said, ""Soup's cold.""<br /> His astonished mother exclaimed, ""Son, I've waited so long to hear you speak. But all these years you never said a thing. Why haven't you spoken before?""</p>
<p>The boy looked at her and replied, ""Up until now, everything's been okay.""</p>

"
44059,"<p>A very concerned woman calls her family doctor and says she is worried about her husband Joe,who for some reason started eating dog biscuits,consuming two or three boxes every week.The doctor agrees that such behavior is odd,but he doesn't believe there's any ingredient in the biscuit to harm Joe. The young wife,feeling better after hearing the doctor's assurance,thanked him and decided to forget about it. A few days later she calls the doctor again,this time late in the evening at the doctor's home,and in a panic.   Sobbing over the phone she explains that she awoke to find Joe wasn't in bed or in the house, and after hearing strange sounds coming from the back yard'she went to investegate.There was Joe, down on all fours,growling and occasionally howling at the moon. The doctor, in a very soothing bed-side manner,soon had the woman calmed down and told her he believed Joe was doing these doggie things for attention and she should ignore it. That seemed to appease Joe's wife so again she thanked the doctor and hung up.A week went by and the doctor began to second-guess himself,thinking maybe he had been too quick to shun off the seriousness of Joe's dilemma.So he decided to call and check.When Joe's wife answered ,the doctor told her why he was calling,she said ""Joe died 5 days ago."" The doctor was stunned.""I sincerely hope the dog biscuits had nothing to do with his death"" said the Doc. Oh No! said Joe's wife.""He was laying in the driveway licking his dick and the milk truck ran over him.""</p>
"
44060,"<p>Once there were two brothers Shutup and Trouble. One day Trouble<br /> got lost so Shutup went to find him. So as Shutup is driving<br /> down the street an officer pulls him over.</p>
<p>Officer: ""You were speeding what's your name?"" </p>
<p>Shutup: ""Shutup"" </p>
<p>Officer: ""That it I'll give you one more chance. What's your name?""</p>
<p>Shutup: ""Shutup"" </p>
<p>Officer: ""Are you looking for trouble?"" </p>
<p>Shutup: ""Yeah do you know where he is?""</p>

44061,"<p>The Lord spoke to Noah and said, ''In six months I am going to make it rain until the whole world is covered with water and all the evil things are destroyed. But, I want to save a few good people and two of every living thing on the planet. I am ordering you to build an ark.'' And, in a flash of lightning, he delivered the specifications for the ark. ''OK,'' Noah said, trembling with fear and fumbling with the blueprints, ''I'm your man.'' </p>
<p>Six months passed, the sky began to cloud up, and the rain began to fall in torrents. The Lord looked down and saw Noah sitting in his yard, weeping, and there was no ark. </p>
<p>''Noah!'' shouted the Lord, ''Where is My ark?'' A lightning bolt crashed into the ground right beside Noah. </p>
<p>''Lord, please forgive me!'' begged Noah. ''I did my best, but there were some big problems. First, I had to get a building permit for the ark's construction, but Your plans did not meet their code. So, I had to hire an engineer to redo the plans, only to get into a long argument with him about whether to include a sprinkler system. </p>
<p>''My neighbors objected, claiming that I was violating zoning ordinances by building the ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city planning board. </p>
<p>Then, I had a big problem getting enough wood for the ark, because there was a ban on cutting trees to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince the environmentalists and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that I needed the wood to save the owls, but they wouldn't let me catch them, so no owls. </p>
<p>''Next, I started gathering up the animals but got sued by an animal rights group that objected to me taking along only two of each kind. </p>
<p>''Just when the suit got dismissed, the EPA notified me that I couldn't complete the ark without filling out an environmental impact statement on Your proposed flood. They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the Supreme Being. Then, the Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed flood plan. I sent them a globe! </p>
<p>''Right now, I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Equal Opportunities Commission over how many minorities I'm supposed to hire. The IRS has seized all my assets claiming that I am trying to leave the country, and I just got a notice from the state that I owe some kind of use tax. Really, I don't think I can finish the ark in less than five years.'' </p>
<p>With that, the sky cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow arched across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled. ''You mean you are not going to destroy the world?'' he asked hopefully. </p>
<p>''No,'' said the Lord. ''The government already has.''</p>

44069,"<p>Many years ago, this man decided to go to a masked orgy with the<br /> knowledge that his wife would probably be out of town. Having<br /> not been to one since his bachelor party many years ago, he was<br /> excited and nervous. He eventually dressed as a knight, and<br /> arrived with high hopes.</p>
<p>When the man arrived, he saw that he was the only one dressed as<br /> anything like what he was, so he was naturally embarassed.<br /> However, the women were all over him, thinking that his costume<br /> was so cute. One woman in particular was hanging around him.<br /> Dressed in a raccoon costume, an old fetish of his for fur<br /> attracted him to her.</p>
<p>""I hope you don't mind my costume,"" she said. ""Don't worry, I<br /> have a thing for fur,"" replied the man. ""Do you want to go to<br /> bed?"" he added. The woman said, ""Yep, my husband doesn't need to<br /> know about this."" To this, the man said, ""Yeah, I cheat on my<br /> wife all the time, and ignorance is bliss.""</p>
<p>The two people went into a back room and started going at it in<br /> their costumes. They then went their separate ways for awhile<br /> and enjoyed the party. Two hours later, the man approached the<br /> woman.</p>
<p>""I had so much fun tonight... do you want to do it again<br /> sometime?"" he asked. ""Of course!"" replied the excited woman,<br /> ""here's my phone number... be careful about my husband."" She<br /> proceeded to give him his phone number.</p>
<p>The man bit his lip. ""That can't be. That's MY phone number.<br /> Unless... HOLY SHIT, YOU'RE MY WIFE!""</p>

<p>Clinton thinks it over, and says, ""I wish for peace in the middle east."" </p>
<p>""Where is that?"" the genie asks. </p>

<p>""Are you kidding? Do you have any idea how long they've been fighting over there? There's no way I can stop that! Pick another wish instead."" </p>
<p>Clinton thinks it over and says, ""I wish that the American people wouldn't make fun of me and my wife, and that I will be remembered as the best President of all time."" </p>
<p>The genie says, ""Let me see that map again.""</p>
"
44071,"<p>There was an opening with the CIA as an assassin. These highly classified positions are hard to fill, and there's a lot of testing and background checks involved before you can even be considered for the position. After sending some applicants through the background checks, training and testing, they narrowed the possible choices down to three men but only one position was available.</p>
<p>So the day came for the final test to see which man would get the extremely secretive job. The CIA men administering the test took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. </p>
<p>`We must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances,' they explained.<br /> 'Inside this room you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her.'</p>
<p>The man got a shocked look on his face and said,<br /> 'You can't be serious! I could never shoot my own wife.'</p>
<p>'Well,' says the CIA man, 'you're definitely not the right man for the job then.'</p>
<p>So they bring the second man to the same door and hand him a gun.<br /> 'We must know that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances,' they explained to the second man.<br /> `Inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her�</p>
<p>The second man looked a bit shocked, but nevertheless took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about five minutes, and then the door opened and the man came out with tears in his eyes. </p>
<p>'I tried to shoot her but I just couldn't pull the trigger and shoot my own wife. I guess I'm not the right man for the job.'</p>
<p>'No,' the CIA man replied, `you don't have what it takes. Take your wife and get the hell home.'</p>
<p>Now the CIA are down to one man left to test. Again they lead him to the same door of the same room and give him the same gun.<br /> 'We must be sure that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances. This is your final test. Inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair, take this gun and kill her.'</p>
<p>The third man took the gun and opened the door and before the door had even closed all the way, the CIA heard the gun start firing, one shot after another for 13 shots. Then all hell broke loose in the room. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. This went on for several minutes, and then all went quiet. The door opened slowly, and there stood the third man. He wiped the sweat from his brow and said, </p>
<p>`You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with f***ing blanks. I had to beat the bitch to death with the chair.'</p>

44073,"<p>Earlier this summer, down on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert, an<br /> hour east of Bakersfield, a fellow new to boating was having a problem. No<br /> matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't get his brand new 22-ft Bayliner<br /> to perform.  It wouldn't get on a plane at all, and was very sluggish in<br /> almost every maneuver, no matter how much power he supplied.</p>
<p>After about an hour of trying to make it go, he putted over to a nearby<br /> marina. Maybe they could tell him what was wrong.</p>
<p>A thorough topside check revealed everything was in perfect working order.<br /> The engine ran fine, the outdrive went up and down, the prop was the<br /> correct size and pitch.  So, one of the marina guys jumped in the water to<br /> check underneath. He came up choking on water, he was laughing so hard.<br /> Under the boat, still strapped securely in place, was the trailer.</p>

44079,"<p>A blind man was seen waiting at a street corner with his guide dog. After a short wait the dog started leading the blind man across the street against the red light.</p>
<p>First a car comes screeching to a halt inches away from him, but still the dog leads on, then a bicyclist almost wipes them out and curses as he goes by. Finally in the last lane a truck swerves and barely misses them.</p>
<p>After they reach the far corner the blind man reaches in his pocket and pulls out a cookie and offers it to the guide dog.</p>
<p>At this point another person who has watched the entire episode interrupts asking why he was rewarding the dog after the dog had endangered his life and almost got him run over by a car, bicycle and truck.</p>
<p>The blind man responded: ""I'm not rewarding him, I'm just trying to find out which end is his head so I can kick him in the ass.""</p>

44090,"<p>PISCES: Feb 19 - Mar 20<br /> You have a vivid imagination and often think you are being followed by<br /> the CIA or FBI.

<p>He walked up to the farmer and said,""Hey, that's a nice donkey you got there. I think I'll take it.""</p>
<p>The farmer replied,""That's not a donkey, that's an ass.""</p>
<p>So, the man said,""Okay, then,I'll take the ass.""  Then he walked over to the chicken coup and said,""I like that chicken.  I'll take it too.""</p>
<p>The farmer replied,""That is a pullet.""</p>
<p>So the man said,""Okay, I'll take the pullet.""<br /> He was looking at a rooster and said,""Well, I guess I'll take the rooster, too.""</p>
<p>The farmer replied,""That's not a rooster, it's a cock.""</p>
<p>So they load the pullet and the cock into the back of the man's truck and tie the ass to the back.  The man then pays the farmer as the farmer tells him,""Now, sometimes the ass gets a little stubborn and he stops.  All you have to do is get out and scratch his back, and he'll go again.""</p>
<p>So the man drives away.  All of a sudden, the ass stops, and the pullet and the cock fly out of the back.  The man is trying to get them back when a woman comes out and says,""Can I help you?""</p>
<p>The man replies,""Yeah, could you grab my cock and pullet while I scratch my ass?""</p>

44097,"<p>I know a mother-in-law who sleeps in her spectacles, the better to see her son-in-law suffer in her dreams.                       - Attributed to Ernest Coquelin  However much you dislike you mother-in-law you must not set fire to her.      - Ernest Wild  Distrust all mothers-in-law. They are completely unscrupulous in what they say in court. The wife's mother is always more prejudiced against the husband than even the most ill-treated wife. If I had my way, I am afraid I would abolish mothers-in-law entirely.                       - Sir Geoffrey Wrangham  Behind every successful man stands a devoted wife and a surprised mother-in-law.  Adam and Eve were the happiest and the luckiest couple in the world, because neither of them had a mother-in-law. Sometimes you cannot tell if a man is trying so hard to be a success to please his wife or to spite his mother-in-law. Does it really surprise anyone that Mother-in-Law's Day occurs less than one week before Halloween?  My mother-in-law was bitten by a dog yesterday. How is she now ? She's fine. But, the dog died.  Hello. Your mother-in-law fell into my pool with crocodiles. The crocodiles are yours, so you save them.  A pharmacist tells a customer: In order to buy arsenic you should need a legal prescription. A picture of your mother-in-law just isn't enough.  Mother to daughter: Your boyfriend such a jerk that I would be delighted to be his mother-in-law.  A husband and wife were shopping when the wife said, ''Darling, its my mothers birthday tomorrow. What shall we buy for her? She would like something electric.'' The husband replied, ''How about a chair?!?''  The doorbell rang this morning. When I opened the door there was my mother-in-law on the front step. She said ''Can I stay here for a few days?'' I said: ''Sure you can.'' and shut the door in her face.  I used to not get on with my mother-in-law, but over the last few months I've developed quite an attachment for her. It goes over her head and a strap comes down under her chin to keep her mouth shut!</p>

<p>I will wear camouflage every day and tuck my trousers into my boots because I<br /> can't figure out how to use blousing straps. I promise to wear my uniform 24<br /> hours a day even when I have a date. I will continue telling myself that I am a<br /> fierce killing machine because my drill sergeant told me I am, despite the fact<br /> that the only action I ever will see is a court martial for sexual harassment. </p>
<p>I acknowledge the fact that I will make E-8 in my first year of service, and<br /> vow to maintain that it is because I scored perfect on my PT test. After<br /> completion of my sexual -- er -- I mean, BASIC training, I will attend a<br /> different Army school once every other month and return knowing less than I did<br /> when I left. </p>
<p>On my first trip home after boot camp, I will walk around like I am cool and<br /> propose to my ninth-grade sweetheart. I will make my wife stay home, because if<br /> I let her out she might leave me for a smarter, better-looking Air Force guy.<br /> Should she leave me twelve times, I will continue to take her back. </p>
<p>While at work, I will maintain a look of knowledge while getting absolutely<br /> nothing accomplished. I will arrive at work every day at 1000 hours because of<br /> morning PT and leave every day at 1300 hours to report back to the ""COMPANY."" I<br /> understand that I will undergo no training whatsoever that will help me get a<br /> job upon separation, and will end up working construction with my friends from<br /> high school. I will brag to everyone about the Army giving me $30,000 for<br /> college, but will be unable to use it because I can't pass a placement exam. </p>
<p>So help me God. </p>

44117,"<p>Years ago, while lying in my hammock and drinking JD from the bottle. I noticed my dog dragging something under the fence. Upon inspection, to my dismay, I realised it was the next door neighbour's 10 year old daughter's rabbit. For years I had watch her come home from school and head straight out to it's cage, free it and play with it in the yard. I knew today would be no different and fearing for our dog, I had to think fast.The rabbit was quite dirty, as if it had put up quite a struggle, so I washed it off with the hose, combed it with the Dog brush and blew it dry with the leaf blower. Upon finishing it's grooming I jumped the fence and replaced back in it's cage, hoping it's death would be written off as ""natural causes"".Back to the hammock and JD. Within the hour the neighbour's Volvo pulled in as usual and out popped the little girl, and as usual she headed straight for the cage. Only this time she stopped about six feet away and screamed: ""DDDAAAADDDDDDDYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""Her father, panic stricken, stood looking at the cage. Being the good neighbour that I am I rushed to fence and asked if there was anything I could do.Her father less than calmly blurted, ""What kind of sick individual would dig up a little girl's dead rabbit and put it back in it's cage??""</p>

44141,"<p>One dark night outside a small town, a fire started inside the local chemical plant. Before long it exploded into flames and an alarm went out to fire departments from miles around. After fighting the fire for over an hour, the chemical company president approached the fire chief and said, ""All of our secret formulas are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They must be saved! I will give $50,000 to the engine company that brings them out safely!""As soon as the chief heard this, he ordered the firemen to strengthen their attack on the blaze. After two more hours of attacking the fire, president of the company offered $100,000 to the engine company that could bring out the company's secret files. From the distance a long siren was heard and another fire truck came into sight. It was a local volunteer fire company composed entirely of men over 65.To everyone's amazement the little fire engine raced through the chemical plant gates and drove straight into the middle of the inferno. In the distance the other firemen watched as the old timers hopped off of their rig and began to fight the fire with an effort that they had never seen before.After an hour of intense fighting the volunteer company had extinguished the fire and saved the secret formulas. Joyous, the chemical company president announced that he would double the reward to $200,000 and walked over to personally thank each of the volunteers. After thanking each of the old men individually, the president asked the group what they intended to do with the reward money. The fire truck driver looked him right in the eye and said, ""The first thing we're going to do is fix the dang brakes on that truck!""</p>

44184,"<p>Q:  How many members of the U.S.S. Enterprise does it take to change a light bulb?A:  7. Scotty will report to Captain Kirk that the light bulb in the Engineering Section is burnt out, to which Kirk will send Bones to pronounce the bulb dead. Scotty, after checking around, notices that they have no more new light bulbs, and complains that he can't see in the dark to tend to his engines. Kirk must make an emergency stop at the next uncharted planet, Alpha Regula IV, to procure a light bulb from the natives. Kirk, Spock, Bones, Sulu, and 3 red shirt security officers beam down. The 3 security officers are promptly killed by the natives, and the rest of the landing party is captured. Meanwhile, back in orbit, Scotty notices a Klingon ship approaching and must warp out of orbit to escape detection. Bones cures the native king who is suffering from the flu, and as a reward the landing party is set free and given all of the light bulbs they can carry. Scotty cripples the Klingon ship and warps back to the planet just in time to beam up Kirk et. al. The new bulb is inserted, and the Enterprise continues with its five year mission.</p>

44208,"<p>Three friars were behind on their belfry payments, so they opened a small florist shop to raise funds. Since everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of God, the rival florist across town thought the competition was&lt; unfair.<br /> He asked the good fathers to close down, but they would not. He went back and begged the friars to close down, but they would not. He asked his mother to go and ask the friars to get out of the business. They would not. </p>
<p>So, the rival florist hired Hugh McTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to persuade them to close. Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store, saying he'd be back if they didn't close their business. Terrified, they did so - thereby proving that: </p>
<p>Hugh, and only Hugh can prevent florist friars.</p>

44217,"<p>There was a little boy who prayed every night for two weeks,<br /> asking God for $100. When he got no response, he thought it<br /> would be a good idea to write to God and see if that worked.</p>
<p>The post office received the letter addressed to ""GOD, USA.""<br /> They decided that it would be best to just forward the letter to<br /> President Clinton. The president read the letter and thought it<br /> was cute, so he asked his secretary to send the boy $5, thinking<br /> the boy would think that was a lot of money for a little boy.</p>
<p>When the boy got the letter, he was so excited that he sat down<br /> immediately to write a thank-you letter. ""Dear God,"" he wrote,<br /> ""Thank you very much for the money you sent. I suppose it is to<br /> be expected, but I thought you should know that when you sent it<br /> through Washington, D.C., the stinkers deducted $95.""</p>

44218,"<p>A programmer and an engineer are sitting next to each other on a long flight<br /> from Los Angeles to New York.</p>
<p>The programmer leans over to the engineer and asks if he would like to play a<br /> fun game.</p>
<p>The engineer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over<br /> to the window to catch a few winks.</p>
<p>The programmer persists and explains that the game is real easy and is a lot<br /> of fun. He explains ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you<br /> pay me $5. Then you ask me a question, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay<br /> you $5.""</p>
<p>Again, the engineer politely declines and tries to get to sleep.</p>
<p>The programmer, now somewhat agitated, says, ""OK, if you don't know the answer<br /> you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $100!""</p>
<p>This catches the engineer's attention, and he sees no end to this torment<br /> unless he plays, so he agrees to the game.</p>
<p>The programmer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to<br /> the moon?"" The engineer doesn't say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls<br /> out a five dollar bill and hands it to the programmer.</p>
<p>Now, it's the engineer's turn. He asks the programmer ""What goes up a hill<br /> with three legs, and comes down on four?""</p>
<p>The programmer looks up at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop<br /> computer and searches all of his references. He taps into the Air phone with his<br /> modem and searches the net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends<br /> e-mail to his co-workers--all to no avail.</p>
<p>After about an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $100. The engineer<br /> politely takes the $100 and turns away to try to get back to sleep. The<br /> programmer, more than a little miffed, shakes the engineer and asks ""Well, so<br /> what's the answer?"" Without a word, the engineer reaches into his wallet, hands<br /> the programmer $5, and turns away to get back to sleep.</p>

44219,"<p>A guy driving a Yugo pulled up to a stoplight next to a Rolls Royce. He rolled down his window and shouted to the driver of the Rolls. ""Hey, buddy, that's a nice car. You got a phone in your Rolls? I've got a phone in my Yugo!""</p>
<p>The driver of the Rolls looked over and said snobbishly, ""Yes, I have a phone.""</p>
<p>The driver of the Yugo said, ""That's great man! Hey, you got a TV in there? You know, I got a TV in the back seat of my Yugo!""</p>
<p>The driver of the Rolls, quite irritated by now, replied, ""Of course, I have a television. A Rolls Royce is the finest luxury car in the world!""</p>
<p>The driver of the Yugo said, ""Yes, a very cool car! Hey, you got a bed in there? I got a bed in the back of my Yugo!""</p>
<p>The driver of the Rolls, upset that he did not have a bed, sped away and went straight to the dealer, where he promptly ordered a bed to be installed in the back of his Rolls Royce.</p>
<p>The next morning, he returned to pick up his car, and the bed looked superb. It came complete with silk sheets and a brass-trimmed headboard. It was clearly a bed fit for a Rolls-Royce.</p>
<p>So the driver of the Rolls began searching for the Yugo. He drove around all day and finally found the Yugo late that night. It was parked, with all the windows fogged up from the inside.</p>
<p>He got out and knocked on the window of the Yugo. When there wasn't any answer, he continued knocking and knocking until finally, the owner of the Yugo lowered the window, and stuck his soaking wet head out.</p>
<p>""I now have a bed in the back of my Rolls-Royce,"" the driver of the Rolls stated arrogantly.</p>
<p>The driver of the Yugo looked at him narrowly and said, ""You got me out of the shower to tell me THIS?!?!</p>

<p>Many women are afraid of their first mammogram, but there's no need to worry. By taking a few minutes each day with the following exercises a week before the exam, you will be totally prepared for the test -- and best of all -- you can do these simple practice exercises right in your home.</p>
<p>EXERCISE ONE: Open your refrigerator door and insert one breast between the door and the main box. Have one of your strongest friends slam the door shut as hard as possible -- and then lean on the door for good measure. Hold that position for five seconds. Repeat again in case the first time wasn't effective enough.</p>
<p>EXERCISE TWO: Go into your garage at 3 a.m. when the temperature of the cement floor is just right. Take off all your clothes and lie comfortably on the floor with one breast wedged under the rear of the car. Ask a friend to slowly back the car up until your breast is sufficiently flattened and chilled. Turn over and repeat for the other breast.</p>
<p>EXERCISE THREE: Freeze two metal bookends overnight. Strip to the waist. Invite a stranger into the room. Press the bookends together as hard as you can. Set an appointment with the stranger to meet next year and do it again.</p>
<p>You are now properly prepared. Final thoughts for women readers:</p>

44239,"<p>Sometimes a story comes along that needs no polishing or enhancement to make it better. This is one of those. It is a real letter submitted to the IRS the midst of 1995's weird and bizarre denial of dependents, exemptions and credits. The letter speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Dear Sirs:</p>
<p>I am responding to your letter denying the deduction for two of the three dependents I claimed on my 1994 Federal Tax return. Thank you, I have questioned whether or not these are my children for years. They are evil and expensive. </p>
<p>It's only fair that, since they are minors and no longer my responsibility, the government should know something about them and what to expect over the next year. Please do not try to reassign them to me next year and reinstate the deduction. They are yours! </p>
<p>The oldest, Kristen, is now 17. She is brilliant. Ask her! I suggest you put her to work in your office where she can answer people's questions about their returns. While she has no formal training, it has not seemed to hamper her mastery of any subject you can name. Taxes should be a breeze. </p>
<p>Next year she is going to college. I think it's wonderful that you will now be responsible for that little expense. While you mull that over, keep in mind that she has a truck. It doesn't run at the moment, so you have the choice of appropriating some Department of Defense funds to fix the vehicle, or getting up early to drive her to school. </p>
<p>Kristen also has a boyfriend. Oh joy! While she possesses all of the wisdom of the universe, her alleged mother and I have felt it best to occasionally remind her of the virtues of abstinence, or in the face of overwhelming passion, safe sex. This is always uncomfortable, and I am quite relieved you will be handling this in the future. May I suggest that you reinstate Dr. Jaclyn Elders who had a rather good handle on the problem.</p>
<p>Patrick is 14. I've had my suspicions about this one. His eyes are a little closer together than those of normal people. He may be a tax examiner himself one day, if he is not incarcerated first. In February, I was awakened at three in the morning by a police officer who was bringing Pat home. He and his friends were TP'ing houses. </p>
<p>In the future, would you like him delivered to the local IRS office, or to Ogden, UT? Kids at 14 will do almost anything on a dare. His hair is purple. Permanent dye, temporary dye, what's the big deal? Learn to deal with it. You'll have plenty of time, as he is sitting out a few days of school after instigating a food fight in the cafeteria. </p>
<p>I'll take care of filing your phone number with the vice principal. Oh yes, he and all of his friends have raging hormones. This is the house of testosterone and it will be much more peaceful when he lives in your home. </p>
<p>DO NOT leave him or his friends unsupervised with girls, explosives, inflammables, inflatables, vehicles, or telephones. (They find telephones a source of unimaginable amusement. Be sure to lock out the 900 and 976 numbers!) </p>
<p>Heather is an alien. She slid through a time warp and appeared as if by magic one year. I'm sure this one is yours. She is 10 going on 21. She came from a bad trip in the sixties. She wears tie-dyed clothes, beads, sandals, and hair that looks like Tiny Tim's. </p>
<p>Fortunately you will be raising my taxes to help offset the pinch of her remedial reading courses. ""Hooked On Phonics"" is expensive, so the schools dropped it. But here's the good news! You can buy it yourself for half the amount of the deduction that you are denying me!</p>
<p>It's quite obvious that we were terrible parents (ask the other two). She cannot speak English. Most people under twenty understand the curious patois she fashioned out of valley girls/boys in the hood/reggae/yuppie/political double speak. The school sends her to a speech pathologist who has her roll her r's. It added a refreshing Mexican/Irish touch to her voice. </p>
<p>She wears hats backwards, baggy pants, and wants one of her ears pierced four more times. There is a fascination with tattoos that worries me, but I am sure that you can handle it. Bring a truck when you come to get her, she sort of ""nests"" in her room and I think that it would be easier to move the entire thing than find out what it is really made of. </p>
<p>You denied two of the three exemptions, so it is only fair that you get to pick which two you will take. I prefer that you take the youngest two, I will still go bankrupt with Kristen's college, but then I am free! If you take the two oldest, then I still have time for counseling before Heather becomes a teenager. </p>
<p>If you take the two girls, then I won't feel so bad about putting Patrick in a military academy. Please let me know of your decision as soon as possible, as I have already increased the withholding on my W-4 to cover the $395 in additional tax and made a down payment on an airplane.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Bob</p>
<p>Note: The IRS allowed the deductions and reinstated his refund.</p>

44260,"<p>If you have raised kids (or been one), and gone through the pet syndrome including toilet-flush burials for dead goldfish It's a long story but one that will have you laughing out LOUD!!</p>
<p>Overview: I had to take my son's hamster to the vet. Here's what happened:</p>
<p>Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was something wrong with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room. ""He's just lying there looking sick,"" he told me, ""I'm serious, Dad. Can you help?""</p>
<p>I put my best hamster-healer look on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do. (Call my wife.)</p>
<p>""Honey,"" I called, ""come look at the hamster!"" ""Oh, my gosh,"" my wife diagnosed after a minute. ""She's having babies."" ""What?"" My son demanded.</p>
<p>""But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!""</p>
<p>I was equally outraged. ""Hey, how can that be?! I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce!"" I accused my wife. ""Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?!"" She inquired. (I actually think she had the gall to say this sarcastically.)</p>
<p>""No, but you were supposed to get two boys!"" I reminded her (in my most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth together). ""Yeah, Bert and Ernie!"" My son agreed. ""Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know,"" she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm, ya think?)</p>
<p>By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. ""Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience,"" I announced. ""We're about to witness the miracle of birth.""</p>
<p>""OH, Gross!"" They shrieked.</p>
<p>""Well, isn't THAT just great! What are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?"" My wife wanted to know. (I really do think she was being snotty here, too. Don't you?)</p>
<p>We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. ""We don't appear to be making much progress,"" I noted.</p>
<p>""It's breech,"" my wife whispered, horrified. ""Do something, Dad!"" My son urged. ""Okay, okay."" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gingerly tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results.</p>
<p>""Should I call 911?"" My eldest daughter wanted to know,"" Maybe they could talk us through the trauma."" (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?)</p>
<p>""Let's get Ernie to the vet,"" I said grimly.</p>
<p>We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in hislap. ""Breathe, Ernie, breathe,"" he urged.</p>
<p>""I don't think hamsters do Lamaze,"" his mother noted to him. (Women can be so cruel to their own young. I mean what she does to ME is one thing, but this boy is of her womb.)</p>
<p>The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass. ""What do you think, Doc, a c-section?"" I suggested scientifically. My son appeared impressed by my observation.</p>
<p>""Oh, very interesting,"" he murmured. ""Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?"" I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.</p>
<p>""Is Ernie going to be okay?"" My wife asked. ""Oh, perfectly,"" the vet assured us.</p>
<p>""This hamster is not in labor. In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen Ernie is a boy.""</p>
<p>""What?""</p>
<p>""You see, Ernie is a young male AND occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um .... er ... masturbate, just the way he did, lying on his back."" He blushed, glancing at my wife. ""Well, you know what I'm saying, Mr. Cameron.""</p>
<p>We were silent, absorbing this.</p>
<p>""So Ernie's just ... just ... excited?""! My wife offered.</p>
<p>""Exactly,"" the vet replied, relieved that we understood. More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle. And laugh. And then even laugh loudly!</p>
<p>""What's so funny?"" I demanded, knowing, but not believing that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless manliness. Tears were now running down her face.</p>
<p>""It's just ... that ... I'm picturing you pulling on its ... its teeny little ..."" she gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.</p>
<p>""That's enough,"" I warned.</p>
<p>We thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be okay.</p>
<p>""I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad,"" he told me.</p>
<p>""Oh, you have NO idea,"" my wife agreed, once again collapsing into laughter.</p>
<p>Enough said.</p>

I'm in hell!Satan:  Hell's not so bad. We actually have a lot of fun down here.  You a drinking man?Guy: Sure, I love to drink.Satan:  Well you're gonna love Mondays then. On Mondays that's all we do is drink.  Whiskey, tequila, Guinness, wine coolers, diet tab and fresca... we drink till we throw up  and then we drink some more! And we don't worry about getting a hangover, because you're dead anyway.Guy: Gee, that sounds great!Satan:  You a smoker?Guy: You better believe it!Satan:  All right!  You're gonna love Tuesdays.  We get the finest cigars from all over the world and smoke our lungsout. If you get cancer - no biggie, you're already dead, remember?Guy: Wow...  that's awesome!Satan:  I bet you like to gamble.Guy: Why yes, as a matter of fact I do.Satan:  Cause Wednesdays you can gamble all you want. Craps, Blackjack, Roulette, Poker, Slots, whatever. If you go bankrupt you're dead anyhow.Satan:  What about Drugs?!?Guy: Are you kidding? Love drugs! You don't mean...Satan: That's right! Thursday is drug day. Help yourself to a great big bowl of crack, or smack. Smoke a doobie the size of a submarine. You can do all the drugs you want, you're dead, who cares.Guy: WOW!  I never realized Hell was such a cool place!Satan:  You gay?Guy: No...Satan:  Ooooh (grimaces).  You're gonna hate Fridays.</p>
"
44271,"<p>Because I'm a guy, I must hold the television remote control in<br /> my hand while I watch TV. If the thing has been misplaced, I'll<br /> miss a whole show looking for it, though one time I was able to<br /> survive by holding a calculator. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, when I lock my keys in the car I will fiddle<br /> with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we<br /> call a road service until long after hypothermia has set in. Oh,<br /> and when the car isn't running very well, I will pop the hood<br /> and stare at the engine as if I know what I'm looking at. If<br /> another guy shows up, one of us will say to the other, ""I used<br /> to be able to fix these things, but now with all these computers<br /> and everything, I wouldn't know where to start."" We will then<br /> drink beer. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, when I catch a cold I need someone to bring<br /> me soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan. You<br /> never get as sick as I do, so for you this isn't an issue. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I can be relied upon to purchase basic<br /> groceries at the store, like milk, or bread. I cannot be<br /> expected to find exotic items like ""Cumin"" or ""Tofu."" For all I<br /> know these are the same thing. And never, under any<br /> circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which ""feminine<br /> hygiene product"" is a euphemism. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, when one of our appliances stops working I<br /> will insist on taking it apart, despite evidence that this will<br /> just cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and<br /> has to put it back together. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I<br /> don't think we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen<br /> to a complete stranger--how the heck could HE know where we're<br /> going? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, there is no need to ask me what I'm thinking<br /> about. The answer is always either sex or football, though I<br /> have to make up something else when you ask, so don't. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I do not want to visit your mother, or have<br /> your mother come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or<br /> think about her any more than I have to. Whatever you got her<br /> for mother's day is ok, I don't need to see it. Did you remember<br /> to pick up something for my mom, too? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I am capable of announcing, ""one more beer<br /> and I really have to go,"" and mean it every single time I say<br /> it, even when it gets to the point that the one bar closes and<br /> my buddies and I have to go hunt down another. I will find it<br /> increasingly hilarious to have my pals call you to tell you I'll<br /> be home soon, and no, I don't understand why you threw all my<br /> clothes into the front yard. What's the connection? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, you don't have to ask me if I liked the<br /> movie. Chances are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, yes, I have to turn up the radio when Bruce<br /> Springsteen or The Doors comes on, and then, yes, I have to tell<br /> you every single time about how Bruce had his picture on the<br /> cover of Time and Newsweek the same day, or how Jim Morrison is<br /> buried in Paris and everyone visits his grave. Please do not<br /> behave as if you do not find this fascinating. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I think what you're wearing is fine. I<br /> thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too.<br /> Either pair of shoes is fine. With the belt or without it looks<br /> fine. Your hair is fine. You look fine. Can we just go now? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy and this is, after all, the 90's, I will share<br /> equally in the housework. You do the laundry, the cooking, the<br /> cleaning, and the dishes, and I'll do the rest.</p>

44364,"<p>Q:  How many SAS programmers does it take to change a light bulb?A:  One to analyze the historical failure rates of lightbulbs using PROC LIFEREG, so as to anticipate the failure of the lightbulb before the user actually has to report it, one to explain why SAS is better for changing lightbulbs than S-Plus, SPSS/X, BMDP, SYSTAT, MINITAB or a spreadsheet, one to write a custom interface in AF/SCL allowing the user to manually request the changing of the light bulb after its failure (prematurely) occurs, one to write a report with PROC SQL and PROC REPORT which will summarize the lightbulbs needing to be changed, sorted twelve different ways, cross-indexed (by wattage, type, and prematureness-of-failure) and totaled, one to actually spin the light bulb into the socket using SAS/Insight, one to call Cary to try to get them to explain when a new version of the lightbulb will ship, how much we'll pay to keep using lightbulbs for another year, and what we'll do if our site sends all its lightbulbs to Europe where 120V/60Hz lightbulbs tend to explode upon insertion in 220V/50Hz circuits, one to write an incomprehensible ten line SAS macro program which will perpetually insert new filaments into all mission critical lightbulbs until its author is fired, at which point the SAS macro will automatically encode itself into a copy of the latest SAS/ETS usage notes, one to write a graphical front end to the lightbulb changing process using SAS/EIS, with little speedometers showing the number of lightbulbs changed per hour, so that management can understand why we need to buy bigger lightbulbs, one to  prepare a SUGI paper summarizing the entire lightbulb project, taking credit for the design and execution of the lightbulb project itself as well as the invention of the light bulb itself, another one to prepare a second SUGI paper benchmarking lightbulb replacement on twelve different types of light sockets, with separate graphs for florescent and incandescent bulbs (made with SAS/Graph, except for the titling, axes, color, polylines, and background, which were all added manually with Cricket Graph on a Mac), ten to push the dollie loaded with SAS/Lightbulb manuals, *and*, One more to ask SAS-L for help when you really need to change that bulb, NOW.</p>

44374,"<p>Back in the olden days when Samurai were important, there was a powerful Japanese Emperor who needed a new Chief Samurai. So he sent out a declaration throughout the entire known world of that time that he was searching for a CHIEF Samurai. A year passed, but only 3 people applied for the very demanding position;</p>
<p>1. a Japanese Samurai<br /> 2. a Chinese Samurai<br /> 3. a Jewish Samurai </p>
<p>The emperor asked the Japanese Samurai to come in and demonstrate why he should be the chief Samurai. The Japanese Samurai opened a match box, and out popped a bumblebee. Whoosh! went his sword, and the bumblebee dropped dead on the ground.</p>
<p>The emperor exclaimed ""That is very impressive!""</p>
<p>The emperor then issued the same challenge to the Chinese Samurai, to come in and demonstrate why<br /> he should be chosen. The Chinese samurai also opened a match box and out buzzed a fly. Whoosh, Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! And the fly dropped dead on the ground in four small pieces.</p>
<p>The emperor exclaimed: ""That is VERY impressive!""</p>
<p>Now the emperor turned to the Jewish Samurai, and asked him to demonstrate why he should be the Chief Samurai. The Jewish Samurai also opened a match box, and out flew a gnat. His flashing sword went Whoosh! But the gnat was still alive and flying around.</p>
<p>The emperor, obviously disappointed, said: ""Very ambitious!, but why is that gnat not dead?""</p>

Told flea to jump, and nothing happened. He did not want to take a chance, so he repeated the experiment several times, and the leg less flea never jumped.

44412,"<p>Between moments of dispensing wisdom, it seems that historical religious<br /> leaders had also learned software programming. One day, a great contest<br /> was held to test their skills.</p>
<p>After days and days of fierce competition, only two leaders remained for<br /> the last day's event: Jesus and Mohammed.</p>
<p>The judge described the software application required for the final<br /> test, and gave the signal to start writing code.</p>
<p>The two contestants feverishly typed away on their keyboards. Routines,<br /> classes, applets and applications flew by on their screens at incredible<br /> speeds. Windows, dialogs, and other intricate graphics began forming on<br /> their monitors. The clock showed that the contest would soon be<br /> finished.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bolt of lightening flashed and the power went out. After a<br /> moment it came back on - just in time for the clock to announce that the<br /> last competition was over.</p>
<p>The judge asked the two contestants to reveal their finished software.<br /> Mohammed angrily said that he'd lost it all in the power outage. The<br /> judge turned to the other competitor. Jesus smiled, clicked a mouse and a<br /> dazzling application appeared on his screen. After just a few moments, the<br /> judge<br /> was clearly impressed and declared Jesus the victor.</p>
<p>When asked why the decision was made, the judge pointed out the unique<br /> characteristic that set the winner apart from all the other leaders:</p>
<p>Jesus saves.</p>
<p>He also backup'ed to CD. That is, ""Once saved, always saved!""</p>

<p>A police car stops behind his and the officer strolls to him to offer help. </p>
<p>The man says he's doing OK and doesn't need help. </p>
<p>The officer takes a walk around the car to make sure everything is OK. </p>
<p>He spots a large knife with a fancy handle on the passenger seat. </p>
<p>When he asks about the knife, the man says it's his and he uses it as a juggler at the local circus. </p>
<p>The officer then asks him to demonstrate his act to be sure the man is telling the truth, and the man goes through his routine. </p>
<p>Meanwhile a car with two recovering alcoholics drives by. The driver says to his passenger, ""Man ... I am glad I stopped drinking when I did. </p>
<p>It's amazing what they make them do these days at those roadside sobriety checks!""</p>

44420,"<p>The inventor of dormitories . . . let's find him, make him pay for the<br /> travesties he's visited on America's youth, and force him to listen to </p>
<p>Matchbox 20. Can't you see him designing these hellish stacks of </p>
<p>humanity many years ago? From the sidewalk he raised his hands </p>
<p>triumphantly and said, ""It shall be like the projects with less violence </p>
<p>and more marijuana!"" He then took lumber and Elmer's Paste, as it is </p>
<p>often called, to create these pet carrier sized rooms that we live in. </p>
<p>You wanna know why people from the projects hardly ever go to college? </p>
<p>It's because they don't want to leave their lush surroundings. </p>
<p>The actual term dormitory is of course derived from the Latin term </p>
<p>for sleep, which is appropriate because that is all you have space to </p>
<p>do. You have to do it standing up in the bathroom sink but it can be </p>
<p>done. The luckier students have space to scratch their asses but the </p>
<p>windows have to be open and their roommates have to be gone for the </p>
<p>weekend. When you go home the closets even feel like a gymnasium, and </p>
<p>you can romp around in the bathroom like a horny antelope. </p>
<p>I can't imagine the kids who brought everything they own to the </p>
<p>dorm. I brought like a condom and a sock. Next semester I hope to have a </p>
<p>towel and the other sock. I also need a new condom. Forget </p>
<p>having space to sleep. Who sleeps anyway? Nobody on my campus. </p>
<p>I think it's a rule. This one kid tried but no one knows what happened </p>
<p>to him. Let's just say his floormates never saw him awake again. I feel </p>
<p>like I'm a member of the national insomnia coalition. 0ur agenda </p>
<p>involves a lot of Frappacino and staring at the test pattern on tv. It's </p>
<p>like this strange pseudo-vampire lifestyle. Did you know that if you </p>
<p>stay up late enough they play the Tonight Show over again and it still </p>
<p>isn't funny? No sleep really fucks with your eating habits too. Every </p>
<p>night at 2 in the morning you get as hungry as a Bosnian and you have to </p>
<p>go to the vending machine to watch the one bagel spin in the carousel of </p>
<p>salmonella. </p>
<p>People have White Zombie playing until 5 AM, which to me really </p>
<p>encompasses my mood at 5AM. I could be listening to Kenny G and it </p>
<p>would seem hardcore at 5 in the morning. It doesn't matter because you </p>
<p>still can't get an open clothes drier minutes before sunrise. There's </p>
<p>like this one chick whose always tying up an entire drier with like one </p>
<p>pair of panties. I let it slide because it gives me an opportunity to </p>
<p>watch hypnotically tumbling panties. The worst is when she turns out to </p>
<p>be morbidly obese and you have to vomit in your laundry basket. Not that </p>
<p>the dryers work anyway. I could fart on my laundry and get it drier than </p>
<p>the converted toaster ovens that the university supplies. Dry jeans? </p>
<p>Forget about it. I had to convert mine to a deep-sea wet suit. </p>
<p>So what if you want to leave the dorm?Get ready for a chore. </p>
<p>You'll need keys, ID, bag, books, a map, an umbrella, sun glasses, </p>
<p>insulin, a snake bite kit, mace, a pack mule, and an Algonquin Indian </p>
<p>translator (Miami students you know what that's all about). Then you </p>
<p>have to go walking through the building kissing the asses of all the </p>
<p>dweebs you live with and holding the door for anyone in the same county. </p>
<p>What's with the door holding policy? Like opening a door requires a </p>
<p>spotter. If you've got arms, a coordinated foot, or useful nub, open </p>
<p>your own God damn door. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </p>
<p>No matter where you go you have to use these gerbil-on-a-wheel </p>
<p>elevators. I could climb up the side of the building with a corpse tied </p>
<p>to my johnson in less time than it takes for the door to close. Then you </p>
<p>have to fucking march for miles from your dorm which is conveniently </p>
<p>placed on fucking opposite side of the campus from any building that is </p>
<p>fucking remotely important. </p>
<p>People on rollerblades I accept, people on bikes I have urges to </p>
<p>clothesline but tolerate, but people on skateboards have a value just </p>
<p>below medically retarded nazis. It must be explained to them that </p>
<p>skateboards were cool when we were 11 and even then they weren't that </p>
<p>cool. </p>
<p>Where are you headed? Probably to get something to eat at the </p>
<p>dining hall. The only dish they haven't fucked up is Lucky Charms. I </p>
<p>think the university supplies them with a blender and unlimited horse </p>
<p>meat mixed with some retired circus animals. The key to making the menu </p>
<p>fresh and exciting is the food coloring. The charming and buck-toothed </p>
<p>lunch ladies proudly announce, ""Yesterday we had chicken nuggets and </p>
<p>today we present to you blue chicken chunks that are totally unrelated </p>
<p>to the nugget dish we served you just yesterday. We are serious, they </p>
<p>have nothing to do with each other. I stake my hair net on it. You can </p>
<p>have extra blue in yours."" And the ladies (who really seem to love livin </p>
<p>in the exciting scooping career) refuse to serve more than what fits on </p>
<p>a toothpick. You can't just ask for a large portion, you have to ask for </p>
<p>""more than the offensive line could consume this semester."" Then you get </p>
<p>a second blue nugget. Remember how excited the potato bar got you the </p>
<p>first week? Now the potato bar makes you homicidal. (What are bacon </p>
<p>flavored bits madeof?) </p>
<p>Then you get to come home to your room. Mine is called a suite, </p>
<p>which is a pretty cruel manipulation of the English language. I get to </p>
<p>spend time with the closet case that the boarding office apparently </p>
<p>found compatible with me. He's like Chewbacca's considerably less </p>
<p>attractive estranged midget cousin. A wookie also has better control of </p>
<p>the English language. My roommate is another rant all together. Most </p>
<p>people get one of two kinds of roommates, the one who sharpens knives </p>
<p>while he watches you sleep (mine), and the one who asks you what it's </p>
<p>like to go outside (also mine). My suite mates next door live an </p>
<p>intensely Rastafarian lifestyle. In an attempt to put Cheech and Chong </p>
<p>to shame, their bong is a centerpiece of the room that they clean with </p>
<p>wadded textbook pages. They smoke to Bob Marley at 3AM on Wednesday </p>
<p>nights which is a little too hardcore but you have to love their </p>
<p>dedication to the sport. </p>
<p>End your dorm day by hopping in the shower. It's as big as a </p>
<p>tupperware container. It has 3 temperatures, fucking hot, really fucking </p>
<p>hot, and nuclear. Whenever somebody flushes a toilet on the campus the </p>
<p>temperature goes to skin removal levels and I go blind for a few </p>
<p>minutes. I swear it is connected to every toilet. My brother flushed the </p>
<p>toilet at home last week and I called him to tell him to be a little </p>
<p>more considerate. The bathroom is as clean as any fast food restaurant </p>
<p>urinal cake and after the average college student cleans the shitter </p>
<p>with a bottle of Vodka it's as clean as any bus station. I've given up </p>
<p>on cleaning the bathroom and I'm disinfecting myself. A quick spray down </p>
<p>with Lysol Direct and my body is fresh and repellant to several </p>
<p>bacteria. </p>
<p>Bottom line. Turn up the music and try to get high off the fumes </p>
<p>coming from under the bathroom door because they never share. The </p>
<p>""best days of your life"" will be over soon.</p>

44423,"<p>One lovely morning, Ben and Thomas were out golfing. Ben slices his ball deep<br /> into a wooded ravine. He grabs his 8-iron and proceeds down the embankment into<br /> the ravine in search of his ball. Ben searches diligently throught the thick<br /> underbrush and suddenly he spots something shiny. As he gets closer, he realizes<br /> that the shiny object is in fact an 8-iron in the hands of a skeleton lying near<br /> an old golf ball. </p>
<p>Ben excitedly calls out to his golfing partner: ""Hey Thomas, come here, I got<br /> big trouble down here."" </p>
<p>Thomas comes running over to the edge of the ravine and calls out, ""What's the<br /> matter Ben?"" </p>
<p>Ben shouts back in a nervous voice, ""Throw me my 7-iron! Looks like you can't<br /> get out of here with an 8-iron.""</p>

44435,"<p>A gorilla is walking through the jungle. He parts the bushes by the watering hole and sees a lion taking a drink of water with his butt sticking up in the air. The gorilla thinks to himself that it would be really funny if he snuck up behind this ""King of the Jungle"" and slipped him the old sausage. So the gorilla sneaks up on his tiptoes behind the lion, grabs him by the hips and starts pumping him in the butt as hard as he can. Then, he pulls out and runs away, laughing his head off.

I've pulled you over for speeding, Ma'am.... could I see your drivers license<br /> and registration please."" ""...What's a license...???"" replied the blonde. Big blue eyes sweetly looking up at him. ""Your drivers license is generally in a wallet"", replied the officer. After fumbling for a few minutes, the driver managed to find it. ""Now may I see your registration?.."" asked the cop. ""Registration?..... What's that....?"" asked the blonde. ""It's usually in your glove compartment..."" said the cop patiently. After some more fumbling, she found the registration. ""Thank you Ma'am. I'll be back in a minute..."" said the cop and walked back to his patrol car. The officer phoned into the dispatch to run a check on the woman's license and registration. After a few moments, the dispatcher came back; ""Ummm....is this woman driving a red sports car?"" ""Yes...."" replied the officer. ""Is she a drop dead gorgeous blonde?"" asked the dispatcher. ""Uh... yes"" replied the cop. ""Here's what you do...."" said the dispatcher. ""Give her the stuff back, and drop your pants..."" ""WHAT!!? I can't do that. Its..... inappropriate..."" exclaimed the cop. ""Trust me..... just do it...."" said the dispatcher. So the cop goes back to the car, gives back the license and registration and drops his pants, just as the dispatcher said.

"
44437,"<p>In the current film, Titanic, the character Rose is shown giving the<br /> finger to Jack (another character).Many people who have seen the film,<br /> question whether ""giving the finger"" was done around the time of the<br /> Titanic disaster,or was it a more recent gesture invented by some defiant<br /> seventh-grader.  According to research, here's the true story:</p>
<p>Before the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the French, anticipating victory<br /> over the English, proposed to cut off the middle finger of all captured<br /> English soldiers.  Without the middle finger it would be impossible to draw<br /> the renowned English longbow and therefore be incapable of fighting in the<br /> future.  This famous weapon was made of the native English Yew tree, and<br /> the act of drawing the longbow was known as ""plucking the yew"" (or ""pluck<br /> yew"").</p>
<p>Much to the bewilderment of the French, the English won a major upset and<br /> began mocking the French by waved their middle fingers at the defeated<br /> French,saying, ""See, we can still pluck yew!  ""PLUCK YEW!""</p>
<p>Over the years some 'folk etymologies' have grown up around this symbolic<br /> gesture.  Since 'pluck yew' is rather difficult to say (like ""pleasant<br /> mother pheasant plucker"", which is who you had to go to for the feathers<br /> used on the arrows for the longbow), the difficult consonant cluster at the<br /> beginning has gradually changed to a labiodental fricative 'F',and thus the<br /> words often used in conjunction with the one-finger-salute are mistakenly<br /> thought to have something to do with an intimate encounter.  It is also<br /> because of the pheasant feathers on the arrows that the symbolic gesture is<br /> known as ""giving the bird"".</p>
<p>And yew all thought yew knew everything!</p>

<p>Police in Los Angeles had good luck with a robbery suspect who just couldn't control himself during a lineup. When detectives asked each man in the lineup to repeat the words, ""Give me all your money or I'll shoot,"" the man shouted, ""That's not what I said!"" </p>

44446,"<p>A mortician was working late one night. It was his job to examine the dead bodies before they were sent off to be buried or cremated. As he examined the body of Mr. Schwartz, who was about to be cremated, he made an amazing discovery. Mr. Schwartz had the longest private part he had ever seen! </p>
<p>""I'm sorry Mr. Schwartz"" said the mortician, ""but I can't send you off to be cremated with a tremendously huge private part like this. It has to be saved for posterity."" </p>
<p>With that, the mortician used his tools to remove the dead man's schlong. He stuffed his prize into a briefcase and took it home. The first person he showed it to was his wife. </p>
<p>""I have something to show you that you won't believe,"" he said, and opened up his briefcase. </p>
<p>""Oh my God!"" she screamed. ""Schwarz is dead!"" </p>

44450,"<p>A magician was on stage doing his act, when he called for a volunteer from the audience. A man volunteered and went up on stage. The magician told himto pick up the 16 pound sledgehammer that was on stage next to a cement block and break the block apart with the sledgehammer so the audience wouldknow the sledgehammer was real.So, the man swung the sledgehammer with all his might and shattered the cement block. The magician now told the man to hit him square in the face with the sledgehammer. Horrified, the man said, ""No way. It'll probably kill you"". The magician insisted that the man hit him in the face, saying, ""I'll be fine. I promise you. Go ahead."" ""Well,"", the man replied, ""Ok, here goes.""Again, the man swung the sledgehammer and aimed it at the magician's face.The result was very bloody. The magician's nose was crushed, teeth fell out and blood everywhere. After 6 months in a coma in the hospital, the magician was lying in the hospital bed. One eye opened, the fingers flexed a bit, the other eye opened, and the magician sat straight up and said, ""Ta-da!""</p>

44464,"<p>There once was a man who was so fanatical about his golf game that he used to<br /> play every day without fail. One morning he had played the first hole and was<br /> just about to tee off on the second, when he saw the most gorgeous woman he had<br /> ever seen putting on the first. </p>
<p>The man waited until the woman had reached the second tee and asked if she<br /> would like to join him and they could finish the round together. To his surprise<br /> the woman agreed and they played the remaining holes. Not only was this woman<br /> beautiful, she was also a good golfer. </p>
<p>When they completed their round, the man told the woman that he was a cordon<br /> bleu chef and wine buff. He invited her back to his place for a meal and a few<br /> drinks.

<p>The man was so taken by the beauty and skill of this woman and desired her no<br /> end. He then asked if she would like to play golf the following morning, to<br /> which she agreed. Once again they enjoyed a great game of golf, a magnificent<br /> evening meal. </p>
<p>This went on for three weeks when the lawyer finally said to the woman,<br /> ""Listen, the golf and the company have been fantastic! But, there are only so<br /> many performances a man can take. When are we going to have sex?"" </p>

44480,"<p>Let's face it -- English is a crazy language. There is no egg in<br /> eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in<br /> pineapple. English muffins weren't invented in England or French<br /> fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which<br /> aren't sweet, are meat. </p>
<p>We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we<br /> find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and<br /> a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. </p>
<p>And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers<br /> don't groce and hammers don't ham? If the plural of tooth is<br /> teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese.<br /> So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices? </p>
<p>Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one<br /> amend, that you comb through annals of history but not a single<br /> annal? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all<br /> but one of them, what do you call it? </p>
<p>If teachers taught, why didn't preacher praught? If a vegetarian<br /> eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? If you wrote a<br /> letter, perhaps you bote your tongue? </p>
<p>Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed<br /> to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people<br /> recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send<br /> cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? Park on<br /> driveways and drive on parkways? </p>
<p>How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise<br /> man and wise guy are opposites? How can overlook and oversee be<br /> opposites, while quite a lot and quite a few are alike? How can<br /> the weather be hot as hell one day and cold as hell another. </p>
<p>Have you noticed that we talk about certain things only when<br /> they are absent? Have you ever seen a horseful carriage or a<br /> strapful gown? Met a sung hero or experienced requited love?<br /> Have you ever run into someone who was combobulated, gruntled,<br /> ruly or peccable? And where are all those people who ARE spring<br /> chickens or who would ACTUALLY hurt a fly? </p>
<p>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which<br /> your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a<br /> form by filling it out and in which an alarm clock goes off by<br /> going on. </p>
<p>English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects<br /> the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race<br /> at all). That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible,<br /> but when the lights are out, they are invisible.

44487,"<p>During grammar school science experiements into properties of different alcohols:The residue of each test was tipped down the sinks, which were grouped in threes.  There were no U-bends, but each group of sinks emptied into a single box, which overflowed into the mains sewers.  Presumably this was intended to retain things like droplets of mercury, which was not banned from use when I was 16.During the session, my bunsen went out, so I re-lit it with a splint lit from the teacher's bunsen.  For safety's sake (!) I dropped the burning splint into the sink, intending to extinguish it with water, instead of waving it around in the alcohol fumes.  A small blue flame disappeared down the plughole.  Hum, thinks I, I wonder where that's going?I opened the cupboard 'neath the sink, only to find the drain box, full of alcohol, a roaring mass of flame.  Shutting the doors, I called out, ""Er, Sir..."" just as the inch-thick wooden lids blew off the adjacent un-used sinks.  Fortunately, the back-blast extinguished the flames under the cupboard, so the box only sagged slightly!</p>

44496,"<p>A woman with a broken ankle was gingerly hobbling along on crutches as she attempted to walk her dog. Because of her handicap, however, she was having a lot of trouble keeping the dog under control. Finally, the dog lunged forward, the leash slipped out of her hand, and the dog went running down the street. She called and called, but the dog wouldn't come back. Since she couldn't chase after it, she eventually gave up and went home. </p>
<p>A couple of hours later she heard something scratching at the door. When she went to the door she found her dog standing there with a dead rabbit in its mouth. Upon closer inspection, she realized it was the neighbors' pet rabbit. She knew she would never be able to tell them what happened, and since they were out of town for the weekend, she hit upon a plan. </p>
<p>She took the rabbit into the bathroom, washed it off, and blew its fur dry. Then she took the rabbit back to the neighbors' backyard and put the rabbit back in its cage. She thought the neighbors would discover the rabbit dead and think it died in the cage. They would never suspect what really happened. </p>
<p>On Monday, there was a knock at the door, and when she answered, there was her neighbor standing there. He asked her if she had seen anyone in their backyard over the weekend. She said no. He said, ""Did you see anything strange going on around our house or yard?"" Again, she denied seeing anything suspicious. She said, ""Why are you asking me these questions? What happened?"" He said, ""Well, something really strange is going on in my backyard. On Friday our rabbit died, so we buried it in the backyard. But when we came back from the weekend, it was back in the cage!""</p>

<p>The pastor listened as she told him how she had accepted Jesus and wanted to be baptized and become a member of the church.</p>
<p>The pastor thought to himself, ""Oh my, she is so unkempt, even smells a little, and her fingernails are not clean. She picks up garbage, cleans toilets - what would the members think of her."" </p>
<p>He told her that she needed to go home and pray about it and then decide.</p>
<p>The following week, here she came again. She told the pastor that she had prayed about it and still wanted to be baptized. ""I have passed this church for so long. It is so beautiful, and I truly want to become a member.""</p>
<p>Again the pastor told her to go home and pray some more. A few weeks later while out eating at the restaurant, the pastor saw the little old lady. </p>
<p>He did not want her to think that he was ignoring her so he approached her and said, ""I have not seen you for a while. Is everything all right?""</p>
<p>""Oh, yes,"" she said. ""I talked with Jesus, and he told me not to worry about becoming a member of your church.""</p>
<p>""He did?"" said the pastor.</p>
<p>""Oh, yes,"" she replied. ""He said even He hasn't been able to get into your church yet, and He's been trying for years.""</p>

Now<br /> in their mid forties, these nuns began to discuss how much of real life they<br /> had missed, and how limited had been their experiences in the ""real"" world.<br /> Finally they conceived a plan, to correct this lack of experience, before their<br /> looks were entirely gone.  They pooled such savings as they had, borrowed money<br /> from relatives, and all four went on a long weekend junket flight to that ever<br /> popular, world capital of sin, Las Vegas.</p>
<p>   As soon as they hit Vegas, the four nuns ditched their habits, and did the<br /> rounds of all the beauty shops, the boutiques, and the shopping malls.  All<br /> dolled up, made up, and ready to go, they spent the entire weekend ""out on the<br /> town"" in Vegas, having a marvelous time, and catching the red-eye back home<br /> Sunday night.</p>
<p>   Monday morning they went to their parish priest, and asked him if he could<br /> hear their confessions that morning, to which the priest replied, ""Certainly<br /> sisters, just line up here outside the confessional, and I'll hear your<br /> confessions one at a time.""</p>
<p>   The first nun entered the confessional, beginning her confession as usual,<br /> and then told the priest about her trip to Vegas...</p>
<p>         ""Father, I have gambled, I have drunk spirits, I have smoked, and I<br /> had a wonderful time.  I also touched a man's penis with my left hand.""</p>
<p>   The priest nearly had heart failure, but slowly he composed himself, and<br /> said to the nun...</p>
<p>           ""Sister, if you are truly repentant, say three Hail Mary's, perform<br /> one act of charity, and dip your left hand in the Holy Water, and you shall be<br /> forgiven.""</p>
<p>   With that, the first nun left, and second nun entered...</p>
<p>""Father, forgive me, for I have sinned.  I have partaken of alcohol,<br /> I have worn make-up, I have used tobacco, and in general I had a terrific time.<br />  Also, I touched a man's penis with my right hand.""</p>
<p>   The priest was nearly catatonic with this news, but as he recovered, he told<br /> the nun...</p>
<p>        ""Sister, if you are truly repentant, say three Hail Mary's, perform<br /> two acts of charity, and dip your right hand in the Holy Water, and you shall<br /> be forgiven.""</p>
<p>   The second nun left, and all of a sudden, all hell broke loose outside the<br /> confessional.  The priest opened the door to see the last two nuns fighting,<br /> wrestling on the floor, and destroying their clothes  and the church in the<br /> process.  The priest shouted at them to stop, saying...</p>
<p>          ""In Heavens name, stop this, you are sisters!  There is no need to<br /> fight like this, over anything.  I will hear your confessions equally, please<br /> stop this!""</p>
<p>   One nun was sitting astride the other, throttling the nun on the bottom with<br /> one hand, and hitting her with the other.  She stopped in mid swing and said...</p>
<p>""Listen Father,... If you think I'm gonna gargle with that Holy<br /> Water, after she's sat in it, you've got another damn think coming!""</p>

44603,"<p>The manager of a large office noticed a new man one day and told him to come into his office. </p>
<p>""What is your name?"" was the first thing the manager asked the new guy. </p>
<p>""John,"" the new guy replied. </p>
<p>The manager scowled, ""Look... I don't know what kind of a mamby-pamby place you worked before, but I don't call anyone by their first name. It breeds familiarity and that leads to a breakdown in authority. I refer to my employees by their last name only... Smith, Jones, Baker... That's all. I am to be referred to only as Mr. Robertson. Now that we got that straight, what is your last name?"" </p>
<p>The new guy sighed, ""Darling. My name is John Darling."" </p>
<p>""Okay John, the next thing I want to tell you is . . .""</p>

"
44605,"<p>There were three pious monks.  These monks were so pious, in fact, that<br /> the head abbot decided one day to reward their devotion by granting<br /> them each one day of sin, on the condition that they confess their<br /> activities to him at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So, the day cometh, and the three monks go off into the night to<br /> indulge in all manner of sin.</p>
<p>The first monk saunters in at 1:00 in the morning, and tries to sneak<br /> upstairs to bed.  But the head abbot, who was waiting up for the three,<br /> stopped him and demanded that he relate his doings.</p>
<p>""No, head abbot,"" the first monk said, ""it's too evil for me to admit!""</p>
<p>""The deal was for you to tell me everything you did, otherwise you will<br /> not receive absolution!""  said the abbot.</p>
<p>So the first monk agreed to tell what he did.  ""I - I - I drank!  And I<br /> did all manner of drugs!  And I smoked tea bags and old polyester ties,<br /> and I snorted coffee whitener....""</p>
<p>""Enough!""  said the head abbot, enraged.  ""Those are evil sins, but I<br /> promised to forgive you.  Go out back, drink some Holy Water, say some<br /> prayers and you will be forgiven in the morning.""</p>
<p>The first monk thankfully went off to follow the abbot's instructions.</p>
<p>The second monk wanders in at 2:00 AM.  ""What did you do last night?""<br /> demanded the head abbot.</p>
<p>""I can't say!  It's much too evil!""</p>
<p>""The agreement was that you must tell me everything you did!""</p>
<p>""Okay,"" agreed the second monk.  ""I had all manner of sex.  I had sex<br /> with young girls, young boys, small furry quadrupeds, large species of<br /> flora, my CD player...""</p>
<p>""Enough!""  cried the head abbot.  ""That is a truly great sin.  But I<br /> promised to give you absolution.  Go out back and drink some Holy<br /> Water.  Then say some prayers and you will be forgiven in the morning.""</p>
<p>The second monk sauntered off to do just that.</p>
<p>And the third and final monk crawls in at 3:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>""What,"" asks the head abbot, ""did you do this evening?""</p>
<p>""No, head abbot, it's too great a sin to admit.  I cannot tell!""</p>
<p>""The agreement, monk!  You must tell me!""</p>
<p>The third monk bowed his head and nodded.  ""All right, head abbot.  Last<br /> night I...I...""</p>
<p>""Yes?""</p>
<p>""I pissed in the Holy Water.""</p>

44616,"<p>There was a man who loved to go pheasant hunting in the fall of<br /> year and read an advertisement of a dog trainer that rented out<br /> ""the world's best bird dogs."" He decided to try one of these<br /> dogs since he had never had any luck with the hunting dog he<br /> already owned. He went to the dog trainer and asked, ""I read<br /> your ad and would like to rent one of your dogs to hunt<br /> pheasants for the day. I would like the best dog in your kennel.""</p>
<p>The dog trainer replied, ""Well, then you would want Lawyer. He<br /> has a great nose and always scares up dozens of pheasants. He<br /> rents for $50 per day.""</p>
<p>""Great!"" the hunter replied.</p>
<p>The hunter paid the fee and took Lawyer out to a field and sure<br /> enough, he flushed out one bird after another and by the end of<br /> the day the man had shot his limit of pheasants.</p>
<p>The next year the man knew he had to go back to this same kennel<br /> and rent Lawyer. However, upon arriving the dog trainer told the<br /> hunter that Lawyer now rented for $100 a day. ""Why is that?"" the<br /> hunter asked.</p>
<p>""Well, Lawyer is even better this year. Take him out and you'll<br /> see.""</p>
<p>The hunter felt it was worth the $100 if the dog was better than<br /> the last year and so he paid the fee and went out to a field and<br /> sure enough, Lawyer flushed out so many pheasants that the<br /> hunter had shot his limit before lunch time.</p>
<p>The next year the man returned to rent Lawyer for the day but<br /> was surprised to discover that the dog now rented for $500 a<br /> day. The dog trainer said, ""He's expensive because he is in such<br /> high demand. Everybody wants Lawyer. And why not? He's an even<br /> better bird dog than last year.""</p>
<p>Once again the hunter felt it was worth the price and so he paid<br /> the $500 and went out to a field. Lawyer was fantastic and the<br /> hunter shot his limit of pheasant within an hour.</p>
<p>The next year the hunter returned to rent Lawyer. ""How much this<br /> year?"" he said.</p>
<p>""$5,"" the dog trainer replied.</p>
<p>""$5?"" the hunter exclaimed. What do you mean $5? The first year<br /> you charged $50, the second year $100 and last year $500? What<br /> happened that Lawyer is suddenly so cheap?""</p>
<p>The dog trainer responded, ""A couple of weeks ago a couple of<br /> guys came in and rented Lawyer and took him out to hunt<br /> pheasants but in the process they mistakenly called him<br /> Judge....and now all he does is sit on his butt and bark!""</p>

44627,"<p>While walking down the street one day, a Republican head of state is tragically hit by a truck and dies. His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. </p>
<p>""Welcome to Heaven,"" says St. Peter. ""Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""</p>
<p>""No problem, just let me in."" says the Republican.</p>
<p>""Well, I'd like to but I have orders from higher up.   What we'll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.""</p>
<p>""Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in Heaven,"" says the Republican head of state.</p>
<p>""I'm sorry but we have our rules."" And with that, St. Peter escorts the Republican to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course.   In the distance is a club and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him, everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, hug him, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at expense of the people.   They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar. Also present is the Devil (a Republican, too), who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes.</p>
<p>They are having such a good time that, before he realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator<br /> rises. The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.</p>
<p>""Now it's time to visit Heaven."" So 24 hours pass with the Republican head of state joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.</p>
<p>""Well then, you've spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now choose your eternity.""</p>
<p>He reflects for a minute, then the head of state answers: ""Well, I would never have thought it, I mean Heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in Hell.""</p>
<p>So Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to Hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. The Devil comes over to the Republican and lays an arm on his neck.</p>
<p>""I don't understand,"" stammers the Republican head of state. Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and club and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.</p>
<p>The Devil looks at him, smiles and says, ""Yesterday we were campaigning.  Today you voted for us!""</p>

After about 5 minutes, everyone hears this loud scream. Dead silence in the bar. Another loud scream-from the bathroom. The bartender and a few customers run to the bathroom. There's the drunk sitting down.  ""What the hell is going on?"" asks the bartender.  ""I went, and every time I try to flush the toilet, it crushes my nuts!"" says the drunk.

44634,"<p>After watching sales falling off for three straight months at<br /> Kentucky Fried Chicken, the Colonel calls up the Pope and asks<br /> for a favor.</p>
<p>The Pope says, ""What can I do?""</p>
<p>The Colonel says, ""I need you to change the daily prayer from,<br /> 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our<br /> daily chicken'. If you do it, I'll donate 10 Million Dollars to<br /> the Vatican.""</p>
<p>The Pope replies, ""I am sorry. That is the Lord's prayer and I<br /> can not change the words.""</p>
<p>So the Colonel hangs up. After another month of dismal sales,<br /> the Colonel panics, and calls again.</p>
<p>""Listen your Excellency. I really need your help. I'll give you<br /> $50 million dollars if you change the words of the daily prayer<br /> from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our<br /> daily chicken.'""</p>
<p>And the Pope responds, ""It is very tempting, Colonel Sanders.<br /> The church could do a lot of good with that much money. It would<br /> help us support many charities. But, again, I must decline. It<br /> is the Lord's prayer, and I can't change the words.""</p>
<p>So the Colonel gives up again. After two more months of terrible<br /> sales the Colonel gets desperate. ""This is my final offer, your<br /> Excellency. If you change the words of the daily prayer from,<br /> 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our<br /> daily chicken' I will donate $100 million to the Vatican.""</p>
<p>The Pope replies, ""Let me get back to you.""</p>
<p>So the next day, the Pope calls together all of his bishops and<br /> he says, ""I have some good news and I have some bad news. The<br /> good news is that KFC is going to donate $100 million to the<br /> Vatican.""</p>
<p>The bishops rejoice at the news. Then one asks about the bad<br /> news.</p>
<p>The Pope replies, ""The bad news is that we lost the Wonder Bread<br /> account.""</p>

44636,"<p>The jumbo jet is just coming into an Airport in Toronto on its final approach. The pilot comes on over the intercom.""This is Capt Johnson. We're on our final descent into Toronto. I want to thank you for flying with us today, and I hope you enjoy your stay in Toronto. He forgets to switch off the intercom. The whole plane can now hear the conversation from the cockpit. The co-pilot says to the pilot, ""Well skipper, watcha gonna do in Toronto? Now all ears in the plane are listening in to this conversation.""Well,"" says the skipper, ""first I'm gonna check into the hotel and take a crap. Then I'm gonna take that new stewardess out for supper, you know, the one with the huge tits. I'm gonna wine and dine her , take her back to my room, and shag her all night.""Everyone in the plane is trying to get a look at the new stewardess. She's so embarrassed that she runs from the back of the plane to try and get to the cockpit to turn the intercom off. Halfway down the aisle, she trips over an old lady's bag and down she goes. The old lady leans over and says, ""No need to run, dear, he's gotta take a shit first!""</p>

44638,"<p>I hate to be the one to defy sacred myth, but I believe he's a she. Think<br /> about it. Christmas is a big, organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing social deal, and<br /> I have a tough time believing a guy could possibly pull it all off! For<br /> starters, the vast majority of men don't even think about selecting gifts until<br /> Christmas Eve. It's as if they are all frozen in some kind of Ebenezerian Time<br /> Warp until 3 p.m. on Dec. 24th, when they - with amazing calm - call other<br /> errant men and plan for a last-minute shopping spree. Once at the mall, they<br /> always seem surprised to find only Ronco products, socket wrench sets, and mood<br /> rings left on the shelves. (You might think this would send them into a fit of<br /> panic and guilt, but my husband tells me it's an enormous relief because it<br /> lessens the 11th hour decision-making burden.) On this count alone, I'm<br /> convinced Santa is a woman. Surely, if he were a man, everyone in the universe<br /> would wake up Christmas morning to find a rotating musical Chia Pet under the<br /> tree, still in the bag. Another problem for a he-Santa would be getting there.<br /> First of all, there would be no reindeer because they would all be dead, gutted<br /> and strapped on to the rear bumper of the sleigh amid wide-eyed, desperate<br /> claims that buck season had been extended. Blitzen's rack would already be on<br /> the way to the taxidermist. Even if the male Santa DID have reindeer, he'd still<br /> have transportation problems because he would inevitably get lost up there in<br /> the snow and clouds and then refuse to stop and ask for directions. Add to this<br /> the fact that there would be unavoidable delays in the chimney, where the Bob<br /> Vila-like Santa would stop to inspect and repoint bricks in the flue. He would<br /> also need to check for carbon monoxide fumes in every gas fireplace, and get<br /> under every Christmas tree that is crooked to straighten it to a perfectly<br /> upright 90-degree angle. Other reasons why Santa can't possibly be a man: - Men<br /> can't pack a bag. - Men would rather be dead than caught wearing red velvet. -<br /> Men would feel their masculinity is threatened...having to be seen with all<br /> those elves. - Men don't answer their mail. - Men would refuse to allow their<br /> physique to be described even in jest as anything remotely resembling a ""bowlful<br /> of jelly."" - Men aren't interested in stockings unless somebody's wearing them.<br /> - Having to do the ""Ho Ho Ho"" thing would seriously inhibit their ability to<br /> pick up women. - Finally, being responsible for Christmas would require a<br /> commitment. I can buy the fact that other mythical holiday characters are<br /> men......... - Father Time shows up once a year unshaven and looking ominous.<br /> Definite guy. - Cupid flies around carrying weapons. - Uncle Sam is a politician<br /> who likes to point fingers. Any one of these individuals could pass the<br /> testosterone screening test. But not St. Nick. Not a chance. As long as we have<br /> each other, good will, peace on earth, faith and Nat King Cole's version of ""The<br /> Christmas Song,"" it probably makes little difference what gender Santa is. I<br /> just wish she'd quit dressing like a guy!!!</p>

44643,"<p>Three blokes enter a disabled swimming contest.   The first has no arms the second no legs and the third has no body, just a head.    They all line up, the whistle blows and ""splash"" they're all in the pool. The guy with no arms takes the lead instantly, but the guy with no legs is closing fast. The head sank straight to the bottom.    Ten lengths later and the guy with no legs finishes first.  He can still see bubbles coming from the bottom of the pool, so he decides he had better dive down to rescue the head guy. He picks up the head, swims back up to the surface and places the head at the side of the pool, where-upon the head starts coughing and spluttering.    Eventually the head catches his breath and shouts: ""Three goddamn years I've spent learning to swim with my goddamn ears, then five seconds before the whistle, some bastard puts a swimming cap on me""</p>

44653,"<p>Jesus, Moses and Elija were feeling good one day so they decided<br /> to go golfing.</p>
<p>Jesus being Jesus always gets to tee off first. They get to the<br /> 7th hole, which is a long par 5 with a creek running across it<br /> at about 240 yards. Jesus gets up to tee off and selects his<br /> driver. Moses asks Jesus if he is going to try to drive across<br /> the creek and Jesus says that he is feeling so good that he<br /> thinks he can make it. So Jesus tees off and it is a long drive<br /> but it lands in the middle of the creek. Jesus asks Moses to<br /> part the water of the creek so he can retrieve his ball saying,<br /> ""You know how much I hate to lose a ball."" So Moses parts the<br /> waters of the creek and the ball is retrieved. Jesus tees it up<br /> again and because he is Jesus he gets unlimited mulligans. Jesus<br /> says he is going to try to drive the creek again. Moses<br /> responds, ""Ok, but I am not going to help you get it back<br /> again!"" Jesus hits tee shot again and sure enough kerr plop it<br /> lands in the creek again. So he goes down and is walking on the<br /> water looking for his ball.</p>
<p>Meanwhile back at the tee the folowing foursome has reached the<br /> tee. One of the golfers says to Moses, ""Look at that guy walking<br /> on the water. Who does he think he is? Jesus Christ?"" Moses<br /> responds, ""No, he thinks he is Tiger Woods.""</p>

44659,"<p>We've all seen him, the party drunk/asshole. He has too much to drink, makes an ass out of himself, barfs all over the rug, then passes out on your bed.We had a guy on the boat (I'm in the USN sub force) who would get so drunk when we pulled into a liberty port the asshole had to be carried back and dumped in his rack. We didn't want the MP's to snag him because that makes the boat look bad and our dickhead CO might have secured everyone's liberty.To take care of this once and for all, we brought him back one night, out cold of course, and placed him in his rack on his side with his ass pointing to us.  One person pulled down is pants and underwear while another person ran to the freezer and Doc's office. The second person came back with a frozen hotdog and a condom.Here is how you do this little stunt:1.  Unwrap the condom and place it over the frozen hotdog. A lubricated one works best.2. Shove the device up the guys ass and leave it there for a second or two.  The condensation from the hotdog will allow it to be removed from the condom while leaving the rubber in the asshole.3. Pull the victims pants up and leave them unbuttoned and unbuckled.      (OPTIONAL)The less people involved the better. When our victim woke up and went to the head we all had to leave to keep from cracking up. When he was done with his shit, shower, and shave, he came to the mess decks for chow. He sat next to a friend of mine who was involved with the shen and asked, ""Hey man, what happened last night?""""I was going to ask you the same thing. You started drinking with some dork from a skimmer and the next thing we knew you guys were off to the bars out in town.

44670,"<p>Take OneThe following story was reported some years ago in the Las Vegas Sun: A man approached the cashiers' cage at Binion's Horseshoe in downtown Las Vegas, pulled a shotgun and was given an amount of cash. (Note that casino cages are located at the rear of the casino to discourage such activities.)The man tucked his shotgun under a trench coat and started to walk casually out of the casino. He was immediately surrounded by casino guards who walked with him so as not to cause a scene.Evaluating his situation, the man entered the casino and sat down at a card game in progress. He remained seated there for several hands, still surrounded by security personnel. The game continued uninterrupted.Finally, perhaps with the thought of creating escape-aiding confusion, the man upended the table sending cards and chips flying. He was immediately set upon by the card players who had to be restrained by the security guards from killing the interloper.The game resumed shortly thereafter and the thief was taken to the hospital.Take TwoThis story even made the ""America's Dumbest Criminals"" book ... In Peoria, Illinois, police were called to the scene of a home burglary. It turned out that only one major item was missing -- an entire houseful of new wall-to-wall carpet.The officers on the scene had no idea how to track a hot carpet. As they headed outside into the newly fallen snow to look around, they found footprints and a long, scraped trail. The officers followed the trail to a neighbor's front door. When the police entered the house, they found the stolen carpet recut and laid to fit its new home.The man who lived there insisted that he had purchased the rug, but police showed him his own trail. He was arrested and charged with the crime.</p>

44674,"<p>Game Show Set Recreated in White House Basement</p>
<p>President George W. Bush has sought answers on Iraq from Ken Jennings, the champion of the popular game show ""Jeopardy,"" White House aides confirmed today.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush first came to believe that Mr. Jennings might have the answers on Iraq when he saw the game-show whiz on television earlier this summer, telling aides, ""That there is the smartest man in the world.""</p>
<p>After contacting Mr. Jennings, White House aides began constructing a mock-up of the ""Jeopardy!"" set in the basement of the White House and enlisted ""Jeopardy!"" host Alex Trebek to reprise his usual role.</p>
<p>Instead of the usual potpourri of ""Jeopardy!"" questions, however, the special White House edition had only categories that pertained to the crisis in Iraq, such as ""ANGRY SHIITES,"" ""RUPTURED OIL PIPELINES,"" and ""MASSIVE POWER OUTAGES.""</p>
<p>According to those who saw Mr. Jennings play the special Iraqi version, the champ breezed through most of the questions but was stumped when he got to ""EXIT STRATEGIES"" for $100.</p>
<p>""The most likely outcome of the war in Iraq, this should happen by the end of 2005,"" Mr. Trebek read.</p>
<p>""What is civil war and total chaos?"" Mr. Jennings guessed.</p>
<p>""No, I'm sorry,"" Mr. Trebek replied.  ""The correct question is, 'What is a thriving Middle Eastern democracy and a beacon of hope for the entire region?'""</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, disappointed by Mr. Jennings' performance, reportedly told aides, ""Ken Jennings may be the smartest man in the world but when it comes to Iraq he's as dumb as a post.""</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in yet another embarrassment for CBS, the network today acknowledged that ""not everyone"" loves Raymond.</p>

44683,"<p>A Cardiologist came up with a new operating procedure that would cut down the time that heart surgery would take and would cause less trauma to the patient. He was praised by his peers when he presented it at a convention in Washington D.C. He was also paid $50,000 to present his findings.The cardiologist did a few more of these presentations and realized that it would be more lucrative to do lectures on his findings rather than continue to work as a surgeon. So he decided to do the lectures full-time. He hired a driver and purchased a limousine.One day, after he'd been doing the lecture circuit for about 6 months, his driver turns to him and says, ""You know... This is completely unfair.""""What do you mean?"" asks the surgeon.""Well, you get paid $50,000 every time you do this lecture and that's more than I get paid in a year,"" replies the driver.The surgeon explains to him that it is a very complicated procedure and that he is the only person that can give this lecture.""That's not true. I can do your lecture blindfolded. I have seen you do your lecture so many times that I know it by heart,"" says the driver.""Well if that's the case, I'll tell you what. You do this lecture and you can keep the $50,000 if you do it right."" replies the surgeon.The driver replies, ""Ok. You're on.""So when they arrive at the lecture hall, the surgeon and the driver change coats and the surgeon puts on the driver's hat and sits in the back of the room.The driver nails the presentation. Not only that, he also answers all the questions without any problems. Just when the driver thinks he's done, an audience member, wearing a lab coat and tape covered glasses stands up and asks a complex question that the driver is not able to answer.""You know..."" says the driver, ""I have done this lecture 287 times and I have never been asked such a stupid question. As a matter of fact, that question is SO stupid that I am going to let my driver answer it.""</p>

I assure you my parents will hear of this.'' With that she sat down red-faced.Unperturbed, Mr. Perkins called on Miss Johnson and asked the same question. Miss Johnson, with composure, replied, ''The pupil of the eye, in dim light.''''Correct,'' said Mr. Perkins. ''And now, Miss Smythe, I have three things to say to you. One, you have not studied your lesson. Two, you have a dirty mind. And three, you will some day be faced with a dreadful disappointment.''</p>

<p>Walk for at least hour a day, go for a swim, take the stairs instead of the elevator, etc.</p>
<p>Wash your hands often. If you can't wash them, keep a bottle of antibacterial stuff around. -</p>
<p>Get lots of fresh air. Open windows whenever possible.</p>
<p>Get plenty of rest</p>
<p>Try to eliminate as much stress from your life as you can.</p>
<p>OR ...  You can take the doctors office approach. Think about it, when you go for a shot, what do they do first? Clean your arm with alcohol.</p>
<p>Why? Because alcohol kills germs.</p>
<p>SO ... I walk to the liquor store (exercise),</p>
<p>I put lime in my Corona (fruit), celery in my Bloody Mary veggies), drink on the bar patio (fresh air), get drunk, tell jokes, and laugh (eliminate stress), then pass out (rest).</p>
<p>The way I see it, if you keep your alcohol levels up, flu germs can't get you!!!</p>

44844,"<p>Somewhere in America this week the following conversation is taking place:</p>
<p>Dad - Son, come in here, we need to talk.<br /> Son - What's up, Dad?</p>
<p>D- There's a scratch down the side of the car. Did you do it?</p>
<p>S- I don't believe, if I understand the definition of ""scratch the car"", that<br /> I can say, truthfully, and that I scratched the car.</p>
<p>D- Well, it wasn't there yesterday, and you drove the car last night, and no<br /> one else has driven it since. How can you explain the scratch?</p>
<p>S- Well, as I've said before, I have no recollection of scratching the car.<br /> While it is true that I did take the car out last night, I did not scratch it.</p>
<p>D- But your sister, Monica, has told me she saw you back the car against the<br /> mailbox at the end of the driveway, heard a loud scraping sound, saw you get out<br /> to examine the car, and then drive away. So again I'll ask you, yes or no, did<br /> you scratch the car?</p>
<p>S- Oh, you mean you think you have evidence to prove I scratched it. Well, you<br /> see, I understood you to mean did ""I"" scratch the car. I stand by my earlier<br /> statement, that I did not scratch the car.</p>
<p>D- Are you trying to tell me you didn't drive the car into the mailbox?</p>
<p>S- Well, you see sir, I was trying to drive the car into the street. I<br /> mishandled the steering of the car, and it resulted in direct contact with the<br /> mailbox, though that was clearly not my intent.</p>
<p>D- So you are then saying that you did hit the mailbox?</p>
<p>S- No sir, that's not my statement. I'll refer you back to my original<br /> statement that I did not scratch the car.</p>
<p>D- But the car did hit the mailbox, and the car did get scratched as a result<br /> of this contact?</p>
<p>S- Well, yes, I suppose you could look at it that way.</p>
<p>D- So you lied to me when you said you did not scratch the car?</p>
<p>S- No. No, that's not correct. Your question was ""Did I scratch the car?"".<br /> From a strict legal definition, as I understood the meaning of that sentence, I<br /> did not scratch the car... the mailbox did... I was merely present when the<br /> scratching occurred. So my answer of No"" when you asked ""Did I scratch the car""<br /> was legally correct, although I did not volunteer information.</p>
<p>D- Son, you are such a slick talker you're either gonna wind up as a lawyer or<br /> President....</p>

44851,"<p>A pretty woman is driving down a country road in her new sports car when the car breaks down. Luckily, she happens to be near a farmhouse. She goes up to the farmhouse and knocks on the door. When the farmer answers, she says to him, ""Oh, it's Sunday night and my car broke down! Can I stay here for the night until tomorrow when I can get some help?""</p>
<p>""Well,"" drawls the farmer, ""you can stay here, but I don't want you messin' with my sons Jed and Luke.""</p>
<p>She looks through the screen door and sees two young men standing behind the farmer. She judges them to be in the early twenties. ""Okay,"" she says.</p>
<p>After they have gone to bed for the night the woman begins to get a little horny just thinking about the two boys in the room next to her. So she quietly goes into their room and says, ""Boys, how would you like for me to teach you the ways of the world?""</p>
<p>They say, ""Huh?""</p>
<p>She says, ""The only thing is, I don't want to get pregnant, so you have to wear these rubbers."" She puts them on the boys, and the three of them go at it all night long.</p>
<p>Forty years later Jed and Luke are sitting on the front porch, rocking back and forth. Jed says, ""Luke?""</p>
<p>Luke says, ""Yeah, Jed?""</p>
<p>Jed says, ""You remember that woman that came by here about forty years ago and showed us the ways of the world?""</p>

44852,"<p>A Minneapolis couple decided to go to Florida to thaw out during a particularly icy winter. They planned to stay at the same hotel where they spent their honeymoon 20 years earlier. Because of hectic schedules, it was difficult to coordinate their travel schedules. So, the husband left Minnesota and flew to Florida on Thursday, with his wife<br /> flying down the following day.</p>
<p>The husband checked into the hotel. There was a computer in his room, so he decided to send an email to his wife. However, he accidentally  left out one letter in her email address, and without realizing his error,  sent the email.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, somewhere in Houston, a widow had just returned home from her husband's funeral. He was a minister who was called home to glory following a heart attack. The widow decided to check her email expecting messages from relatives and friends. After reading the first message, she screamed and fainted.</p>
<p>The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read:</p>
<p>         To: My Loving Wife<br />          Subject: I've Arrived<br />          Date: January 13, 2005</p>

44895,"<p>Ignoring the fact that George Bush declined Saddam Hussein's challenge to a<br /> televised debate, Tim Dowling exclusively reveals what could have happened had<br /> they met Tuesday February 25, 2003 </p>
<p>Tony Blair, moderator: Welcome to the first televised debate between George W.<br /> Bush and Saddam Hussein, live from United Nations headquarters in New York. We<br /> will begin with a brief opening statement from each of you. </p>
<p>Bush: First of all I would just like to welcome my evil friend to the UN, one<br /> of the great American institutions for the propulsion of freedom throughout the<br /> world. </p>
<p>Saddam: Thank you, Great Satan. I hope that in today's debate we may find some<br /> common ground between the Iraqi people's commitment to peace and human progress<br /> and America's desire to destroy the Middle East. </p>
<p>Bush: Do I answer that? </p>
<p>Blair: No. The first question is quite simply this: do you have any links with<br /> al-Qaida? </p>
<p>Bush: I do not. </p>
<p>Blair: The question is for Saddam. </p>
<p>Saddam: As I told Mr. Tony Benn clearly and simply, if I had links with<br /> al-Qaida and I enjoyed those links then I would not be ashamed to tell the<br /> world, but since I am ashamed to tell the world of this, it follows that I have<br /> no such links. </p>
<p>Bush: Neither do I. </p>
<p>Blair: The second question is for President Bush. President Bush, if America<br /> and Iraq were to go to war tomorrow, who would win? </p>
<p>Bush: That's easy. America, right? </p>
<p>Saddam: Even I knew that one. </p>
<p>Bush: That's because the great United American States of America are on the<br /> side of rightliness and Americanity, against an evil Axis of Evil made up of<br /> Iraq, North Korea and... how many are in an axis? Three? </p>
<p>Blair: I think you're allowed as many as you like. </p>
<p>Bush: OK, Iraq, North Korea and France.! </p>
<p>Saddam: I will tell you frankly and directly that Iraq is not part of any Axis<br /> of Evil. </p>
<p>Bush: Who am I thinking of then? Irania? </p>
<p>Blair: Let's move on. Saddam, are you willing to destroy your stockpile of<br /> Samoud 2 missiles in accordance with UN weapons inspectors' orders? </p>
<p>Saddam: I explain to you now that if Iraq possessed these so-called weapons,<br /> we would never destroy them, but since we do not have any such weapons, we are<br /> happy to comply, even though these non-existent weapons certainly do not exceed<br /> the proscribed range of 150 kms. I've tested them myself, and we don't have any. </p>
<p>Blair: The final question is for George Bush. Mr President, is there any way<br /> that Saddam Hussein can avoid war, and what steps must he now take in order to<br /> reach a negotiated solution? </p>
<p>Bush: Listen to me. It's very simple. First Saddam must compile 200% with the<br /> UN inspectorers, and I mean activated compilation, not passivist compilation.<br /> Second, he must disarm fully, in keeping with UN revelation 1441 and the next<br /> one coming, 1441B, which will require him to disarm even more fully than that.<br /> Then he must destroy all Samoud missiles and any other weapons of mass<br /> destruction he is found, or not found, to be possessive of, without being asked.<br /> Finally, there is one more task he must perform, which I am not at liberty to<br /> revulge. And even that will not be enough. </p>
<p>Blair: The translator would like to take your answer home with him and work on<br /> it over the weekend. </p>
<p>Bush: Fine, but we require nothing less than total disarmature. </p>
<p>Saddam: OK. </p>
<p>Blair: Sorry, but I'm not sure that ""disarmature"" is a word. I defer to the UN<br /> Keeper of the Dictionary, Mr Richard Stilgoe. </p>
<p>Stilgoe: Yes, you can have disarmature. It means, ""the action of disarming""<br /> according to the OED. </p>
<p>Bush: Exactly. He must cut his own arms off. </p>
<p>Saddam: If it means peace, I will do it. </p>
<p>Bush: Too late. </p>
<p>Stilgoe: Did you know that Saddam Hussein is an anagram of 'Demands a Sushi'? </p>
<p>Saddam: Yes, I've heard them all. </p>
<p>Bush: I don't eat sushi. Is there a fish option? </p>
<p>Blair: I'd like to remind everyone at home that the Monica Lewinsky-Tonya<br /> Harding fight follows after the break.</p>

44897,"<p>A 34 yr. old white male found dead in the basement of his home died of suffocation, police said. He was approximately 6' 2"" and 225 lb. He was wearing a pleated skirt, white bra, black and white saddle shoes and a woman's wig. It appeared that he was trying to create a schoolgirl's uniform look. He was also wearing a military gas mask that had the filter canister removed and a rubber hose attached in its place. The other end of the hose was connected to a hollow wooden section of bedpost approximately 12 inches long and 3 inches in diameter. This bedpost was inserted into his rear end for reasons unknown, and was the cause of his suffocation. Police found the task of explaining the circumstances of his death to his family members ""very awkward"". </p>

Upon arrival, the officer found the man face down on the couch, naked. When she rolled him over to check for a pulse and to start CPR if necessary, she noticed burn marks around his genitals. After the ambulance arrived and removed the man (who turned out to be dead on arrival at hospital), the police made a closer inspection of the couch, and noticed that the man had made a hole between the cushions. Upon flipping the couch over they discovered what caused his death. Apparently the man had a habit of putting his penis between the cushions, down into the hole and between two electric sanders (with the sandpaper removed for obvious reasons). According to the story, after his orgasm the...ahem...discharge shorted out one of the sanders, electrocuting him to death.</p>
<p>(AP) LOS ANGELES - Police officials would not release the name of a Pacoima man who was found dead yesterday after responding to complaints from neighbors that a bad smell was coming from his apartment. Upon entering the apartment, officers were surprised to see that every square inch of the apartment, including appliances and even the inside of the toilet, were covered with pornographic images cut from magazines. ""The visual effect was very unsettling,"" said Officer Hradj of the Pacoima Police. ""Because everything looked the same, you could not tell where one wall ended and a doorway began."" The surprises did not end there, however. Police described the man as having ""concocted a wire frame around his head"" upon which he had taped various pornographic images, apparently so he could freely move about his apartment without ever losing his close-up view of nude bodies. Small slits had been cut into the paper so he could find his way, but according to Hradj, ""He had almost no peripheral vision. He could barely see a thing."" The man was found nude with this wire frame entangled in a hanging lamp. ""We think he had been dusting,"" said another police officer, ""because a feather duster was lying nearby, and his head gear had somehow become caught in the lamp, which was chained to the ceiling."" The man allegedly choked to death trying to extricate himself from his predicament. According to his apartment manager, the white male in his mid-30's never left his apartment, and had food delivered weekly. Funeral services are planned for next week. His next of kin requested that his name be withheld. </p>

So he<br /> went to the clinic near his house and told the clinic worker<br /> that he wanted to have sex and if there was anyone there to give<br /> it to him.  The worker said yes and told him to go up to room<br /> 222.  So he walked up to room 222 and opened the door to find a<br /> chicken laying on the bed.  He said to himself, ""no this can't<br /> be right.""  So he went back down to the desk and said to the<br /> worker, ""there is a chicken laying on the bed, I wanted a<br /> person.""  The worker, then told him, ""chickens are good, go up<br /> there, do what you have to do, then come back down.""  So the guy<br /> said ok and went up and did what he had to do.  He spent two and<br /> a half hours with this chicken.</p>
<p>When he was done fooling around with the chicken, he came back<br /> down and told the worker that the sex was great and if there was<br /> another chicken he could have sex with.  The worker said yes, go<br /> up to room 224.  So he walked up to room 224, to find other men<br /> up in the room.  He said to himself, this can't be right.  So he<br /> went back downstairs and said to the worker, ""this can't be<br /> right, there is men in that room, i wanted a chicken.""  So the<br /> worker said ""yes I know just go up and sit on the couch with the<br /> other men.""  So he went back up and did what he was told.  </p>
<p>After being in the room for 2 minutes, the walls turned to<br /> mirrors, and in the reflection of the mirrors was a man having<br /> sex.  The man that had just had sex with the chicken turned to<br /> the man sitting next to him and said ""wow that guy is really<br /> getting down.""  </p>
<p>The other guy turned to him and said, ""this isn't nothing, you<br /> should have just saw the guy that was up here for two and a half<br /> hours with the chicken.""</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter he met a farmer who had three stunning, gorgeous daughters that positively took his breath away. So he explained his mission to the farmer, asking for permission to marry one of them.</p>
<p>The farmer simply replied, ""They're all lookin' to get married, so you came to the right place. Look them over and select the one you want.""</p>
<p>The man dated the first daughter. The next day the farmer asked for the man's opinion.</p>
<p>""Well"" said the man, "" She's just a weeeeee bit, not that you can hardly notice, but pigeon-toed.""</p>
<p>The farmer nodded and suggested the man date one of the other girls; so the man went out with the second daughter.</p>
<p>The next day, the farmer again asked how things went.</p>
<p>""Well,"" the man replied, ""She's just a weeeee bit, not that you can hardly tell, cross-eyed.""</p>
<p>The farmer nodded and suggested he date the third girl to see if things might be better. So he did.</p>
<p>The next morning the man rushed in exclaiming, ""She's perfect, just perfect! She's the one I want to marry!"" So they were wed right away.</p>
<p>Nine Months later the baby was born. When the man visited nursery he was horrified: the baby was the ugliest, most pathetic human you can imagine. He rushed to his father-in-law asking how such a thing could happen considering the parents.</p>
<p>""Well,"" explained the farmer, ""She was just a weeeee bit, not that you could hardly tell, pregnant when you met her.""</p>

44923,"<p>What's the difference between Anarchists and Libertarians??</p>
<p>Libertarians are anarchists with money.</p>
<p>Anarchists believe property is theft. Libertarians believe everything is property.</p>
<p>Libertarians are bosses; anarchists work for them when they run out of other options.<br /> Libertarians buy more guns, but anarchists use more ammo.</p>
<p>Libertarians ride in stretch limos; anarchists throw bricks through their windshields.</p>
<p>Libertarians go shopping; anarchists go shoplifting.</p>
<p>Libertarians go to the police after they've been mugged; anarchists get mugged by the police.</p>
<p>A libertarian wants to marry another libertarian, but only after sleeping with enough anarchists.</p>
<p>Anarchists ignore the IRS; Libertarians hire accountants and attorneys to fight them.</p>
<p>Libertarians think the government is trying steal the property they rightfully own; anarchists think the government is trying to defend property that nobody rightfully owns.</p>
<p>Libertarians are organized in a political party; anarchists aren't organized in anything.</p>
<p>Anarchists ignore elections; Libertarians run for office, vote and lose.</p>
<p>Libertarians think anarchists are naive and unrealistic; anarchists don't care what libertarians think.</p>

44924,"<p>A little old lady goes into the Chase Manhattan Bank, tells the teller that<br /> she has $5,000,000.00 in cash to be used to open an account. However, before she<br /> just hands over that much money, she would like to meet the man who runs things. </p>
<p>The teller calls the bank president, and arranges the meeting. The lady goes<br /> into his office, and after introductions are made, the bank president asks the<br /> lady how she came to have so much cash on hand. </p>
<p>The lady tells him that she's an avid gambler. The bank president says ""You<br /> must be the luckiest person that I've ever met, to win so much!"" ""No"" replies<br /> the lady, ""I will only bet on a sure thing, and since I am somewhat gifted with<br /> the ability to see the future, ALL of my bets are sure things."" </p>
<p>The bank president smiles and says ""No, it must be luck madam. There is no<br /> such thing as a sure thing"". ""I'll prove it!"" says the lady. She then closes her<br /> eyes and starts to hum softly for about 30 seconds. ""O.K...I have looked into<br /> your future and I'm afraid there's bad news. By 8:00 a.m tomorrow, your<br /> testicles will have changed shape and will be perfectly square."" </p>
<p>The bank president is starting to think this lady is nuts, so he tells her<br /> that he has no more time for this malarky and he would like for her to leave.<br /> The lady refuses, and proposes a wager. The man declines until the old lady says<br /> ""Look, I'll bet you $5,000.00 that by 8:00 tomorrow morning, your testicles will<br /> be square! What have you got to lose? You claim I can't win - there's no such<br /> thing as A sure thing...right?"" By this the bank pres. is really starting to<br /> dislike this old broad, and not only would he enjoy teaching her a lesson, he<br /> could use the $5K. ""O.K fine!"" he yells ""You got a bet!"". </p>
<p>""Wonderful!"" proclaims the lady, ""I'll see you 1st thing tomorrow. Do you mind<br /> if my attorney accompanies me? I always have him present for wagers over<br /> $500.00."" The man replies ""Lady, I don't care who you bring, as long as you<br /> bring the money!"" </p>
<p>That night the bank president has some strange dreams, and what the lady said<br /> is really starting to get to him. The next morning, he's greatly releaved to see<br /> that everything is the same shape as always. He dresses, and goes to the bank<br /> where he finds the lady and a man waiting for him. </p>
<p>""Well"" says the lady, ""Do you want to have the money deposited into my new<br /> account, or do you have cash?"" </p>
<p>The bank pres. smiles and replies ""I feel bad doing this, but nutty old dames<br /> like you need to be taught a lesson sometimes, and I know that you can afford<br /> it, so it is you that must pay. You see, my testicles are the same shape they've<br /> always been. Not the slightest bit square."" ""What!"" cries the lady, ""That can't<br /> be!! I never imagined that it would come to this, but I won't pay one cent until<br /> I've examined the testicles myself!"" </p>
<p>The bank pres. blushes with embarrassment, but finally replies ""Under the<br /> circumstances, I suppose that's not unreasonable"" and with that he drops his<br /> pants. The lady gets on her knees to grasp him, and her attorney screams ""DAMMIT<br /> YOU OLD BAT!! YOU'VE DONE IT TO ME AGAIN!!"" and he hands her $15,000.00 in cash. </p>
<p>At this point the bank president is completely lost. ""What in the hell was<br /> that all about?"" he asks. ""Oh,"" says the lady as she carefully puts the money<br /> into her bag ""I bet him that I would literally have the president of the Chase<br /> Manhattan Bank by the balls before 9:00 this morning. So here's the $5,000.00<br /> that I lost to you, and please add the other $10,000.00 to my new account""</p>

44987,"<p>A fellow stopped at a rural gas station and, after filling his tank, he paid the bill and bought a soft drink. He stood by his car to drink his cola and he watched a couple of men working along the roadside. One man would dig a hole two or three feet deep and then move on.
