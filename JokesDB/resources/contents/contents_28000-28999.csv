<p>The doctor says, ""Your wife was in a serious car accident, and I have bad news and good news.</p>

28001,"<p>A man meets a gorgeous woman in a bar. They talk, they connect, and they end<br /> up leaving together. They get back to her place, and as she shows him around, he<br /> notices that her bedroom is completely packed with teddy bears.</p>
<p>Hundreds of small bears are on a shelf all the way along the floor, medium<br /> sized ones are on a shelf a little higher, and huge bears are on the top shelf<br /> along the wall. The man is kind of surprised by the collection, especially<br /> because it�s so extensive, but he decides not to mention this to her.</p>
<p>She turns to him�they kiss�then they rip each other�s clothes off and romp<br /> around the room all night. After an intense night of passion, as they are lying<br /> there together in the afterglow, the man rolls over and asks, smiling, �Well,<br /> how�d I do?�</p>
<p>The woman says, �You can have any prize from the bottom shelf.�</p>

28002,"<p>Three nurses died and went to Heaven. They were met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter, who questioned them.""What did you used to do back on Earth?"" he asked the first nurse.""Why do you think you should be allowed into Heaven?"" She told him, ""I was a nurse at an inner city hospital. I worked to bring healing and peace to many sufferers, especially poor children.""""Very noble. You may enter."" And he ushered her through the gates. He asked the same questions to the next nurse.""I was a missionary nurse in the Amazon. For many years I worked with a small group of doctors and nurses to help people in numerous tribes, healing them and telling them of God's love."" The second nurse replied.""Excellent!"" said St. Peter. And he ushered her through the gates as well. Finally he posed his questions to the third nurse.She hesitated, then explained, ""I was just a nurse at an HMO.""St. Peter considered her answer for a moment, then told her, ""Well, you can enter, too.""""Wow!"" the nurse exclaimed in relief.""I almost thought you weren't going to let me in.""""Oh, you can certainly come in,"" St. Peter told her, ""but you can only stay for three days.""</p>

<p>Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was threatening its dominant market position. The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market. LBNL, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry Integration Model (PIM), LBNL helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework. LBNL convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens along with LBNL consultants with deep skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting, enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear, and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, and core values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total business integration solution. LBNL helped the chicken change to become more successful.</p>
<p>LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man. The chicken 'crossed' the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.</p>
<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.</p>
<p>MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the chicken, ""Thou shalt cross the road."" And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.</p>
<p>FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?</p>
<p>RICHARD M. NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did NOT cross the road.</p>
<p>BILL CLINTON: Let me make this clear. I DID NOT have sex with this chicken. I did not give this chicken any gifts. This chicken, if it did cross the road, must have had legitimate business on the other side of the road. I have eaten chicken in the past, but Hilary and I have worked through those issues.</p>
<p>MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.</p>
<p>JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyone ever think to ask, What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the place, anyway?""</p>
<p>FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.</p>
<p>BILL GATES: I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your cheque book.</p>
<p>OLIVER STONE: The question is not, ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" Rather, it is, ""Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?""</p>
<p>DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected in such a way that they are now genetically disposed to cross roads.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.</p>

28012,"<p>One day, while a seamstress was sewing while sitting close to a river, her thimble fell into the river.  </p>
<p>When she cried out, the Lord appeared and asked, ""Why are you crying?""  </p>
<p>The seamstress replied that her thimble had fallen into the water, and she needed the thimble to make her living.</p>
<p>The Lord went down into the water and reappeared with a golden thimble. ""Is this your thimble?"" the Lord asked. </p>
<p>The seamstress replied, ""No.""</p>
<p>The Lord again went down and came up with a wooden thimble. ""Is this your thimble?"" the Lord asked.   </p>
<p>Again, the seamstress replied, ""No.""</p>
<p>The Lord went down again and came up with a silver thimble. ""Is this your thimble?"" the Lord asked. </p>
<p>The seamstress replied, ""Yes.""</p>
<p>The Lord was pleased with the woman's honesty and gave her all three thimbles to keep, and the seamstress went home happy.</p>
<p>Some time later, the seamstress was walking with her husband along the riverbank, and her husband fell into the river.   </p>
<p>When she cried out, The Lord again appeared and asked her, ""Why are you crying?""</p>
<p>""Oh Lord, my husband has fallen into the water!""  </p>
<p>The Lord went down into the water and came up with Mel Gibson. ""Is this your husband?"" the Lord asked. </p>
<p>""Yes."" cried the seamstress.</p>
<p>The Lord was furious. ""You lied! That is an untruth!""  </p>
<p>The seamstress replied, ""Oh, forgive me, my Lord.  It is a misunderstanding.  You see, if I had said 'no' to Mel Gibson, you would have come up with Tom Cruise. Then if I said 'no' to him, you  would have come up with my husband.  Had I then said 'yes,' you would have given me all three.  Lord, I am a poor woman and am not able to take care of all three husbands, so THAT'S why I said yes to Mel Gibson.""</p>

28015,"<p>Blowjob Etiquette<br /> 1. First and foremost, we are not obligated to do it.<br /> 2. Extension to rule #1 - So if you get one, be grateful.<br /> 3. I don't care WHAT they did in the porn video you saw, it is not standard practice to come on someone's face.<br /> 4. Extension to rule #3 - No, I DON'T have to swallow.<br /> 5. My ears are NOT handles.<br /> 6. Extension to rule #5 - do not push on the top of my head. Last I heard, deep throat had been done. And additionally, do you really WANT puke on your dick?<br /> 7. I don't care HOW relaxed you get, it is NEVER OK to fart.<br /> 8. Having my period does not mean that it's ""hummer week"" - get it through your head - I'm bloated and I feel like shit so no, I don't feel particularly obligated to blow you just because YOU can't have sex right now.<br /> 9. Extension to #8 - ""Blue Balls"" might have worked on high school girls -if you're that desperate, go jerk off and leave me alone with my Midol.<br /> 10. If I have to pause to remove a pubic hair from my teeth, don't tell me I've just ""wrecked it"" for you.<br /> 11. Leaving me in bed while you go play video games, smoke a cigarette, watch TV...etc.... immediately afterwards is highly inadvisable if you would like my behavior to be repeated in the future.<br /> 12. If you like how we do it, it's probably best not to speculate about the origins of our talent. Just enjoy the moment and be happy that we're good at it. See also rule #2 about gratitude.<br /> 13. No, it doesn't particularly taste good. And I don't care about the protein content.<br /> 14. No, I will NOT do it while you watch TV, smoke a cigarette, drink, etc....<br /> 15. When you hear your friends complain about how they don't get blow jobs often enough, keep your mouth shut. It is inappropriate to either sympathize or brag.<br /> 16. Just because ""it's awake"" when you get up does not mean I have to ""kiss it good morning.""</p>

28019,"<p>Years ago, while lying in my hammock and drinking JD from the bottle. I noticed my dog dragging something under the fence. Upon inspection, to my dismay, I realised it was the next door neighbour's 10 year old daughter's rabbit. For years I had watch her come home from school and head straight out to it's cage, free it and play with it in the yard. I knew today would be no different and fearing for our dog, I had to think fast.</p>
<p>The rabbit was quite dirty, as if it had put up quite a struggle, so I washed it off with the hose, combed it with the Dog brush and blew it dry with the leaf blower. Upon finishing it's grooming I jumped the fence and replaced back in it's cage, hoping it's death would be written off as ""natural causes"".</p>
<p>Back to the hammock and JD. Within the hour the neighbour's Volvo pulled in as usual and out popped the little girl, and as usual she headed straight for the cage. Only this time she stopped about six feet away and screamed: ""DDDAAAADDDDDDDYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""</p>
<p>Her father, panic stricken, stood looking at the cage. Being the good neighbour that I am I rushed to fence and asked if there was anything I could do.</p>
<p>Her father less than calmly blurted, ""What kind of sick individual would dig up a little girl's dead rabbit and put it back in it's cage??""</p>

28030,"<p>Keep the following in mind when going poopies at work...</p>
<p>We've all been there, but don't like to admit it.  We've all<br /> kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew<br /> down below.  WORK POOP is inevitable.  For those who hate<br /> pooping at work, following is the 2000 Survival Guide for taking<br /> a dump at work.  Memorize these definitions and pooping at work<br /> will become a pure pleasure.</p>
<p>ESCAPEE - Definition:  A fart that slips out while taking a leak<br /> at the urinal or forcing a poop in the stall.  This is usually<br /> accompanied by a sudden wave of panic and embarrassment.  This<br /> is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen<br /> police car and speeding.  If you release an escapee, do not<br /> acknowledge it.  Pretend it did not happen.  If you are standing<br /> next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it.<br /> No one likes an escapee.  It is uncomfortable for all involved.<br /> Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.</p>
<p>JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE) - Definition:  When<br /> forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace.<br /> This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover.  If<br /> this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until<br /> everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the<br /> awkwardness of what just occurred.</p>
<p>COURTESY FLUSH - Definition:  The act of flushing the toilet the<br /> instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the<br /> poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location.  This reduces<br /> the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom.<br /> This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.</p>
<p>WALK OF SHAME - Definition:  Walking from the stall, to the<br /> sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom.<br /> This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and<br /> busts you.  As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the<br /> smell does not exist.  Can be avoided with the use of the<br /> COURTESY FLUSH.</p>
<p>OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER - Definition:  A colleague who poops at<br /> work and is damn proud of it.  You will often see an Out Of The<br /> Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine<br /> under their arm.  Always look around the office for the Out Of<br /> The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom.</p>
<p>THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) - Definition:  A group of<br /> coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off<br /> without incident. This group can help you to monitor the<br /> whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE<br /> HAVENS.</p>
<p>SAFE HAVENS - Definition:  A seldom used bathroom somewhere in<br /> the<br /> building where you can least expect visitors.  Try floors that<br /> are predominantly of the opposite sex.  This will reduce the<br /> odds of<br /> a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.</p>
<p>TURD BURGLAR - Definition:  A pooper who does not realize that<br /> you are in the stall and tries to force the door  open.  This is<br /> one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur<br /> when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall<br /> until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all<br /> uncomfortable eye contact.</p>
<p>CAMO-COUGH - Definition:  A phony cough that alerts all new<br /> entrants into the bathroom that you are in a  stall.  This can<br /> be used to cover up a WATERMELON or to alert potential Turd<br /> Burglars.  Very effective when used in conjunction with an<br /> ASTAIRE.</p>
<p>ASTAIRE - Definition:  A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert<br /> potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall.  This<br /> will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied.  If you hear<br /> an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can<br /> poop in peace.</p>
<p>WATERMELON - Definition:  A turd that creates a loud splash when<br /> hitting the toilet water.  This is also an embarrassing<br /> incident.  If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a<br /> diversion.  SEE CAMO-COUGH.</p>
<p>HAVANA OMELET - Definition:  A load of diarrhea that creates a<br /> series of loud splashes in the toilet water.  Often accompanied<br /> by an Escapee.  Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire.</p>
<p>UNCLE TED - Definition:  A bathroom user who seems to linger<br /> around<br /> forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the<br /> mirror or sitting on the pot.  An Uncle Ted makes it difficult<br /> to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop<br /> your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well<br /> as the other bathroom attendees. </p>

<p>After one year and $180,000.00, they concluded that the reason the head was larger than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure during sex. </p>
<p>After the U.S. published the study, France decided to do their own study. </p>
<p>After $250,000.00 and 3 years of research, they concluded that it was to give the woman more pleasure during sex. </p>

The preacher took the mower and began to try to crank it. He pulled on the string a few times with no response from the mower.

"
28071,"<p>1.- Al encender su carro :</p>
<p>Pida al Dios Todo Poderoso que lo cuide y proteja contra los peligros que encontrar� en las calles dominicanas. Tenga mucho cuidado con los ""conductores en reversa"". Esta clase de conductores son muy famosos por salir en reversa desde sus marquesinas, sin importarles mucho lo que pueda haber en el camino. Si se encuentra con uno de estos ""conductores"" entonces usted podr� poner en pr�ctica el saludo dominicano de ""conductores"".</p>
<p>2.- Saludo dominicano de conductores :</p>
<p>Para saludar a un conductor dominicano, baje lentamente su ventana y con un tono grave y fuerte diga: ""TU MALDITA MADRE"", puede incluirse al final de la expresi�n alg�n sustantivo calificativo como: ""JUE LA GRAN PUTA"", ""MARICONAZO"", ""DEGRACIAO"", ""FATAL"" (escoja el mas adecuado). De todas maneras, est� siempre preparado para responder con un ""VAYASE A LA MIERDA"" o ""CALLESE BUENA MIERDA"". En caso de que el otro conductor lo haya saludado primero. Puede acompa�ar el saludo con se�ales producidas con el dedo mayor de cualquiera de sus manos.</p>
<p>3.- Luces direccionales :</p>
<p>Si un conductor en otro carril enciende sus luces direccionales con la intenci�n de cambiar de carril, no lo deje entrar a su carril. De hecho, pise el acelerador y p�ngase pr�ximo a �l. Es probable que el conductor intente saludarlo, pero usted ya sabe exactamente que hacer (ver parrafo anterior referente a! saludos Dominicanos de Conductores).</p>
<p>4.-Sem�foros :</p>
<p>Estos interesantes artefactos suelen encontrarse en las intersecciones de las calles sin tener ninguna razon de existir, pero ah� est�n. Es muy probable encontrar conductores detenidos observando como cambian las luces de colores (una experiencia fascinante). Los polic�as de tr�nsito creen que cada color tiene un significado que el conductor debe respetar. De la observaci�n efectuada se ha determinado el significado de cada color:</p>
<p>a.- Luz amarilla: acelere su carro tanto como pueda.<br /> b.- Luz roja: esta luz le permite a 5 o 6 carros m�s despu�s de su encendido.<br /> c.- Luz verde: reduzca la velocidad y espere que 5 o 6 carros atraviesen su luz roja.</p>
<p>Nota: es vital tocar la bocina a los 1.5 segundos del encendido de la luz verde.</p>
<p>5.- Cambio de carril :</p>
<p>Antes que nada, no importa lo que vaya a hacer, nunca encienda sus luces direccionales, de lo contrario provocar la reacci�n del otro conductor ver (Luces direccionales). Observe al conductor que viene por el carril al que desea cambiarse, y ante su menor descuido m�tase desenfrenadamente, se sorprender� al darse cuenta que s�lo necesita unos cent�metros entre carro y carro. En ese momento ser� saludado (ver p�rrafo anterior referente a saludos Dominicanos de Conductores) por no menos de 3 conductores. Para perfeccionar su cambio de carril hay varias t�cnicas, por ejemplo: intente desacelerar su carro dr�sticamente y en cuesti�n de segundos, no deje de observar el fen�meno de reacci�n en cadena producido por el conductor de atr�s, y en medio del caos cambie de carril y acelere.</p>
<p>6.- Tapones :</p>
<p>Durante los tapones se realizan actividades muy divertidas:</p>
<p>a. Toque su bocina;<br /> b. Retoque su maquillaje (conductoras Femeninas);<br /> c. Pierda peso sudando como un perro si no tiene aire acondicionado;<br /> d. Salude a otros conductores (ver p�rrafo anterior referente a saludos Dominicanos de Conductores).<br /> e. Perfeccione su cambio de carril.<br /> f. Hable por el celular (es m�s com�n utilizarlo mientras conduce).<br /> g. S�quese los mocos, introduciendo su dedo hasta lo m�s profundo de su cerebro y forme bolitas con ellos para entretenerse mientras espera.<br /> h. Escupa fuertemente hacia la calle y luego mire los labios de los otros ""conductores"" mientras le dicen ""mira ese puerco""</p>
<p>7.- Peatones :</p>
<p>Estos individuos son una molestia para los ""conductors"". En caso de encontrar uno de estos, acelere y mu�strele qui�n es el jefe. En las intersecciones, ceda el paso al peat�n y cuando lo tenga en la mira t�rele el carro arriba. Si no llega a darle, puesto que son muy h�biles, no se preocupe, seguramente le habr� dado un buen susto.</p>

28077,"<p>An WWII American soldier had been on the front lines in Europe<br /> for three months, when he was finally given a week of R&amp;R. He<br /> caught a supply boat to a supply base in the south of England,<br /> then caught a train to London.</p>
<p>The train was extremely crowded and he could not find a seat. He<br /> was dead on his feet and walked the length of the train looking<br /> for any place to sit down. Finally he found a compartment with<br /> seats facing each other; there was room for two people on each<br /> seat. On one side sat only a proper looking, older British lady,<br /> with a small dog sitting in the empty seat beside her.</p>
<p>""Could I please sit in that seat?"" he asked. The lady looked<br /> down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ""You Americans<br /> are so rude"" she said, ""Can't you see my dog is sitting there?""</p>
<p>He walked through the train more and still could not find a<br /> seat. He found himself back at the same place. ""Lady, I love<br /> dogs - have a couple at home so I would be glad to hold your dog<br /> if I can just sit down"" he said. The lady wrinkled her nose and<br /> snorted, ""You Americans are not only rude, you are arrogant.""</p>
<p>He leaned against the wall for a time, but was so tired he<br /> finally said, ""Lady, I've been on the front lines in Europe for<br /> three months with not a decent rest for all that time. Could I<br /> just please sit there and hold your dog?"" The lady replied, ""You<br /> Americans are not only rude and arrogant, you are also<br /> obnoxious.""</p>
<p>With that comment, the soldier calmly stepped it, picked up the<br /> dog, threw it out the window and sat down. The lady was<br /> speechless.</p>
<p>An older neatly dressed Englishman sitting across on the other<br /> seat spoke up. ""Young man, I do not know if all you Americans<br /> fit the lady's description of you or not. But I do know that you<br /> Americans do a lot of things wrong. You drive on the wrong side<br /> of the road, you hold your fork with the wrong hand, and now you<br /> have just thrown the wrong bitch out of the window!""</p>

28080,"<p>An Irishman had been drinking at a pub all night. The bartender finally said that the bar was closing. So the Irishman stood up to leave and fell flat on his face. He tried to stand one more time; same result. He figured he'll crawl outside and get some fresh air and maybe that will sober him up.Once outside he stood up and fell flat on his face. So he decided to crawl the 4 blocks to his home. When he arrived at the door he stood up and again fell flat on his face. He crawled through the door and into his bedroom.When he reached his bed he tried one more time to stand up. This time he managed to pull himself upright, but he quickly fell right into bed and was sound asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.He was awakened the next morning to his wife standing over him, shouting, ""So, you've been out drinking again!""""What makes you say that?"" he asked, putting on an innocent look.""The pub called -- you left your wheelchair there again.""</p>

28083,"<p>When I was a young spry turkey, new to the coop,<br /> My big brother Mike took me out on the stoop,</p>
<p>Then he sat me down, and he spoke real slow,<br /> And he told me there was something that I had to know;</p>
<p>His look and his tone I will always remember,<br /> When he told me of the horrors of..... Black November;</p>
<p>""Come about August, now listen to me,<br /> Each day you'll get six meals instead of just three,</p>
<p>""And soon you'll be thick, where once you were thin,<br /> And you'll grow a big rubbery thing under your chin;</p>
<p>""And then one morning, when you're warm in your bed,<br /> In'll burst the farmer's wife, and hack off your head;</p>
<p>""Then she'll pluck out all your feathers so you're bald 'n pink,<br /> And scoop out all your insides and leave ya lyin' in the sink;</p>
<p>""And then comes the worst part"" he said not bluffing,<br /> ""She'll spread your cheeks and pack your rear with stuffing"".</p>
<p>Well, the rest of his words were too grim to repeat,<br /> I sat on the stoop like a winged piece of meat,</p>
<p>And decided on the spot that to avoid being cooked,<br /> I'd have to lay low and remain overlooked;</p>
<p>I began a new diet of nuts and granola,<br /> High-roughage salads, juice and diet cola;</p>
<p>And as they ate pastries, chocolates and crepes,<br /> I stayed in my room doing Jane Fonda tapes;</p>
<p>I maintained my weight of two pounds and a half,<br /> And tried not to notice when the bigger birds laughed;</p>
<p>But 'twas I who was laughing, under my breath,<br /> As they chomped and they chewed, ever closer to death;</p>
<p>And sure enough when Black November rolled around,<br /> I was the last turkey left in the entire compound;</p>
<p>So now I'm a pet in the farmer's wife's lap;<br /> I haven't a worry, so I eat and I nap;</p>
<p>She held me today, while sewing and humming,<br /> And smiled at me and said ""Christmas is coming ...""</p>

What makes you think you can stereotype women that way? What does the color of a person's hair have to do with her worth as a human being? It's guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in the community and from reaching our full potential as a person, because you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against, not only blondes, but women in general...and all in the name of humor!''</p>

28092,"<p>When you are going out together<br /> 1. Avoid at all costs comparing your current boyfriends faults<br /> with your ex boyfriends good points.<br /> 2. (No offence to women) But women do have a tendency to nag,<br /> men will always be the laid back ones who dont seem to give a<br /> damn whether or not they see you often, whether they do or not<br /> remains a mystery.<br /> 3. Avoid the green monster!!! (JEALOUSY!)<br /> 4. Dont nag. Discuss situations which have occured, either on<br /> the phone or face to face, not txts or internet.<br /> 5. A texting relationship, is a dreadful relationship. This is<br /> because everything is slang, eg I luv u? Spelt wrong, it just<br /> dont have the same effect as when spelt properly or said with<br /> true feeling.<br /> 6. Make sure you talk about sex issues when you feel ready for<br /> it, dont leave things unsaid or you wont know where you stand<br /> with each other.<br /> 7. Lads! Please try, make an effort, it doesnt exactly make a<br /> girl feel too great when her boyfriend acts like he doesnt want<br /> to spend quality time with her, eg time spent alone.<br /> 8. TALK SO YOUR GIRLFRIEND CAN ACTUALLY HEAR YOU!!!!!!!! (just<br /> kidding, well it can get a ickle bit annoyin sometimes but also<br /> sweet)<br /> 9. Give your girlfriend help when she is giving you sexual<br /> favours, eg point out what you like best, this goes both ways<br /> girls, were not all mind-readers you know!<br /> 10. Dont try to pressurise your boyfriend/girlfriend into doing<br /> anything they are not sure about. It could ruin everything for<br /> both of you. You may not think it girls, but this applies to you<br /> too.</p>
<p>When the relationship has ended.<br /> 1. Do not be bitter, about anything. For example do not talk<br /> about how your ex is small in particular departments and how<br /> they cannot perform to certain standards.<br /> 2. Try not to check up where your ex is or who he/she is with<br /> now.<br /> 3. Do NOT under ANY circumstances send letters, texts, emails or<br /> anything of the sort telling your ex you still have feelings for<br /> them. This is a VERY, VERY bad idea!!!!!<br /> 4. Second time round doesnt usually work out too great, think of<br /> the reasons why you ended it in the first place!!! (in my case i<br /> am trying to prove this wrong!!! It WILL work out better for me<br /> and the current boyfriend this time round, the second, well i<br /> bloody hope so anyway!!)</p>
<p>FINALLY BOTH OF YOU NEED TO TRY AND MAKE THINGS WORK. So good<br /> luck to all of you in a relationship and we hope we have helped<br /> you out with our youthful, but knowledgeable insight to the<br /> world of teenage dating!!</p>

28095,"<p>In a recent contest, The Washington Post asked readers to dream up new<br /> elements for the Periodic Table. Among the best of the batch:</p>
<p>Limbaughium Lb The heaviest known element. It possesses an ever-expanding<br /> mass. Very white. Acidic. Emits heat but no light. Instantly polarizes all<br /> elements that come in contact with it. Repels protons and electrons;<br /> attracts only morons.</p>
<p>Billclintium Bc With a slick appearance and slimy texture, this element<br /> undergoes a series of interesting changes when in hot water.</p>
<p>Canadium Eh Similar to Americium, but a little denser. Much more rigid.<br /> Often called Boron.</p>
<p>Innofensium Pc Precisely equal numbers of electrons, protons, neutrons,<br /> leptons, quarks.Completely inert, utterly useless, but smells like a rose.</p>
<p>Newtium Nt Extreme irritant. Carries a strong negative charge. Does not<br /> possess magnetic properties. Can be purchased cheaply.</p>
<p>Quaylium Vp Einsteinium it ain't.</p>
<p>Budweisium Ps Has no taste or smell; is often indistinguishable from water.</p>
<p>Cabmium Cb Found in abundance, except when needed. Exists in two states,<br /> in motion and at rest. When in motion, it cannot be stopped, no matter<br /> what you do. Cabmium has a charge associated with it. The charge is<br /> variable, and scientists have not determined the formula for calculating<br /> it.</p>
<p>Politicium Po Contains a great deal of gas. Similar to radon in that it<br /> can reach lethal concentrations in the House.</p>
<p>Congress Cg Atomic number 525. Can never be found in a solution.</p>

28100,"<p>The String And Octopus Guide To Parenthood<br /> by Colin Bowles</p>
<p>Preparation for parenthood is not just a matter of reading books and decorating the nursery. Here are 12 simple tests for expectant parents to take to prepare themselves for the real-life experience of being a mother or father.</p>
<p>1. Women: to prepare for maternity, put on a dressing gown and stick a beanbag down the front. Leave it there for 9 months. After 9 months, take out 10% of the beans.</p>
<p>Men: to prepare for paternity, go to the local pharmacy, tip the contents of your wallet on the counter, and tell the pharmacist to help himself. Then go to the supermarket. Arrange to have your salary paid directly to their head office. Go home. Pick up the paper. Read it for the last time.</p>
<p>2. Before you finally go ahead and have children, find a couple who are already parents and berate them about their methods of discipline, lack of patience, appallingly low tolerance levels, and how they have allowed their children to run riot. Suggest ways in which they might improve their child's sleeping habits, toilet training, table manners and overall behavior. Enjoy it, it'll be the last time in your life that you will have all the answers.</p>
<p>3. To discover how the nights will feel, walk around the living room from 5pm to 10pm carrying a wet bag weighing approximately 8-12 lbs.  At 10pm, put the bag down, set the alarm for midnight, and go to sleep. Get up at 12 and walk around the living room again, with the bag, until 1am.  Put the alarm on for 3am. As you can't get back to sleep, get up at 2am and make a drink. Go to bed at 2:45am. Get up again at 3am when the alarm goes off. Sing songs in the dark until 4am. Put the alarm on for 5am. Get up. Make breakfast. Keep this up for 5 years. Look cheerful.</p>
<p>4. Can you stand the mess children make? To find out, first smear ice cream onto the sofa and strawberry jam onto the curtains. Hide a fish stick behind the stereo and leave it there all summer. Stick your fingers in the flower beds then rub them on the clean walls. Cover the stains with crayons. How does that look?</p>
<p>5. Dressing small children is not as easy as it seems: first buy a live octopus and a fishnet bag. Attempt to put the octopus into the fishnet bag so that none of the arms hang out. Time allowed for this: all morning.</p>
<p>6. Take an egg carton. Using a pair of scissors and a pot of paint, turn it into an alligator. Now take a toilet tube. Using only cellophane tape and a piece of foil, turn it into a Christmas cracker. Last, take a milk container, a ping pong ball, and an empty packet of Coco Pops, and make an exact replica of the Eiffel Tower.  Congratulations. You have just qualified for a place on the playgroup committee.</p>
<p>7. Forget the Peugeot 205 and buy a Sierra. And don't think you can leave it out in the driveway spotless and shining. Family cars don't look like that. Buy a chocolate popsickle and put it in the glove compartment. Leave it there. Get a pencil and wedge it firmly in the cassette player. Take a family-size packet of chocolate biscuits.  Mash them down into the back seats. Run a garden rake along both sides of the car. There. Perfect.</p>
<p>8. Get ready to go out. Wait outside the bathroom for half an hour.  Go out the front door. Come in again. Go out. Come back in. Go out again. Walk down the front path. Walk back up it. Walk down it again. Walk very slowly down the road for 5 minutes. Stop to inspect minutely every cigarette end, piece of used chewing gum, dirty tissue and dead insect along the way. Retrace your steps.. Scream that you've had as much as you can stand, until the neighbors come out and stare at you. Give up and go back into the house. You are now just about ready to try taking a small child for a walk.</p>
<p>9. Always repeat everything you say at least five times.</p>
<p>10. Go to your local supermarket. Take with you the nearest thing you can find to be a pre-school child, a fully grown goat is excellent. If you intend to have more than one child, take more than one goat. Buy your week's groceries without letting the goats out of your sight.  Pay for everything the goats eat or destroy. Until you can easily accomplish this, do not even contemplate having children.</p>
<p>11. Hollow out a melon. Make a small hole in the side. Suspend it from the ceiling and swing it from side to side. Now get a bowl of soggy oatmeal and attempt to spoon it into the swaying melon by pretending to be an airplane. Continue until half of the oatmeal is gone. Tip the rest into your lap, making sure that a lot of it falls on the floor.  You are now ready to feed a 12-month old baby.</p>
<p>12. Learn the names of every character from Postman Pat, Fireman Sam, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. When you find yourself singing ""Postman Pat"" at work, you finally qualify as a parent.</p>

I thought, ""Well, that's wives for you. The children will remember. ""The children came down to breakfast and didn't say a word.When I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet said, ""Good Morning, Boss, Happy Birthday."" I felt a little better. Someone had remembered. I worked until noon, then Janet knocked on my door and said, ""You know it is such a beautiful day outside and it is your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me."" I said, ""By George, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go.We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go. We went out into the country to a little private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously. On the way back to the office, she said, ""You know, it is such a beautiful day, we don't need to go back to the office, do we?"" I said, ""No, I guess not."" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment.""After arriving at her apartment she said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable. Sure,"" I excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes she came out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my wife, children and dozens of our friends. They were all singing Happy Birthday.......and there I sat on the couch.......naked.</p>

28124,"<p>IMPORTANT! READ THIS BEFORE USING YOUR NEW DEVICE</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have purchased an extremely fine device that would give you thousands of years of trouble-free service, except that you undoubtedly will destroy it via some typical bone-head consumer maneuvers. Which is why we ask you to:</p>
<p>PLEASE FOR GOD'S SAKE READ THIS OWNER'S MANUAL CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU UNPACK THE DEVICE.</p>
<p>YOU ALREADY UNPACKED IT, DIDN'T YOU? YOU UNPACKED IT AND PLUGGED IT IN AND TURNED IT ON AND FIDDLED WITH THE KNOBS, AND NOW YOUR CHILD, THE SAME CHILD WHO ONCE SHOVED A POLISH SAUSAGE INTO YOUR VIDEOCASSETTE RECORDER AND SET IT ON ""FAST FORWARD"", THIS CHILD ALSO IS FIDDLING WITH THE KNOBS, RIGHT?</p>
<p>WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST BREAK THESE DEVICES RIGHT AT THE FACTORY BEFORE WE SHIP THEM OUT, YOU KNOW THAT?!?</p>
<p>We're sorry. We just get a little crazy sometimes because we're always getting back ""defective"" merchandise where it turns out that the consumer inadvertently bathed the device in acid for six days. So, in writing these instructions, we naturally tend to assume that your skull is filled with dead insects, but we mean nothing by it. OK? Now let's talk about:</p>
<p>1. UNPACKING THE DEVICE The device is encased in foam to protect it from the Shipping People, who like nothing more than to jab spears into outgoing boxes.</p>
<p>PLEASE INSPECT THE CONTENTS CAREFULLY FOR GASHES OR IDA MAE BARKER'S ENGAGEMENT RING, WHICH SHE LOST LAST WEEK, AND SHE THINKS MAYBE IT WAS WHILE SHE WAS PACKING DEVICES.</p>
<p>Ida Mae really wants that ring back because it is her only proof of engagement, and her fiancee, Stuart, is now seriously considering backing out on the whole thing in as much as he had consumed most of a bottle of Jim Beam in Quality Control when he decided to pop the question. It is not without irony that Ida Mae's last name is ""Barker"",if you get our drift.</p>
<p>WARNING: DO NOT EVER AS LONG AS YOU LIVE THROW AWAY THE BOX OR ANY OF THE PIECES OF STYROFOAM, EVEN THE LITTLE ONES SHAPED LIKE PEANUTS.If you attempt to return the device to the store, and you are missing one single pea-nut, the store personnel will laugh in the chilling manner exhibited by Joseph Stalin just after he enslaved Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Besides the device, the box should also contain: * Eight little rectangular snippets of paper that say ""WARNING"" * A little plastic packet containing four 5/17 inch pilfer grommets and two club-ended 6/93 inch boxcar prawns. YOU WILL NEED TO SUPPLY: a matrix wrench and 60,000 feet of tram cable.</p>
<p>IF ANYTHING IS DAMAGED OR MISSING: You IMMEDIATELY should turn to your spouse and say ""Margaret, you know why this country can't make a car that can get all the way through the drive-through at Burger King without a major transmission overhaul? Because nobody cares, that's why.""</p>
<p>WARNING: This is assuming your spouse's name is Margaret. And not Pete.</p>
<p>2. PLUGGING IN THE DEVICE The plug on this device represents the latest thinking of the electrical industry's Plug Mutation Group, which, in a continuing effort to prevent consumers from causing hazardous electrical current to flow through their appliances, developed the Three-Pronged Plug, then the Plug where One Prong is Bigger Than the Other. Your device is equipped with the revolutionary new Plug Whose Prongs Consist of Six Small Religious Figurines Made of Chocolate.</p>
<p>DO NOT TRY TO PLUG IT IN! Lay it gently on the floor near an outlet, but out of direct sunlight, and clean it weekly with a damp handkerchief.</p>
<p>WARNING: WHEN YOU ARE LAYING THE PLUG ON THE FLOOR, DO NOT HOLD A SHARP OBJECT IN YOUR OTHER HAND AND TRIP OVER THE CORD AND POKE YOUR EYE OUT, AS THIS COULD VOID THE WARRANTY.</p>
<p>3. OPERATION OF THE DEVICE</p>
<p>WARNING: WE MANUFACTURE ONLY THE ATTRACTIVE DESIGNER CASE. THE ACTUAL WORKING CENTRAL PARTS OF THE DEVICE ARE MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN. THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE TRANSLATED BY MRS. SHIRLEY PELTWATER OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, WHO HAS NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN TO JAPAN BUT DOES HAVE MOST OF ""SHOGUN"" ON TAPE.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: For results that can be the finest, it is our advising that: NEVER to hold these buttons two times!! Except the battery. Next taking the (something) earth section may cause a large occurrence! However. If this is not a trouble, such rotation is a very maintenance action, as a kindly (something) viewpoint from Drawing B.</p>
<p>4. WARRANTY<br /> Be it hereby known that this device, together with but not excluding all those certain parts thereunto, shall be warranted against all defects, failures and malfunctions as shall occur between now and Thursday afternoon shortly before 2, during which time the Manufacturer will, at no charge to the Owner, send the device to our Service People, who will emerge from their caves and engage in rituals designed to cleanse it of evil spirits. This warranty does not cover the attractive designer case.</p>
<p>WARNING: IT MAY BE A VIOLATION OF SOME LAW THAT MRS. SHIRLEY PELTWATER HAS ""SHOGUN"" ON TAPE</p>

28125,"<p>First Lady Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno were having one of those girl to girl talks.</p>
<p>Hillary said to Janet, ""You're lucky that you don't have to put up with men having sex with you. I have to put up with Bill, and there is no telling where he last had his pecker.""</p>
<p>Janet responded, ""Just because I am esthetically challenged (that's ""politically correct"" for ugly) doesn't mean I don't have to fight off unwelcome sexual advances.""</p>
<p>Hillary asks, ""Well, how do you deal with the problem?""</p>
<p>Janet, ""Whenever I feel that a guy is getting ready to make a pass at me, I muster all my might and squeeze out the loudest, nastiest fart that I can.""</p>
<p>That night, Bill was already in bed with the lights out when Hillary slips into bed. She could hear him start to stir, and knew that he would be wanting some action. She had been saving her farts all day, and was ready for him.</p>
<p>She tenses up her butt cheeks and forces out the most disgusting sounding fart you could imagine.</p>
<p>Bill rolls over and says, ""Janet, is that you?</p>

<p>So they went to his place and when they were in bed, screwing, he started to laugh to himself. When she asked what was so funny, he answered,<br /> ""Well, I've only been a lawyer for 15 minutes, and I'm already screwing someone!""</p>

28130,"<p>Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Taster named FRANK, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast when he got roped into testing chili:</p>
<p>""Recently I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon when the call came.</p>
<p>I was assured by the other two judges and (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.</p>
<p>Here are the scorecards from the event:</p>
<p>Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild!</p>
<p>FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.</p>
<p>Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.</p>
<p>Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.</p>
<p>FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now, get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.</p>
<p>Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.</p>
<p>FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it, is it possible to burn-out taste buds? Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that ugly bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac?</p>
<p>Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.</p>
<p>FRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning</p>
<p>my lips off? It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks!</p>
<p>Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.</p>
<p>FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally, she must be kinkier than I thought. Can't</p>
<p>feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!</p>
<p>Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not</p>
<p>getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4 inch hole in my stomach.</p>
<p>Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili</p>
<p>JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.</p>
<p>JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chili?</p>
<p>FRANK: (editor's note: Judge #3 was unable to report)</p>

Else he may elude me<br /> yet.<br /> Witch Tripp: His dog Buddy, freshly neuter'd, may bear his Master harsh<br /> reproach. He may consent to wearing a collar of our invention, to survey the<br /> king at his ease. Dogs are much accustom'd to insects. What's one more bug?<br /> Starr: Good hag, I rely on you completely.

Methinks I spied the van from Hard Copy.<br /> Leer: You cut me to the quick. Do they not know that I am chaste?<br /> McCurry: They insinuate that thou hast chased too often.<br /> Leer: Never have lies been so artfully stack'd against a pure soul. Where is<br /> Lady Hillary?<br /> McCurry: Her secretary doth report that she is lock'd in her bath, saying over<br /> and over, ""Why can I not wash my hands of this guy?""<br /> Leer: Oh cursed fate!

28141,"<p>These days, pressure to do drugs is all around, so it's vital that you reach<br /> your kids early. Here are some tips for talking to them about marijuana and<br /> other illegal substances.<br /> * Tell your kids that if they ever do drugs, CIA Director William Webster will<br /> think they are losers.<br /> * As an alternative to drugs, suggest ""cool"" drug-free activities, like making<br /> a bird feeder out of a milk carton or interviewing local seniors about what the<br /> olden days were like.<br /> * Before engaging in any stressful discussion with your children, take a<br /> moment to smoke a bowl or two to relax. Scare your kids straight with the<br /> terrifying tale of the time you were 16 and did bong hits in the back of an El<br /> Camino outside a Kansas concert.<br /> * Explain that only lowlifes like pro athletes and rock stars use drugs.<br /> * Kids may ask too many questions. To save time, just explain to them that the<br /> powder-filled balloons will keep them from getting sick on the plane ride back<br /> to America.<br /> * If your child must use drugs, make it a culturally enriching experience by<br /> hiring a certified shaman to take him/her on a traditional peyote vision quest.<br /> * As an alternative to harmful drugs like marijuana, encourage your kids to<br /> experiment with safe, legal substances like cigarettes and alcohol.<br /> * Be direct, brief, and to the point. Remember, you only have about 45 minutes<br /> or so before the acid really starts to kick in.<br /> * Today's kids place an emphasis on good ""vibes"" in a conversational setting.<br /> Accentuate the site of your talk with black-light posters and lava lamps. Keep<br /> the lighting dim, hanging wall-sized tie-dyes or tapestries over exterior<br /> windows to blot out all sunlight.<br /> * Explain to your kids that the reason they call it ""dope"" is that you have to<br /> be a ""dope"" to use it. From then on, the mere mention of ""dope"" will flood their<br /> minds with terrifying imagery of ""being a dope,"" scaring them off drugs<br /> forever.<br /> * Record your conversation with your child, then unspool, cut up and<br /> reassemble the recording at random. Use the resultant juxtaposed fragments to<br /> predict the future in a process similar to the throwing of the I Ching.<br /> * Ask the editors of Highlights for Children to repeat the strip in which<br /> Goofus OD's and chokes on his own vomit in a bathroom stall at the train<br /> station.<br /> * Before bringing up drugs with your kids, hook your turntables up to<br /> a wah-wah pedal.</p>

28143,"<p>A man takes the day off work and decides to go out golfing. </p>
<p>He is on the second hole when he notices a frog sitting next to the green.</p>
<p>He thinks nothing of it and is about to shoot when he hears, ""Ribbit 9 Iron.""</p>
<p>The man looks around and doesn't see anyone. </p>
<p>Again, he hears, ""Ribbit 9 Iron.""  </p>
<p>He looks at the frog and decides to prove the frog wrong, puts the club away, and grabs a 9 iron.</p>
<p>Boom! He hits it 10 inches from the cup. He is shocked.</p>
<p>He says to the frog, ""Wow that's amazing. You must be a lucky frog, eh?  </p>
<p>The frog replies, ""Ribbit Lucky frog.""</p>
<p>The man decides to take the frog with him to the next hole. ""What do you think frog?"" the man asks. </p>
<p>""Ribbit 3 wood.""</p>
<p>The guy takes out a 3-wood and, Boom! Hole-in-one.  </p>
<p>The man is befuddled and doesn't know what to say. By the end of the day, the man golfed the best game of golf in his life and asks the frog, ""OK where to next?""  </p>
<p>The frog replies, ""Ribbit Las Vegas.""</p>
<p>They go to Las Vegas and the guy says, ""OK frog, now what?"" </p>
<p>The frog says, ""Ribbit Roulette.""  Upon approaching the roulette table, the man asks, ""What do you think I should bet?""  </p>
<p>The frog replies, ""Ribbit $3000, black 6."" </p>
<p>Now, this is a million-to-one shot to win, but after the golf game, the man figures what the heck.</p>
<p>Boom! Tons of cash comes sliding back across the table.  </p>
<p>The man takes his winnings and buys the best room in the hotel.  </p>
<p>He sits the frog down and says, ""Frog, I don't know how to repay you. You've won me all this money and I am forever grateful"".</p>
<p>The frog replies, ""Ribbit Kiss Me."" </p>
<p>He figures why not, since after all the frog did for him, he deserves it.   </p>
<p>With a kiss, the frog turns into a gorgeous 15-year-old girl. </p>
<p>""And that, your honor, is how the girl ended up in my room. </p>
<p>So help me God or my name is not William Jefferson Clinton."" </p>

28147,"<p>MATURITY:   Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year old females can function as adults. Most 17-year old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out. HANDWRITING:   To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken- scratch. Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their 'i's' with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their'p's' and 'g's'. It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she's dumping you, she'll put a smiley face at the end of the note. BATHROOMS:   A man has six items in his bathroom -- a toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream, razor, a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from a Holiday Inn. The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items. RESTROOMS   Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons. Women use restrooms as social lounges. Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other.  Never in the history of the world has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, 'Hey Tom, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me? CATS:   Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats. OFFSPRING:   Ah, children. A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house. SEX:   Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of foreplay.  Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay. DRESSING UP:   A woman will dress up to: go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail. A man will dress up for:  weddings and funerals. LAUNDRY:   Women do laundry every couple of days. A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants , before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul, and take his mountain of clothes to the aundromat.  Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by reruns of old episodes of 'Love, American Style.' WEDDINGS:   When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about 'the ceremony.' Men talk about 'the bachelor party.' MENOPAUSE:   When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree of these changes varies with the individual. Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction -- he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and leather driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche. THE TELEPHONE:   Men see the telephone as a communication tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same frind and they will talk for three hours. RICHARD GERE:   Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way. Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the health club and dates only married women. MADONNA:   Same as above, but reversed. Same reason.PLANTS:   A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation. The man waters the plants. The woman comes home five or six days later to an apartment full of dead plants. No one knows why this happens. CAMERAS:   Men take photography very seriously. They'll shell out $4000 for state of the art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography classes. Women purchase Kodak Instamatics. Of course, women always end up taking better pictures. LOCKER ROOMS:   In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women.  They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about one thing in the locker room -- sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie. GUNS:   Women dislike guns because they make noise and smell bad.  They also suspect a certain phallic symbolism.  A man likes guns for the same reason he likes TV remote controls:  they make something interesting happen some distance from where he is.  Protecting or feeding the family is really secondary.GARAGES:   Women use garages to park their cars and store their lawnmowers. Men use garages for many things. They hang license plates in garages, they watch TV in garages, and they build useless lopsided benches in garages. MOVIES:   Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man. The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him. TIME:   When a woman says she'll be ready to go out in five more minutes, she's using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football game's just got five minutes left. Neither of them is counting time outs, commercials, or replays</p>

The rabbit then asked for a motorbike."" poof, two wishes left."" "" duh, "" thought the bear, ""rabbit could have just asked for money and then he could have bought his own motorbike"" So bear then wished that all the bears except him in the next wood were female too. The rabbit then asked for a motorcycle helmet, put it on and kickstarted the engine. The bear was shocked at how thick the rabbit was being, he could have asked for more money and bought his own<br /> "" Rabbit, your last wish"" the frog said.

28157,"<p>Several years ago, Andy was sentenced to prison. During his stay, he got along well with the guards and all his fellow inmates. The warden new that, deep down, Andy was a good person. So, the warden made arrangements for the inmate to learn a trade while doing his time. Some three years later, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area. Often, he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for citizens of the community. And, he always reported back to prison by early Sunday evening. Andy was a model inmate. One day, the warden considered remodeling his kitchen, though he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top. So, he called Andy into his office and asked him to do the job for him. To the warden's surprise, Andy simply refused to help. ""But, you're an expert. Andy, I really need your help,"" said the warden. ""Gosh, warden, I'd really like to help you, but counter fitting is what got me into prison in the first place.""</p>

The guy, clearly offended, says, ""Well, yes I am. But<br /> let me ask you: if I had asked for Italian sausage, would you<br /> ask me if I was Italian? Or if I had asked for German sausage,<br /> would you ask me if I was German? Or if I had asked for a taco,<br /> would you ask if I was Mexican? Huh? Would ya?"" The clerk says,<br /> ""Well, no.""</p>
<p>With deep self righteous indignation, the guy says, ""All right<br /> then, why the HELL did you ask me if I'm Polish just because I<br /> ask for Polish sausage?"" The clerk says, ""Because this is a<br /> hardware store.""</p>

28178,"<p>George Carlin Speaks Out...</p>
<p>I Am Your Worst Nightmare. I am a BAD American.<br /> I am George Carlin.</p>
<p>I like big cars, big hooters, and big paychecks.<br /> I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some midlevel governmental functionary with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies.</p>
<p>I believe that if you are selling me a Big Mac, you'd better do it in English.<br /> I'm not in touch with my feelings and I like it that way.<br /> I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child, it takes two parents.<br /> I think owning a gun doesn't make you a killer.</p>
<p>I want to know which church is it exactly where the Reverend Jesse Jackson preaches. And where does he get his money. And why is he always part of the problem and not the solution.</p>
<p>I believe if she has her lips on your willie, it is sex, and it is sex for both of you. This even applies when you are President of the United States. </p>
<p>I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment than working at Blockbuster. In fact, if your parents are footing the bill to put your pansy ass through 4-7 years of college, you haven't begun to be enlightened.</p>
<p>I believe everyone has a right to pray to his or her God or gods, just leave the rest of us out of it. This also applies to sexuality.</p>
<p>I believe it's called the Boy Scouts for a reason.<br /> I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized.<br /> I don't use the excuse ""it's for the children"" as a shield for unpopular opinions or actions.<br /> I think fireworks should be legal on the 4th of July.<br /> My heroes are John Wayne, the Simpsons, and whoever canceled Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.<br /> I don't hate the rich. I don't pity the poor.<br /> I know wrestling is fake and I don't waste my time arguing about it.</p>
<p>I think global warming is a big lie. Where are all those experts now, when I am freezing my ass through a long winter?</p>
<p>I've never owned a slave, or was a slave, I didn't wander forty years in the desert after getting chased out of Egypt, I haven't burned any witches or been persecuted by the Turks and neither have you, so shut up already.</p>
<p>I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry ass if you're running from them. I also think they have the right to pull your ass over if you are breaking the law, regardless of what color you are.</p>
<p>I think if you are too stupid to know how a ballot works, I don't want you deciding who should be running the most powerful nation of the world for the next four years.</p>
<p>I think if you are in the passing lane, and not passing, your license should be revoked, and you should be forced to ride the bus until you promise to never delay the rest of us again.</p>
<p>I think beef jerky could quite possibly be the perfect food.<br /> I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but please don't pretend they are a political statement.<br /> I think Dr. Seuss was a genius.<br /> I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise.</p>
<p>If that makes me a BAD American, then yes, I'm a BAD American.<br /> If you too are a BAD American please forward this to everyone you know.</p>

28180,"<p>Seems God was just about done creating the universe, but he had<br /> two extra things left in his bag of creations, so he decided to<br /> split them between Adam and Eve. He told the couple that one of<br /> the things he had to give away was the ability to stand up while<br /> urinating. </p>
<p>""It's a very handy thing"", God told the couple, ""I was wondering<br /> if either one of you wanted that very ability.""</p>
<p>Adam jumped up and blurted, ""Oh, give that to me! I'd love to be<br /> able to do that! It seems a sort of thing a man should do. Oh<br /> please, oh please, oh please, let me have that ability. It'd be<br /> so great! When I'm working in the garden or naming the animals,<br /> I could just stand there and let it fly. It'd be so cool, I<br /> could write my name in the sand. Oh please God, let it be me who<br /> you give that gift to, let me stand and pee, oh please..."" </p>
<p>On and on he went like an excited little boy who had to pee. Eve<br /> just smiled and told God that if Adam really wanted that so<br /> badly, that he should have it. It seemed to be the sort of thing<br /> that would make him happy and she really wouldn't mind if Adam<br /> were the one given this ability. </p>
<p>And so Adam was given the ability to urinate while in a vertical<br /> position. He was happy and did celebrate by wetting down the<br /> bark on the tree nearest him, laughing with delight all the<br /> while. </p>
<p>""Fine,"" God said looking back into his bag of leftovers. ""What's<br /> left here? Oh yes, brains....""</p>

28185,"<p>We've all been interviewed for jobs. And, we've all spent most of those interviews thinking about what not to do. Don't bite your nails. Don't fidget. Don't interrupt. Don't belch. If we did any of the don'ts, we knew we'd disqualify ourselves instantly. But some job applicants go light years beyond this. We surveyed top personnel executives of 100 major American corporations and asked for stories of unusual behavior by job applicants. </p>
<p>The lowlights: </p>
<p>1. ""... stretched out on the floor to fill out the job application."" </p>
<p>2. ""She wore a Walkman and said she could listen to me and the music at the same time."" </p>
<p>3. "" A balding candidate abruptly excused himself. Returned to office a few minutes later, wearing a hairpiece."" </p>
<p>4. ""... asked to see interviewer's resume to see if the personnel executive was qualified to judge the candidate."" </p>
<p>5. ""... announced she hadn't had lunch and proceeded to eat a hamburger and French fries in the interviewer's office - wiping the ketchup on her sleeve"" </p>
<p>6. ""Stated that, if he were hired, he would demonstrate his loyalty by having the corporate logo tattooed on his forearm."" </p>
<p>7. ""Interrupted to phone his therapist for advice on answering specific interview questions."" </p>
<p>8. ""When I asked him about his hobbies, he stood up and started tap dancing around my office."" </p>
<p>9 . ""At the end of the interview, while I stood there dumbstruck, went through my purse, took out a brush, brushed his hair, and left."" </p>
<p>10. ""... pulled out a Polaroid camera and snapped a flash picture of me. Said he collected photos of everyone who interviewed him."" </p>
<p>11. ""Said he wasn't interested because the position paid too much."" </p>
<p>12. ""While I was on a long-distance phone call, the applicant took out a copy od Penthouse, and looked through the photos only, stopping longest at the centerfold."" </p>
<p>13. ""During the interview, an alarm clock went off from the candidate's brief case. He took it out, shut it off, apologized and said he had to leave for another interview."" </p>
<p>14. ""A telephone call came in for the job applicant. It was from his wife. His side of the conversation went like this: ""Which company? When do I start? What's the salary?"" I said, ""I assume you're not interested in conducting the interview any further."" He promptly responded, ""I am as long as you'll pay me more. ""I didn't hire him, but later found out there was no other job offer. It was a scam to get a higher offer."" </p>
<p>15. ""His attach� [case] opened when he picked it up and the contents spilled, revealing ladies' undergarments and assorted makeup and perfume."" </p>
<p>16. ""Candidate said he really didn't want to get a job, but the unemployment office needed proof that he was looking for one."" </p>
<p>17. ""... asked who the lovely babe was, pointing to the picture on my desk. When I said it was my wife, he asked if she was home now and wanted my phone number. I called security."" </p>
<p>18. ""Pointing to a black case he carried into my office, he said that if he was not hired, the bomb would go off. Disbelieving, I began to state why he would never be hired and that I was going to call the police. He then reached down to the case, flipped a switch and ran. No one was injured, but I did need to get a new desk.""</p>

<p>Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends. </p>
<p>Customer: Depends on what? </p>
<p>Clerk: Actually, a lot of things. </p>
<p>Customer: How about giving me an average price? </p>
<p>Clerk: Wow, that's too hard a question. The lowest price is $9 a gallon, and we have 150 different prices up to $200 a gallon. </p>
<p>Customer: What's the difference in the paint? </p>
<p>Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint. </p>
<p>Customer: Well, then, I'd like some of that $9 paint. </p>
<p>Clerk: Well, first I need to ask you a few questions. When do you intend to use it? </p>
<p>Customer: I want to paint tomorrow, on my day off. </p>
<p>Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint. </p>
<p>Customer: What? When would I have to paint in order to get the $9 version? </p>
<p>Clerk: That would be in three weeks, but you will also have to agree to start painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until at least Sunday. </p>
<p>Customer: You've got to be kidding! </p>
<p>Clerk: Sir, we don't kid around here. Of course, I'll have to check to see if we have any of that paint available before I can sell it to you. </p>
<p>Customer: What do you mean check to see if you can sell it to me? You have shelves full of that stuff; I can see it right there. </p>
<p>Clerk: Just because you can see it doesn't mean that we have it. It may be the same paint, but we sell only a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price just went to $12. </p>
<p>Customer: You mean the price went up while we were talking! </p>
<p>Clerk: Yes, sir. You see, we change prices and rules thousands of times a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with your paint yet, we just decided to change. Unless you want the same thing to happen again, I would suggest that you get on with your purchase. How many gallons do you want? </p>
<p>Customer: I don't know exactly. Maybe five gallons. Maybe I should buy six gallons just to make sure I have enough. </p>
<p>Clerk: Oh, no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy the paint and then don't use it, you will be liable for penalties and possible confiscation of the paint you already have. </p>
<p>Customer: What? </p>
<p>Clerk: That's right. We can sell you enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do the bedroom, you will be in violation of our tariffs. </p>
<p>Customer: But what does it matter to you whether I use all the paint? I already paid you for it! </p>
<p>Clerk: Sir, there's no point in getting upset; that's just the way it is. We make plans based upon the idea that you will use all the paint, and when you don't, it just causes us all sorts of problems. </p>
<p>Customer: This is crazy! I suppose something terrible will happen if I don't keep painting until after Saturday night! </p>
<p>Clerk: Yes, sir, it will. </p>
<p>Customer: Well, that does it! I'm going somewhere else to buy my paint. </p>
<p>Clerk: That won't do you any good, sir. We all have the same rules. Thanks for painting with our airline.</p>

28205,"<p>President Bush was representing the United States of America on a highly<br /> formal, orchestrated state visit to England.</p>
<p>Air Force One stops at a bright red carpet along which the President<br /> strides to join Queen Elizabeth II in a beautiful, ornate 17th-century<br /> coach hitched to 6 enormous matched white horses.</p>
<p>The coach proceeds through the streets of London en route to Buckingham<br /> Palace, the Queen and the President waving to the cheering throngs.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the right rear horse produces a thunderous, cataclysmic fart<br /> that reverberates through the air and rattles the doors of the coach.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable, the reaction of the two powerful figures is to focus their<br /> attentions elsewhere and behave as if nothing extraordinary had happened.</p>
<p>But, the Queen is the first to realize that ignoring what had just happened<br /> is ridiculous.  She explains, ""Mr.  President, please accept my regrets ---<br /> I'm sure you understand that there are some things that even a Queen cannot<br /> control.""</p>

28214,"<p>After the birth of their 10th child, an Arkansas couple decided that<br /> enough was enough.  The husband went to the doctor and told him that he<br /> and his wife didn't want any more children, and what could the doctor do<br /> to help?.  The doctor smiled, told him to go home, get a cherry bomb, put<br /> it in a can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to ten.</p>
<p>    The man relayed this story to his wife, and shaking his head in doubt<br /> said, ""I may not be the smartest man in the world, but I don't see how<br /> putting a cherry bomb in a can next to my ear is going to help!""</p>
<p>    His wife agreed, and they drove to Missouri together for a second<br /> opinion.  Surprisingly enough, when they told the second doctor why they'd<br /> come, he asked them where they were from, and then told them to buy a<br /> cherry bomb, put it in a can, and for the husband to hold it next to his<br /> ear and count to ten.</p>
<p>    Deciding that both doctors couldn't be wrong, the couple went home,<br /> lit a cherry bomb and put it in a can.  The husband held the can up to<br /> his ear and began to count: ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5..."",  at which point he<br /> paused, placed the can between his legs and counted on his other hand:<br /> ""6, 7, 8...""</p>

28221,"<p>A police chief, a fire chief, and a city manager were traveling together by car to a municipal management conference in a distant city. Their car broke down in a rural area, and they were forced to seek shelter for the night at a nearby farmhouse. The farmer welcomed them in, but cautioned them that there were only two spare beds, and that one of them would have to sleep in the barn with the farm animals. After a short conference, the police chief agreed to take the barn. Shortly after retiring, a knock was heard on the door of the farmhouse. The party inside answered to find the police chief standing there, complaining that he could not sleep. There were pigs in the barn, he said, and he was reminded of the days when everyone called him a pig. The fire chief then volunteered to exchange with the police chief. A short time later, another knock was heard at the door. The fire chief complained that the cows in the barn reminded him of Mrs. O'Leary's cow that started the Chicago fire, and that every time he started to go to sleep, he started to have a fireman's worst nightmare, that of burning to death. The city attorney, in desperation for sleep, then agreed to sleep in the barn. This seemed like a good idea until a few minutes later, when another knock was heard at the door. When the occupants answered the door, there stood the very indignant cows and pigs.</p>

His boss doesn't believe him,<br /> so he says ""No you do not know everyone in the whole world"" but<br /> Bubba says ""Yes I do!"" so Bubba's boss says ""Well prove it!""<br /> then Bubba says ""Pick someone and I know them!""</p>
<p>Well Bubba's boss thinks for a minute and then comes up with a<br /> name.</p>
<p>""Tom Selleck! I bet you don't know Tom Selleck!"" Bubba say ""Tom<br /> Selleck! Tom and I were in boy scouts together when we were<br /> kids!"" but Bubba's boss says ""No you weren't!"" then Bubba says<br /> ""Yes we were!"" so they fly to Hollywood and drive up to Tom<br /> Selleck's house. Bubba knocks on the door and Tom Selleck<br /> answers and Bubba says ""Tom!!!"" and Tom says ""Bubba!"" and they<br /> hug and catch up for 30 minutes and Bubba's boss can't believe<br /> it. But then he thinks ""Well that could happen, it's just one<br /> person,"" so he tells Bubba and Bubba says ""OK, pick somebody<br /> else!""</p>
<p>This time Bubba's boss has someone in mind! ""The president, Bill<br /> Clinton! You don't know Bill Clinton!"" but Bubba says ""Oh yes I<br /> do! Bill and I were on debate team together in college!"" Bubba's<br /> boss says ""No you weren't!"" and Bubba says ""Yes we were!"" So<br /> they fly to Washington and they catch up with the President at a<br /> press conference. They work their way through the crowd until<br /> Bubba gets close enough to catch Clinton's eye and waves ""Bill!""<br /> and the President waves ""Bubba!"" and after the press conference<br /> they hug and catch up for 30 minutes and Bubba's boss is stunned<br /> - he can't believe it. But then he thinks ""Well that's just two<br /> people in one country - that doesn't mean he knows everyone in<br /> the whole world!"" so he tells Bubba and Bubba says ""OK, pick<br /> someone out of the world spectrum and I know them!""</p>
<p>And Bubba's boss knows just who to pick so he says ""The Pope!<br /> You do not know the Pope!"" and Bubba says ""The Pope! The Pose<br /> BAPTIZED me!"" and Bubba's boss says ""No he didn't!"" and Bubba<br /> says ""Yes he did!"" So they fly to Rome where the Pope is giving<br /> Mass in front of hundreds of thousands of people. They work<br /> their way through the crowd - without much luck - so Bubba says<br /> ""Boss, we're never gonna get there together through all these<br /> people so I tell you what - I'll work my way up there and when I<br /> do, I'll give you a sign that show you I know the Pope!"" and he<br /> leaves. Well Bubba's boss waits and waits and waits and just<br /> when he's about to give up, he sees the Pope come out onto the<br /> balcony and right there beside him is Bubba!</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, Bubba's boss passes out. Bubba comes back<br /> and finds his boss passed out and he fans him and says ""Boss!<br /> Boss! Wake up!"" and when his boss comes to, he asks ""Boss what<br /> happened?"" Bubba's boss looks at Bubba and says, ""OK, I can see<br /> Tom Selleck. I can see Bill Clinton and I can even take the<br /> Pope! But when somebody standing next to me asks</p>
<p>'Who's that up there with Bubba?', that's a little more than I<br /> can take!""</p>

""Jesus is watching you,"" the voice boomed again. The burglar stopped dead again. He was frightened. Frantically, he looked all around. In a dark corner, he spotted a bird cage and in the cage was a parrot. He asked the parrot: ""Was that you who said Jesus is watching me?"" ""Yes"", said the parrot. The burglar breathed a sigh of relief, and asked the parrot: ""What's your name?"" ""Clarence,"" said the bird. ""That's a dumb name for a parrot,"" sneered the burglar.

28251,"<p>One day at a busy airport, the passengers on a commercial airliner are seated waiting for the pilot to show up so they can get under way.</p>
<p>The pilot and copilot finally appear in the rear of the plane and begin walking up to the cockpit through the center aisle. Both appear to be blind; the pilot is using a white cane, bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle. The copilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered with sunglasses.</p>
<p>At first, the passengers do not react thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke. After a few minutes though, the engines start revving, and the airplane begins moving down the runway.</p>
<p>The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness. They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance.</p>
<p>Yet, the plane starts accelerating rapidly, and people begin panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical.</p>
<p>When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once. At the very last moment, the plane lifts off and is airborne.</p>
<p>Up in the cockpit, the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: ""You know, one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream, and we aren't going to know when to take off!""</p>

"
28256,"<p>Herewith is a compendium of movie clich�s, stereotypes, obligatory scenes, hackneyed formulas, shopworn conventions and outdated archetypes.</p>
<p>The author says that as you go to enough different movies, you start to notice things. Like how every time there's a chase scene in an exotic locale, a fruit cart gets overturned. Or how whenever the hero knocks out a Nazi sentry and puts on his uniform, the uniform is a perfect fit. Or how there are plots that would be over in five minutes, if all characters weren't idiots.</p>
<p> Actress Inferior Position  -  In movie sex scenes, which are usually directed by men, the POV (Point of View) at the moment of climax is almost always the man's, so that we see the actress, not the actor, losing control.</p>
<p>AC-WAT-NOBI Movie  -  A Cop With A Theory No One Believes In.</p>
<p>Against All Odds Rule  -  In an apparently fatal situation from which there is no possible hope of survival, it is certain the characters will survive.<br /> In a situation where there is any apparent chance of survival, there will be at least some deaths.</p>
<p>""Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens.""  -  Whenever someone is alone at home at night and they hear a sound in the house and ask aloud, ""(Name), is that you?"" it NEVER is.</p>
<p> Air Vent Escape Route  -  If the hero is imprisoned in a building owned by the villains, there will inevitably be an air vent cover that is not screwed in and is easily removed. The passageway will be large enough to accommodate any size person. The escape route will pass over the room where the bad guys are discussing the details of their diabolical plan, which the hero will now be able to foil.</p>
<p>Alien Berlitz Communication Rule (ABC Rule)  -  Movie aliens are able to learn the local language (English, French, Japanese, etc.) in an amazingly short time. Frequently this includes the ability to reproduce recognizable Earth-like accents.</p>
<p>Ali MacGraw's Disease  -  Movie illness in which only symptom is that the sufferer grows more beautiful as death approaches.</p>
<p>Back seat Inviso-Syndrome  -  Film characters are invariably unable to see a person crouched in the backseat of a car (even a convertible) when, in the real world, it is an impossible place for a person to hide.</p>
<p>Bad Movie Rental Warning Rule  -  If a rental movie box has a warning such as ""If scenes of graphic horror offend you, do not rent this film!"" -do not rent this film.</p>
<p>Baguette Envy  -  In every scene which includes a person carrying a bag of groceries, the bag will invariably contain a long, skinny, French baguette loaf, and exactly 8.5 inches of it will be exposed.</p>
<p> Bartender Establishing Shot - All movie bartenders, when first seen, are wiping the inside of a glass with a rag.</p>
<p> ""Based on a True Story.""  -  Hollywood shorthand, meaning: Depressing,morbid, downbeat, including scenes so shocking or lascivious that no producer would include them in a movie unless he could excuse himself by saying these things actually happened.</p>
<p> Bathroom Rule  -  No one in the movies ever goes to the toilet to perform the usual bodily functions. Instead they either use the bathroom to take illegal drugs, commit suicide, make a criminal deal, kill someone else in a stall, get killed, or sneak out through the bathroom window.</p>
<p> Beeping Rule - In movies where cops, reporters, hackers, and others are using a computer to locate a suspect or special file, the successful retrieval of said subject is heralded with dramatic beeps, flashing messages, and other electronic indications that ""something important has been found."" The only time an ordinary computer ever beeps is when it refuses to carry out a command.</p>
<p>Beginning, The  -  Word used in titles of sequels to movies in which everyone was killed at the end of the original movie, making an ordinary sequel impossible. Explains to knowledgeable filmgoers that the movie will concern, for example, what happened in the Amityville house before the Lutzes moved in. Other examples: The First Chapter, The Early Days, etc.</p>
<p>Best Play of the Game Rule  -  Every bad sports movie ends with the hero making an extraordinary catch/play/hit in slow motion to win the game at the final gun/bell/buzzer.</p>
<p>""Betcha Can't Name That Tune"" Ploy  -  Almost all movie pianists, such as Clint Eastwood in 'In the Line of Fire', are perfectly happy playing nothing but chords. By never straying anywhere near a recognizable melody, they avoid paying royalties.</p>
<p>'Betsy' Syndrome  -  Identifying an actor in print by their latest film, regardless of how weak it was. Inspired by a newspaper article that appeared toward the end of Sir Lawrence Olivier's career, referring to him as ""Lawrence ('The Betsy') Olivier.""</p>
<p>Big Nod, The  -  Comes after the Last Word. After a character is fatally wounded, first he lies motionless and recites an incredibly meaningful statement. Then his head nods to one side.</p>
<p>Bogeyman Shot  -  Unaware victim is shot in close-up looking toward the camera, while a huge lopsided space is left vacant for the monster/killer to appear in.</p>
<p>Boob Tube  -  There is never anything worth seeing on TV in the movies.</p>
<p>Boom-Boom Rule  -  Whenever a building or a car explodes, the explosion will be repeated in its entirely from several different camera angles.</p>
<p>Born in the USA  -  Any movie set in an unnamed U.S. city will be revealed by the credits to have been filmed in Toronto or Vancouver.</p>
<p>British Roman Rule  -  All leaders of the Roman Empire have British accents. Why don't filmmakers want Romans to at least have Italian accents?</p>
<p>Broken Compass Principle  -  In New York City chase scenes, cars are able to turn off of avenues onto other avenues. This is impossible, since the avenues are parallel.</p>
<p>Bumbling Night Watchman  -  Any scene involving the good guy burgling an office at night will inevitably include a semi- competent night watchman, whose sole purpose is to inject an element of danger into an otherwise boring event. Actions performed by the watchman usually include shining flashlight through the window, rattling doorknobs, watching security monitors, etc., all done in a manner that allows the good guy to continue undetected until just after he discovers the needed information or object. He will then flee the scene with the watchman in pursuit.</p>
<p>Bun and Spectacles Rule  -  Any woman who appears in a movie with her hair in a tight bun and wearing glasses (usually large thick round ones will inevitably turn out to be the beautiful heroine. She will magically acquire perfect vision and a sexy wardrobe.</p>

28257,"<p>(A way to explain the Clinton situation to your kids)   </p>
<p>The Bubba of Scuz<br /> And the Bimbo of Loo,<br /> were sharing a pizza<br /> with nothing to do. </p>
<p>They sat and they talked,<br /> Although little was said.<br /> So they dabbled in<br /> bumblefunumpus instead. </p>
<p>(Which cannot be explained<br /> and is never polite)<br /> Whether done in the daylight<br /> or darkness of night. </p>
<p>But the Bubba of Scuz<br /> was a Loyalty Scout.<br /> Which meant that with Bimbos,<br /> funumping was out. </p>
<p>The Loyalty Scouts<br /> (an unusual breed)<br /> thought that telling the truth<br /> was the best of good deeds. </p>
<p>If ever you slipped<br /> into trouble so deep<br /> that you thought that a lie<br /> was the best way to keep </p>
<p>your brains in your head<br /> and your seat in your pants,<br /> a Loyalty Scout would say,<br /> ""Don't take the chance!"" </p>
<p>A Splonger named Ken<br /> had been watching the glade,<br /> where the Bubba and Bimbo<br /> funumped in the shade. </p>
<p>""At last,"" said the Splong<br /> (a responsible guy)<br /> ""I now have what I need<br /> to entice him to lie."" </p>
<p>The Bubba of Scuz<br /> was then pressured to tell<br /> of the things he had done<br /> in the glade by the dell. </p>
<p>""Did you yert with palookas?<br /> Or miff some goopats?<br /> I heard that you fleegered<br /> a blooper with gnats!"" </p>
<p>""I have done no such thing,""<br /> said the Bubba of Scuz.<br /> ""Those things aren't the things<br /> that a Scuz Bubba does."" </p>
<p>""But what about Bimbos?""<br /> Inquired the Splong.<br /> ""Funumping with Bimbos<br /> is equally wrong!"" </p>
<p>""I never funumped<br /> with the Bimbo of Loo.<br /> If you say that I did,<br /> what you say isn't true."" </p>
<p>Except that it was,<br /> bringing Bubba up short,<br /> when the Splonger named Ken<br /> made his final report. </p>
<p>So take this advice<br /> when you're feeling ashamed.<br /> Stick to the truth<br /> or you'll wind up defamed. </p>
<p>The Loyalty Scouts<br /> will muster you out.<br /> Your good friends will wonder<br /> what you are about. </p>
<p>And history's scribes,<br /> remembering you<br /> will skip all the good<br /> you endeavored to do. </p>
<p>Like the Bubba of Scuz<br /> who, 'til history's end,<br /> will be linked to his Bimbo<br /> and the Splonger named Ken.</p>

<p>A young boy, about eight years old, walks into the local grocery store and picks our a huge box of laundry detergent. </p>
<p>The grocer walked over, and trying to be friendly, asked the boy if he had a lot of laundry to do. </p>
<p>""Oh, no laundry,"" the boy said, ""I'm going to wash my dog!"" </p>
<p>""But you shouldn't use this to wash your dog. It's very powerful and if you wash your dog in this, he'll get sick. In fact, it might even kill him."" </p>
<p>But the boy was not to be stopped and carried the detergent to the counter and paid for it, even as the grocer still tried to talk him out of washing his dog. </p>
<p>About a week later the boy was back in the store to buy some candy. The grocer asked the boy how his dog was doing. </p>
<p>""Oh, he died,"" the boy said sadly. </p>
<p>The grocer, trying not to be an I-told-you-so, said he was sorry the dog died but added, ""I tried to tell you not to use that detergent on your dog!"" </p>
<p>""Well,"" the boy replied, ""I don't think it was the detergent that killed him."" </p>
<p>""Oh? What was it then?"" </p>

<p>4. If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four wheel drive with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is what they live for.</p>
<p>5. Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same store.</p>
<p>6. Do not buy food at the movie store.</p>
<p>7. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone eating.</p>
<p>8. Remember: ""Y'all"" is singular. ""All y'all"" is plural. ""All y'all's"" is plural possessive.</p>
<p>9. There is nothing sillier than a Northerner imitating a southern accent, unless it is a southerner imitating a Boston accent.</p>
<p>10. Get used to hearing, ""You ain't from around here, are you?""</p>
<p>11. People walk slower here.</p>
<p>12. Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't understand you either.</p>
<p>13. The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective ""Big ol'"", as in ""big ol' truck"" or ""big ol' boy"". Eighty-five percent begin their new southern influenced dialect with this expression. One hundred percent are in denial about it.</p>
<p>14. The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer proper.</p>
<p>15. Be advised: The ""He needed killin'"" defense is valid here.</p>
<p>16. If attending a funeral in the South, remember, we stay until the last shovel of dirt is thrown on and the tent is torn down.</p>
<p>17. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"" stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say.</p>
<p>18. Most Southerners do not use turn signals, and they ignore those who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the car was purchased.</p>
<p>19. Northerners can be identified by the spit on the inside of their car's windshield that comes from yelling at other drivers.</p>
<p>20. The winter wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until November.</p>
<p>21. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store, it is just something you're supposed to do.</p>
<p>22. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South.  When you purchase one, it is to be positioned directly in front of your trailer. This is logical, bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the trailer and should, therefore, be displayed.</p>
<p>23. Tornadoes and Southerners going through a divorce have a lot in common. In either case, you know someone is going to lose a trailer.</p>
<p>24. Florida is not considered a southern state. There are far more Yankees than Southerners living there.</p>
<p>25. In southern churches you will hear the hymn, ""All Glory, Laud and Honor"". You will also hear expressions such as, ""Laud, Have mercy"", ""Good Laud"", and ""Laudy, Laudy, Laudy"".</p>
<p>26. As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph zone, directly in the middle of the road, remember, many folks learned to drive on a model of vehicle known as John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for the vehicle.</p>
<p>27. You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you already know the positions of key hills, trees, rocks, and where buildings used to stand, you're better off trying to find it yourself.</p>

28311,"<p>There was once a man from the city who was visiting a small farm, and during<br /> this visit he saw a farmer feeding pigs in a most extraordinary manner. The<br /> farmer would lift a pig up to a nearby apple tree, and the pig would eat the<br /> apples off the tree directly. The farmer would move the pig from one apple to<br /> another until the pig was satisfied, then he would start again with another<br /> pig.</p>
<p>The city man watched this activity for some time with great<br /> astonishment. Finally, he could not resist saying to the farmer, ""This is the<br /> most inefficient method of feeding pigs that I can imagine. Just think of the<br /> time that would be saved if you simply shook the apples off the tree and let the<br /> pigs eat them from the ground!""</p>
<p>The farmer looked puzzled and replied, ""What's time to a pig?""</p>

<p>So he opened it and it read: �Dear God, I am an 83 year old widow<br /> living on a very small pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had a<br /> hundred dollars in it which was all the money I had until my next pension<br /> check.� �Next Sunday is Easter, and I had invited two of my friends over for<br /> dinner. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with.� �I have no family<br /> to turn to, and you are my only hope. Can you please help me?�</p>
<p>The postal worker was touched, and went around showing the letter to all the<br /> others. Each of them dug into his wallet and came up with a few dollars. By the<br /> time he made the rounds, he had collected 96 dollars, which they put into an<br /> envelope and sent over to her. The rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm<br /> glow thinking of the nice thing they had done.</p>
<p>Easter came and went, and a few days later came another letter from the old<br /> lady to God. All the workers gathered around while the letter was opened.</p>
<p>It read, �Dear God, How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me?�<br /> �Because of your generosity, I was able to fix a lovely dinner for my friends.<br /> We had a very nice day, and I told my friends of your wonderful gift. ��By the<br /> way, there was 4 dollars missing.

Authorities warn citizens not to tamper with the devices. Three friends recently spent an evening sharing drinks and exchanging insults at a local cafe in the southeastern province of Svay Rieng. Their companionable arguing continued for hours, until one man pulled out a 25-year-old unexploded anti-tank mine found in his backyard. He tossed it under the table, and the three men began playing Russian roulette, each tossing down a drink and then stomping on the mine. The other villagers fled in terror. Minutes later, the explosive detonated with a tremendous boom, killing the three men in the bar.

28338,"<p>A nun and a priest were traveling across the desert and realized halfway<br /> across that the camel they were using for transportation was about to die. They<br /> set up a make-shift camp, hoping someone would come to their rescue, but to no<br /> avail. Soon the camel died.</p>
<p>After several days of not being rescued, they agreed that they were not going<br /> to be rescued. They prayed a lot (of course), and they discussed their<br /> predicament in great depth. Finally the priest said to the nun, ""you know<br /> sister, I am about to die, and there's always been one thing I've wanted here on<br /> earth--to see a woman naked. Would you mind taking off your clothes so I can<br /> look at you?""</p>
<p>The nun thought about his request for several seconds and then agreed to take<br /> off her clothes. As she was doing so, she remarked, ""Well, Father, now that I<br /> think about it, I've never seen a man naked, either. Would you mind taking off<br /> your clothes, too?""</p>
<p>With little hesitation, the priest also stripped. Suddenly the nun exclaimed,<br /> ""Father! What is that little thing hanging between your legs?""</p>
<p>The priest patiently answered, ""That, my child, is a gift from God. If I put<br /> it in you, it creates a new life.""</p>

28381,"<p>What if Dr. Seuss was a technical writer? Here are several examples of what he may write to help you resolve your computer problems.If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort, And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report! If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash, And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash, Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash! If the above doesn't help with your computer troubles, perhaps this will.If the label on the cable on the table at your house, Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol, That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall.And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse, Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang, 'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang! When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk, And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary risc, Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM. Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom!</p>

<p>Many people had tried over time (weight-lifters, truck drivers, etc.) but<br /> nobody could do it. One day this scrawny little man came into the bar, wearing<br /> thick glasses and a polyester suit, and said in a tiny squeaky voice ""I�d like<br /> to try the bet."" </p>
<p>After the laughter had died down, the bartender said OK, grabbed a lemon, and<br /> squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little<br /> man. </p>
<p>But the crowd�s laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist<br /> around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass. </p>
<p>As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000, and asked the little man<br /> ""What do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weight-lifter, or what?"" </p>

28422,"<p>A man and woman are having a relationship for about 4 months now. One Friday night they meet at a bar after work. They stay for a few, then went to get some food at a local restaurant near their respective homes. They eat, then go back to his house and she stays over.<br /> Her story: He was in an odd mood when I got to the bar, I thought it might have been because I was a bit late but he didn't say anything much about it. The conversation was quite slow going so I thought we should go off somewhere more intimate so we could talk more privately. So we went to this restaurant and he's STILL acting a bit funny and I'm trying to cheer him up and start to wonder whether it's me or something else. I ask him, and he says no. But you know I'm not really sure. So anyway, in the cab back to his house, I say that I love him and he just puts his arm around me. I don't know what the hell this means because you know he doesn't say it back or anything. We finally get back to his place and I'm wondering if he's going to dump me! So I try to ask him about it but he just switches on the TV. Reluctantly, I say I'm going to go to sleep. Then, after about 10 minutes, he joins me and we have sex. But, he still seemed really distracted, so afterwards I just wanted to leave. I dunno, I just don't know, what he thinks anymore. I mean, do you think he's met someone else??? </p>

"
28423,"<p>The 5 toughest questions for men are: </p>
<p>1. What are you thinking about? </p>
<p>2. Do you love me? </p>
<p>3. Do I look fat? </p>
<p>4. Do you think she is prettier than me? </p>
<p>5. What would you do if I died? </p>
<p>What makes these questions so difficult is that each one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly ( i.e. tells the truth). Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzed below, along with possible responses. </p>
<p>Question #1: What are you thinking about? </p>
<p>The proper answer to this, of course, is: ""I'm sorry if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you."" </p>
<p>(Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, ""If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!"") </p>
<p>Question #2: Do you love me? </p>
<p>The proper response is: ""YES!"" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in order, ""Yes, dear."" </p>
<p>Inappropriate responses include: </p>
<p>a. Oh yeah, loads. </p>
<p>b. Would it make you feel better if I said yes? </p>
<p>c. That depends on what you mean by love. </p>
<p>d. Does it matter? </p>
<p>e. Who, me? </p>
<p>Question #3: Do I look fat? </p>
<p>The correct answer is an emphatic: ""Of course not!"" </p>
<p>Among the incorrect answers are: </p>
<p>a. Compared to what? </p>
<p>b. I wouldn't call you fat, but you're not exactly thin. </p>
<p>c. A little extra weight looks good on you. </p>
<p>d. I've seen fatter. </p>
<p>e. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died. </p>
<p>Question #4: Do you think she's prettier than me? </p>
<p>Once again, the proper response is always: ""Of course not!"" </p>
<p>Incorrect responses include: </p>
<p>a. Yes, but you have a better personality. </p>
<p>b. Not prettier, but definitely thinner. </p>
<p>c. Not as pretty as you when you were her age. </p>
<p>d. Define pretty.. </p>
<p>e. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died. </p>
<p>Question #5: What would you do if I died? </p>
<p>A definite no-win question. </p>

<p>Ten minutes after they arrived home, Roger grabbed the car keys and started heading out the door. </p>
<p>'Where are you going?' Jane asked.</p>
<p>'I have a little errand to run. I should be back soon.'</p>
<p>After an agonizing three hour absence, Roger returned, sporting a very wide and wicked grin. </p>
<p>'Honey, I managed to get tomorrow's question and answer.'</p>
<p>'What is it?' she cried excitedly.</p>
<p>'OK, the question is, ""What are the three main parts of the male anatomy?"" </p>
<p>And the answer is, ""The head, the heart and the penis.""'</p>
<p>The couple went to sleep with Jane now feeling at ease, plummeting into a deep slumber. At 3.30 am, however, Jane was shaken awake by Roger, who was asking her the quiz show question. </p>
<p>'The head, the heart, the penis,' Jane replied groggily before returning to sleep.</p>
<p>Roger asked her again in the morning as Jane was brushing her teeth. Once again she replied correctly.</p>
<p>So it was that Jane was once again on the set of the quiz show. Even though she knew the question and answer, she could feel butterflies. </p>
<p>The cameras began running and the host, after reminding the audience of the previous day's events, faced Jane and asked the big question.</p>
<p>'Jane, for $65,000, what are the main parts of the male anatomy? You have ten seconds.'</p>
<p>'Hmmm, uhm, the head? She said nervously.</p>
<p>'Very good. Six seconds.'</p>
<p>'Eh, uh, the heart?</p>
<p>'Very good. Four seconds.'</p>
<p>'I, uhh, ooooooooohh, darn! My husband drilled it into me last<br /> night and I had it on the tip of my tongue this morning... '</p>
<p>'That's close enough,' said the game show host, 'Congratulations!'</p>

When the dust settled the only ones in the auditorium are Satan and one older gentleman, who did not seem at all concerned that Satan was standing directly in front of him. Now this confused Satan a bit, so he walked up to the man and said, ""Do you know who I am?"" To which the older gentleman replied, ""Yup. Sure do."" Satan: ""Aren't you afraid of me?"" Older gentleman: ""Nope, sure ain't."" Satan was quite perturbed at this so he got right in the man's face and asked, ""And would you mind telling me why not?""

28512,"<p>The Bathroom Door is Closed. Please do not stand here and talk, whine, or ask<br /> questions. Wait until I get out. </p>
<p>Yes, it is locked. I want it that way. It is not broken. I am not trapped. I<br /> know I have left it unlocked, and even open at times, since you were born,<br /> because I was afraid some horrible tragedy might occur while I was in here, but<br /> it's been 10 years and I want some PRIVACY. </p>
<p>Do not ask me how long I will be. I will come out when I am done. </p>

<p>Do not go running back to the phone yelling, ""She's in the BATHROOM! </p>
<p>Do not begin to fight as soon as I go in. </p>
<p>Do not stick your little fingers under the door and wiggle them. This was<br /> funny when you were two, but not now. </p>
<p>Do not slide pennies, Lego's, or notes under the door. Even when you were two<br /> this got a little tiresome. </p>
<p>If you have followed me down the hall talking, and are still talking as you<br /> face this closed door, please turn around, walk away, and wait for me in another<br /> room. I will be glad to listen to you when I am done. </p>
<p>And yes, I still love you. </p>

Finally, he got around to writing the ticket,<br /> and as he was doing so he kept swatting at some flies that were buzzing around<br /> his head. The farmer said, ""Having some problems with circle flies there, are<br /> ya, Sir?"" Bush stopped writing the ticket and said, ""Well yeah, if that's what<br /> they are -- I never heard of circle flies."" So the farmer says, ""Well, circle<br /> flies are common on farms. See, they're called circle flies because they're<br /> almost always found circling around the back end of horses."" Bush says, ""Oh,""<br /> and goes back to writing the ticket. After a minute he stops and slowly says,<br /> ""Hey... wait a minute, are you trying to call me a horse's ass?"" The farmer<br /> says, ""Oh no, Governor, I have too much respect for you to even think about<br /> calling you a horse's ass."" Grinning broadly, Bush says, ""Well, that's a good<br /> thing,"" and goes back to writing the ticket. After a long pause, the farmer<br /> says, ""Hard to fool them flies though.""</p>

Due to the clouds and haze, the pilot could not determine the helicopter's position and course to steer to the airport. </p>

<p>A few days went by, and he comes home from work and again his wife asks for a<br /> favor, ""Honey, the car won't start, I think that it needs a new battery. Could<br /> you change it for me?"" </p>
<p>""What do I look like, Mr.Goodwrench?"" was his response. Another couple of<br /> weeks go by, and it's raining pretty hard. His wife then finds a leak in the<br /> roof. She pleads with him as he's walking through the door. ""Honey, there's a<br /> leak on the roof! Can you please fix it?"" </p>
<p>He just looked at her and said ""What do I look like, Bob Vila?"" and sat down<br /> with a beer and watched a game on TV. </p>
<p>One weekend the husband woke up and it was pouring pretty hard, but the leak<br /> on the roof was gone! Speaking of leaks, he also went to take a shower, and he<br /> found that the one pipe behind the sink wasn't leaking anymore either. </p>
<p>His wife was coming home just then, and as she walked through the door, the<br /> husband asked, ""Honey, how come there aren't any more leaks, and the car's<br /> running?"" </p>
<p>She replied nonchalantly, ""Oh, the other day I was picking up the mail, and I<br /> ran into one of our new neighbors, Jon. What a nice man. He came over and fixed<br /> everything."" ""Wow, did he charge us anything?"" asked the husband. ""No, he just<br /> said that he'd do it for free if I either baked him a cake or had sex with him""<br /> she said. </p>
<p>""Cool. What kind of cake did you make?"" asked the husband. ""Cake? What the<br /> hell do you think I look like, Betty Crocker?</p>

28584,"<p>Effective immediately, the following economizing measures are being implemented in the ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" subsidiary: </p>
<p>1) The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree, which never produced the cash crop forecasted, will be replaced by a plastic hanging plant, providing considerable savings in maintenance; </p>
<p>2) Two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not cost effective. In addition, their romance during working hours could not be condoned. The positions are, therefore, eliminated; </p>
<p>3) The three French hens will remain intact. After all, everyone loves the French; </p>
<p>4) The four calling birds will be replaced by an automated voice mail system, with a call waiting option. An analysis is underway to determine who the birds have been calling, how often and how long they talked; </p>
<p>5) The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of Directors. Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could have negative implications for institutional investors. Diversification into other precious metals, as well as a mix of T-Bills and high technology stocks, appear to be in order; </p>
<p>6) The six geese-a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer be afforded. It has long been felt that the production rate of one egg per goose per day was an example of the general decline in productivity. Three geese will be let go, and an upgrading in the selection procedure by personnel will assure management that, from now on, every goose it gets will be a good one; </p>
<p>7) The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in better times. The function is primarily decorative. Mechanical swans are on order. The current swans will be retrained to learn some new strokes, thereby enhancing their outplacement; </p>
<p>8) As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under heavy scrutiny by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the workforce is being sought. The more militant maids consider this a dead-end job with no upward mobility. Automation of the process may permit the maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring or a-mulching; </p>
<p>9) Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number. This function will be phased out as these individuals grow older and can no longer do the steps; </p>
<p>10) Ten Lords-a-leaping is overkill. The high cost of Lords, plus the expense of international air travel, prompted the Compensation Committee to suggest replacing this group with ten out-of-work congressmen. While leaping ability may be somewhat sacrificed, the savings are significant as we expect an oversupply of unemployed congressmen this year; </p>
<p>11) Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple case of the band getting too big. A substitution with a string quartet, a cutback on new music, and no uniforms, will produce savings which will drop right to the bottom line; </p>
<p>Overall we can expect a substantial reduction in assorted people, fowl, animals and related expenses. Though incomplete, studies indicate that stretching deliveries over twelve days is inefficient. If we can drop ship in one day, service levels will be improved. Regarding the lawsuit filed by the attorney's association seeking expansion to include the legal profession (""thirteen lawyers-a-suing""), a decision is pending. Deeper cuts may be necessary in the future to remain competitive. </p>
<p>Should that happen, the Board will request management to scrutinize the Snow White Division to see if seven dwarfs is the right number.</p>

28596,"<p>Do not expect your doctor to share your discomfort. Involvement with the<br /> patient's suffering might cause him to lose valuable scientific objectivity. </p>
<p>Be cheerful at all times. Your doctor leads a busy and trying life and<br /> requires all the gentleness and reassurance he can get.</p>
<p>Try to suffer from the disease for which you are being treated. Remember that<br /> your doctor has a professional reputation to uphold. </p>
<p>Do not complain if the treatment fails to bring relief. You must believe that<br /> your doctor has achieved a deep insight into the true nature of your illness,<br /> which transcends any mere permanent disability you may have experienced.</p>
<p>Never ask your doctor to explain what he is doing or why he is doing it. It is<br /> presumptuous to assume that such profound matters could be explained in terms<br /> that you would understand. </p>
<p>Pay your medical bills promptly and willingly. You should consider it a<br /> privilege to contribute, however modestly, to the well-being of physicians,<br /> health care managers and other humanitarians.</p>
<p>Do not suffer from ailments not covered by your health care plan. It is a<br /> waste of resources to contract illnesses that are beyond your means. </p>
<p>Never reveal any of the shortcomings that have come to light in the course of<br /> treatment by your doctor. The patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one<br /> and you have a sacred duty to protect him from exposure. </p>
<p>Never die while in your doctor's presence or under his direct care. This will<br /> only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.</p>

28613,"<p>Election update from http://www.aaronsjokes.com/</p>
<p>NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE</p>
<p>To the citizens of the United States of America,</p>
<p>In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your<br /> independence, effective today.</p>
<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over all states, commonwealths and other  territories.  Except Utah, which she does not fancy. </p>
<p>Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85%<br /> of you who have until now been unaware that there is a  world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for further elections.</p>
<p>Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be<br /> circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.</p>
<p>To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:</p>
<p>1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br /> Then look up ""aluminum"". Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look ""vocabulary"".  Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed"".</p>
<p>2. There is no such thing as ""US English"". We will let Microsoft know on your behalf.</p>
<p>3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.<br /> It really isn't that hard.</p>
<p>4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.</p>
<p>5. You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.</p>
<p>6. You should stop playing American ""football"". There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed<br /> to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.</p>
<p>7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys. ""Merde"" is French for ""sh!t"".</p>
<p>8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new<br /> national holiday, but only in England. It will be called ""Indecisive Day"".</p>
<p>9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.</p>
<p>10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

28616,"<p>Scene: It's a fine beautiful day in the forest and a rabbit is sitting outside his burrow, typing away on his laptop.<br /> Along comes a fox, out for a walk. </p>
<p>Fox: ""What are you working on?"" Rabbit: ""My Thesis paper to graduate from University."" Fox: ""Hmmmmm. What is it about?"" Rabbit: ""Oh, I'm writing about how rabbits eat foxes."" </p>
<p>(There is an incredulous pause) </p>
<p>Fox: ""That's ridiculous! Any fool knows that rabbits don't eat foxes!"" Rabbit: ""Come with me and I'll show you!"" </p>
<p>They both disappear into the rabbit's burrow. After a few minutes, gnawing on a fox bone, the rabbit returns to his lap top and resumes typing. Soon a wolf comes along and stops to watch the hard working rabbit. (Tippy-tap, tippy-tap, tippy-tippy-tap). </p>
<p>Wolf: ""What's that you are writing?"" Rabbit: ""I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eats wolves."" (loud guffaws). Wolf: ""You don't expect to get such garbage published, do you?"" Rabbit: ""No problem. Do you want to see why?"" </p>
<p>The rabbit and the wolf go into the burrow, and again the rabbit returns by himself. This time he is patting his stomach. He goes back to his typing. (Tippy-tap, tippy-tap, tippy-tippy-tap). </p>
<p>Finally a bear comes along and asks, Bear: ""What are you doing?"" Rabbit: ""I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eats bears."" Bear: ""Well that's absurd!"" Rabbit: ""Come into my home and I'll show you."" </p>
<p>SCENE: Inside the rabbit's burrow. In one corner, there is a pile of fox bones. In another corner is a pile of wolf bones. On the other side of the room a huge lion is belching and picking his teeth. </p>
<p>THE MORAL OF THE STORY: ----------------------- It doesn't matter what you choose for a thesis topic. It doesn't matter what you use for your data. It doesn't even matter if your topic makes sense. What matters is who you have for a thesis advisor.</p>

<p>The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to<br /> the pharmacy to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about half an<br /> hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. At the<br /> register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy a<br /> 3-pack, 10-pack or family pack.

Must be something like the professional immunity physicians enjoy.People often wonder about the difference between ""hard core"" and ""soft core"" pornography.

28721,"<p>A little old lady goes into the Chase Manhattan Bank, and says she wants to open a savings account. The accounts person asks her how much she would like to deposit to open the account and the little old lady says, ""Three million dollars."" The accounts person is startled, and says, ""In what form?"" and the little old lady says, ""Cash. I've got it here in this bag..."" The accounts person looks and, sure enough, the lady has a big grocery bag just chock full of green stuff in big denominations. This is a highly unusual event, and the accounts person excuses herself to get the president of the bank to handle this one. He arrives, and escorts the little old lady to his office to handle it personally. Once in his office, he asks the little old lady where she got so much money. She says, ""Gambling."" ""Gambling?,"" he says.""What sort of gambling?"" ""Oh, I make bets with people on all sorts of things, and I usually win. For example, I've got $100,000 right here that says that by noon tomorrow your balls will be square, and I'll even give you 4:1 odds. You got $25,000 you'd be willing to wager on that?"" The bank president is shocked at this sort of thing coming from a sweet little old lady, but he didn't get to be the president of the Chase Manhattan Bank without knowing something about money.""I suppose I could come up with enough to cover that sort of wager, but I wouldn't feel right taking it from you...there's no way you can win a bet like that!"" The little old lady just shook the bag, and said, ""I know what I'm doing...and I can afford to lose, though I'm not going to. Is it a bet?"" ""Ok, have it your way,"" said the president, and they shook hands on it.""See you at 11:55 tomorrow morning,"" said the little old lady, and with that she left. Next morning at 11:55 the little old lady arrives with a younger man in a three-piece suit, and is escorted to the bank president's office. The president is a nervous wreck, though a happy one. He'd gotten almost no sleep the night before, waking every few minutes to feel his balls to check for impending squareness, but nothing happened all night. He had checked hundreds of times that morning, but still nothing; perfectly normal. When the little old lady arrived he started to relax, knowing he had won.""Come in, please have a seat! Who might this gentleman be?"" said the president.""He's my lawyer. For a bet of this size I want to have a witness. Any objections?"" ""No, perfectly understandable,"" said the president.""Well, it's now noon, and I'm still unchanged, so I guess I win!"" he said happily.""Not so fast!"" said the little old lady.""For a hundred grand I want to verify things personally! Please drop your pants."" The bank president is a bit flustered, but agrees that in her position he'd want proof as well, so he drops his pants. The little old lady goes over to him and reaches out to feel the organs in question.""Ok, you win, here's your $100,000,"" says the little old lady, handing over a bag of bills. As she does so, her lawyer starts banging his head against the wall and moaning.""What's wrong with him?"" asks the bank president.""Oh, he's just upset. Poor loser if you ask me. You see, I had a bet for $1,000,000 with him that I would have the President of the Chase Manhattan Bank by the balls by noon today.""</p>

28722,"<p>A Cardiologist came up with a new operating procedure that would cut down the time that heart surgery would take and would cause less trauma to the patient. He was praised by his peers when he presented it at a convention in Washington D.C. He was also paid $50,000 to present his findings.</p>
<p>The cardiologist did a few more of these presentations and realized that it would be more lucrative to do lectures on his findings rather than continue to work as a surgeon. So he decided to do the lectures full-time. He hired a driver and purchased a limousine.</p>
<p>One day, after he'd been doing the lecture circuit for about 6 months, his driver turns to him and says, ""You know... This is completely unfair.""</p>
<p>""What do you mean?"" asks the surgeon.</p>
<p>""Well, you get paid $50,000 every time you do this lecture and that's more than I get paid in a year,"" replies the driver.</p>
<p>The surgeon explains to him that it is a very complicated procedure and that he is the only person that can give this lecture.</p>
<p>""That's not true. I can do your lecture blindfolded. I have seen you do your lecture so many times that I know it by heart,"" says the driver.</p>
<p>""Well if that's the case, I'll tell you what. You do this lecture and you can keep the $50,000 if you do it right."" replies the surgeon.</p>
<p>The driver replies, ""Ok. You're on.""</p>
<p>So when they arrive at the lecture hall, the surgeon and the driver change coats and the surgeon puts on the driver's hat and sits in the back of the room.</p>
<p>The driver nails the presentation. Not only that, he also answers all the questions without any problems. Just when the driver thinks he's done, an audience member, wearing a lab coat and tape covered glasses stands up and asks a complex question that the driver is not able to answer.</p>
<p>""You know..."" says the driver, ""I have done this lecture 287 times and I have never been asked such a stupid question. As a matter of fact, that question is SO stupid that I am going to let my driver answer it.""</p>

And, one dog belonged to a lawyer. For the finals each dog was given a bag of bones to see what it could make. The doctor said, ""Stethascope, go!"" The dog built a human skeleton. The judges were ready to award the trophy right then. But, they decided to give the other dogs a try. The engineer said, ""Slide-rule, go!"" (So, its an old joke.) The dog built a suspension bridge.

28789,"<p>El otro d�a mi abuela me escribi� una carta que dec�a textualmente as�:</p>
<p>Querido nieto:</p>
<p>El otro d�a tuve una experiencia religiosa muy buena, que quer�a compartir contigo. Fui a la librer�a cristiana y all� encontr� una calcoman�a para el auto que dec�a:</p>
<p>""Toc� bocina si amas a Dios"".</p>
<p>Dado que hab�a tenido un d�a muy malo, decid� comprarla y pegarla en el paragolpes de mi auto. Al salir manejando, llegu� a un cruce de dos avenidas que estaba muy complicado, con muchos autos. La temperatura exterior era de 37 grados y era la hora de salida de las oficinas. All� me qued� parada, porque la luz estaba roja, pensando en el Se�or y como El es bueno, no me d� cuenta que la luz se hab�a puesto verde, pero descubr� que muchos otros aman al Se�or porque inmediatamente comenzaron a sonar las bocinas. La persona que estaba detr�s de mi auto (sin duda muy religiosa) tocaba la bocina sin parar y me gritaba:</p>
<p>- Dale por el amor de Dios.</p>
<p>Dirigidos por �l, todos hac�an sonar la bocina. Yo les sonre� y los saludaba con la mano a trav�s de la ventanilla. Vi que otro muchacho me saludaba de una manera particular levantando s�lo el dedo medio de la mano. Le pregunt� a otro de mis nietos, que estaba conmigo, que quer�a decir ese saludo, contest�ndome que era un saludo Hawaiano de buena onda. Entonces yo saqu� mi mano por la ventana y salud� a todos de la misma manera.</p>
<p>Mi nieto se doblaba de la risa, supongo que por la bella ""experiencia religiosa"" que estaba viviendo. Dos hombres de un auto cercano, se bajaron y comenzaron a caminar hacia mi auto, creo que para rezar conmigo o para preguntarme a que templo voy.</p>
<p>Pero en ese momento fue que vi que la luz estaba verde. Entonces salud� a todos mis hermanos y hermanas y pas� la luz. Luego de cruzar, not� que el �nico auto que hab�a podido pasar era el m�o, ya que la luz volvi� a ponerse en rojo y me sent� triste de dejarlos all� despu�s de todo el amor que hab�amos compartido.</p>
<p>Por lo tanto par� el auto, me baj�, salud� a todos con el saludo hawaiano por �ltima vez y me fui. Ruego a Dios por todos esos buenos hombres y mujeres.</p>

<p>'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the trailer<br /> Not a creature was stirrin' 'Cept a redneck named Taylor.<br /> His first name was Bubba, Joe was his middle,<br /> And a-runnin' down his chin Was a trickle of spittle.<br /> His socks, they were hung by the chimney with care,<br /> And therefore there was a foul stench in the air. </p>
<p>That Bubba got scared And rousted the boys.<br /> There was Rufus, 12 Jim Bob was 11<br /> Dud goin' on 10 Otis was 7.<br /> John, George and Chucky Were 5,4, and 3:<br /> The twins were both girls So they let them be. </p>
<p>They jumped in their overalls, No need for a shirt,<br /> Threw a hat on each head, Then turned with a jerk.<br /> They ran to the gun rack That hung on the wall.<br /> There were 17 shotguns They grabbed them all. </p>
<p>Bubba said to the young'uns, ''Now hesh up ya'll!<br /> The last thing we wanna do Is wake up yer Maw.''<br /> Maw was expecting And needed her sleep,<br /> So out they crept out the door Without making a peep. </p>
<p>They all looked around, and then they all spit.<br /> The young'uns asked Bubba, ''Paw, what is it?''<br /> Bubba just stared He could not say a word.<br /> This was just like all of The stories he'd heard. </p>
<p>It was Santy Claus on the roof, Darn tootin'<br /> But the boys didn't know They was about to start shootin'!<br /> They aimed their shotguns and nearly made a mistake<br /> That would have resulted in venison steak.<br /> Bubba hollered out, ''Don't shoot, boys!''<br /> That's Santy Claus And he's brought us some toys. </p>
<p>The dogs were a-barkin' And a-raisin' cain,<br /> And Bubba whistled, and shouted, And called them by name.<br /> ''Down, Spot! Shut up Bullet! Quiet, Pete and Roscoe!<br /> Git, Turnip and Tater and Sam and Bosco!'' </p>
<p>''Git down from that porch! Git down off that wall!<br /> Quit shakin the trailer, Or you'll make Santy fall!''<br /> The dogs kept a-barkin' And wouldn't shut up,<br /> And they trampled poor Pete Who was only a pup. </p>
<p>Santy opened his bag, And threw out some toys.<br /> Bubba got most, But left a few for the boys.<br /> Since the guns had been dropped He just might not die. </p>
<p>He jumped in his sleigh, Told his reindeer to hurry.<br /> The trailer started to wobble Santa started to worry.<br /> Just as the reindeer Got into the air,<br /> The trailer collapsed, But Bubba didn't care. </p>
<p>He was busy lookin' At all his new toys.<br /> Then a thought hit him, And he said to the boys:<br /> ''Go check on yer Maw, Make sure she's all right.<br /> That roof fallin' on her Could-a hurt just a might.'' </p>
<p>But Maw was OK, And the girls were too.<br /> They fixed up the trailer It looked good as new.<br /> And as for Bubba, He liked Old St. Nick,<br /> But Santa thought Bubba Was a pure-in-tee hick! </p>

28820,"<p>Introductory Chemistry at Duke University has been taught for about a zillion years by Professor Bonk (really), and his course is semi-affectionately known as ""Bonkistry."" He has been around forever, so I wouldn't put it past him to come up with something like this. </p>
<p>Anyway, one year there were these two guys who were taking Chemistry and who did pretty well on all of the quizzes and the midterms and labs, etc., such that going into the final they had a solid A. </p>
<p>These two friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chem final was on Monday), they decided to go up to UVirginia and party with some friends up there. </p>
<p>So they did this and had a great time. However, with their hangovers and everything, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, what they did was to find Professor Bonk after the final and explain to him why they missed the final. They told him that they went up to UVa for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and couldn't get help for a long time and so were late getting back to campus. </p>
<p>Bonk thought this over and then agreed that they could make up the final on the following day. The two guys were elated and relieved. So, they studied that night and went in the next day at the time that Bonk had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. They looked at the first problem, which was something simple about molarity and solutions and was worth 5 points. ""Cool"" they thought, ""this is going to be easy."" They did that problem and then turned the page. They were unprepared, however, for what they saw on the next page. It said: </p>

28821,"<p>They were two guys who just loved Italian sausage touring Italy. Right before they left Italy they went on a tour of an Italian meat factory and talked to one Italian worker. They said ""can we see your Italian sausage?"""". The worker said with a smirk """"sure!"""" and whipped out his ding-a-ling. The tourists were disgusted and ran away. They came upon another worker and asked him the same question. He said """"well if you really want to..."""" and whipped out his thing. The tourists were disgusted and ran away. Finally when they were getting ready to leave they saw one more worker. So they decide to ask this  guy the same question. The guys response was... """"hold on i keep it in the freezer""""</p>

<p>Everything checked out fine. The old lady pulled the doctor to the side and said, ""Doctor, I haven't had sex for years now, and I was wondering how I can increase my husband's sex drive."" </p>
<p>The doctor smiled and said, ""Have you tried to give him Viagra?"" </p>

<p>When I arrived I saw everyone sitting around mending his or her<br /> various wounds, scratches and contusions. No sight of the cat. It appears that<br /> while they were running the machine the cat was twirling his tail in his usual<br /> fashion and stuck it down into the printer at the most inopportune time and got<br /> sucked in! Apparently, the cat absolutely freaked out and clawed at everyone who<br /> came close. They finally freed the cat, and to this day, the cat goes nowhere<br /> near the machine.</p>

28850,"<p>Lesson Number One </p>
<p>A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A small rabbit </p>
<p>saw the crow, and asked him, ""Can I also sit like you and do </p>
<p>nothing all day long?"" </p>
<p>The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" So, the rabbit sat on the ground </p>
<p>below the crow, and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped </p>
<p>on the rabbit and ate it. </p>
<p>Moral of the story: </p>
<p>To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high </p>
<p>up. </p>
<p>Lesson Number Two </p>
<p>A turkey was chatting with a bull. ""I would love to be able to get </p>
<p>to the top of that tree,"" sighed the turkey, ""but I haven't got the </p>
<p>energy."" ""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" </p>
<p>replied the bull. ""They're packed with nutrients."" The turkey </p>
<p>pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough </p>
<p>strength to reach the first branch of the tree. The next day, after </p>
<p>eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a </p>
<p>fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon </p>
<p>he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the </p>
<p>tree. </p>
<p>Moral of the story: </p>
<p>Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. </p>
<p>Lesson Number Three </p>
<p>When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. The </p>
<p>brain said, "" I should be Boss because I control the whole body's </p>
<p>responses and functions."" The feet said, "" We should be Boss as we </p>
<p>carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go."" The hands </p>
<p>said, ""We should be the Boss because we do all the work and earn all </p>
<p>the money."" And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and </p>
<p>the eyes until finally the asshole spoke up. </p>
<p>All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. So </p>
<p>the asshole went on strike, blocked itself up and refused to work. </p>
<p>Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, the </p>
<p>feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain </p>
<p>fevered. Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the </p>
<p>Boss, so the motion was passed. All the other parts did all the </p>
<p>work while the Boss just sat and passed out the shit! </p>
<p>Moral of the story: </p>
<p>You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. </p>
<p>Lesson Number 4 </p>
<p>There was a fly buzzing around a barn one day when he happened on a </p>
<p>pile of fresh cow manure. Since it had been hours since his last </p>
<p>meal, he flew down and began to eat. He ate and ate and ate. Finally, </p>
<p>he decided he had eaten enough and tried to fly away. He had eaten </p>
<p>too much though, and could not get off the ground. As he looked </p>
<p>around wondering what to do now, he spotted a pitchfork leaning up </p>
<p>against the wall. He climbed to the top of the handle and jumped off, </p>
<p>thinking that once he got airborne, he would be able to take flight. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was wrong and dropped like a rock, splatting when </p>
<p>he hit the floor. Dead. </p>
<p>The moral to the story is: Never fly off the handle when you know </p>
<p>you're full of shit.</p>

28891,"<p>Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play -- normally one club and two balls.Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out of the hole.For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.Course owners reserve the right to restrict the length of the club to avoid damage to the hole.The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is satisfied that the play is complete.Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course.The experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course, with special attention to well formed bunkers.Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played on or are currently playing to the owner of the course being played.Upset course owners have been known to damage a player's equipment for this reason.Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear along, just in case.Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played on for the first time.Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else playing what they consider to be a private course.Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times.Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair.Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation.More advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the case. Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before attempting to play the back nine.Slow play is encouraged; however, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owner's request.It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.The course owner will be the sole judge of who is the best player.**WARNING** Players are advised to think twice before considering membership at a given course. Additional assessments may be levied by the course owner and the rules are subject to change. For this reason, many players prefer to continue to play several different courses.</p>

28926,"<p>This paper was turned in by an Oakland High school student who received the highest honors at the school district's ebonics translation competition. </p>
<p>Assignment: </p>
<p>Please translate the following song lyrics from ebonics to standard English. </p>
<p>Artist: Notorious B.I.G.<br /> Album: Ready to Die<br /> Song: One more chance (remix) </p>
<p>First things first, I poppa, freaks all the honeys Dummies - playboy bunnies, those wantin' money Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get nathan' But penetration, unless it smells like sanitation Garbage, I turn like doorknobs Heart throb, never, black and ugly as ever However, I stay coochied down to the socks Rings and watch filled with rocks </p>
<p>As a general rule, I perform deviant sexual acts with women of all kinds, including but not limited to those with limited intellect, nude magazine models, and whores. I particularly enjoy sexual encounters with the latter group as they are generally disappointed in the fact that they only receive penile intercourse and nothing more, unless of course, they douche on a consistent basis. Although I am extremely unattractive, I am able to engage in these types of sexual acts with some regularity. Perhaps my sexuality is somehow related to my fancy and expensive jewelery. </p>
<p>And my jam knock in the Mitsubishi Girls pee pee when they see me Nava-hoes creep me in they tee pee As I lay down laws like I lay carpet Stop it - if you think your gonna make a profit </p>
<p>I enjoy playing my music loudly on my car stereo. Apparently, women enjoy this also because they become sexually aroused when they see me driving. Oddly enough, when I visit the Native American reservations, some of the more sexually promiscuous Indian women attempt to seduce me in their homes. Their intent is to divest me of my earnings. Such actions are unacceptable. </p>
<p>Don't see my ones, don't see my guns - get it Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it In two as I flow with the Junior Mafia I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya I'm clockin' ya - Versace shades watchin' ya Once ya grin, I'm in game, begin </p>
<p>Understand this fact: you can have neither my money, nor my weapons. I suggest that you inform your peers that we engaged in violent sexual acts. Currently, I am rapping with my associates, the Junior Mafia. I'm having some difficulty understanding why you refuse to approach me. I am attempting to make eye contact with you through my expensives glasses, and as soon as you respond with a smile, I will approach you. </p>
<p>First I talk about how I dress and this And diamond necklesses - stretch Lexuses The sex is just immaculate from the back I get Deeper and deeper - help ya reach the Climax that your man can't make Call and tell him you'll be home real late Let's sing the break </p>
<p>I prefer to open the conversation with light banter about my wardrobe and jewelery, then I like to discuss my collection of expensive cars. This is more than enough to convince you to have sexual intercourse with me. I am able to insert my penis further into you when I enter you from behind. Furthermore, you will be able to reach orgasm. I understand this to be a problem with your current sexual partner. He needn't be concerned about your whereabouts. Please phone him and inform him that you won't be home for a while. By the way, please sing the chorus of the song for me also. </p>
<p>She's sick of that song on how it's so long Thought he worked his until I handled my biz There I is - major pain like Damon Wayans Low down dirty even like his brother Keenan Schemin' - don't bring your girl 'round me True player for real, ask Puff Daddy </p>
<p>Your current love interest no longer wishes to hear your fabrications about the length of your member. After I had sexual intercourse with your woman, she became enlightened as to the proper way it is supposed to be performed; violently and immorally. It would be in your best interest to keep your woman away from me as my sexual prowess is very strong. If you are unconvinced, ask Puff Daddy. </p>
<p>You - ringin' bells with bags from Chanel Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell She beeped me, meet me at twelve </p>
<p>Despite the fact that you attempted to win her at her doorstep with bags full of expensive clothes and a car (the lower end model Mercedes Benz which you financed by signing over your current vehicle) containing an expensive stereo and a cellular phone, your woman has contacted me through my pager indicating that we should rendezvous at midnight. </p>
<p>Where you at? Flippin' jobs, playin' car notes? While I'm swimmin' in ya women like the breast stroke Right stroke, left stroke what's the best stroke Death stroke - tongue all down her throat Nuthin' left to do but send her home to you I'm through - can ya sing the song for me, boo? </p>
<p>You, on the other hand, jump from job to job, barely able to maintain payments on the Mercedes Benz you purchased for your woman. Meanwhile, I continue to engage in sexual intercourse and commit lewd osculatory acts with your women. My only remaining option is to request that they leave my home and return to you because I have reached orgasm and no longer have a need for their presence. </p>
<p>So, what's it gonna be? Him or me? We can cruise the world with pearls Gator boots for girls The envy of all women, crushed linen Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em The finest women I love with a passion Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin' </p>
<p>The ultimate decision rests with you. Whom do you choose as your sexual partner. I can take you on cruises around the world. I will dress you in the finest jewelery and footwear. You will be envied by women worldwide in your fine clothes and jewelery. There is a special place in my heart for beautiful women. I will defeat your man in an altercation because he is effeminate. </p>
<p>High fashion - flyin' into all states Sexin' me while your man masturbates Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds Lyrically I'm supposed to represent I'm not only the client, I'm the player president </p>
<p>You will be dressed in finest clothes on the runways of Paris. I will fly you to every state to shop for fine clothes and jewelery. You will enjoy sexual intercourse with me and your man will be forced to pleasure himself through manual stimulation. What a life! I'll return you to LaGuardia in time to catch your 8 o'clock flight. The timing is perfect becuase I have scheduled a date with a second woman who arrives at the same gate at 9 o'clock. I'll seduce her in the same way that I seduced you. I rap well and I am a positive reflection of my hometown. Not only am I a sexually deviant, misogynistic, immoral, wealthy, male prostitute, but I also sit on the board of directors of the organization that governs others of my kind.</p>

28939,"<p>The FBI was looking to hire new agents.  3 people came to the try outs...2 guys and 1 girl. The FBI guy says to the three participants: ""When you go into that room over there, you will see your husband or wife tied up in a chair.  To get this job, you have to take this gun, and shoot them.""So, the first guy takes the gun, and goes into the room.  He sees his wife tied up in a chair.  There is a long silence, and the guy walks out and says ""I couldn't do it."" The FBI guy unties the wife, and says, ""Sorry, you didn't get the job.""The next guy goes in and sees his wife sitting there, all tied up.  He also could not shoot his wife. So the FBI guy tells him ""Sorry, you didn't get the job.""Finally, the woman goes into the room with a gun.  For at least 5 minutes there was a lot of noise!  The woman comes out of the room and says ""You didn't tell me the gun was full of blanks! I had to beat my husband to death with the chair!!!"" The FBI guy says ""Uhhh... You're hired!""--Submitted by Katie Cook</p>

So he went to the beach, undressed completely, and buried himself in the sand except for his penis.</p>
<p>Just then two little old ladies were strolling along the beach, one walking with a cane. Upon seeing this ""thing"" sticking out of the sand, she began to move it about with her cane. She remarked to the other little old lady,</p>

Immediately the alligator ran up and sunk his teeth right into the general's family jewels and held on tight.

28956,"<p>Because I'm a guy, I must hold the television remote control in my hand while I watch TV. If the thing has been misplaced, I'll miss a whole show looking for it, though one time I was able to survive by holding a calculator. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, when I lock my keys in the car I will fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your suggestions that we call a road service until long after hypothermia has set in. Oh, and when the car isn't running very well, I will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if I know what I'm looking at. If another guy shows up, one of us will say to the other, ""I used to be able to fix these things, but now with all these computers and everything, I wouldn't know where to start."" We will then drink beer.</p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, when I catch a cold I need someone to bring me soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan. You never get as sick as I do, so for you this isn't an issue. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I can be relied upon to purchase basic groceries at the store, like milk, or bread. I cannot be expected to find exotic items like ""Cumin"" or ""Tofu."" For all I know these are the same thing. And never, underany circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which ""feminine hygiene product"" is a euphemism. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, when one of our appliances stops working I will insist on taking it apart, despite evidence that this will just cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and has to put it back together. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I don't think we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen to a complete stranger -- how the heck could HE know where we're going? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, there is no need to ask me what I'm thinking about. The answer is always either women or football, though I have to make up something else when you ask, so don't. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I do not want to visit your mother, or have your mother come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or think about her any more than I have to. Whatever you got her for mother's day is ok, I don't need to see it. Did you remember to pick up something for my mom, too? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I am capable of announcing, ""one more beer and I really have to go,"" and mean it every single time I say it, even when it gets to the point that the one bar closes and my buddies and I have to go hunt down another. I will find it increasingly hilariousto have my pals call you to tell you I'll be home soon, and no, I don't understand why you threw all my clothes into the front yard. What's the connection? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, you don't have to ask me if I liked the movie. Chances are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, yes, I have to turn up the radio when Bruce Springsteen or The Doors comes on, and then, yes, I have to tell you every single time about how Bruce had his picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek the same day, or how Jim Morrison is buried in Paris and everyone visits his grave. Please do not behave as if you do not find this fascinating. </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy, I think what you're wearing is fine. I thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too. Either pair of shoes is fine. With the belt or without it looks fine. Your hair is fine. You look fine. Can we just go now? </p>
<p>Because I'm a guy and this is, after all, the 90's, I will share equally in the housework. You do the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning, and the dishes. I'll do the rest.</p>

28972,"<p>This is supposedly a true story from a recent Defence Science Lectures Series, as related by the head of the Australian DSTO's Land Operations/Simulation division. </p>
<p>They'd been working on some really nifty virtual reality simulators, the case in point being to incorporate Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters into exercises (from the data fusion point of view). Most of the people they employ on this sort of thing are ex- (or future) computer game programmers. Anyway, as part of the reality parameters, they include things like trees and animals. For the Australian simulation they included kangaroos. In particular, they had to model kangaroo movements and reactions to helicopters (since hordes of disturbed kangaroos might well give away a helicopter's position). </p>
<p>Being good programmers, they just stole some code (which was originally used to model infantry detachment reactions under the same stimuli), and changed the mapped icons, the speed parameters, etc. The first time they demonstrated this to some visiting Americans, the hotshot pilots decided to get ""down and dirty"" with the virtual kangaroos. So, they buzzed them, and watched them scatter. The visiting Americans nod appreciatively ... then gape as the kangaroos duck around a hill, and launch about two dozen Stinger missiles at the hapless helicopter. The programmers looked rather embarrassed at forgetting to remove *that* part of the infantry coding ... and Americans leave muttering comments about not wanting to mess with the Aussie wildlife .... </p>
<p>As an addendum, simulator pilots from that point onwards avoided kangaroos like the plague, just like they were meant to do in the first place ....</p>

<p>While both male and female reindeer grow antlers in the summer each year, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, male reindeer drop their antlers at the beginning of winter, usually late November to mid December. </p>
<p>Female reindeer retain their antlers until after they give birth in the spring. Therefore, according to every historical rendition depicting Santa's reindeer, every single one of them, from Rudolph to Blitzen had to be a female. </p>
