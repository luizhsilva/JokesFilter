21003,"<p>Dear Son:Your Paw has a job. It's the first one he had in forty-eight years since we have been married. We are a little better off now, because we have so much money now we don't know what to do with it. Paw gets $17.15 every Thursday, so we thought we ought to do something about fixing up the house.We sent to Sears &amp; Roebuck for one of those bathrooms you hear people having in houses. It took a plumber to put it in shape.On one side of the bathroom is a great long thing something like a pig trough, only you get in it and wash all over. Over on the other side is a little white thing they call a sink where you wash your face and hands. But over in the corner we really got something. This thing, you put one foot in, wash it clean, then you pull the chain &amp; get fresh water for the other foot.Two lids come with the thing. We got no use for them in the bathroom so I'm using one for the bread board. The other lid has a hole in it so we use it for a frame for grandfather's picture.Sears &amp; Roebuck are real nice people to deal with. They sent us a roll of paper with the outfit. We can't write on it very well, so I'm using it to wrap Paw's lunch. Take care of yourself.Maw</p>

21016,"<p>Bill Gates dies in a car accident. He finds himself in purgatory, being sized up by God... </p>
<p>""Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95.  I'm going to do something I've never done before in your case; I'm going to let you decide where you want to go."" </p>
<p>Bill replied, "" Well, what's the difference between the two?"" </p>
<p>God said, ""I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, it if will help your decision.""</p>
<p>""Fine, but where should I go first?""</p>
<p>""I'll leave that up to you.""</p>
<p>""Okay then,"" said Bill, ""Let's try Hell first.""</p>
<p>So Bill went to Hell.  It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of BEAUTIFUL women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about.  The sun was shining, the temperature perfect.  He was very pleased. </p>
<p>""This is great!"" he told God.  ""If this is hell, I REALLY want to see heaven!""</p>
<p>""Fine,"" said God, and off they went.</p>
<p>Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing.  It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell. </p>
<p>Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision.  ""Hmmmm.  I think I'd prefer Hell,"" he told God.</p>
<p>""Fine,"" retorted God, ""as you desire.""  </p>

<p>Bill responded, with his voice filled with anguish and disappointment, ""This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the beaches, the beautiful women playing in the water????!""</p>
<p>""Oh, that?...That was a DEMO,"" replied God.</p>

21060,"<p>Kay Martin, a secretary to a New Zealand MP, got the fright of her life a few weeks ago. According to the Auckland Sunday Star, she and a friend were chatting over a drink when they heard a chicken squawking. The bird sounded in some distress, so they went outside to investigate, thinking perhaps that it had escaped from one of the neighbors. But, there were no chickens anywhere. Then Martin realized with horror that the sound was coming from her own kitchen - coming, in fact, from the oven, where she had put a chicken in to roast half an hour earlier. ''It was as if it was shrieking at me from its grave,'' she says. ''It was so bizarre I just froze.'' As they approached the oven, the squawking reached a crescendo. They took the tray out, and as the chicken began to cool, the squawking died away. Martin chopped the neck off and threw it in the sink. She noticed that the vocal chords were intact. ''Steam was coming up the neck from the stuffing,'' says Martin, and this had caused the dead bird to squawk. She has not cooked chicken since.</p>

<p>Se�or Encargado de Soporte T�cnico:</p>
<p>Hace un a�o y medio cambi� de la versi�n Novia 7.0 a Esposa 1.0 y he observado que el programa inici� un proceso inesperado de subrutina llamado Hijo, que me ocup� mucho espacio y recursos importantes y eso que el programa tambi�n ocupa much�simo disco duro. En el folleto explicativo del programa no viene menci�n alguna a este fen�meno.</p>
<p>Por otra parte, Esposa 1.0 se auto instala como residente en todos los dem�s programas y, durante el inicio de cualquier otra aplicaci�n, se lanza monitoreando todas las actividades del sistema.</p>
<p>Aplicaciones como Cerveza con Amigos 10.3, Noche de Tragos 2.5, y F�tbol Dominguero 5.0 ya no funcionan, y el sistema se cuelga cada vez que intento cargarlos.</p>
<p>De vez en cuando, se lanza un programa oculto (�virus?) denominado Suegra 1.0 que parece residente en memoria y que consigue colgar el sistema o que Esposa 1.0 se comporte de manera totalmente impredecible, por ejemplo, dejando de atender a cualquier comando que introduzco. No he logrado desinstalar este residente. Aparentemente, no puedo lograr mantener a Esposa 1.0 en minimizado al correr alguna de mis aplicaciones favoritas.</p>

<p>RESPUESTA</p>
<p>Estimado Usuario:</p>
<p>Este es un motivo de queja muy com�n entre los usuarios, pero se debe en la mayor�a de los casos a un error b�sico de concepto:</p>
<p>Mucha gente pasa de cualquier versi�n de Novia X.0 a Esposa 1.0 con la idea de que Esposa 1.0 es s�lo un programa de 'Entretenimiento y utilidades'. Sin embargo, Esposa 1.0 es un SISTEMA OPERATIVO completo y su creador lo dise�� para controlar todo el sistema. Es muy poco probable que pueda Ud. desinstalar a Esposa 1.0 y regresar a cualquier versi�n de Novia X.0. Hay archivos operativos ocultos en  su sistema que har�an que Novia X.0 emulara a Esposa 1.0, as� que no se gana nada.</p>
<p>Es imposible desinstalar, eliminar, o purgar los archivos del programa una vez instalados. No puede volver a Novia X.0 porque Esposa 1.0 no est� programado para eso. Lo mismo pasa con Suegra 1.0 que es una aplicaci�n oculta que se auto instala en el sistema mientras Esposa 1.0 funciona. Hay quienes han intentado el formateo total del sistema para luego instalar los programas Novia Plus o Esposa 2.0 pero terminan con m�s problemas que antes. Lea en el manual, el apartado Precauciones, cap�tulos: Pago de alimentos y pensiones; Mantenimiento de hijos"".</p>
<p>Por otro lado, si cambia a Novia 8.0 no intente luego pasar a Esposa 2.0 porque los problemas que provoca este nuevo sistema operativo no son id�nticos, sino peores, que los de Esposa 1.0. Aunque existe una versi�n Esposa 3.0 e incluso 4.0, son programas reservados a especialistas, de alt�simo costo y no son aconsejables para el usuario normal.</p>
<p>Si todos fallan, es preferible optar por sistemas basados en plataformas completamente diferentes como Celibato 1.0 o Maric�n 5.3; pero yo le recomiendo que mantenga a Esposa 1.0 y maneje la situaci�n lo mejor posible.</p>
<p>Personalmente, tengo tambi�n instalado a Esposa 1.0 y le sugiero que estudie toda la secci�n del manual sobre Fallos Generales de Sociedad (FGS's).</p>
<p>Esposa 1.0 es un programa muy sensible a los comandos y funciona en modo protegido contra fallos. Esto significa que Ud. deber� asumir la responsabilidad por cualquier problema que se produzca independientemente de su causa, porque el programa siempre considerar� que cualquier fallo en el sistema es debido a un mal uso por parte del usuario. Uno de los mejores recursos es la aplicaci�n del comando C:PEDIR PERDON.exe en cuanto se produzca un problema o el sistema se cuelgue.</p>
<p>No reinicie el sistema porque seguir� sin funcionar. Evite el uso excesivo de la tecla ESC o SUPR, porque luego deber� aplicar el comando PEDIR PERDON.exe/flores /All para que el programa vuelva a funcionar normalmente. El sistema funcionar� bien mientras usted cargue con todas las culpas por los FGS's.</p>
<p>Esposa 1.0 es un programa muy interesante, pero con un alto costo de mantenimiento. Considere la posibilidad de instalar alg�n software adicional para mejorar el rendimiento de Esposa 1.0. Le recomiendo Flores 5.0, Joyitas 2.3 y, en �ltimo caso, Viaje de Vacaciones 3.2; tambi�n puede usar Simiamor 8.0 o Loquet�digas 14.7. Estos son programas Shareware muy difundidos en Internet y que funcionan muy bien como residentes y los puede obtener casi en cualquier sitio web.</p>
<p>Jam�s instale Secretariaconminifalda 3.3, Amiguita 1.1 o Amigotes 4.6. Estos programas no funcionan en el ambiente Esposa 1.0 y probablemente causen da�os irreversibles al Sistema Operativo.</p>
<p>Mucha suerte.</p>

<p>'Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree.'</p>
<p>'Noah's wife was called Joan of Ark.'</p>
<p>'Noah built an ark, which the animals come on to in pears.'</p>
<p>'Lot's wife was a pillar of salt by day, but a ball of fire by night.'</p>
<p>'The Jews were a proud people and throughout history they had trouble with the<br /> unsympathetic Genitals.'</p>
<p>'Samson was a strongman who let himself is led astray by a Jezebel like<br /> Delilah.'</p>
<p>'Samson spayed the Philistines with the axe of the Apostles.'</p>
<p>'Moses led the Hebrews to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread which<br /> is bread without any ingredients.'</p>
<p>'The Egyptians were all drowned in the dessert. Afterwards, Moses went up on<br /> Mount Cyanide to get the 10 amendments.'</p>
<p>'The first commandment was when Eve told Adam to eat the apple.'</p>
<p>'The seventh commandment is thou shall not admit adultery.'</p>
<p>'Moses died before he ever reached Canada.'</p>
<p>'Then Joshua led the Hebrews in the battle of Genital.'</p>
<p>'The greatest miracle in the Bible is when Joshua told his son to stand still<br /> and he obeyed him.'</p>
<p>'David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar. He fought with the<br /> Finklesteins, a race of people who lived in Biblical times.'</p>
<p>'Solomon, one of David's sons, had 300 wives and 700 porcupines.'</p>
<p>'When Mary heard that she was the mother of Jesus, she sang the Magna Carta.'</p>

<p>�Jesus was born because Man had an immaculate contraption.'</p>
<p>'St John, the blacksmith, dumped water on his head.'</p>
<p>�Jesus said the Golden Rule, which says to do one to others before they do one<br /> to you.'</p>
<p>'He also explained, ""A man doth not live by sweat alone.""'</p>
<p>'It was a miracle when Jesus rose from the dead and managed to get the<br /> tombstone off the entrance.'</p>
<p>'The people who followed the Lord were called the 12 decibels.'</p>
<p>'The epistles were the wives of the apostles.'</p>
<p>'One of the opossums was St Matthew who was also a taxi man.'</p>
<p>'St Paul cavorted to Christianity. He preached holy acrimony, which is another<br /> name for marriage.'</p>
<p>'A Christian should have only one spouse. This is called monotony.'</p>
<p>Bless their little hearts!</p>

21083,"<p>Last year, my friend upgraded his GirlFriend 3.1 to GirlFriend Plus 1.0 (marketing name: Fiance 1.0). Recently he upgraded Fiance 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and it's a memory hogger: has taken up all his space.</p>
<p>Wife 1.0 must be running  before he can do anything and seems to conflict/interfere with other tasks running such as hockey 2.1, squash 3.01 and boys out 1.2. Although he didn't ask for them, Wife 1.0 came with auto-installed Plug-Ins such as Mother In Law and Brother In Law.</p>
<p>Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming GirlFriend 4.0...<br /> - A ""Don't remind me again"" button<br /> - Minimize button<br /> - Shutdown feature<br /> - An install shield feature so that Girlfriend 4.0 can be completely uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache and other objects)<br /> - ""Abort"" button (O.K. that one's pretty bad - but had to say it)</p>
<p>I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still installed, they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted. Then I tried to uninstall  Girlfriend 1.0 but it didn't have an uninstall program. I tried to uninstall it by hand, but it put files in my system directory. Another thing  that sucks--in all versions of Girlfriend that I've used is that it is totally ""object orientated"" and only supports hardware with gold plated contacts.</p>
<p> *****  BUG WARNING  ********</p>
<p>Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to install, claiming insufficient resources. Wife 1.0 will then spawn off the virus Lawyer 6.66  which, when activated, consumes all available resources and brings your system to it's knees. The funny thing is,  if you try to hide Mistress 1.1 in high memory, Wife 1.0 will eventually detect it and begin the process described above.</p>

Stunned by<br /> her beauty,the two guys stare at her for awhile, debating<br /> whether to approach her, when all of a sudden, she begins to<br /> cough, clutching her throat, and begin to turn blue. (obviously<br /> in serious respiratory distress)</p>
<p>One said to the other, ""That gal is having a bad time!"" The<br /> other agreed and said, ""Do you think we should go help?"" ""You<br /> bet!"" said the first, and with that he ran over and said, ""Can<br /> you speak?"" She shook her head no. He then asked, ""Can you<br /> breath?"" She again shook her head no. With that, he pulled up<br /> her skirt, pulled down her panties and licked her on the butt.<br /> She was so shocked by the act, she coughed up the obstruction<br /> and began to breathe, with embarrassed relief. At which point,<br /> the first Texan looked at his friend and exclaimed, I guess that<br /> hind lick maneuver really does work!""</p>

<p>the two statues smiled at each other, ran toward some nearby woods and dove<br /> behind a couple of bushes. the angel smiled to himself as he listened to the two<br /> statues giggling, bushes rustling and twigs snapping.</p>
<p>after fifteen minutes, the two statues emerged from the bushes, satisfied and<br /> smiling.</p>
<p>puzzled, the angel looked at his watch and asked the statues, ""you<br /> still have fifteen minutes. would you like to continue?""</p>

21147,"<p>Once there was this hunter, out in the forest, hunting bears. </p>
<p>As the hunter approached a clearing in the forest, he saw a bear. One of the biggest bears he'd ever seen. So he crouches down behind a largish rock, takes careful aim with his shotgun, and fires. After the smoke clears, he runs down tothe clearing, and the bear's body is gone! </p>
<p>He searches the clearing, but to no avail. Then there's a tap-tap-tap on his shoulder. The hunter looks around, and it's the bear! ""You just tried to kill me, didn't you?"". Says the bear.""Uh, no. No I didn't"". The hunter, taken aback by a talking bear, lies.""Yes you did. Don't lie, or I'll rip your arms off"" ""Uh, yeah, yeah I did."" ""Alright"", says, the bear, ""I'll let you go if you do one thing for me."" ""What's that?"", inquires the hunter. ""Give me a head-job."" ""What??"" ""On your knees"" So, the hunter obliges, and leaves the clearing. </p>
<p>Well, the hunter's pissed-off. ""Humiliated by a bear!"", he thinks to himself. ""I'll teach that bastard"". He runs to the local town, and buys an Uzi sub-machine gun, and runs back to the clearing. The bear is still there, basking in the sun. ""I've got you now, bear"", the hunter says to himself, andopens fire from behind the rock. </p>
<p>Again, after the smoke clears, the hunter runs down to the clearing. No bear. Tap-tap-tap on his shoulder. Gulp. ""You just tried to kill me again, didn't you?"". Says the bear. ""Uh, no. No I didn't"", lies the hunter. ""Yes you did. Don't lie, or I'll rip your legs off"" ""Ok! I did."" ""Alright"", says, the bear, ""I'll let you go if you do one thing for me."" ""What's that?"", inquires the hunter. ""Drop your pants and bend over"" ""No way!"" ""Ok. Prepare to get your legs ripped off."" ""Alright! I'll do it, you bastard"" So, the hunter obliges, and leaves the clearing, walking rather gingerly. </p>
<p>""I'll fucking get the bastard this time"", the hunter thinks to himself, and buys a rocket launcher. He runs back to the clearing, and blasts everything into oblivion. Trees are on fire, rocks are broken, the ground is scorched. Again, after the smoke clears, the hunter runs down to the clearing. No bear. </p>
<p>Tap-tap-tap on his shoulder. Gulp. ""You're not here for the hunting, are you?"", says the bear.</p>

21160,"<p>Question: Do you know how to save five drowning lawyers? Answer: No. Reply: Good!</p>
"
21161,"<p>Rule One</p>
<p>If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a<br /> package, because you're sure not picking anything up.</p>
<p>Rule Two</p>
<p>You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so<br /> long as you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep<br /> your eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will remove them.</p>
<p>Rule Three</p>
<p>I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to<br /> wear their trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their<br /> hips. Please don't take this as an insult, but you and all of your<br /> friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open minded<br /> about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the<br /> door with your underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and<br /> I will not object. However, In order to ensure that your clothes do<br /> not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with my daughter,<br /> I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in<br /> place to your waist.</p>
<p>Rule Four</p>
<p>I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing<br /> a ""barrier method"" of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it<br /> comes to sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.</p>
<p>Rule Five</p>
<p>In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports,<br /> politics, and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only<br /> information I require from you is an indication of when you expect to<br /> have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only word I need from<br /> you on this subject is ""early.""</p>
<p>Rule Six</p>
<p>I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to<br /> date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my<br /> daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out with my little girl, you<br /> will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with you. If<br /> you make her cry, I will make you cry.</p>
<p>Rule Seven</p>
<p>As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear,<br /> and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to<br /> be on time for the movie, you should not be dating. My daughter is<br /> putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the<br /> Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you do<br /> something useful, like changing the oil in my car?</p>
<p>Rule Eight</p>
<p>The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter:<br /> Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden<br /> stool. Places where there are no parents, policemen, or nuns within<br /> eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is<br /> dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient<br /> temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank<br /> tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and<br /> a goose down parka zipped up to her throat. Movies with a strong<br /> romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature<br /> chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay. Old folks homes are better.</p>
<p>Rule Nine</p>
<p>Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a pot-bellied, balding,<br /> middle-aged, dim-witted has-been. But on issues relating to my<br /> daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless god of your universe. If I<br /> ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell<br /> me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I have a<br /> shotgun, a shovel, and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle with<br /> me.</p>
<p>Rule Ten</p>
<p>Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the<br /> sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice<br /> paddy outside of Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the<br /> voices in my head frequently tell me to clean the guns as I wait for<br /> you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull into the driveway<br /> you should exit your car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the<br /> perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my<br /> daughter home safely and early, then return to your car - there is no<br /> need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face at the window is mine.</p>

''Well, I have got to go to the bathroom SO BAD.'' Replied one of the others, ''I'll go knock on the door, and check. If it's the wrong house, at least I'll get to a toilet!'' So he gets out and walks to the front door. He rings it once....No answer. He rings it again.....Still no answer. So, he thinks, ''This is a big house, big party, maybe the party is outside, in the backyard.'' So he walks around the house to the back, there was no one out there either. As he aproached the back door, he was suprized to find it unlocked, and opened. There was obviously no one home, so he figured he'd just quietly run inside real quick, and use there bathroom, no one would know. So, he goes inside but he can't find the bathroom anywhere. So, he quickly ran up the stairs and searched, and searched, till finally as he opened a door to a small room, he was amazed to find a GOLDEN TOILET. He had never seen anything like it, but remembering that he was in a stranger's house, and that they could at anytime return home, he quickly did his business and walked out. As he got in the car he excitedly told his friends of the AMAZING GOLDEN TOILET. They laughed in disbelief at his crazy tale. They pulled out of the driveway, arguing about it. They argued the whole way to the party.A couple of hours later, on the way home from the party. They drive past the house with the GOLDEN TOILET. And they guy insists on stopping so he could prove to his friends the these people really did have a GOLDEN TOILET. So, they agree to check it out. So they all walk up to the front door and ring the door bell. And a woman answers the door. ''Excuse me maam, but could you please let me show my friends here your GOLDEN TOILET, they don't believe me!''  ''So YOU'RE the guy!'' The woman replies, then yells to her husband in the house, ''HONEY!?!...HERES THE GUY THAT POOPED IN YOUR TUBA!'''</p>

21211,"<p>At this point, two things seem clear: It will be a very long time before David Phillips will have to pay for another airline ticket. And it will be even longer before the poor and homeless people in the Sacramento area will want to see another cup of chocolate pudding.Phillips, a civil engineer at UC-Davis, has become a cult hero in the obsessive subculture of people who collect frequent-flier miles by parlaying $3,150 worth of pudding into 1.2 million frequent flyer miles. Oh, yeah - he's also going to claim an $815 tax write-off.Last May, Phillips was pushing his shopping cart down the frozen-food aisle of his local supermarket when a promotion on a Healthy Choice frozen entree caught his eye: He could earn 500 miles for every 10 Universal Product Codes bar-codes) from Healthy Choice products he sent to the company by Dec.31. Even better: Any bar codes mailed by the end of the month would rack up double the mileage, or 1,000 miles for every 10 labels.""I started doing the math, and I realized that this was a great deal,"" he said. ""I wanted to take my family to Europe this summer, and this could be the way."" Frozen entrees were about $2 apiece, but a few aisles away Phillips found cans of Healthy Choice soups at 90 cents each. He filled his cart with them, and then headed to his local Grocery Outlet, a warehouse-style discount store. And there he hit the mother lode.""They had individual servings of chocolate pudding for 25 cents a piece,"" he said. ""And each serving had its own bar code on it. I did some more math and decided to escalate my plans.""Phillips cleaned the store out - bought every last cup of pudding in the warehouse. He then asked the manager for the addresses of all the other Grocery Outlet in the Central Valley and, with his mother-in-law riding shotgun in his van, spent a weekend scouring the shelves of every store from Davis to Fresno. ""There were 10 stores in all,"" he said. ""Luckily, most of them were right off the freeway.""He filled his garage to the rafters with chocolate pudding and stacked additional cases in his living room. But Phillips wasn't finished yet - he had the manager of his local Grocery Outlet order him 60 more cases.""A few days later I went out behind the store,"" he said, ""and there were two whole pallets of chocolate pudding with my name on them.""All in all, he'd purchased 12,150 individual servings of pudding. Around this time, Phillips began to reveal his scheme to fellow readers of the Webflyer Web site http://www.flyertalk.comwww.flyertalk.com, where he posted an account under the name ""Pudding Guy."" Phillips' tale was met with skepticism, if not outright disbelief, until he uploaded photos of his haul. They're still there, at: http://www.flyertalk.com/pudding.htmwww.flyertalk.com/pudding.htm  http://www.flyertalk.com/photosfr.htm But then Pudding Guy discovered he had a problem on his hands: The deadline for earning double miles was quickly approaching, and there was simply no way Phillips and his wife could tear off all those bar codes in time.""I had to come up with something to do with all that pudding, fast"" he said.Phillips trucked the pudding to two local food banks and the Salvation Army, which agreed to tear off the bar codes in exchange for the food donation.""We'd never seen anything like it,"" said Larry Hostetler, community relations director for the Sacramento Salvation Army. ""We've gotten some big donations, but always from companies and institutions, not individual people.""Phillips got his bar codes in the mail in time to beat the deadline, and then held his breath. The promotion specifically said I could get the miles for any Healthy Choice product,"" he said. ""But still, it seemed like there was a good chance they'd get me on some technicality.""But then packages - large packages - started arriving in the mail from Healthy Choice. In all, they contained 2,506 certificates, each good for 500 miles. That's 1,253,000 miles.Under the terms of the promotion, Phillips could have the mileage posted in any airline account. He split 216,000 between his United, Delta and Northwest accounts and posted the rest - 1,037,000 miles - to his American Airlines account.By surpassing the million-mile mark, Pudding Guy now has AAdvantage Gold status for life, entitling him to a special reservations number, priority boarding, upgrades and bonus miles. While we talked on the phone, Pudding Guy did a little math - as you might have noticed by now, he's very, very good at math - and figured out that scheme netted him enough miles for 31 round-trip coach tickets to Europe, or 42 tickets to Hawaii, or 21 tickets to Australia, or 50 tickets anywhere in the U.S.""Wow - 31 trips to Europe for a little over $3,000,"" I said. ""That's less than $100 a ticket.""""Oh, it's better than that,"" Phillips said. ""Since I gave the pudding to charity I can take a tax write-off of $815. So that brings the cost of a ticket to Europe down to $75."" As it turns out, Pudding Guy didn't donate all his stash to the food banks. He kept about 100 servings for himself, and he's just about finished them.""Actually,"" he said, ""I really like the stuff.""</p>

<p>The sales clerk replied in a condescending tone, ""Which Barbie? We have Barbie Goes to the Gym for $19.95, Barbie Goes to the Ball for $19.95, Barbie Goes Shopping for $19.95, Barbie Goes to the Beach for $19.95, Barbie Goes Nightclubbing for $19.95, and Divorced Barbie for $265.00.""</p>

21220,"<p>A butcher is leaning on the counter toward the close of day when a dog with a<br /> basket in its jaws comes pushing through the door.</p>
<p>""An' wot's this then?"" he asked. The dog knocks the basket sharply into the<br /> butcher's shins. </p>
<p>""You dumb dog."" As he reaches down to smack the dog, he notices a note and a<br /> ten dollar bill in the basket.</p>
<p>The scribble on the note asks for three pounds of his best mince [ground<br /> beef]. The butcher figures this is too easy. He goes to the window and reaches<br /> for the dried up stuff that's been sitting out all day.</p>
<p>The dog growls at him. The butcher turns around and, glaring at the pup, gets<br /> the best mince from the fridge. Weighing out about 2 1/2 pounds, he drops in on<br /> the scale with his thumb.</p>
<p>""Hmmmmm, a bit shy. Who'll know?""</p>
<p>Again, the dog growls menacingly. ""Alright, alright,"" as he throws on a<br /> generous half pound. He wraps it out, drops it in the basket, and drops in<br /> change from a five. The dog threatens to chew him off at the ankles. Another<br /> five goes in the basket.</p>
<p>The butcher is quite impressed and decides to follow the piddy pup home. The<br /> dog quickly enters high-rise buildings, pushes the lift button, enters the lift,<br /> and then pushes the button for the 12th floor. The dog walks down the corridor<br /> and smartly bangs the basket on the door. The door opens, and the dog's owner<br /> screams at the dog.</p>
<p>""Hey, what are you doing? That's a really smart dog you've got there,""<br /> comments the butcher.</p>

21235,"<p>The other day I saw a ""Honk if you love Jesus"" bumper sticker. I was feeling<br /> particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir<br /> performance followed by a thunderous prayer meeting, so I bought the sticker and<br /> put it on my bumper. Boy, am I glad I did! What an uplifting experience that<br /> followed! I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in<br /> thought about the Lord, and how good He is... and I didn't notice that the light<br /> had changed. It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't<br /> honked, I'd never have noticed! I found that LOTS of people love Jesus! Why,<br /> while I was sitting there, the guy behind me started honking like crazy, and<br /> then he leaned out of his window and screamed, ""For the love of GOD! GO, GO!!<br /> Jesus Christ, GO!!"" What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus! Everyone<br /> started honking! I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling<br /> at all these loving people. I even honked my horn a few times to share in the<br /> love! There must have been a man from Florida back there because I heard him<br /> yelling something about a ""sunny beach""...I saw another guy waving in a funny<br /> way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. When I asked my teenage son<br /> what that meant, he said that it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or<br /> something. Well, I've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window<br /> and gave him the good luck sign back. My son burst out laughing...why even HE<br /> was enjoying this religious experience! A couple of the people were so caught up<br /> in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking<br /> towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is<br /> when I noticed the light had changed, so I waved one more time to my loving<br /> brothers and sisters, grinning, and drove on through the intersection. I noticed<br /> I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed<br /> again and I felt kind of sad that I had to leave them all after all the love we<br /> had shared, so I slowed the car down, leaned out of the window and gave them all<br /> the Hawaiian good luck sign one more time as I drove away. Praise the Lord for<br /> such wonderful folks.</p>

If He cusses while he tells you his wish list, leave a pile of dog shit in place of the gifts or gifts he requests.'Two days before Christmas, Luke's father asked him what he wanted for Christmas. 'I want a damn teddy bear laying right beside me when I wake up. When I go downstairs I want to see a damn train going around the damn tree. And when I go outside I want to see a damn bike leaning up against the damn garage.'On Christmas morning, little Luke woke up and rolled over into a pile of dog shit. Confused, he walked downstairs and saw another pile under the tree. Scratching his head, he walked outside and saw a huge pile of dog shit by the garage.When Luke walked back inside with a curious look on his face, his dad smiled and asked, 'What did Santa bring you this year?'Luke replied, 'I think I got a dog but I can't find the son-of-a-bitch!'</p>

21260,"<p>A young family moved into a house next door to a vacant lot. One<br /> day a construction crew turned up to start building a house on<br /> the empty lot. </p>
<p>  The young family's 6 year old daughter naturally took an<br /> interest in all the activity going on next door and started<br /> talking with the workers. </p>
<p>  She hung around and eventually the construction crew - gems in<br /> the rough all of them - more or less adopted her as a kind of<br /> project<br />   mascot. </p>
<p>   They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had<br /> coffee and lunch breaks,and gave her little jobs to do here and<br /> there to make her<br />   feel important. </p>
<p>  At the end of the first week they even presented her with a<br /> pay envelope containing a dollar. </p>
<p>  The little girl took this home to her mother who said all the<br /> appropriate words of admiration and suggested that they take the<br /> dollar pay she had<br />   received to the bank the next day to start a savings account. </p>

21278,"<p>I never have quite figured out why the sexual urges of men &amp; women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Mars &amp; Venus thing. And, I never have figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart. And, I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene gets thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words ""I do"".</p>
<p>One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.""</p>
<p>I said, ""WHAT??"" So she says the words that I and every husband on the planet dreads. She explains that I must not be in tune with her emotional needs as a Woman. I'm thinking, ""What was her first clue?""</p>
<p>I finally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to bed. The very next day we went shopping at a big unnamed department store... I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them.</p>
<p>She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say OK. And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond earrings. Let me tell you ...she was so excited. She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don't think she cared. I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she doesn't even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK.</p>
<p>She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have seen her face when she said, ""I'm ready to go, let's go to the cash register.""</p>
<p>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No, honey. I don't feel like buying all this stuff now."" You should have seen her face ... it went completely blank. I then said, ""Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while.""</p>
<p>And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a Man.""</p>
<p>I figure that I should be having sex again sometime during the Spring thaw.</p>

<p>If your teen-age son kills himself or then next door neighbors,<br /> you blame the rock 'n' roll music or musician he liked.</p>
<p>If you smoke three packs a day for 40 years and die of lung cancer,<br /> your family blames the tobacco company.</p>
<p>If your daughter gets pregnant by the football captain you blame the school for poor sex education.</p>
<p>If your neighbor crashes into a tree while driving home drunk, you blame the bartender.</p>
<p>If your cousin gets AIDS because the needle he used to shoot up with heroin was dirty,<br /> you blame the government for not providing clean ones.</p>
<p>If your grandchildren are brats without manners, you blame television.<br /> If your friend is shot by a deranged madman, you blame the gun manufacturer.</p>
<p>And if a crazed person breaks into the cockpit and tries to kill the pilots at 35,000 feet, and the passengers kill him instead, the mother of the deceased blames the airline.</p>

The last straw came when he asked a woman co-worker out on a date, and she all but laughed at him. That does it, he decided. I'm going to start a whole new regimen. He began attending aerobics classes. He started working out with weights. He changed his diet. And he got an expensive hair transplant. In six months, he was a different man. Again, he asked his female co-worker out, and this time she accepted. There he was, all dressed up for the date, looking better than he ever had. He stood poised to ring the woman's doorbell, when a bolt of lightning struck him and knocked him off his feet. As he lay there dying, he turned his eyes toward the heavens and said, ""Why, God, why now? After all I've been through, how could you do this to me?"" From up above, there came a voice, ""Sorry. I didn't not recoginize you.""</p>

So, she got everyone together and assigned different duties to each scout.Gabby was responsible for the food supplies, Mike would be the cook this trip, Johnnie was responsible for their maps and making up a time schedule, Tim was to decide on their events, and to fit them into Johnnie's schedule and Sally would test all their equipment before setting out.They arrived at Big Moose Mountain and everyone was excited. They arrived right on schedule and were getting ready for their first event - hiking up the mountain. But first, they wanted to get something to eat. So Sally asked Mike if he would prepare the meal and, of course, Mike said he would.About 10 minutes later he came back and told Sally, ""I can't make the supper. I can't light a fire with the matches you brought."" Sally replied, ""I can't understand that. Those matches should be perfectly fine. I tested them all just before we left.""</p>

<p>Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like?</p>
<p>Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse, a miniskirt and high heels. I work out every day, I'm toned and perfect. My measurements are 36-24-36. What do you look like?</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm 6'3"" and about 250 pounds. I wear glasses and I have on a pair of blue sweat pants I just bought from Walmart. I'm also wearing a T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from dinner...it smells funny.</p>
<p>Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me?<br /> Wellhung: OK</p>
<p>Sweetheart: We're in my bedroom. There's soft music playing on the stereo and candles on my dresser and night table. I'm looking up into your eyes, smiling. My hand works its way down to your crotch and begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm gulping, I'm beginning to sweat.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest.</p>
<p>Wellhung: Now I'm unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm moaning softly.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk slides off my warm skin. I'm rubbing you bulge faster, pulling and rubbing.</p>
<p>Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and accidentally rips a hole in your blouse. I'm sorry.<br /> Sweetheart: That's OK, it wasn't really too expensive.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'll pay for it.<br /> Sweetheart: Don't worry about it. I'm wearing a lacy black bra. My soft breasts are rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm fumbling with the clasp on your bra. I think it's stuck. Do you have any scissors?<br /> Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly. I'm reaching back undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my breast. My nipples are erect for you.</p>
<p>Wellhung: How did you do that? I'm picking up the bra and inspecting the clasp.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your tongue all over me.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm dropping the bra. Now I'm licking your, you know, breasts. They're neat!<br /> Sweetheart: I'm running my fingers through your hair. Now I'm nibbling your ear.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breast are covered with spit and phlegm.<br /> Sweetheart: What?</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm so sorry; Really.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm wiping your phlegm off my breasts with the remains of my blouse.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with a plop.<br /> Sweetheart: OK. I'm pulling your sweat pants down and rubbing your hard tool.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee!<br /> Sweetheart: I'm pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over, in and out nibbling on you...umm... wait a minute.<br /> Sweetheart: What's the matter?</p>
<p>Wellhung: I've got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I'm choking.<br /> Sweetheart: Are you OK?</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm having a coughing fit. I'm turning all red.<br /> Sweetheart: Can I help?</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I'm fumbling through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups?<br /> Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm drinking a cup of water. There, that's better.<br /> Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm washing the cup now.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm on the bed arching for you.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm drying the cup. Now I'm putting it back in the cabinet. And now I'm walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it's dark, I'm lost. Where's the bedroom?</p>
<p>Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall.<br /> Wellhung: I found it.</p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm tuggin' off your pants. I'm moaning. I want you so badly.<br /> Wellhung: Me too.</p>
<p>Sweetheart: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately-our naked bodies pressing each other.</p>
<p>Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts.<br /> Sweetheart Why don't you take off your glasses?</p>
<p>Wellhung: OK, but I can't see very well without them. I place the glasses on the night table.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby!</p>
<p>Wellhung: I have to pee. I'm fumbling my way blindly across the room and toward the bathroom.<br /> Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I find the bathroom and it's dark. I'm feeling around for the toilet. I lift the lid.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm waiting eagerly for your return.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm done going. I'm feeling around for the flush handle, but I can't find it. Uh-oh!<br /> Sweetheart: What's the matter now?</p>
<p>Wellhung: I've realized that I've peed into your laundry hamper. Sorry again. I'm walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my way.<br /> Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on.</p>
<p>Wellhung: OK, now I'm going to put my...you know ...thing...in your...you know...woman's thing.<br /> Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it!</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss your neck. Umm, I'm having a little trouble here.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can't stand it another second! Slide in! Screw me now!</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm flaccid.<br /> Sweetheart: What?</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm limp. I can't sustain an erection.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm standing up and turning around; an incredulous look on my face.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm shrugging with a sad look on my face, my wiener all floppy. I'm going to get my glasses and see what's wrong.<br /> Sweetheart: No, never mind. I'm getting dressed. I'm putting on my underwear. Now I'm putting on my wet nasty blouse.</p>
<p>Wellhung: No wait! Now I'm squinting, trying to find the night table. I'm feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray, picture frames and your candles.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm buttoning my blouse. Now I'm putting on my shoes.</p>
<p>Wellhung: I've found my glasses. I'm putting them on. My God! One of your candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I'm pointing at it, a shocked look on my face.<br /> Sweetheart: Go to hell. I'm logging off, you loser!</p>
<p>Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!<br /> Sweetheart:{logged off}</p>

21295,"<p>The hillbilly man and his new bride were on their honeymoon. The first night the hillbilly anxiously jumps into bed to wait for his wife to get herself ready for a little romance.</p>
<p>His new bride comes out of the bathroom in a sexy negligee and says ""Honey, I have something to tell you. I'm a virgin.""</p>
<p>The man grabs his clothes and rushes out of the house yelling at the top of his lungs. He heads straight to his father's house. When he gets there his father says ""Son, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be on your honeymoon.""</p>
<p>The son, almost out of breath from his run to the house says ""Dad, my new wife told me a big secret of hers. She's a virgin!!!!""</p>
<p>""Damn son. You did the right thing by leaving. If she wasn't good enough for her family, she sure as hell isn't good enough for ours!""</p>

21296,"<p>A dad walks into a market followed by his ten-year-old son. The<br /> kid is spinning a 25 cent piece in the air and catching it<br /> between his teeth. As they walk through the market someone bumps<br /> into the boy at just the wrong moment and the coin goes straight<br /> into his mouth and lodges in his throat. He immediately starts<br /> choking, going blue in the face, and his dad starts panicking<br /> and shouting for help.</p>
<p>A well dressed middle-aged, moderately attractive, but serious<br /> woman in a navy blue business suit is sitting at a coffee bar in<br /> the market, reading her newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee.<br /> At the sound of the comotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup<br /> down on the saucer, neatly folds her newspaper and places it on<br /> the counter. Then she gets up from her seat and makes her<br /> unhurried way across the market. Reaching the boy, the woman<br /> carefully takes hold of the boy's testicles and squeezes. Gently<br /> at first. Nothing happened. Then she squeezed even more firmly.<br /> After a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up<br /> the 25 cent piece, which the woman deftly catches in her free<br /> hand. Releasing the boy, the woman pockets the coin and walks<br /> back to her seat in the coffee bar, without saying a word.</p>
<p>As soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no lasting<br /> ill-effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts<br /> effusively thanking her saying, ""I've never seen anybody do<br /> anything like that before--it was fantastic. Are you a doctor?""</p>
<p>""Good heavens, no,"" the woman replies. ""I'm a divorce attorney.""</p>

<p>The correct answer is ""3"" but partial credit can be given to anybody who writes ""It depends"" in the margin of the test or simply blames the whole stupid thing on ""Marketing."" </p>
<p>SOCIAL SKILLS </p>
<p>Engineers have different objectives when it comes to social interaction. ""Normal"" people expect to accomplish several unrealistic things from social interaction: Stimulating and thought-provoking conversation Important social contacts A feeling of connectedness with other humans In contrast to ""normal"" people, engineers have rational objectives for social interactions: Get it over with as soon as possible Avoid getting invited to something unpleasant Demonstrate mental superiority and mastery of all subjects. </p>
<p>FASCINATION WITH GADGETS </p>
<p>To the engineer, all matter in the universe can be placed into one of two categories: (1) things that need to be fixed, and (2) things that will need to be fixed after you've had a few minutes to play with them. Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems. Normal people don't understand this concept; they believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet. No engineer looks at a television remote control without wondering what it would take to turn it into a stun gun. No engineer can take a shower without wondering if some sort of Teflon coating would make showering unnecessary. To the engineer, the world is a toy box full of sub-optimized and feature-poor toys. </p>
<p>FASHION AND APPEARANCE </p>
<p>Clothes are the lowest priority for an engineer, assuming the basic thresholds for temperature and decency have been satisfied. If no appendages are freezing or sticking together, and if no genitalia or mammary glands are swinging around in plain view, then the objective of clothing has been met. Anything else is a waste. </p>
<p>DATING AND SOCIAL LIFE </p>
<p>Dating is never easy for engineers. A normal person will employ various indirect and duplicitous methods to create a false impression of attractiveness. Engineers are incapable of placing appearance above function. </p>
<p>Fortunately, engineers have an ace in the hole. They are widely recognized as superior marriage material: intelligent, dependable, employed, honest, and handy around the house. While it's true that many normal people would prefer not to date an engineer, most normal people harbor an intense desire to mate with them, thus producing engineer like children who will have high-paying jobs long before losing their virginity. </p>
<p>Male engineers reach their peak of sexual attractiveness later than normal men, becoming irresistible erotic dynamos in their mid thirties to late forties. Just look at these examples of sexually irresistible men in technical professions: </p>
<p>Bill Gates MacGyver Etcetera </p>
<p>Female engineers become irresistible at the age of consent and remain that way until about thirty minutes after their clinical death. Longer if it's a warm day. </p>
<p>HONESTY </p>
<p>Engineers are always honest in matters of technology and human relationships. That's why it's a good idea to keep engineers away from customers, romantic interests, and other people who can't handle the truth. </p>
<p>Engineers sometimes bend the truth to avoid work. They say things that sound like lies but technically are not because nobody could be expected to believe them. The </p>
<p>complete list of engineer lies is listed below. </p>
<p>""I won't change anything without asking you first."" ""I'll return your hard-to-find cable tomorrow."" ""I have to have new equipment to do my job."" ""I'm not jealous of your new computer."" </p>
<p>FRUGALITY </p>
<p>Engineers are notoriously frugal. This is not because of cheapness or mean spirit; it is simply because every spending situation is simply a problem in optimization, that is, ""How can I escape this situation while retaining the greatest amount of cash?"" </p>
<p>POWERS OF CONCENTRATION </p>
<p>If there is one trait that best defines an engineer it is the ability to concentrate on one subject to the complete exclusion of everything else in the environment. This sometimes causes engineers to be pronounced dead prematurely. Some funeral homes in high-tech areas have started checking resumes before processing the bodies. Anybody with a degree in electrical engineering or experience in computer programming is propped up in the lounge for a few days just to see if he or she snaps out of it. </p>
<p>RISK </p>
<p>Engineers hate risk. They try to eliminate it whenever they can. This is understandable, given that when an engineer makes one little mistake the media will treat it like it's a big deal or something. </p>
<p>EXAMPLES OF BAD PRESS FOR ENGINEERS Hindenberg Space Shuttle Challenger SPANet(tm) Hubble space telescope Apollo 13 Titanic Ford Pinto Corvair </p>
<p>The risk/reward calculation for engineers looks something like this: </p>
<p>RISK: Public humiliation and the death of thousands of innocent people. REWARD: A certificate of appreciation in a handsome plastic frame. </p>
<p>Being practical people, engineers evaluate this balance of risks and rewards and decide that risk is not a good thing. The best way to avoid risk is by advising that any activity is technically impossible for reasons that are far too complicated to explain. </p>
<p>If that approach is not sufficient to halt project, then the engineer will fall back to a second line of defense: ""It's technically possible but it will cost too much."" </p>
<p>EGO </p>
<p>Ego-wise, two things are important to engineers: How smart they are. How many cool devices they own. The fastest way to get an engineer to solve a problem is to declare that the problem is unsolvable. No engineer can walk away from an unsolvable problem until it's solved. No illness or distraction is sufficient to get the engineer off the case. These types of challenges quickly become personal --a battle between the engineer and the laws of nature. </p>
<p>Engineers will go without food and hygiene for days to solve a problem. (Other times just because they forgot.) And when they succeed in solving the problem they will experience an ego rush that is better than sex -- and I'm including the kind of sex where other people are involved. </p>
<p>Nothing is more threatening to the engineer than the suggestion that somebody has more technical skill. Normal people sometimes use that knowledge as a lever to extract more work from the engineer. When an engineer says that something can't be done (a code phrase that means it's not fun to do), some clever normal people have learned to glance at the engineer with a look of compassion and pity and say something along these lines: ""I'll ask Bob to figure it out. He knows how to solve difficult technical problems."" </p>
<p>At that point it is a good idea for the normal person to not stand between the engineer and the problem. The engineer will set upon the problem like a starved Chihuahua on a pork chop.</p>

21307,"<p>A man had to go to a strange town to be the guest speaker at a business meeting. </p>
<p>When he arrived at the Motel in town, he found that he had a lot of time before the meeting. </p>
<p>He asked the clerk where the nearest golf course was and was given directions on how to get there.</p>
<p>While playing on the front nine, he was going over the speech in his mind and became confused as to where he was on the course. </p>
<p>Looking around, he saw a Lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her and told her about his big meeting and the speech he was to make and his confusion about where he was on the course, asked her if she knew what hole he was playing.</p>
<p>She replied ""I'm on the 7th hole and you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole.""</p>
<p>He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the back nine the same thing happened. and he approached her again with the same request.</p>
<p>She said ""I'm on the 14th, you are a hole behind me, So you must be on the 13th.""</p>
<p>Once again he thanked her and returned to his play. He finished his round and went into the club house where he saw the Lady sitting at the end of the bar. </p>
<p>He asked the bartender if he knew the Lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played the course often. </p>
<p>He approached her and said, ""let me buy you a drink to show my appreciation for your help. I understand that you are a sales lady, well I am in sales also. What do you sell""?</p>
<p>She replied, ""if I told you, you would only laugh."" ""No I wouldn't"", he said and persisted that she tell him what she sold.</p>
<p>""Well if you must know"", she answered, ""I sell Tampax.""</p>
<p>With that, he fell on the floor and laughed so hard he almost lost his breath. She said ""see I knew you would laugh.""</p>
<p>""That's not what I'm laughing at"" he replied, ""I'm a toilet paper salesman, so I'm still a hole behind you!""</p>

21322,"<p>BREAKING NEWS: GOD OVERRULES SUPREME COURT VERDICT</p>
<p>Bush To Be Smitten Later Today</p>
<p>HEAVEN, ENTIRE UNIVERSE (ANS) -- In a stunning development this morning, God invoked the ""one nation, under God"" clause of the Pledge of Allegiance to overrule the recent Supreme Court decision that handed the White House to George Bush.</p>
<p>""I'm not sure where the Supreme Court gets off,"" God said this morning on a rare Today Show appearance, ""but I'm sure as hell not going to lie back and led Bush get away with this bull*#@!.""</p>
<p>""I've watched analysts argue for weeks now that the exact vote count in Florida 'will never be known.' Well, I'm God and I DO know exactly who voted for whom. Let's cut to the chase: Gore won Florida by exactly 20,219 votes.""</p>
<p>Shocking political analysts and pundits, God's unexpected verdict overrules the official Electoral College tally and awards Florida to Al Gore, giving him a 289-246 victory. The Bush campaign is analyzing God's Word for possible grounds for appeal.</p>
<p>""God's ruling is a classic over-reach,"" argued Bush campaign strategist Jim Baker. ""Clearly, a divine intervention in a U.S. Presidential Election is unprecedented, unjust, and goes against The constitution of the state of Florida.""</p>
<p>""Jim Baker's a jackass,"" God responded. ""He's got some surprises ahead of him, let me tell you. HOT ones, if you know what I mean.""</p>
<p>God, who provided the exact vote counts for every Florida precinct, explained that bad balloting machinery and voter confusion were no grounds to give the White House to ""a friggin' idiot.""</p>
<p>""Look, only 612 people in Palm Beach County voted for Buchanan. Get real! The rest meant to vote for Gore. Don't believe me? I'll name them: Anderson, Pete; Anderson, Sam, Jr.; Arthur, James; Barnhardt, Ron...""</p>
<p>Our Lord then went on to note that he was displeased with George W. Bush's prideful ways and announced that he would officially smite him today. In an act of wrath unlike any reported since the Book of Job, God has taken all of Bush's goats and livestock, stripped him of his wealth and possessions, sold his family into slavery, forced the former presidential candidate into hard labor in a salt mine, and afflicted him with deep boils.</p>

21330,"<p>THINK YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY.... check it out these actual cases.</p>
<p>Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned-out section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba<br /> tanks on his back, flippers, and face mask.</p>
<p>A postmortem test revealed that the man died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clothed diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire.</p>
<p>It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the man went diving off the coast, some 20 miles from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, had called in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and emptied at the site of the forest fire.</p>
<p>You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next, he was doing the breast stroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air. Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.<br /> ___________________________________________</p>

<p>A man was working on his motorcycle on the patio, his wife nearby in the kitchen. While racing the engine, the motorcycle accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handlebars, was dragged along as it burst through the glass patio doors.</p>
<p>His wife, hearing the crash, ran in the room to find her husband cut and bleeding, the motorcycle, and the shattered patio door. She called for an ambulance and, because the house sat on a fairly large hill, went down the several flights of stairs to meet the paramedics and escort them to her husband.</p>
<p>While the attendants were loading her husband, the wife managed to right the motorcycle and push it outside. She also quickly blotted up the spilled gasoline with some paper towels and tossed them into the toilet.</p>
<p>After being treated and released, the man returned home, looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He went into the bathroom and consoled himself with a cigarette while attending to his business. About to stand, he flipped the butt between his legs.</p>
<p>The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. Finding him lying on the bathroom floor with his trousers blown away and burns on his buttocks, legs and groin, she<br /> once again phoned for an ambulance. The same paramedic crew was dispatched.</p>
<p>As the paramedics carried the man down the stairs to the ambulance they asked the wife how he had come to burn himself. She told them.<br /> They started laughing so hard, one slipped, the stretcher and dumping the husband out. He fell down the remaining stairs, breaking his arm.<br /> ______________________________________________<br /> Still having a bad day? Just remember, it could be worse...</p>

Nancy, his wife, pondered this<br /> for a little while and then thought of an answer.

The man was racing the engine<br /> on the motorcycle and somehow the motorcycle slipped into gear.<br /> The man, still holding the handlebars, was dragged through a<br /> glass patio door and the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside<br /> the house.</p>
<p>The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found<br /> her husband laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the<br /> motorcycle laying next to him and the patio door shattered. The<br /> wife ran to the phone and summoned an ambulance. Because they<br /> lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several<br /> flights of long steps to the street to direct the paramedics to<br /> her husband.</p>
<p>After the ambulance arrived and transported the husband to the<br /> hospital, the wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it<br /> outside. Seeing that gas had spilled on the floor, the wife<br /> obtained some papers towels, blotted up the gasoline, and threw<br /> the towels in the toilet.</p>
<p>The husband was treated at the hospital and was released to come<br /> home. After arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door<br /> and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent,<br /> went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet and smoked a<br /> cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between<br /> his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated.</p>
<p>The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her<br /> husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her<br /> husband laying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away<br /> and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs<br /> and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone and called for an<br /> ambulance.</p>
<p>The same ambulance crew was dispatched and the wife met them at<br /> the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher<br /> and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down<br /> the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the<br /> paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself.<br /> She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one<br /> of them tipped the stretcher and dumped the husband out. He fell<br /> down the remaining steps and broke his arm.</p>

So he goes over to the dog, and notices he has a note in his mouth. He takes the note, and it reads ""Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please. The dog has money in his mouth, as well.""</p>
<p>The butcher looks inside and, lo and behold, there is a ten pound note there. So he takes the money, and puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, placing it in the dog's mouth. The butcher is well impressed, and since it's close to closing time, he decides to shut up shop and follow the dog. So off he goes.</p>
<p>The dog is walking down the street, when he comes to a level crossing. The dog puts down the bag, jumps up and presses the button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the lights to turn. They do, and he walks across the road, with the butcher following him all the way.</p>
<p>The dog then comes to a bus stop, and starts looking at the timetable. The butcher is in awe at this stage. The dog checks out the times, and then sits on one of the seats provided. Along comes a bus. The dog walks around the front, looks at the number, and goes back to his seat. Another bus comes. Again the dog goes and looks at the number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on. The butcher, by now open-mouthed, follows him onto the bus.</p>
<p>The bus travels through the town and out into the suburbs, the dog looking at the scenery. Eventually he gets up, and moves to the front of the bus. He stands on 2 back paws and pushes the button to stop the bus. Then he gets off, his groceries still in his mouth.</p>
<p>Well, dog and butcher are walking along the road, and then the dog turns into a house. He walks up the path, and drops the groceries on the step. Then he walks back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He goes back down the path, runs up to the door and -Whap!- throws himself against it again.  There's no answer at the house, so the dog goes back down the path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter of the garden. He gets to the window, and beats his head against it several times, walks back, jumps off, and waits at the door.</p>
<p>The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door, and starts laying into the dog. Kicking him and punching him, and swearing at him.</p>
<p>The butcher runs up, and stops the guy. ""What the hell are you doing? The dog is a genius. He could be on TV, for heaven's sake !"", to which the guy responds... ""Genius me butt - this is the second time this week that he's forgotton his key!""</p>

21423,"<p>In a recent contest, The Washington Post asked readers to dream up new<br /> elements for the Periodic Table. Among the best of the batch:<br /> Limbaughium Lb<br /> The heaviest known element. It possesses an ever-expanding mass. Very white.<br /> Acidic. Emits heat but no light. Instantly polarizes all elements that come in<br /> contact with it. Repels protons and electrons; attracts only morons. </p>
<p>With a slick appearance and slimy texture, this element undergoes a series of<br /> interesting changes when in hot water. </p>
<p>Canadium Eh<br /> Similar to Americium, but a little denser. Much more rigid. Often called<br /> Boron. </p>
<p>Innofensium Pc<br /> Precisely equal numbers of electrons, protons, neutrons, leptons, quarks.<br /> Completely inert, utterly useless, but smells like a rose. </p>
<p>Newtium<br /> Extreme irritant. Carries a strong negative charge. Does not possess magnetic<br /> properties. Can be purchased cheaply. </p>
<p>Quaylium Vp<br /> Einsteinium it ain't. </p>
<p>Budweisium Ps<br /> Has no taste or smell; is often indistinguishable from water. </p>
<p>Cabmium Cb<br /> Found in abundance, except when needed. Exists in two states, in motion and at<br /> rest. When in motion, it cannot be stopped, no matter what you do. Cabmium has a<br /> charge associated with it. The charge is variable, and scientists have not<br /> determined the formula for calculating it. </p>
<p>Politicium Po<br /> Contains a great deal of gas. Similar to radon in that it can reach lethal<br /> concentrations in the House. </p>
<p>Congress Cg<br /> Atomic number 525. Can never be found in a solution. </p>
<p>Snot Sn<br /> Bonds forever with corduroy.</p>

21428,"<p>Sam &amp; Jesus [PUN WARNING]    Many many years ago in the town of Jerusalem lived a very nice Jewish man, named Sam, with his wife and children. Times were hard, and this gentleman had to work very long hours daily as a laborer to house and feed his family.  But his real love was sewing.  Although he put in long hours at his job, he would often stay up half the night designing and making clothes.  His dream was to some day have a shop of his own where he could outfit everyone.    One evening, as he sat sewing by lamp light, he heard a commotion outside.  When he went to look, he saw all his neighbors going to an area of raised field, so he tagged along.  There was an enormous crowd, and up on the hill he saw a tall bearded man preaching.  Sam was intrigued by this man, a very eloquent speaker, the crowd was so quiet.  But, thought Sam, this man looked dusty, dirty, poorly dressed, and tired.  So after the sermon, Sam managed to go speak to this man.  Sam told him he was great speaker, really holding the people's attention, but that clothes really do help, and that if he were dressed better he would make a much better impression.    Then Sam had a great idea -- he offered to make the man, (whose name he found out was Jesus), a new outfit, for free, if when Jesus went out on another speaking tour, he would just happen to drop into his speech from where he got his clothes.  Jesus thought this over, saying that it was true his appearance did need improving, after all, traveling the way he did was hard on his clothing and that he just hadn't the time or the money to get new outfits.  And so it was agreed.    Jesus was to be gone on the road for another two weeks, so Sam spent nearly every night now designing, cutting out, and sewing a beautiful robe.  When Jesus was back in town, Sam took him the new outfit.  And Jesus promised to tell folks from where his new outfit had come.Over the next several months, people began coming to Sam's house, asking for new clothes because they had seen and admired what the man Jesus was wearing. With orders for several complete wardrobes, Sam was able to quit his day laborer job, and, with the help of his wife, he set up a little business.    A month later, Jesus was back in town and he came to Sam's house.  Sam thanked him profusely and said he thought they should be partners, open up a real shop, not just in his house.  Sam said he would put up a sign, what did Jesus think of 'Sam and Jesus Clothing'?  Jesus thought a minute, then said, 'I think the sign should read 'Lord and Taylor'.</p>

21432,"<p>The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists; two men and a woman. </p>
<p>For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. </p>
<p>''We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!'' </p>
<p>The man said, ''You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.'' </p>
<p>The agent said, ''Then you're not the right man for this job.'' </p>
<p>The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about five minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes.''I tried, but I can't kill my wife.'' </p>
<p>The agent said, ''You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.'' </p>
<p>Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. The agents heard screaming, crashing, and banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. </p>
<p>She wiped the sweat from her brow, and said, ''This gun is loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair.''</p>

21436,"<p>Three business men were sitting in a bar, drinking and discussing how stupid their wives were.</p>
<p>The first says, ""I tell you, my wife is so stupid. Last week she went to the supermarket and bought $300 worth of meat because it was on sale, and we don't even have a fridge big enough to keep it in!""</p>
<p>The second agrees that she sounds pretty thick, but says his wife is thicker. ""Just last week, she went out and spent $17000 on a new car,"" he laments, ""and she doesn't even know how to drive!""</p>
<p>The third, a blonde male, nods sagely and agrees that these two women sound like they both walked through the stupid forest and got hit by every branch.</p>
<p>However, he still thinks his wife is dumber. ""I have to laugh when I think about it"", he chuckles. ""Last week my wife left on a vacation to Greece.""</p>
<p>""I watched her packing her bags and she must have taken at least five boxes of condoms with her. She doesn't even have a penis!""</p>

21438,"<p>There once was a giant who lived at the top of a big mountain.<br /> His favorate thing to do was to kick trids (short people) from<br /> the village down the mountain. After a while, the mayor of the<br /> village went to talk to him. ""Excuse me Mr. Giant. Us trids in<br /> the village feel that you could maybe find a different hobby<br /> less painful to us trids."" ""No way! It's sooo fun! To see the<br /> little trids roll down the mountain, it's a blast!"" And he<br /> kicked the mayor down the mountain.</p>
<p>The trids are shocked but the send a priest up to the giant<br /> thinking he won't kick a man of god. So after the same<br /> discussion, the giant kicked the priest down the mountain.</p>
<p>After a week or so, they concluded that the giant must be Jewish<br /> if he would dare to kick a priest down the mountain. So up went<br /> a rabbi. ""Excuse me, Giant, but the trids don't like you kicking<br /> them doen the mountain. You need to find yourself a different<br /> hobby to do!"" ""But when I kick them down, they roll and it's<br /> hillarious!"" ""Ok. So there's nothing at all I can say or do to<br /> make you change your mind?"" ""Nope, there isn't."" ""OK. I guess<br /> you can kick me now."" ""What? Silly Rabbi, kicks are for trids!""</p>

21451,"<p>On February 3, 1990, a Renton (Seattle area) man tried to commit a<br />  robbery. This was probably his first attempt, as suggested by his<br />  lack of a record of violent crime, and by his terminally stupid<br />  choice:</p>
<ol>
<li>The target was H&amp;J Leather &amp; Firearms, a gunshop; </li>
<li>The shop was full of customers, in a state where a substantial<br />  fraction of the adult population is licensed to carry concealed<br />  handguns in public places; </li>
<li>To enter the shop, he had to step around a marked King County<br />  Police patrol car parked at the front door; </li>
<li>An officer in uniform was standing next to the counter, having<br />  coffee before reporting to duty. </li>
</ol>
<p> Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a holdup and<br />  fired a few wild shots.</p>
<p> The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, removing him from the<br />  gene pool.</p>
<p> Several other customers also drew their guns, but didn't fire. No one<br />  else was hurt.</p>

21458,"<p>Sent by  a  friend:  I'm  currently  running  the  latest  version  of<br /> GirlFriend and I've been having some problems lately.I've been running the  same<br />  version  of   DrinkingBuddies1.0   forever  as  my  primary application, and<br /> all the  GirlFriend  releases  I've tried have always conflicted with  it.  I<br /> hear  that  DrinkingBuddies  won't  crash  if GirlFriend is run in  background<br /> mode  and  its  sound is turned off. However, for the life of  me  I  can'tfind<br /> the  switch that turns the sound off. So, I just run them separately, and they<br /> work just fine.<br /> GirlFriend also seems  to  have  a  problem  co-existing  with my Golf<br /> program,  often  trying  to  abort  Golf  with  some  sort  of  timing<br /> incompatibility. I probably should  have  stayed  with GirlFriend 1.0, but I<br /> thought I  might  see  better  performance  from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of<br /> conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with<br /> GirlFriend 2.0. He said I probably didn't have enough cache to run GirlFriend<br /> 2.0,  and eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly.  He  was<br /> right.  As  soon  as I purged my cache,  it  uninstalled  itself.  Shortly<br /> after  that,  I  installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta.All the bugs  were  supposed  to<br /> be gone, but the first time I used it, it gave me a virus anyway.<br /> I had to clean out my  whole  system  and  shut down for while. I very<br /> cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend 4.0. This  time  I used a SCSI probe first and<br /> also installed a  virus  protection  program. It worked okay for a while until I<br />  discovered  that  GirlFriend  1.0 was still in my system. I tried running<br /> GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has<br /> a  feature  I didn't know about that automatically senses the presence of  any<br /> other version of GirlFriend and communicates with it in some  way,  which<br /> results in the immediate removal of both versions.<br /> The version I have now  works  pretty  well,  but there are still some<br /> problems. Like all  versions  of  GirlFriend,  it  is  written in some obscure<br /> language I can't  understand,  much  less reprogram. Frankly I think there is<br /> too much  attention  paid  to  the look and feel rather than the  desired<br /> functionality.  Also,  I've  never  liked  how  the GirlFriend Series is totally<br /> object-oriented. A  year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of<br /> GirlFriend  to GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident<br /> version of GirlFriend. He discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a<br /> year if you don't upgrade to Fiancee 1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had<br /> to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a  huge  resource  hog. It has<br /> taken up all his space, so he can't load anything  else. One of the primary<br /> reasons he decided to go  with  Wife  1.0  was  because  it  came bundled with<br /> FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 often<br /> prohibits access to FreeSexPlus,  even with new Plug-Ins. On top of that, Wife<br /> 1.0 came  with  MotherInLaw 1.0, although he did not<br /> ask for it. This has an automatic pop-up feature he can't control, and it's<br /> impossible to modulate its  sound.  I  suggested that he consider installing<br /> Mistress 1.0, but he said  he  heard  if  you try to run it without first<br /> uninstalling any of  the  Wife  series, Wife will delete all MSMoney files and<br /> crash  the  system  before uninstalling itself. With a purged cache, Mistress<br /> 1.0  will  never  install. The moral of this story is:  Know  your  system's<br /> hardware  requirements, software peculiarities and limited range of<br /> compatibilities  and do be careful with those alluring upgrades.</p>

21460,"<p>Astrology tells us about you and your future simply by your birthday. The Chinese Zodiac uses the year of your birth. Demographics tell us what you like, dislike, whom you vote for, what you buy and what you watch on television.<br /> Well, the Corporate Zodiac goes a step further: simply by your job title, people will have you all figured out... </p>
<p>MARKETING: You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and socializing - which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least compatible with Sales. </p>
<p>SALES: Laziest of all signs, often referred to as ""marketing without a degree"", you are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with ""customers"" so you can ""concentrate on the big picture"". You seek admiration for your golf game throughout your life. </p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY: Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace. Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying, but who the hell can tell?! It is written that the Geeks shall inherit the Earth. </p>
<p>ENGINEERING: One of only two signs that actually studied in school, it is said that ninety percent of all Personal Ads are placed by engineers. You can be happy with yourself: your office is typically full of all the latest ""ergodynamic"" gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your ""carpal tunnel""... </p>
<p>ACCOUNTING: The only other sign that studied in school, you are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the organization; combined with your extreme organizational traits, the majority of rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane. </p>

21463,"<p>A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship. The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier.</p>
<p>He said to the female whale, ""Let's both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.</p>
<p>Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female ""lets swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore.""</p>
<p>At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen!""</p>

21464,"<p>A guy is hanging out in his favorite bar when he spots a<br /> fabulous babe walking in on the arm of some ugly dude. He asks<br /> the bartender about her and is surprised to discover that she's<br /> a prostitute. He watches her the rest of the night, amazed that<br /> someone so attractive could be available to him. The next night<br /> he goes back to the bar, and sure enough she shows up again,<br /> only this time alone. The guy gets up his nerve and approaches<br /> her.</p>
<p>""Is it true you're a prostitute?""</p>
<p>""Why, sure, big boy. What can I do for you?""</p>
<p>""Well, I dunno. What do you charge?""</p>
<p>""I get $100 just for a hand job. We can negotiate from there...""</p>
<p>""$100!?! For a handjob? Are you nuts?""</p>
<p>""You see that Ferrari out there?"" The guy looks out the front<br /> door, and sure enough there's a shiny new Ferrari parked<br /> outside. ""I paid cash for that Ferrari with the money I made on<br /> hand jobs. Trust me, it's worth it.""</p>
<p>The guy mulls it over for a while, and decides what the hell. He<br /> leaves with her, and gets the most unbelievable experience he's<br /> ever had. This hand job was better than any complete sexual<br /> experience in his miserable life. The next night he's back at<br /> the bar, waiting eagerly for her to show up. When she does, he<br /> immediately approaches her.</p>
<p>""Last night was incredible!""</p>
<p>""Of course it was. Just wait til you try one of my blow jobs...""</p>
<p>""How much is that?""</p>
<p>""$500""</p>
<p>""$500!?! C'mon, that's ridiculous!""</p>
<p>""You see that apartment building across the street?"" The guy<br /> looks out front at a 12 story apartment building. ""I paid cash<br /> for that building with the money I made on blow jobs. Trust me,<br /> it's worth it.""</p>
<p>Based on the night before, the guy decides to go for it. He<br /> leaves with her, and once again is not disappointed. He nearly<br /> faints - twice. The next night he can hardly contain himself<br /> until she shows up.</p>
<p>""I'm hooked, you're the best! Tell me, what'll it cost me for<br /> some pussy?""</p>
<p>She motions for him to follow her outside. She points down the<br /> street, here between the buildings he can see Manhattan. ""You<br /> see that island?""</p>
<p>""Aw, c'mon! You can't mean that!""</p>
<p>She nods her head. ""You bet. If I had a pussy, I'd own<br /> Manhattan!""</p>

21509,"<p>Turmoil rocked Heaven this morning as allegations arose that God had had an affair with a former worshipper. The scandal was begun when a 21 year old woman, known only as Mary, claimed that she had given birth to God's ""only son"" last week in a barn in the hamlet of Bethlehem.Sources close to Mary claim that she ""had loved God for a long time"", that she was constantly talking about her relationship with God, and that she was ""thrilled to have had his child.""  In a press conference this morning, God issued a vehement denial, saying that ""No sexual relationship existed"", and that ""the facts of this story will come out in time, verily"".Independent counsel Kenneth Beelzebub immediately filed a brief with the Justice department to expand his investigation to cover questions of whether any commandments may have been broken, and whether God had illegally funnelled laundered money to his illegitimate child through three foreign operatives know only as the ""Wise Men"". Beelzebub has issued subpoenas to several angels who are rumoured to have acted as go-betweens in the affair.Critics have pointed out that these allegations have little to do with the charges that Beelzebub was originally appointed to investigate, that God had created large-scale flooding in order to cover up evidence of a failed land deal.In recent months, Beelzebub's investigation has already been expanded to cover questions surrounding the large number of locusts that plagued God's political opponents in the last election, as well as to claims that the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah was to divert attention away from a scandal involving whether the give-away of a parcel of public land in Promised County to a Jewish special interest group was quid pro quo for political contributions.If these allegations prove to be true, then this could be a huge blow to God's career, much of which has been spent crusading for stricter moral standards and harsher punishments for wrongdoers. Indeed, God recently outlined a ""tough-on-crime"" plan consisting of a series of 10 ""Commandments"", which has been introduced in Congress in a bill by Rep. Moses.  Critics of the bill have pointed out that it lacks any provisions for the rehabilitation of criminals, and lawyers for the ACLU are planning to fight the ""Name in Vain"" Commandment as being an unconstitutional restriction on free speech.</p>

He looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then walked over to the sign, looked at it and whined. Getting the idea, the receptionist got the office manager. The office manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the least. However, the dog looked determined, so he led him into the office. Inside, the dog jumped up on the chair and stared at the manager. The manager said, ""I can't hire you. The sign says you have to be able to type.""The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to type out a perfect letter. He took out the page and trotted over to the manager and gave it to him, then jumped back on the chair. The manager was stunned, but then told the dog, ""The sign says you have to be good with a computer.""The dog jumped down again and went to the computer. The dog proceeded to demonstrate his expertise with various programs and produced a sample spreadsheet and database and presented them to the manager. By this time the manager was totally dumbfounded! He looked at the dog and said, ""I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and have some interesting abilities. However, I still can't give you the job.""The dog jumped down and went to a copy of the sign and put his paw on the part about being an Equal Opportunity Employer. The manager said, ""Yes, but the sign also says that you have to be bilingual.""The dog looked at him straight in the face and said, ""Meow.""</p>

21535,"<p>Ed finally decides to take a vacation. He books himself on a Caribbean<br /> cruise and proceeds to have the time of his life--until the boat sank.</p>
<p>He found himself swept up on the shore of an island with no other people,<br /> no supplies...nothing...only bananas and coconuts.</p>
<p>After about four months, he is lying on the beach one day when the most<br /> gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to him. In disbelief, he asks her,<br /> ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?""</p>
<p>""I rowed from the other side of the island,"" she says. ""I landed here when<br /> my cruise ship sank.""</p>
<p>""Amazing,"" he says. ""You were really lucky to have a rowboat wash up with<br /> you.""</p>
<p>""Oh, this?"" replies the woman. ""I made the rowboat out of raw material I<br /> found on the island. The oars were whittled from gum tree branches. I wove<br /> the bottom from palm branches. And the sides and stern came from a<br /> Eucalyptus tree.""</p>
<p>""But, but, that's impossible,"" stutters Ed. ""You had no tools or hardware.<br /> How did you manage?""</p>
<p>""Oh, that was no problem,"" replies the woman. ""On the south side of the<br /> island, there is a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed. I found<br /> if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into<br /> forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools and used the tools to make<br /> the hardware.""</p>
<p>Ed is stunned. ""Let's row over to my place,"" she says. After a few minutes<br /> of rowing, she docks the boat at a small wharf. As Ed looks onto shore, he<br /> nearly falls out of the boat. Before him is a stone walk leading to an<br /> exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.</p>
<p>While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, he<br /> could only stare ahead, dumbstruck. As they walk into the house, she says<br /> casually, ""It's not much, but I call it home. Sit down please. Would you<br /> like to have a drink?""</p>
<p>""No, no, thank you."" he says, still dazed. ""Can't take any more coconut<br /> juice.""</p>
<p>""It's not coconut juice,"" the woman replies. ""I have a still. How about a<br /> Pina Colada?"" Trying to hide his continued amazement, he accepts, and they<br /> sit down on her couch to talk.</p>
<p>After they have exchanged their stories, the woman announces, ""I'm going<br /> to slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to take a shower<br /> and shave? There is a razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom.""</p>
<p>No longer questioning anything, Ed goes into the bathroom. There, in the<br /> cabinet, is a razor made from a bone handle. Two shells honed to a hollow<br /> ground edge are fastened on to its end inside of a swivel mechanism.</p>
<p>""Wow! This woman is amazing!"" he muses, ""What next?""</p>
<p>When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but vines-strategically<br /> positioned-and smelling faintly of gardenias. She beckons for him to sit<br /> down next to her.</p>
<p>""Tell me,"" she begins suggestively, slithering closer to him, ""We've been<br /> out here for a really long time. You've been lonely. There's something I'm<br /> sure you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing<br /> for all these months. You know..."" She stares into his eyes. He can't<br /> believe what he's hearing: ""You mean---"", he swallows excitedly, ""I can<br /> check my email from here?!""</p>

21542,"<p>Some lessons learned in life:</p>
<p>Never under any circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night.</p>
<p>If you have to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be ""meetings"".</p>
<p>There is a very fine line between ""hobby"" and ""mental illness"".</p>
<p>People who want to share their religious veiws with you almost never want you to share yours with them.</p>
<p>And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its glories, decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as His messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle.</p>
<p>You should not confuse your career with your life, because if you have a career that probably means you have no life.</p>
<p>No matter what happens... somebody will find a way to take it too seriously.</p>
<p>Never lick a steak knife.</p>
<p>Take out the fortune before you eat the cookie.</p>
<p>""The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we ALL believe that we are above average drivers.</p>
<p>You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her at that moment.</p>

21547,"<p>Use the Term 'Falling' Instead Of 'Cheating' </p>
<p>An elderly priest was upset with the things he was hearing during Saturday<br /> confessions. After his sermon one Sunday morning, he said to his<br /> congregation, ""I'm tired of hearing so many people tell me in confession<br /> that they have cheated. For thirty years, people have been saying to me<br /> 'I have cheated with Anthony... I have cheated with Mary... I have cheated<br /> with Frankie.' I am sick and tired of hearing this word. From now on, when<br /> you come into my confessional, you will say 'I have fallen with Anthony, or<br /> with Mary, or with Frankie.' No more the word CHEATS. It will be FALL.""</p>
<p>About a year later, the old priest retired and was replaced by a younger<br /> man. No one thought to tell the new priest about the change of words in<br /> the confessional. After hearing his first round of Saturday confessions,<br /> the young priest went to the mayor of the town and said to him, ""Mr. Mayor,<br /> you are going to have to do something about the deplorable condition of the<br /> streets and sidewalks in this town. Everybody is telling me they are<br /> falling all over the place.""</p>
<p>The mayor immediately understood the problem, and he leaned back in his<br /> chair and laughed.</p>
<p>The priest was puzzled, and said, ""Mr. Mayor, you shouldn't be laughing!<br /> Your wife told me that just last week she fell three times!""</p>

<p>So he did.  Then, the guy got soooooo drunk that he puked up<br /> onto himself.  ""Oh man, my wifes gonna murder me.""  he slurred.<br /> ""Don't worry"" his friend said ""here is a $20 note, ok.  Tell ya<br /> wife this....""</p>
<p>Later that night, the man got home.  </p>
<p>""Who do you think you are coming home drunk to me with vomit over<br /> your shirt.  You bastard!  You're a discrace of a husband""  The<br /> wife cried.  ""No sweetie""  Mr Drunk began, ""I stayed late at the<br /> office and on the way home some druck chucked on me.  He gave me<br /> $20 as an apology.  The wife stared at her husband.

21550,"<p>Billy was excited about his first day at school. So excited in fact, that only a few minutes after class started, he realized that he desperately needed to go to the bathroom.<br /> So, Billy raised his hand politely to ask if he could be excused. Of course, the teacher said yes, but asked Billy to be quick.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Billy returned, looking more desperate and embarrassed. ""I can't find it,"" he admitted.</p>
<p>The teacher sat Billy down and drew him a little diagram to where he should go and asked him if he will be able to find it now. Billy looked at the diagram, said ""yes"" and goes on his way.</p>
<p>Well five minutes later he returned to the class room and says to the teacher, ""I can't find it.""</p>
<p>Frustrated, the teacher asked Tommy, a boy who has been at the school for awhile, to help him find the bathroom.</p>
<p>So, Tommy and Billy go together and five minutes later they both return and sit down at their seats. The teacher asks Tommy, ""Well, did you find it?""</p>
<p>Tommy is quick with his reply, ""Oh sure, he just had his boxer shorts on backwards.""</p>

<p>Later that night, while going at it pretty hot and heavy in the shower, her toes remained still. </p>
<p>Confused, he asked, ""Why is it that when we do it in bed, your toes go up, but when we do it in the shower, they don't?"" </p>
<p>""Silly,"" she replied, ""I take my pantyhose off in the shower!""</p>

<p>Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like? </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse, a miniskirt and high heels. I work out every day, I'm toned and perfect. My measurements are 36-24-36. What do you look like? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm 6'3"" and about 250 pounds. I wear glasses and I have on a pair of blue sweat pants I just bought from Walmart. I'm also wearing a T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from dinner...it smells funny. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me?<br /> Wellhung: OK </p>
<p>Sweetheart: We're in my bedroom. There's soft music playing on the stereo and candles on my dresser and night table. I'm looking up into your eyes, smiling. My hand works its way down to your crotch and begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm gulping, I'm beginning to sweat.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest. </p>
<p>Wellhung: Now I'm unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm moaning softly. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk slides off my warm skin. I'm rubbing you bulge faster, pulling and rubbing. </p>
<p>Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and accidentally rips a hole in your blouse. I'm sorry.<br /> Sweetheart: That's OK, it wasn't really too expensive. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'll pay for it.<br /> Sweetheart: Don't worry about it. I'm wearing a lacy black bra. My soft breasts are rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm fumbling with the clasp on your bra. I think it's stuck. Do you have any scissors?<br /> Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly. I'm reaching back undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my breast. My nipples are erect for you. </p>
<p>Wellhung: How did you do that? I'm picking up the bra and inspecting the clasp.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your tongue all over me. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm dropping the bra. Now I'm licking your, you know, breasts. They're neat!<br /> Sweetheart: I'm running my fingers through your hair. Now I'm nibbling your ear. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breast are covered with spit and phlegm.<br /> Sweetheart: What? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm so sorry; Really.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm wiping your phlegm off my breasts with the remains of my blouse. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with a plop.<br /> Sweetheart: OK. I'm pulling your sweat pants down and rubbing your hard tool. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee!<br /> Sweetheart: I'm pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over, in and out nibbling on you...umm... wait a minute.<br /> Sweetheart: What's the matter? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I've got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I'm choking.<br /> Sweetheart: Are you OK? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm having a coughing fit. I'm turning all red.<br /> Sweetheart: Can I help? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I'm fumbling through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups?<br /> Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm drinking a cup of water. There, that's better.<br /> Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm washing the cup now.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm on the bed arching for you. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm drying the cup. Now I'm putting it back in the cabinet. And now I'm walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it's dark, I'm lost. Where's the bedroom? </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall.<br /> Wellhung: I found it. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: I'm tuggin' off your pants. I'm moaning. I want you so badly.<br /> Wellhung: Me too. </p>
<p>Sweetheart: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately-our naked bodies pressing each other. </p>
<p>Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts.<br /> Sweetheart Why don't you take off your glasses? </p>
<p>Wellhung: OK, but I can't see very well without them. I place the glasses on the night table.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby! </p>
<p>Wellhung: I have to pee. I'm fumbling my way blindly across the room and toward the bathroom.<br /> Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I find the bathroom and it's dark. I'm feeling around for the toilet. I lift the lid.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm waiting eagerly for your return. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm done going. I'm feeling around for the flush handle, but I can't find it. Uh-oh!<br /> Sweetheart: What's the matter now? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I've realized that I've peed into your laundry hamper. Sorry again. I'm walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my way.<br /> Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on. </p>
<p>Wellhung: OK, now I'm going to put my...you know ...thing...in your...you know...woman's thing.<br /> Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it! </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss your neck. Umm, I'm having a little trouble here.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can't stand it another second! Slide in! Screw me now! </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm flaccid.<br /> Sweetheart: What? </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm limp. I can't sustain an erection.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm standing up and turning around; an incredulous look on my face. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I'm shrugging with a sad look on my face, my wiener all floppy. I'm going to get my glasses and see what's wrong.<br /> Sweetheart: No, never mind. I'm getting dressed. I'm putting on my underwear. Now I'm putting on my wet nasty blouse. </p>
<p>Wellhung: No wait! Now I'm squinting, trying to find the night table. I'm feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray, picture frames and your candles.<br /> Sweetheart: I'm buttoning my blouse. Now I'm putting on my shoes. </p>
<p>Wellhung: I've found my glasses. I'm putting them on. My God! One of your candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I'm pointing at it, a shocked look on my face.<br /> Sweetheart: Go to hell. I'm logging off, you loser! </p>
<p>Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!<br /> Sweetheart:{logged off}</p>

21578,"<p>THE FEMALE STRESS DIET<br /> This is a specially formulated diet designed to help you cope with the stress that builds up during the day:</p>
<p>Breakfast - I grapefruit, I slice whole-wheat toast, I cup of skim milk.</p>
<p>Lunch - Small portion of lean, steamed chicken with a cup of spinach, 1 cup of herbal tea, I Tim Tam.</p>
<p>Afternoon Tea - The rest of the packet of Tim Tams, I tub of Tip Top ice cream with chocolate topping, I jar of Nutella.</p>
<p>Dinner - 4 bottles of red wine, 2 loaves of garlic bread, I family size supreme pizza, 3 Snickers bars.</p>
<p>Late Night Snack - Whole frozen Sarah Lee cheesecake eaten directly from the freezer.</p>
<p>Diet Rules<br /> 1. If no one sees you eat something, it has no calories.</p>
<p>2. When drinking a diet Coke with a chocolate bar, the fat in the  chocolate is cancelled out by the diet Coke.</p>
<p>3. When you eat with someone else, calories don't count if you  do not eat more than they do.</p>
<p>4. Food used for medicinal purposes does NOT count. (For  example: hot chocolate, toast, cheesecake, vodka...)</p>
<p>5. If you fatten up the people around you, you will look thinner.</p>
<p>6. Cinema-related foods have a zero calorie count as they are part of the entertainment package and not counted as food intake. This includes popcorn, Minties, Maltesers, Jaffas and frozen Cokes.</p>
<p>7. Biscuit pieces have no calories because breaking the biscuits up causes calorie leakage.</p>
<p>8. Food licked from knives and spoons has no fat if you are in the process of cooking something.</p>
<p>9. Foods that are the same color have the same amount of fat. Examples are: spinach and peppermint ice cream, apples and red jelly snakes.</p>
<p>10. Chocolate is like a food-color wildcard and may be  substituted for any other color.</p>
<p>11. Anything eaten while standing has no calories due to gravity and the density of the calorie mass.</p>
<p>12. Food consumed from someone else's plate has no fat as it rightfully belongs to the other person and will cling to his/her plate. (Oh, how fat likes to cling!)</p>
<p>And remember: 'STRESSED' SPELT BACKWARDS IS 'DESSERTS'!</p>

21585,"<p>There was once a Scotsman and an Englishman who lived next door to each other. The Scotsman owned a hen and each morning would look in his garden and pick up one of his hen's eggs for breakfast. One day he looked into his garden and saw that the hen had laid an egg in the Englishman's garden. He was about to go next door when he saw the Englishman pick up the egg. The Scotsman ran up to the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged to him because he owned the hen.</p>
<p>The Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property.</p>
<p>They argued for a while until finally the Scotsman said, ""In my family we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I kick you in the balls and time how long it takes you to get back up, then you kick me in the balls and time how long it takes for me to get up; whoever gets up quicker wins the egg.""</p>
<p>The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman found his heaviest pair of boots and put them on. He took a few steps back, then ran toward the Englishman and kicked him as hard as he could in the balls. The Englishman fell to the floor clutching his nuts, howling in agony for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Eventually the Englishman stood up and said, ""Now it's my turn to kick you.""</p>
<p>The Scotsman said, ""Keep the damn egg.""</p>

21588,"<p>Mike Mooney A Yankee was driving through the south when he decided he wanted to buy a pig. He stopped at a pig farm and told the farmer he wanted to buy a 100 pound pig. The farmer nodded, walked out into the sty, bent over and picked up a pig by its tail with his teeth. The farmer said, ""This one will go a little over a 100"".Astonished the Yankee said, ""Who are you trying to fool? You can't weigh a pig that way"". The farmer laughed and called to his young son, ""Boy, come over here and weigh that pig for this man"". The boy obliged by bending over and picking up the pig by its tail with his teeth. Turning to his father the boy said, "" This here pig weighs about 100 pounds"". The Yankee was having no part of this so in order to convince him the farmer told his son to go to the house and get his mother so she could weigh the pig. After a short delay the son returned and said, ""Ma says she will be right down after she's finished weighing the mailman"".</p>

21589,"<p>It is with the saddest heart that I must pass on the following news.</p>
<p>Please join me in remembering a great icon of the entertainment community. The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and complications from repeated pokes in the belly. He was 71.</p>
<p>Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, Little Debbie, and Captain Crunch.</p>
<p>The gravesite was piled high with flours.</p>
<p>Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very ""smart"" cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he still, as a crusty old man, was considered a roll model for millions.</p>
<p>Doughboy is survived by his young wife, Play Dough, two children, John Dough and Jane Dough, plus they had one in the oven. He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart.</p>
<p>The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>This genie, like all genies, was so happy to be freed of the lamp that he granted the guy three wishes.</p>
<p>""I wish to be a dollar richer than Bill Gates, "" says the guy. The genie wasn't sure who Bill Gates was until the guy told him to check Forbes magazine. When the genie called up Forbes from inside the lamp he learned that Bill Gates was indeed the richest man in the world.</p>
<p>""Guy,"" the genie said, ""You will forever be a dollar richer than Bill Gates. What's your second wish.""</p>
<p>""Genie, I want the most expensive Porsche made: Fire engine red, on board GPS and the finest audio system ever installed in an automobile.""</p>
<p>""That's easy, Guy,"" says the genie. He waves his hand and best car anybody had ever seen pops out of the lamp. The genie then asks the guy for his third wish.</p>
<p>The guy mulls the problem over and over. A girl-- nah, with billions and billions of dollars he certainly had become a chick magnet. World peace? Only wackos want that. The guy found a reason not to wish for anything that came to his mind.</p>
<p>""Genie,"" the guy said, ""I can't think of anything now. May I save the third wish for later.""</p>
<p>""Gee, this is most unusual. But you hold the hammer, I can't escape from this lamp until you make a third wish. Call me when you're ready,"" and whoosh the genie disappears into the lamp.</p>
<p>The guy carefully picks up the now-ever-so- valuable lamp and places it in the trunk of the fire engine red Porsche. He turns the radio on to balance the sounds and makes all the other adjustments needed to get his great audio system customized to his ears.</p>
<p>After that, he pulled off the beach and headed south along the Pacific Coast Highway. Soon he was up to 60, then 70, then<br /> 80. The Porsche handled perfectly. The guy was so happy that he began to sing along with the familiar commercial on the radio.</p>

<p>The wolf caught up with them and said ""I'm gonna huff, and puff and blow your house down."" While he was huffing and puffing, the straw pig and the stick pig were so scared! But the brick pig picked up the phone and called a friend. </p>
<p>A few minutes passed and all of a sudden this big black stretch limo drove up. Out came two massive pigs in pin striped suits and fedoras. These huge pigs came over to the wolf and grabbed him by the neck and beat the living shit out of him. Then, One of them pulled out a gun and fired into the wolf's mouth. Then they left the wolf dead, got back into their limo and drove off. The straw pig and the stick pig were amazed!!! They asked the brick pig, ""Who the hell were those guys?"" </p>
<p>And the brick pig said ""Oh, those are my cousins ...the Guinea Pigs.""</p>

21634,"<p>The Bill of No RightsWe, the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to help everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any more riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior and secure the blessings of debt-free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny, guilt-ridden, delusional and other liberal bedwetters.We hold these truths to be self-evident: that a whole lot of people were confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of No Rights.ARTICLE I:You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.ARTICLE II:You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone - not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc., but the world is full of idiots and probably always will be, if there's people like you in it.ARTICLE III:You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful, do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy.ARTICLE IV:You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes.ARTICLE V:You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just not interested in public health care.ARTICLE VI:You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim or kill someone, don't be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair.ARTICLE VII:You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob, cheat or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still won't have the right to a big-screen color TV or a life of leisure.ARTICLE VIII:You don't have the right to demand that our children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience. We hate oppressive governments and won't lift a finger to stop you from going to fight if you'd like; however, we do not enjoy parenting the entire world, and do not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat.ARTICLE IX:You don't have the right to a job. All of us sure want all of you to have one, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful.ARTICLE X:You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you have the right to pursue happiness- which, by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an over abundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>Por diversos motivos que pasaremos a detallar, seg�n las informaciones recabadas, dos terroristas de alg�n lugar del Medio Oriente llegaron a Buenos Aires con la firme determinaci�n de ejecutar 'el castigo de Al� para con los infieles'. Esto no pudo llevarse a cabo. He aqu� la historia y el itinerario seguido por los dos fan�ticos una vez llegados a nuestro pa�s:</p>
<p>Domingo 23:47 h: Llegan a Buenos Aires v�a a�rea desde Uruguay; salen de Aeroparque y toman un taxi. El taxista los marca por el espejo y al ver las caras de boludos que tienen, los pasea por toda la ciudad durante una hora y media. En la esquina de Carabobo y Rivadavia se sube un c�mplice que los afana y los dejan tirados en el Bajo Flores.</p>
<p>Lunes 1:15 h: Cuando logran recuperarse un poco, aparece una barrita de la villa y se produce el siguiente dialogo:</p>
<p>""Che, fierita, dame un peso pa' la birra""</p>
<p>""�...?""</p>
<p>""Dale barbeta, pelotudo. �Tiram� un mango! �O so' sordo, so'...!.</p>
<p>""No habla espa�ol... Yo afgano...""</p>
<p>""�Ah, afgano! Agarr�mela con la mano (al mismo tiempo que empiezan los golpes de pu�o, patadas, codazos, etc.)</p>
<p>Lunes 4:30 h: Al despertar, despu�s de la golpiza, ambos terroristas logran llegar a una remiser�a. Toman un auto por la autopista Ricchieri hacia Ezeiza. Cinco kil�metros antes de llegar los detiene un piquete de empleados de Aerol�neas Argentinas que, junto con los camioneros, empleados judiciales, canillitas, vendedores ambulantes, etc., no les permiti� el paso.</p>
<p>Lunes 7:30 h: Llegan a Ezeiza (�al fin!). Necesitan cambiar plata para moverse m�s tranquilos. �Tienen d�lares y se los cambian por Patacones!</p>
<p>Lunes7:45hs: Intentan abordar un avi�n para hacerlo caer sobre Buenos Aires. Aerol�neas y Austral est�n de paro; los empleados impiden que despegue cualquier otra l�nea a�rea. El �nico avi�n que est� en pista lleva 18 horas de retraso. Los empleados y pasajeros 'acampan' dentro del aeropuerto. Hacen ollas populares. Gritan consignas contra el gobierno; llega Gendarmer�a... Se empiezan a cagar a trompadas, todos contra todos... �Gran quilombo!</p>
<p>Lunes 19:05 h: Al fin se tranquilizan un poco los �nimos. Se acercan al mostrador de Iberia para sacar un pasaje rumbo a Lima, desviarlo y hacerlo estallar (je, je, je). �Pero ninguna l�nea �rea acepta Patacones!</p>
<p>Lunes 19:07 h: A esta altura del d�a, los saboteadores discuten entre si. �No saben si hacer mierda Buenos Aires es un acto terrorista o una obra de caridad!</p>
<p>Lunes 20:30 h: Muertos de fr�o y de hambre van al Mc Donald's de Ezeiza. Piden un Mc Pollo con Frenys y Coca mediana.</p>
<p>Martes 0:35 h: Se recuperan de una infecci�n intestinal en el Hospital Fern�ndez.</p>
<p>Martes 20:00 h: Chiche Gelblung los lleva al programa 'Memoria', junto al m�dico gallego que les hace un tratamiento de cactus mezclado con remolacha y repollo.</p>
<p>Martes 23:42 h: Los tipos rajan del pa�s a trav�s de la 'triple frontera'. Juran por Al� jam�s volver a intentar nada en nuestro 'bendito pa�s'.</p>

21683,"<p>The Geography of a Woman</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>Between the ages of 18 - 21 a woman is like Africa or Australia. She is half discovered, half wild and naturally beautiful with bushland around the fertile deltas.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 21 - 30 a woman is like America or Japan. Completely discovered, very well developed and open to trade especially with countries with cash or cars.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 30 - 35, she is like India or Spain. Very hot, relaxed and convinced of its own beauty.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 35 - 40 a woman is like France or Argentina. She may have been half destroyed during the war but can still be a warm and desirable place to visit.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 40 - 50 she is like Yugoslavia or Iraq. She lost the war and is haunted by past mistakes. Massive reconstruction is now necessary.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 50 - 60 she is like Russia or Canada. Very wide, quiet and the borders are practically unpatrolled but the frigid climate keeps people away.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 60 - 70 a woman is like England or Mongolia. With a glorious and all conquering past but alas no future (a bit like Tony Blair, maybe Blair's a women really).</p>
<p>After 70, they become Albania or Afghanistan. Everyone knows where it is, but no one wants to go there.</p>

I have no idea who the father is.''OK', says the doctor, 'I'll do it for you, but it's most unusual.'The baby begins to be born and the doctor says, 'Here comes the head, it seems to have yellow skin and the eyes are slanted. Was one of the actors Chinese?''Yes, doctor, he was,' says the woman.'Wait,' says the doctor, 'the chest and arms are out and they seem to be very dark. Was one of the actors black?''Yes doctor, he was.''Wait, now the legs are out and they're light brown. Was one of the actors of mixed race?''Yes doctor, he was.'So the doctor pulls the baby free and gives it the traditional slap on the back.

21699,"<p>My three-year-old son, Matt, had a lot of problems with potty<br /> training. One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in<br /> between errands. It was very busy, with a full dining room.</p>
<p>While enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny, so of course<br /> I checked my seven-month-old daughter, and she was clean. Then I<br /> realized that Matt had not asked to go potty in a while, so I<br /> asked him, and he said, ""No.""</p>
<p>I kept thinking, ""Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I<br /> didn't have any clothes with me."" I asked again, ""Matt, are you<br /> sure you did not have an accident?"" ""No,"" he replied. I just<br /> knew that he must have, cause the smell was getting worse.</p>
<p>So, I asked one more time, ""Matt, did you have an accident?""</p>
<p>This time, with a little smirk on his face, he jumped up, yanked<br /> down his pants, bent over and spread his cheeks and yelled, ""See<br /> Mom, it's just gas!!""</p>
<p>While 50 people nearly choked to death on their tacos, he calmly<br /> pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if nothing<br /> happened.

21764,"<p>A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA (Federal Housing Administration) loan<br /> for a client.  He was told that the loan would be granted if he could prove<br /> satisfactory title to property offered as collateral.  The title dated back to<br /> 1803, and he had to spend three months running it down.  After sending the<br /> information to FHA, he got this reply: ""We received your letter today enclosing<br /> application for loan for your client, supported by abstract of title.  Let us<br /> compliment you on the able manner in which you prepared and presented the<br /> application.  However, you have not cleared the title before the year 1802, and<br /> therefore, before final approval can be accorded the application, it will be<br /> necessary that the title be cleared back to that year.""</p>
<p>    Annoyed, the lawyer replied: ""Your letter regarding titles in Case No.<br /> 189156 received.  I note that you wish titles extended further back than I have<br /> presented them.  I was unaware that any educated man in the world failed to<br /> know that Louisiana was purchased from France in 1803.  The title to the land<br /> was acquired by France by right of conquest from Spain.  The land came into<br /> possession of Spain by right of discovery made in 1492 by a sailor named<br /> Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route<br /> to India by the then reigning monarch, Isabella.  The good Queen, being a pious<br /> woman and careful about titles, almost as much I might say, as the FHA, took<br /> the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope for the voyage before she<br /> sold her jewels to help Columbus.  Now the Pope, as you know, is the emissary<br /> of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and God, it is commonly accepted, made the<br /> world.  Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that He also made that part<br /> of the world called Louisiana, and I hope to hell you are satisfied.""</p>

<p>A constant statement was heard by the neighbors who feared the man the most... ""When I die I will dig my way up and out of the grave to come back and haunt you for the rest of your life!""</p>
<p>They believed he practiced black magic and was responsible for missing cats and dogs, and strange sounds at all hours. He was feared and enjoyed the respect it garnished.</p>
<p>He died abruptly under strange circumstances and the funeral had a closed casket. After the burial, the wife went straight to the local bar and began to party as if there was no tomorrow. The gaiety of her actions were becoming extreme while her neighbors approached in a group to ask these questions:</p>
<p>Are you not afraid? Concerned? Worried? That this man who practiced black magic and stated when he died he would dig his way up and out of the grave to come back and haunt you for the rest of your life?</p>

21780,"<p>A hip young man goes out and buys the best car available:  a 1996<br />      Turbo BeepBeep.  It is the best and most expensive car in the world,<br />      and it runs him $500,000.  He takes it out for a spin and, while doing<br />      so, stops for a red light.</p>
<p>     An old man on a moped (both looking about 90 years old) pulls up next<br />      to him.  The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the car<br />      and asks, ""What kind of car ya' got there, sonny?""</p>
<p>     The young many replies ""A 1996 Turbo BeepBeep.  They cost $500,000.""</p>
<p>     ""That's a lot of money!"" says the old man, shocked.  ""Why does it cost<br />      so much?""</p>
<p>     ""Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!"" states the cool<br />      dude proudly.</p>
<p>     The moped driver asks, ""Can I take a look inside?""</p>
<p>     ""Sure"" replies the owner.</p>
<p>     So, the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.<br />      Leaning back on his moped, the old man says ""That's a pretty nice car,<br />      all right!""  Just then the light changes, so the guy decides to show<br />      the old man what his car can do.  He floors it, and within 30 seconds<br />      the speedometer reads 320 mph.</p>
<p>     Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror.  It seems to be<br />      getting closer!  He slows down to see what it could be and suddenly,<br />      whhooossshhh! Something whips by him, going much faster!""</p>
<p>     ""What on earth could be going faster than my Turbo BeepBeep?"" the<br />      young man asks himself.</p>
<p>     Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot coming toward him. Whooosshh!<br />      It goes by again!  And, it almost looked like the old man on the<br />      moped!</p>
<p>     ""Couldn't be,"" thinks the guy.  ""How could a moped outrun a Turbo<br />      BeepBeep?""</p>
<p>     Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whoooshka-BbblaMMM! It<br />      plows into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end.</p>
<p>     The young man jumps out, and Jesus to Betsy, it IS the old man!!! Of<br />      course, the moped and the old man are hurting for certain.  He runs up<br />      to the dying old man and says, ""You're hurt bad!  Is there anything I<br />      can do for you?""</p>
<p>     The old man groans and replies ""Yes.  Unhook my suspenders from your<br />      side-view mirror!""</p>

21791,"<p>A young mother was having a consultation with a doctor. As they spoke, her Little Johnny could clearly be heard terrorizing the people in the waiting room - yet she made no attempt to restrain him. Soon they heard some clattering in an adjoining room, but still she did nothing. Finally, after an extra-loud crash, the woman casually told the doctor, ""I hope you don't mind my Little Johnny playing in there."" ""No, not at all,"" said the doctor calmly. ""Not at all.

21792,"<p>A few months ago, there was an opening with the CIA for an assassin. </p>
<p>These highly classified positions are hard to fill, and there's a lot of testing and background checks involved before you can even be considered for the position.  After sending some applicants through the background checks, training and testing, they narrowed the possible choices down to two men and a woman, but only one position was available.</p>
<p>The day came for the final test to see which person would get the extremely secretive job. The CIA men administering the test took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun.</p>
<p>""We must know that you will follow our instructions whatever the circumstances,"" they explained.</p>
<p>""Inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair.  Take this gun and kill her.""</p>
<p>The man looked horrified and said, ""You can't be serious!  I could never shoot my wife!""   ""Well,"" said the CIA man, ""you're definitely not the right man for this job then.""</p>
<p>So they brought the second man to the same door and handed him a gun.</p>
<p>""We must know that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances,"" they explained to the second man.</p>
<p>""Inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair.  Take this gun and kill her.""</p>
<p>The second man looked a bit shocked, but nevertheless took the gun and went in the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes; then the door opened.  The man came out of the room with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>""I tried to shoot her; I just couldn't pull the trigger and shoot my wife.  I guess I'm not the right man for the job.""</p>
<p>""No,"" the CIA man replied, ""You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.""</p>
<p>Now they only had the woman left to test. They led her to the same door to the same room and handed her the same gun.</p>
<p>""We must be sure that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances;this is your final test.  Inside you will find your husband sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill him.""</p>

Then all hell broke loose in the room. They heard screaming, crashing,and banging on the walls.  This went on for several minutes; then all went quiet.  </p>
<p>The door opened slowly, and there stood the woman.  She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks.  I had to beat the son of a bitch to death with the chair!""</p>

<p>""Iiss ttthere aaannnyytthing tthat yyou ccan dddooo ttoo ffixxx iiit?"", asked the man.</p>
<p>""I can surgically remove about 8 inches,"" replied the doctor.</p>

<p>So the doc goes through with the opperation, and his stuttering stops. Two months later, the man comes back to the doctor's office with a question.</p>
<p>""Hey doc, the operation helped my stuttering, but my sex life sucks. Can you reverse the operation?""</p>

21847,"<p>Occasionally, airline attendants make an effort to make the ""in-flight safety<br /> lecture"" and their other announcements a bit more entertaining. Here are some<br /> real examples that have been heard or reported:</p>
<p>""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of<br /> this airplane..."" </p>
<p>Pilot - ""Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now, so I am going to<br /> switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as you wish, but please<br /> stay inside the plane till we land ... it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk<br /> on the wings it affects the flight pattern."" </p>
<p>And, after landing: ""Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you<br /> enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride."" </p>
<p>As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone<br /> voice comes over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella. WHOA!"" </p>
<p>After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis, a flight<br /> attendant on a Northwest flight announced: ""Please take care when opening the<br /> overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as Hell<br /> everything has shifted."" </p>
<p>From a Southwest Airlines employee.... ""Welcome aboard Southwest Flight XXX to<br /> YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull<br /> tight. It works just like every other seatbelt, and if you don't know how to<br /> operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event<br /> of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling.<br /> Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a small<br /> child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you<br /> are traveling with two small children, decide now which one you love more. </p>
<p>Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but they'll<br /> try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves<br /> you, or your money, more than Southwest Airlines."" </p>
<p>""As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all of your belongings.<br /> Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants.<br /> Please do not leave children or spouses."" </p>
<p>""Last one off the plane must clean it."" </p>
<p>And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""We are pleased to have some of<br /> the best flight attendants in the industry ...Unfortunately none of them are on<br /> this flight...! </p>
<p>Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake City:<br /> The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, ""That was quite a bump and I<br /> know what ya'll are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airline's<br /> fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendants'<br /> fault.....it was the asphalt!"" </p>
<p>Another flight Attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask you<br /> to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal."" </p>
<p>After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant came on<br /> with, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and<br /> the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate.<br /> And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we'll<br /> open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal. </p>
<p>Part of a Flight Attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you<br /> folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go<br /> blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of<br /> us here at US Airways.""</p>

21848,"<p>An Ohio State University mortician student walked into the<br /> embalming room where a cadaver was lying on the table. Confident<br /> that he knew enough now to begin the procedure without his<br /> instructor, he began to examine the body. When he rolled it<br /> over, he was shocked to see a cork in the man's butt. Mystified,<br /> he pulled it out and immediately heard the University of<br /> Michigan fight song come out of the guy's butt.</p>
<p>Shaken by what had happened, he quickly shoved the cork back<br /> into it's original resting place. He then ran to get his<br /> instructor, nervously shouting, ""Sir, you must come, you won't<br /> believe what I discovered!!""</p>
<p>Annoyed by the interruption, the professor said, ""Let's take a<br /> look at this astounding discovery.""</p>
<p>When they entered the morgue, the teacher was also surprised to<br /> see the cork, so he approached the table and promptly removed<br /> the cork.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the University of Michigan fight song, he quickly<br /> replaced the cork in the cadaver's butt and said, ""What's so<br /> surprising about that? I've heard thousands of assholes sing<br /> that song!""</p>

21856,"<p>En cierta ocasi�n se hizo un concurso entre los mejores arqueros del mundo. Ya llegada la final s�lo quedaban tres competidores: uno de Suiza, otro de Inglaterra y por �ltimo, sepa c�mo le hizo, pero estaba un mexicano. Como en la �ltima prueba los tres finalistas estaban empatados, los jueces decidieron aumentar el grado de dificultad y ahora se trataba de poner alguna fruta en la cabeza de un ni�o que estar�a a 50 m de distancia y luego disparar con el arco y acertar en ella.</p>
<p>Primero va el ingl�s y �ste coge una sand�a y se la pone al ni�o en la cabeza; prepara su arco. Se siembra un silencio total en todo el estadio. Dispara y acierta partiendo en dos la fruta. Se lleva una gran ovaci�n del p�blico. Terminado su turno, coge el micr�fono y presumiendo a todo mundo se presenta:</p>
<p>""I'm Robin Hood"".</p>
<p>Toca turno al suizo, pero �ste en vez de una sand�a coge  una manzana y la coloca en la cabeza del ni�o. Entonces, un silencio enorme se apodera del estadio. La gente est� sorprendida, ya que la manzana es muy peque�a. El arquero cogi� su arco, apunt� y con un disparo certero le da justo en el centro parti�ndola en cuatro partes. El estadio explota con una gran ovaci�n. Y tambi�n, una vez terminado su turno, agarr� el micr�fono y presumi� a todo mundo:</p>
<p>""I'm Guillermo Tell"".</p>
<p>Por �ltimo, el m�s freg�n de todos: el grandioso y majestuoso mexicano. Quien arras� con todos sus contrincantes en las otras fases y es recibido con una estruendosa ovaci�n cuanto toca su turno. De su bolsa, el competidor saca un objeto y lo pone en la cabeza del ni�o. Intrigados, los espectadores se preguntaban qu� era esa bolita roja que se ve�a a lo lejos. Gracias a las pantallas gigantes que hab�a en el estadio, pudieron ver que se trataba de una min�scula cereza que apenas se pod�a ver en la cabeza del ni�o. Para hacer m�s dif�cil la prueba, coloca al ni�o a 100 m de distancia. Esta vez se siente un silencio sepulcral en el estadio. Ni un respiro se o�a. Nada. Como si estuviera solo, el mexicano coge su arco, apunta, dispara la flecha que se va viajando a m�s de 100 Km/h... �Zas! La flecha se clava justamente en medio de la frente, atraves�ndole la cabeza al ni�o. El mexicano coge el micr�fono y dice:</p>
<p>""I'm Sorry"".</p>

<p>3) Tire -- Male, because it goes bald and it's often overinflated. </p>
<p>4) Hot Air Balloon -- Male, because, to get it to go anywhere, you have to light a fire under it, and of course, there's the hot air part. </p>
<p>5) Sponges -- Female, because they're soft, squeezable and retain water. </p>
<p>6) Web Page -- Female, because it's always getting hit on. </p>
<p>7) Subway -- Male, because it uses the same old lines to pick people up. </p>
<p>8) Hourglass -- Female, because over time, the weight shifts to the bottom. </p>

21897,"<p>This is a bricklayer's accident report. which was printed in the<br /> Newsletter of the New Zealand equivalent of the Worker's Compensation Board. This is a TRUE story. Had this guy died, he'd have walked away with a Darwin Award. The letter begins:</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block 3 of the accident report form. I put ""Poor Planning"" as the cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient.</p>
<p>I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working<br /> alone on the roof of a new six-storey building.</p>
<p>When I completed my work, I found I had some bricks left over, which, when weighed later were found to be slightly in excess of 500lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor.</p>
<p>Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks.</p>
<p>You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135 lbs. Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the fractured skull; minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed on Section 3 of the accident report form.</p>
<p>Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the<br /> fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep in the pulley. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.</p>
<p>At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the<br /> building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up.</p>
<p>This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe<br /> lacerations of my legs and lower body. Here my luck began to change<br /> slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.</p>
<p>I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in<br /> pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me.</p>
<p>This explains the two broken legs. I hope this answers your inquiry.</p>

21907,"<p>'Road sex' blamed for mystery crashesby David Williams, Motoring CorrespondentA deadly new syndrome is stalking the highways and byways of the world, according to a new report today -- ''road sex''.It is claimed that the phenomenon could explain scores of mystery road crashes each year.A national poll in Australia has revealed that almost half the drivers questioned are guilty of road sex -- indulging in sexual fantasies or ''sexual anger'' while behind the wheel.Research suggests that after drink-driving, the second biggest killer on Australian roads is lack of concentration, often caused by those fantasies.The finding emerged during a four-year study into driver behaviour and the state of the mind immediately preceding a crash. Forty-two per cent of those surveyed admitted to indulging in sexual fantasies or experiencing ''sexual anger'' while out on the road.Psychologist John Cheetham, who analysed the research for an insurance firm, said: ''Sexual frustration and irritability go together. But irritability and motor vehicles are not compatible.''If we can get into the mind of the driver in the hours leading up to an accident, we might hold the key to more effective driver education and road- accident prevention.''RAC spokesman Edmund King said there was hope for British drivers. ''We do not feel that the typical UK driver has enough time to get lost in sexual fantasies on the road,'' he said.''In the UK the emotions that spill over tend to be frustration, anger and 'road rage' aimed at other drivers.''Perhaps the freedom of the Australian highway is more conducive to sexual fantasies than the congested UK motorways.''</p>

He was hoping he could get a special rooster-one that service all of his many hens and when he told this to the market vendor, the vendor replied: 'I have just the rooster for you. Ricky here is the horniest rooster you will ever see!'           So the farmer took Ricky back to the farm. Before setting him loose in the hen house though, he gave Ricky a little pep talk. 'Ricky,' he said, 'I'm counting on you to do your stuff.' And without a word he strutted into the hen house.           Ricky was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a thunderbolt. There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Ricky had finished having his way with each hen. But Ricky didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one and still at the same frantic pace. Then he went to the pig house, where he did the same. The farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out, 'Stop, Ricky, you'll kill yourself.' But Ricky continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.           The next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Ricky lying there on his lawn. His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue hanging out. A buzzard was already circling above Ricky.           The farmer walked up to Ricky saying, 'Oh you poor thing, look what you did, you've gone and killed yourself. I warned you my little buddy.'           'Shhhhh,' Ricky whispered, 'The buzzard's getting closer</p>

<p>One day, the wife was talking to a friend about her husband's behavior and was<br /> particularly distraught by it all.</p>

<p>""200 points out of 100 points possible?"" he asks himself. ""How can that be?"" </p>
<p>So he calls the licensing board and they tell him: ""You see sir, you received 50 points for taking the engine apart perfectly, 50 points for putting the engine back perfectly, and 100 EXTRA points for doing it all through the muffler.""</p>

Sip some soda up and spray it on the person next to you. Pretend nothing happened.2. Don't go to the dining hall.  Live there and never leave.  When people come in, harass for news of the outside world and tell them how the dining hall needs new ketchup.3. Before eating, say grace.  Punctuate by slamming your face into your food.4. After obtaining your food, proceed to throw it out the nearest window.  Turn to the person nearest to you and say, ""Wow!  Did you ever see [name of dish] fly like that before?""5. Hide behind the milk dispenser.  Moo every time someone gets milk.6. Go up to the server and ask to see the chef.  After he/she is introduced, request an off-the-menu meal consisting of lightly blackened escargot, a simmering seafood bisque, a delicately roasted rack of lamb in a basil cream sauce, and a tart but not sweet dessert of his/her own concoction.  When he or she refuses, punch them and proceed to make this meal yourself.7. After finishing your meal, look at your brand of china.  Proceed to look at everyone else's, regardless of whether they're finished eating or not.  Complain how the school is too cheap to buy some real Wedgewood china.  Then dump your dishes and waste food in the trash and explain how it would be cheaper to buy new dishes than to wash the old ones.8. During the meal, start a conversation about the innocence of Jeffrey Dahmer.  Then look at everybody's limbs with a marked amount of interest.  Then ""involuntarily"" drool.9. Stand in line for the food.  After getting your food, smear it over your clothes and return to the end of the line.  Repeat.10. Complain how cold it is in the dining hall--to every person in the dining hall.</p>

But the crowd's<br /> laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon<br /> and six drops fell into the glass.

As the crowd cheers, the bartender reasons to himself that no one would come in and do that twice, and that the man probably has the money for the previous night, so he passes out the shots and knocks one back himself. ""Ok, that's $80 for last night, and $63 for tonight,"" The man replies, ""I don't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, sorry to say."" The bartender, enraged at this, smashes the man in the head over and over as he drags him to the door and again throws him roughly into the street.
