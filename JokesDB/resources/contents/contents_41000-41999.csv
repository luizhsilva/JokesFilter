<p>""Oh. Well...after that, we bounced back and prospered...I guess I should thank you for that. You saved my business. Is there anything else?"" </p>

<p>The owner says ""Well, the parrot knows how to do legal research."" The customer then asks about the next parrot, to be told that this one costs $1,000 because it can do everything the other parrot can do plus it knows how to write a brief that will win any case. </p>
<p>Naturally, the increasingly startled customer asks about the third parrot, to be told that it costs $4,000. Needless to say, this begs the question, ""What can it do?"" </p>

41015,"<p>On a farm the was a horse and a chicken who were friends. One<br /> day they were mucking around on the farm in a paddock where<br /> there was a big deep hole, which the horse fell into.</p>
<p>""Help me"" neigh the horse.</p>
<p>""OK I'll go get the farmer."" Clucked the chicken. And so the<br /> chicken went to get the farmer but he could not be found. So he<br /> went into the barn and got into the farmers new BMW and drove<br /> out to the horse, put a rope around the horse and pulled him out<br /> of the hole.</p>
<p>The next day not having learned the lesson the horse and the<br /> chicken were playing near the hole again. But this time the<br /> chicken fell in.</p>
<p>""Help me"" clucked the chicken, but instead of running to get the<br /> farmers car the horse lowered his cock into the hole and picked<br /> up the chick.</p>

41016,"<p>One of the nation's largest soup manufacturers announced today that they will be stocking America's shelves this week with their newest Soup creation, ""Clinton Soup"", that will honor one of the nation's most distinguished men. It consists primarily of a small weenie in hot water! </p>
<p>Chrysler Corporation is adding a new car to its line to honor Bill Clinton. The Dodge Drafter will begin production in Canada this year. </p>
<p>When Clinton was asked what he thought about foreign affairs, he replied: ""I don't know, I never had one."" </p>
<p>If you came across Bill Clinton struggling in a raging river and you had a choice between rescuing him or getting a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph, what shutter speed would you use?<br /> Chelsea asked her dad, ""Do all fairy tales begin with once upon a time?""<br /> Bill Clinton replied, ""No, some begin with 'After I'm elected'."" </p>
<p>Clinton's mother prayed fervently that Bill would grow up and be president. So far, half of her prayer has been answered. </p>
<p>American Indians have nicknamed Bill Clinton as ""Walking Eagle"" because he is so full of crap he can't fly. </p>
<p>Clinton only lacks three things to become one of America's finest leaders: integrity, vision, and wisdom. </p>
<p>Clinton is doing the work of three men: Larry, Curly, and Moe. </p>

<p>""Would you like to go to Frank's Place and have a beer?"" </p>
<p>No answer. This bothered him a bit So a few minutes later he<br /> again asked him: ""How about going to the bar and having a drink<br /> with me?"" </p>
<p>Again... no answer. He asked him one more time: ""Hey, would you<br /> like to go &amp; have a drink with me?"" </p>

When she gets back, Dad asked, ""Well how much did you give the boy this time?""""Oh, I wrote two checks, one for $20, and the other for $1,000 out to him.""""That's $1020!!!"" yelled Dad, ""Are you going crazy???""""Don't worry hon,"" Mom said, kissed Dad on the on top of his bald head, ""I taped the $20 check to the cover of his book, but I put the $1,000 one somewhere between the pages in chapter 15!""</p>

<p>The novice teed up and smacked the ball straight down the fairway and onto the green, where it stopped inches from the hole. </p>
<p>""Now what?"" the fellow asked the speechless pro. </p>

41037,"<p>At a trial, an attorney was putting witnesses through an exacting<br /> cross-examination, and was taking great delight into forcing witnesses to admit<br /> that they did not remember every single detail of an automobile accident. While<br /> the lawyer knew that no witness has a perfect memory, he had honed a skill in<br /> exploiting minor inconsistencies and lapses of memory in order to challenge the<br /> credibility of honest witnesses. After a series of scathing cross-examinations,<br /> he was looking forward to his examination of yet another witness.</p>
<p>""Did you actually see the accident?"" he asked.</p>
<p>The witness responded with a polite, ""Yes, sir.""</p>
<p>""How far away were you when the accident happened?""</p>
<p>""I was Thirty-four feet, seven and three quarter�s inches away from the point<br /> of collision.""</p>
<p>""Thirty-four feet, seven and three quarter inches?"" the lawyer asked,<br /> sarcastically, ""Do you expect us to believe that your memory is so good, and<br /> your sense of distance is so precise, that months after the accident you can<br /> come into court and give that type of detail?""</p>
<p>The witness was unphased. ""Sir, I had a hunch that some obnoxious, know-it-all<br /> lawyer would ask me the distance, and would try to make it seem like I was lying<br /> if I could not give an exact answer. So I got a tape measure, and measured out<br /> the exact distance.""</p>

41048,"<p>And we thought some of OUR laws were strange...</p>
<p>Most Middle Eastern countries recognize the following Islamic law: ""After<br /> having sexual relations with a lamb, it is a mortal sin to eat its flesh.""<br /> (umm OK, I'm sure the lamb appreciates that one)</p>
<p>In Lebanon, men are legally allowed to have sex with animals, but the<br /> animals must be female. Having sexual relations with a male animal is<br /> punishable by death. (OK, like THAT makes sense...)</p>
<p>In Bahrain, a male doctor may legally examine a woman's genitals, but is<br /> forbidden from looking directly at them during the examination. He may<br /> only see their reflection in a mirror. (Ouch!)</p>
<p>Muslims are banned from looking at the genitals of a corpse. This also<br /> applies to undertakers; the sex organs of the deceased must be covered<br /> with a brick or a piece of wood at all times. (...a brick?)</p>
<p>The penalty for masturbation in Indonesia is capitation. (Wonder how they<br /> enforce that one?)</p>
<p>There are men in Guam whose full-time job is to travel the countryside and<br /> deflower young virgins, who pay them for the privilege of having sex for<br /> the first time. Reason: under Guam law, it is expressly forbidden for<br /> virgins to marry. (Now let's just think for a minute...is there any job<br /> anywhere else in the world that even comes close to this?)</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, a betrayed wife is legally allowed to kill her adulterous<br /> husband, but may only do so with her bare hands. (The husband's lover, on<br /> the other hand, may be killed in any manner desired. COOL)</p>
<p>Topless saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England, but only in tropical<br /> fish stores. (Of course!)</p>
<p>In Cali, Colombia, a woman may only have sex with her husband, and the<br /> first time this happens her mother must be in the room to witness the act.<br /> (I shudder at the thought. How many of us would be virgins today?)</p>
<p>In Santa Cruz, Bolivia it is illegal for a man to have sex with a woman<br /> and her daughter at the same time. (We have to presume this was a big<br /> enough problem that they had to pass this law...)</p>
<p>In Maryland, it is illegal to sell condoms from vending machines with one<br /> exception: prophylactics may be dispensed from a vending machine only ""in<br /> places where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on the<br /> premises."" (Is this a great country or what?)</p>

41070,"<p>A couple went golfing one day at a very, very exclusive course lined with million-dollar homes. On the third tee, the husband cautioned,<br /> 'Honey, be careful when you drive. If we break one of those windows it'll cost us a fortune to repair.'</p>
<p>Of course, she teed off and promptly shanked it right through the window of the biggest house on the course.</p>
<p>The husband cringed.<br /> 'I warned you to watch out. Now we'll have to go up there and apologize and see how much that lousy drive is going to cost.'</p>
<p>They walked up, knocked on the door, and a warm voice said,<br /> 'Come on in.'</p>
<p>When they opened the door they saw glass all over the place and a broken bottle lying on its side near the broken window. A man reclining on the couch said,<br /> 'Are you the people that broke the window?'</p>
<p>'Uh yeah, we're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.</p>
<p>'0H!, no apology is necessary. </p>
<p>Actually I want to thank you. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years.</p>
<p>'Now that you've released me I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, and I'll keep the last one for myself.'</p>
<p>'Wow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'</p>
<p>'No problem, it's the least I can do. And you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie said looking at the wife.</p>
<p>'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world,' she said.</p>
<p>'Consider it done,' the genie said.</p>
<p>'And what's your wish, genie?' they asked in unison.</p>
<p>'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle and haven't had sex with a woman in a thousand years, my wish is to sleep with your wife.'</p>

<p>She mulled it over for a few moments and said,<br /> 'Considering all that, I guess I wouldn't mind.'</p>

"
41071,"<p>U.S. TO BEGIN BOMBING ENGLAND UNLESS PEACE ACCORD IS RATIFIED BY ENGLAND AND<br /> BREAKAWAY PROVINCE OF N. IRELAND </p>
<p>The White House -- President Clinton announced today that an all out bombing<br /> offensive against England will begin in two weeks, unless a peace accord is<br /> ratified by England and its breakaway province of Northern Ireland. Along with<br /> liberating Northern Ireland, the President said that all British culinary<br /> institutes would be fair game for bombing. After the attack, NATO peace keeping<br /> troops will be sent in to ensure that all dentists can operate safely and<br /> without the threat of attack. </p>
<p>""Using the fine logic we crafted in the Kosovo intervention, we have decided<br /> to add, incrementally, to the list of peace initiatives around the world,"" he<br /> said in a prepared statement. </p>
<p>A background briefing indicated that on a weekly schedule, the Clinton<br /> administration would intervene in the following areas: </p>
<p>Week one -- Bombing of England to free Northern Ireland, and to destroy the<br /> legendarily bad cuisine fabrication facilities. </p>
<p>Week two -- Bombing of Ankara, Baghdad and Teheran to free the Kurds. Oh yeah,<br /> let us not forget all of the oil reserves we would gain. </p>
<p>Week three -- Bombing of several random African countries to stop the Hutus<br /> from killing Tutsis. </p>
<p>Week four -- Bombing of both Istanbul and Athens to solve the Cyprus problem,<br /> and end the argument over whether Socrates was actually homosexual or not. </p>
<p>Week five -- Bombing of Madrid to free the Basque Country, also to shut up the<br /> people at PETA because one target would be the bull fighting rings. </p>
<p>Week six -- Bombing of Ottawa to free the Quebecois. </p>
<p>Week seven -- Bombing of Jakarta to free the Timor Islands. </p>
<p>Week eight -- Bombing of Switzerland because it is due time that they were<br /> bullied. </p>
<p>Week nine -- Bombing of Paris to free Corsica, and those wishing to use<br /> deodorant and razors. </p>
<p>Week ten -- Bombing of Washington, DC to free the Confederate of Southern<br /> States, held captive for 139 years, and to free up more Senate seats for Hillary<br /> to possibly run for. </p>
<p>Week eleven -- Bombing of North Dakota so that South Dakota might finally be<br /> recognized as a ""real"" state. </p>
<p>""This schedule will do until we can come up with others,"" said Madeline<br /> Albright, Secretary of State. When asked whether or not the US would bomb<br /> Beijing in order to free Tibet she responded, ""Something that practical would<br /> never be on a military agenda.""</p>

St. Peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the reading room and library, the observation room, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a huge room full of clocks.The guy asks, ""What's up with these clocks?""St. Peter explains, ""Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged.""The guy thinks that this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks are going faster than others. He asks why that is?St. Peter explains, ""Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds his clock.""This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, ""What's the story with that clock?""""Oh, that,"" St. Peter replies, ""That's OJ Simpson's clock.

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, John volunteered, ""I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just roommates."" About a week later, Julie came to John and said, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. ""You don't suppose she took it, do you?"" Julie said, ""Well, I doubt it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure."" So he sat down and wrote: ""Dear Mother, I'm not saying you 'did' take a gravy ladle from my house, and I'm not saying you 'did not' take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner."" Several days later, John received a letter from his mother which read: ""Dear Son, I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Julie, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now. Love, Mom""</p>

41095,"<p>An attractive woman entered a pet shop. When the clerk offered assistance, she explained that she was recently divorced, and was looking for a small-ish dog for company.</p>
<p>The clerk explained that the name of the store was 'Exotic Pets' and that, unfortunately, they did not stock cats, dogs, fish or any commonplace pets.</p>
<p>He did say, however, that he had something which might be ideal. He took the woman into a back room. He walked over to a terrarium, and pointed proudly to a large bullfrog which sat inside it.</p>
<p>""Would that suit your needs?"" he asked.</p>
<p>The woman answered, scornfully, that she hardly thought an amphibian would be a suitable companion.</p>
<p>""Ah,"" replied the salesman, leering, ""but this 'amphibian' has been carefully trained ... to perform oral sex upon women.""</p>
<p>At this the woman's eyes lit up.She eagerly negotiated a price of  $500 for the frog, and left with it in her expectant possession. Arriving home, she drew a bubble bath, poured a glass of champagne and relaxed in anticipation. When she was thoroughly mellow, she dried herself, and arranged herself, nude, upon her bed. Parting her thighs, she placed the frog between them, closed her eyes, and waited.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. She prodded the frog. Still nothing. She moved it Up further toward her body. Nothing. She ordered it to perform. No response.</p>
<p>After an hour of this frustration, she lifted the phone, and called the pet shop. When the clerk answered, she complained loudly that she had been cheated. The clerk apologized profusely, wrote down her address, and said he'd be right over.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, he knocked on the door, and the woman answered, wearing a nightgown. He asked her to demonstrate the problem. She obliged, by disrobing and assuming her former position, with the frog in place. The frog made no movement.</p>
<p>""You see?"" she asked, petulantly.<br /> ""Yes, I do,"" said the man.<br /> Then, addressing the frog as he removed his necktie and shirt, he said, ""Now, I'm only going to show you this one more time...""</p>

41096,"<p>A burglar broke into a house one night. He shined his flashlight around, looking for valuables, and when he picked up a CD player to place in his sack, a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying, ""Jesus is watching you.""</p>
<p>He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight out, and froze. When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, promised himself a vacation after the next big score, then clicked the light back on and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard, ""Jesus is watching you.""</p>
<p>Freaked out, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot. ""Did you say that?"" He hissed at the parrot.</p>
<p>""Yep,"" the parrot confessed, then squawked, ""I'm just trying to warn you.""</p>
<p>The burglar relaxed. ""Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?""</p>
<p>""Moses,"" replied the bird.</p>
<p>""Moses?"" the burglar laughed. ""What kind of stupid people would name a parrot Moses?""</p>

41098,"<p>This American golf fanatic always dreamed of playing at st. Andrews, and<br /> finally got the chance. Going with his wife, they teed off and he proceeded to<br /> play the best game of his life. After 9 holes, he was 5 strokes under par, and<br /> was on cloud nine. On the back nine, he started playing even better, even<br /> getting an eagle on the 16th hole. </p>
<p>He was so excited that he ended up slicing the shot on the 17th tee, and as he<br /> walked up to it, saw that his ball was behind a small shack for the<br /> groundskeepers. </p>
<p>Now he started to worry that his score would go up, but his caddy came up to<br /> him and said ""sir, this may sound like a tough shot, but if you put it through<br /> that window, the ball should go through the window on the other side, and if<br /> you're lucky, the ball will roll onto the green. The way you've played today, I<br /> think you can make it."" </p>

<p>As at his ball lying there behind the shack, his caddy says ""sir, the way<br /> you've been playing, why not try a trick shot. Some of the other caddies say if<br /> you can get it through that window, it will follow through the one opposite it<br /> and roll onto the green."" </p>

41122,"<p>How To Be A Cultist:Recently, the Society For Evil Overlords has noticed a regrettabledecline in the availability and quality of fanatical henchmen, evilpriests, and willing sacrificial victims. We wish to correct thisgrowing problem by submitting the following general guidelines forCultists.1.  Pick one faith and stay with it.  Dilettantism is the mark ofthe amateur.  2.  Avoid needless embarrassment.  Practice the correctpronunciation of your deity+s name in the privacy of your own roombefore chanting it in public.  Flash cards are often helpful.  3.  Never invoke anything bigger than your head.  4.  Avoid all cabalistic jewelry over ten pounds in weight+ itattracts unwelcome attention from tourists, policemen, varioussupernatural creatures, and can be downright dangerous duringthunderstorms.  5.  Citronella candles may not be used in rituals.  I cannot stressthis enough.  Pastel-colored candles in the shape of cute animals arelike beacons to the Powers of Darkness.  6.  Always keep your kit with you: candles, chalk, incense, silverknife, Thuggee cord,  service revolver, garlic, Yellow Sign, cab fare,condoms, and change.  7.  NEVER be the cultist that goes to rough up the hero(es).Ransacking hotel rooms is probably safe, but going +round to beat upthe good guys is a sure route to the bottom of the Thames.  8.  When the Black Mass goes awry, stay away from the Evil Priest.Enraged demons always go for the pompous.9.  Don't gloat.10.  If you can't resist gloating, don't reveal your plans.11.  If you do gloat and reveal your plans, don+t leave the hero(es)to die slowly. They don+t.12.  If you gloat, reveal your plans, and leave the hero(es) to dieslowly, don+t have the audacity to look surprised when they turn up atthe last moment to foil your evil plot.13.  The hero (or heroes) will always show up at the last possiblemoment to foil your plans.  With this in mind, start half an hourearly+they hate that.14.  Plan ahead by selecting ceremonial robes that are easy to run inwhile still affording ample concealment.15.  Never screw anything whose genetic structure you are notabsolutely comfortable with.16.  Never admit to screwing anything whose genetic structure you arenot absolutely comfortable with.17.  When a religious artifact begins emitting light, CLOSE YOUREYES.Thousands of cultists could be saved every year if they+d justremember this simple safety tip.18.  When mutilating cattle, avoid the ones with testicles.19.  During ritual sacrificing, taking bits home for later is nowgenerally considered -bad form.-20.  Blood tests are now required for all sacrificial victims beforethe ritual.  The effects of HIV+ offerings on the average maleficdeity have never been witnessed by anyone living, or even intact.21.  Contrary to historical belief, drugs and invocations do not mix.When the shit comes down, it is vitally necessary to be able todiscern between the gibbering monstrosity to throw the holy water onand the gibbering monstrosity that will fade away after a few hours,some B-complex, and a good hot bath.22.  Never play strip Tarot.23.  Piety and belief are powerful things,  and few forces in naturecan stand against one who is true to his faith, his God, and his ownsoul. However, it is also true that the Gods tend to side with theheaviest artillery, so be prepared change sides at the drop of a hat.24.  For those situations where a fresh, living sacrifice is just notfeasible (or even possible), the lower ranks of demons can be fooledby microwaving a previously-frozen chunk of ex-victim and cleverlyjiggling it.  However, a mock victim sculpted from Spam + is rightout.</p>

41148,"<p>An elderly man lay dying in his bed. In death's final agony, as<br /> he started to slip away, he suddenly smelled the aroma of his<br /> favorite chocolate chip cookies wafting up the stairs.<br /> He gathered his remaining strength and lifted himself from the<br /> bed.<br /> Leaning against the wall, he slowly made his way out of the<br /> bedroom, and with even greater effort forced himself down the<br /> stairs. Gripping the railing with both hands, he crawled<br /> downstairs defying the pull of Morpheus. </p>

Were it not for the immense pain caused by his<br /> extreme exertions, he would have thought himself already in<br /> heaven for there spread out upon waxed paper on the kitchen<br /> table - were hundreds of his favorite chocolate chip cookies. </p>

Or was it one final act of heroic love from his<br /> devoted wife, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man?<br /> Mustering one great final effort, with tears in his eyes, he<br /> threw himself toward the table, landing on his knees in a<br /> rumpled posture. His parched lips parted: the wondrous taste of<br /> the sweet biscuit was already mentally in his mouth, seemingly<br /> bringing him back to life. He felt renewed strength pulsate<br /> through his body. </p>

<p>He got the job and the priest gave him scriptures to copy. He found out that he was copying from a copy and asked why he couldn't copy from the originals because somebody could have made a mistake while copying.</p>
<p>The priest replied, ""Because the originals are too valuable."" So the monk asked if he could at least see the originals and the priest agreed to just let him see them.</p>
<p>The priest took the monk down to the vaults where all of the original scriptures were, showed them to the monk, and left him to his silence. The priest was waiting by the door for about an hour and finally decided to go check on the monk.</p>

Okay, I'll keep my end of the deal. Take your pick of my herd.''The blonde carefully considered the entire herd and finally picked one that was by far cuter and more playful than any of the others.When she was done, the goatherder turned to her and said, ''Okay, now I have a proposition for you.

41200,"<p>A language instructor was explaining to her class that French nouns, unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically designated as masculine or feminine. Things like 'chalk' or 'pencil,' she described, would have a gender association although in English, these words were of neutral gender. </p>
<p>Puzzled, one student raised his hand and asked, ""What gender is a computer?"" </p>
<p>The teacher wasn't certain which it was, and so divided the class into two groups and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine. One group was composed of the women in the class, and the other of men. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendation. </p>
<p>The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to in the masculine gender because: </p>
<p>1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br /> 2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.<br /> 3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.<br /> 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model. </p>
<p>The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender because: </p>
<p>1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.<br /> 2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br /> 3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.<br /> 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.</p>

41226,"<p>Q:  How many light bulbs does it take to change a light bulb?A:  One, if it knows its own Goedel number.Note: I thought this was something to do with the maths/logic theories of Kurt Goedel, about it being impossible to prove things, and finally a more complete explanation arrived in my mailbox : - A Goedel Number is one of several ways to encode a Turing Machine, the classical abstraction of a computer, or for that matter of any algorithm.  The idea (as best I see it) is that if the machine knows its own Goedel Number it can simulate itself... It does come from the mathematician Goedel - partly because he used TMs in his famous theorem, I believe.)</p>

41230,"<p>A certain young man finally won a date with the blonde female of somewhat questionable morals that lived in his apartment complex.To prepare for his big date, the young man went up on to the roof of his apartment building in order to tan himself. Not wanting any tan lines to show, he sunbathed in the nude. Unfortunately, the young man fell asleep while on the roof, and managed to get a sunburn on his ""tool of the trade"". But the young man was determined not to miss his date, so he put some lotion on his manhood and wrapped it in gauze.The blonde showed up for the date at his apartment, and the young man treated her to a home cooked dinner, after which they went into the living room to watch a movie. During the movie, however, the young man's sunburn started acting up again. He asked to be excused, went into the kitchen, and poured a tall, cool glass of milk. He then placed his sunburned member in the milk and experienced immediate relief of his pain.The blonde, however, wondering what he was doing, wandered into the kitchen to see him with his Johnson immersed in a glass of milk. Upon seeing this, the blonde exclaimed, ""So that's how you guys load those things!""</p>

I got hitched to a widow with a grown daughter who then became my<br /> stepdaughter. My daddy came to visit us; fell in love with my lovely<br /> stepdaughter, then married her. And so my stepdaughter was now my stepmother.<br /> Soon, my wife had a son who was, of course, my daddy's brother-in-law since he<br /> is the half-brother of my stepdaughter, who is now, of course, my daddy's wife.<br /> So, as I told you, when my stepdaughter married my daddy, she was at once my<br /> stepmother! Now, since my new son is brother to my stepmother, he also became my<br /> uncle. As you know, my wife is my step-grandmother since she is my stepmother's<br /> mother. Don't forget that my stepmother is my stepdaughter. Remember, too, that<br /> I am my wife's grandson. But hold on just a few minutes more. You see, since I'm<br /> married to my step-grandmother, I am not only the wife's grandson and her hubby,<br /> but I am also my own grandfather.

41241,"<p>Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked<br /> beans. He loved them, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat lively<br /> reaction on him. One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it was apparent<br /> that they would marry, he thought to him, ""She'll never go for me carrying on<br /> like that,"" so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up his beloved baked<br /> beans, and shortly after, that they got married. </p>
<p>It was his birthday a few months later and, on the way home from work, his car<br /> broke down. Since they lived in the country, the man called his wife and told<br /> her he would be late because he had to walk. On his way home, he passed a small<br /> cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had<br /> several miles to walk, he figured he could walk off any ill effects before he<br /> got home. </p>
<p>So he went in and ordered, and before leaving had three extra large helpings<br /> of baked beans. All the way home he 'putt-putted'. He 'putted' down one hill and<br /> 'putt-putted' up the next. By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe. </p>
<p>His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed,<br /> ""Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!"" She<br /> put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and<br /> made him promise not to peek. At this point he was beginning to feel another one<br /> coming on. Just as she was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang.<br /> She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and she went to<br /> answer the phone. </p>
<p>While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one<br /> leg and let go. It was not only loud, but also ripe as a rotten egg. He had a<br /> hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. He<br /> had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg<br /> and 'rrriiiipppp!' It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse.<br /> To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms awhile, hoping the smell would<br /> dissipate. Things had just about returned to normal when he felt another urge<br /> coming. He shifted his weight to his other leg and let go. This was a real<br /> blue-ribbon winner; the windows rattled, the dishes on the table shook and, a<br /> minute later, the flowers on the table were dead. </p>
<p>While keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway, and keeping<br /> his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for the next ten<br /> minutes, farting and fanning them each time with his napkin. When he heard his<br /> wife saying goodbye (indicating the end of his loneliness, and freedom) he<br /> neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. Smiling<br /> contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. </p>
<p>Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner.<br /> After assuring her he had not, she removed the blindfold and yelled,<br /> ""Surprise!!!"" </p>
<p>To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the<br /> table for his surprise birthday party.</p>

41242,"<p>Joe took his blind date to the carnival. ""What would you like to do first, Kim?"" asked Joe.</p>
<p>""I want to get weighed,"" she said. They ambled over to the weight  guesser. He guessed 120 pounds. She got on the scale; it read 117 and  she won a prize.</p>
<p>Next, the couple went on the Ferris Wheel. When the ride was over, Joe again asked Kim what she would like to do.</p>
<p>""I want to get weighed,"" she said.</p>
<p>Back to the weight guesser they went. Since they had been there  before, he guessed her correct weight, and Joe lost his dollar.</p>
<p>The couple walked around the carnival and again he asked where to  next. ""I want to get weighed,"" she responded.</p>
<p>By this time, Joe figured she was really weird and took her home  early, dropping her off with a handshake.</p>
<p>Her roommate, Laura, asked her about the blind date, ""How'd it go?""</p>
<p>Kim responded, ""Oh, Waura, it was wousy.""</p>

41243,"<p>Once, there was this guy, who personally felt that he has committed lots of sinful crime and therefore decided to visit a church and confess all of his sins. When he arrived at a church, he walked to the confession area and spoke to the pastor. ""Father, I am sinful. """"Yes son, just tell me what have you done, the Lord will forgive you.""""Father, I have a steady relationship with my girlfriend, it's been 3 years and nothing serious ever happened between us. Yesterday, I visited her house, nobody was at home except for her sister. We were alone and I slept with her.""""That's bad my boy, fortunately you realize your mistake.""""Father, last week I went to her office to look for her, but nobody was around except for one of her colleagues, so I slept with her too.""""That's not very good of you.""""Father, last month, I went to her uncle's house to look for her, nobody was around except for her auntie, and I slept with her too."" ""Father? ......... Father?"" suddenly this guy realized that there was no response from the Father, he walked over and discovered that the Pastor was not there. So he began searching for him. ""Father? Where are you?"" He searched high and low, and finally he found him hiding under the table behind the piano.""Father, why are you hiding here?""""Sorry son, suddenly I remembered there is nobody around here except me.""</p>

Before he could say more than a word or two, the druggist told him, ""Now, just a minute - listen to my side of it. This morning the alarm failed to go off, so I was late getting up. I went without breakfast and hurried out to the car, but I'll be damned if I didn't lock the house with both house and car keys inside. I had to break a window to get my keys. Driving a little too fast, I got a speeding ticket. Then, about three blocks from the store I had a flat tire. </p>
<p>When I finally got to the store there was a bunch of people waiting for me to open up. I got the store opened and started waiting on these people, and all the time the darn phone was ringing its head off. Then I had to break a roll of nickels against the cash register drawer to make change, and they spilled all over the floor. I got down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels - the phone is still ringing - when I came up I cracked my head on the open cash drawer, which made me stagger back against a showcase with a bunch of perfume bottles on it, and half of them hit the floor and broke. The phone is still ringing with no let up, and I finally got back to answer it. It was your wife - she wanted to know how to use a rectal thermometer. Well, Mister, I TOLD HER!""</p>

<p>One weekend the husband woke up and it was pouring pretty hard, but the leak on the roof was gone! </p>
<p>Speaking of leaks, he also went to take a shower, and he found that the one pipe behind the sink wasn't leaking anymore either. </p>
<p>His wife was coming home just then, and as she walked through the door, the husband asked, ""Honey, how come there aren't any more leaks, and the car's running?"" </p>
<p>She replied nonchalantly, ""Oh, the other day I was picking up the mail, and I ran into one of our new neighbors, Jon. What a nice man. He came over and fixed everything."" </p>
<p>""Wow, did he charge us anything?"" asked the husband. </p>
<p>""No, he just said that he'd do it for free if I either baked him a cake or had sex with him."" she said. </p>

41262,"<p>For his birthday, Little Johnny asked for a 10 speed bicycle.</p>
<p>His father said, ""Son, we'd love to give you one, but the mortgage on this house is $80,000 and your mother just lost her job. There's no way we can afford it.""</p>
<p>The next day the father saw Little Johnny heading out the front door with a suitcase. So he asked, ""Son, where are you going?""</p>
<p>Little Johnny told him, ""I was walking past your room last night and I heard you tell mom you were pulling out. I heard her tell you to wait because she was coming too.</p>
<p>And I'll be damned if I'm sticking around here by myself with an $80,000 mortgage and no transportation.""</p>

41263,"<p>Three blondes died in a car crash trying to jump the Grand Canyon and are at the pearly gates of heaven. St Peter tells them that they can enter the gates only if they can answer one simple religious question. </p>
<p>The question posed by St. Peter is ""What is Easter""? </p>
<p>The first blonde replies, ""Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November when everyone gets together, eats turkey and are thankful..."" </p>
<p>""Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other place!"" replies St. Peter. He turns to the second blond, and asks her the same question: ""What is Easter?"" </p>
<p>The second blonde replies, ""Easter is the holiday in December when we put up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus."" </p>
<p>St Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the on the pearly gates in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in the other place. She is not welcome in Heaven. He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, ""Do YOU know what Easter is""? </p>
<p>The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St Peter in the eyes, ""I know what Easter is."" </p>
<p>""Oh?"" says St Peter, incredulously. </p>
<p>""Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish celebration of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one of his disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with nails through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was sealed off by a large boulder."" </p>
<p>St Peter smiled broadly with delight. </p>
<p>The third blonde continued... ""Every year the boulder is moved aside so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter.""</p>

He stopped by the hardware store and picked up a bucket and an anvil, then stopped by the livestock dealer to buy a couple of chickens and a goose. Now he had a problem: how to carry all of his purchases home.The livestock dealer said, ""Why don't you put the anvil in the bucket, carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?""Hey, thanks!"" the farmer said, and off he went.While walking he met a fair young lady with rather large beautiful breasts. She told him she was lost, and asked, ""Can you tell me how to get to 1515 Mockingbird Lane?""The farmer said, ""Well, as a matter of fact, I'm going to visit my brother at 1616 Mockingbird Lane. Let's take a short cut and go down this alley. We'll save half the time to get there"".The fair young lady said, ""How do I know that when we get in to the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull down my skirt and ravish me?""The farmer said, ""I am carrying a bucket, an anvil, 2 chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?""The young lady said, ""Easy silly! Set the goose down, put the bucket over the goose, put the anvil on top of the bucket, and I'll hold the friggen chickens!""</p>

The Monsignor leads them into a room, and tells them to undress, and a small bell is tied to each man's penis. In comes a beautiful woman, wearing a sexy belly-dancer costume. She begins to dance sensually around the first candidate.<br /> *Ting-a-ling* ""Oh, Patrick,"" says the Monsignor, ""I am so disappointed in your lack of control. Go now and take a long, cold shower and pray about your carnal weakness."" </p>
<p>The candidate leaves. </p>
<p>The dancer continues, dancing around the second candidate, slowly peeling off her layers of veils. As the last veil drops: *Ting-a-ling* </p>
<p>""Joseph, Joseph,"" sighs the Monsignor. ""You too are unable to withstand your carnal desires. Go take a long, cold shower and pray for forgiveness."" </p>
<p>The dancer continues, dancing naked in front of the final candidate. Nothing. She writhes up and down against his body. No response. Finally,exhausted, she quits. </p>

<p>God got mad and said to the 160-km-long line,<br /> 'You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created you in my image and your mates whipped you all. Look at the only one of my sons who stood up and made me proud. Learn from him. Tell them, my son, how did you manage to be the only one in this line?'</p>

"
41314,"<p>Dear Tech Support:Recently I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed that the new program began making unexpected changes to the accounting  software, severely limiting access to wardrobe, flower and jewelry  applications that operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.  No mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalls many other valuable programs such as DinnerDancing 7.5, CruiseShip 2.3, and OperaNight 6.1 and installs new, undesirable programs such as PokerNight 1.3, SaturdayFootball 5.0, Golf 2.4 and ClutterEverywhere 4.5. conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and invariably crashes the system. Under no circumstances will it run DiaperChanging 14.1or HouseCleaning 2.6.  I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix Husband 1.0, but this all purpose utility is of only limited effectiveness. Can you help, please!!Sincerely, XXXDear XXX:This is a very common problem women complain about, but it is mostly due to a primary misconception.  Many people upgrade from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 with no idea that Boyfriend 5.0 is merely an ENTERTAINMENT package.However, Husband 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and was designed by its creator to run as few applications as possible. Further, you cannot purge Husband 1.0 and return to Boyfriend 5.0, because Husband 1.0 is not designed to do this.Hidden operating files within your system would cause Boyfriend 5.0 to emulate Husband 1.0, so nothing is gained. It is impossible to uninstall, delete, or purge the program files from the system, once installed.  Any new program files can only be installed once per year, as Husband 1.0 has severely limited memory.  Error messages are common, and a normal part of Husband 1.0.In desperation to play some of  their ""old time"" favorite applications, or to get new applications to work, some women have tried to install Boyfriend 6.0, or Husband 2.0. However, these women end up with more problems than encountered with Husband 1.0. Look in your manual under ""Warnings: Divorce/Child Support."" You will notice that this program runs very poorly, and comes bundled with HeartBreak 1.3. I recommend you keep Husband 1.0, and just learn the quirks of this strange and illogical system. Having Husband 1.0 installed myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding General Partnership Faults [GPFs].  This is a wonderful feature of Husband 1.0, secretly installed by the parent company as an integral part of the operating system. Husband 1.0 must assume ALL responsibility for ALL faults and problems, regardless of root cause. To activate this great feature enter the command ""C: I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME"". Sometimes Tears 6.2 must be run simultaneously while entering the command. Husband 1.0 should then run the applications Apologize 12.3 and Flowers/Chocolates 7.8.TECH TIP!Avoid excessive use of this feature.  Overuse can create additional and more serious GPFs, and ultimately YOU may have to give a C: I APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal operations. Overuse can also cause Husband 1.0 to default to GrumpySilence 2.5, or worse yet, to Beer 6.0. Beer 6.0 is a very bad program that causes Husband 1.0 to create FatBelly files and SnoringLoudly wave files that are very hard to delete. Save yourself some trouble by following this tech tip! Just remember!  The system will run smoothly, and take the blame for all GPFs, but because of this fine feature it can only intermittently run all the applications Boyfriend 5.0 ran. Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot accept new applications quickly. Consider buying additional software to improve performance.  I personally recommend HotFood 3.0, Lingerie 5.3 and Patience 10.1.  Used in conjunction, these utilities can really help keep Husband 1.0 running smoothly.  After several years of use, Husband 1.0 will become familiar and you will find many valuable embedded features such as FixBrokenThings 2.1, Snuggling 4.2 and BestFriend 7.6.A final word of caution! Do NOT, under any circumstances, install MotherInLaw 1.0. This is not a supported application, and will cause selective shutdown of the operating system.  Husband 1.0 will run only Fishing 9.4 and Hunting 5.2 until MotherInLaw 1.0 is uninstalled. I hope these notes have helped.  Thank you for choosing to install Husband 1.0 and we here at Tech Support wish you the best of luck in coming years. We trust you will learn to fully enjoy this product!</p>

"
41329,"<p>The setting is Ohio State University about six or seven years ago in a huge lecture hall (approximately 1000 students) for a Calculus final. Apparently this particular calculus teacher wasn't very well liked. He was one of those guys who would stand at the front of the class and yell out how much time was remaining before the end of a test, a real charmer. </p>
<p>Since he was so busy gallivanting around the room making sure that nobody cheated and that everyone was aware of how much time they had left before their failure on the test was complete, he had the students stack the completed tests on the huge podium at the front of the room. </p>
<p>This made for quite a mess, remember there were 1000 students in the class. Anyway, during this particular final, one guy entered the test needing a decent grade to pass the class. His only problem with Calculus was that he did poorly when rushed, and this guy standing in the front of the room barking out how much time was left before the tests had to be handed in didn't help him at all. </p>
<p>He figured he wanted to assure himself of a good grade, so he hardly flinched when the professor said ""pencils down and submit your scantron sheets and work to piles at the front of the room"". </p>
<p>Five minutes turned into ten, ten into twenty, twenty into forty ... almost an hour after the test was ""officially over"", our friend finally put down his pencil, gathered up his work, and headed to the front of the hall to submit his final. The whole time, the professor sat at the front of the room, strangely waiting for the student to complete his exam. </p>
<p>""What do you think you're doing?"" the professor asked as the student stood in front of him about to put down his exam on one of the neatly stacked piles of exams (the professor had plenty of time to stack the mountain of papers while he waited) </p>
<p>It was clear that the professor had waited only to give the student a hard time. </p>
<p>""Turning in my exam,"" retorted the student confidently. </p>
<p>""I'm afraid I have some bad news for you,"" the professor gloated, ""Your exam is an hour late. You've FAILED it and, consequently, I'll see you next term when you repeat my course."" </p>
<p>The student smiled slyly and asked the professor ""Do you know who I am?"" </p>
<p>""What?"" replied the professor gruffly, annoyed that the student showed no sign of emotion. </p>
<p>The student rephrased the question mockingly, ""Do you know what my name is?"" </p>
<p>""NO"", snarled the professor. </p>
<p>The student looked the professor dead in the eyes and said slowly, ""I didn't think so"", as he lifted up one of the stacks half way, shoved his test neatly into the center of the stack, let the stack fall burying his test in the middle, turned around, and walked casually out of the huge lecture hall.</p>

But if any of them hits you, do not, i  repeat, DO NOT swear, because if you do, a whole flock will come and attack  you.""  So the man continued his hike, and all of a sudden, he was hit in the  forehead by a Foo, and he said, ""OOOWWWW!  Geez, that hurt!"" But he  remembered what the Indian said, and he didn't swear.  A few minutes later,  he was hit by another Foo in the exact same spot, but he still didn't swear.  He continued his hike once again, and he was hit by a gigantic Foo.  This  time he swore, ""AWW SHIT, DAMNIT THAT FU*KIN HURTS!"" and suddenly, a whole  flock of Foo's flew to him and starting hitting him and scratching him and  pecking him.  Soon, he was dead.

The elves were complaining about not getting<br /> paid for the overtime they had worked while making the toys and were threatening<br /> to go on strike. The reindeer had been drinking all afternoon and were dead<br /> drunk. To make matters worse, a few of the other elves had taken the sleigh out<br /> for a spin earlier in the day and had crashed it into a tree. </p>
<p>Santa was furious. ""I can't believe it!

I sent that<br /> stupid Little Angel out HOURS ago to find a tree and he isn't even back yet!<br /> What am I going to do?""</p>
<p>Just then, the Little Angel opened the front door and stepped in from the<br /> snowy night, dragging a Christmas tree. The angle said, ""Yo, fat man! Where do<br /> you want me to stick the tree this year?"" </p>

41349,"<p>Once upon a time there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked beans. She loved them but unfortunately they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her.Then one day she met a guy and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, ""He is such a sweet and gentle man, he would never go for this carrying on."" So she made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans.Some months later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home.On her way she passed a small diner and the odour of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted. And upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it.Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the phone.The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cooked cabbage.Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signalled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself.She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, and apologising for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not.At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!!There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a ""Happy Birthday""!!!</p>

Slowly, more and more people gather to watch them work. When they had finished, there was such a crowd they thought it would be a good idea to give a demonstration. So Al jumps.</p>
<p>He bounces at the end of the cord, but when he comes back up, Joe notices that he has a few cuts and scratches. Unfortunately, Joe isn't able to catch him, and he falls again, bounces again and comes back up again. This time he is bruised and bleeding. Again Joe misses him. Al falls again and bounces back up. This time he comes back pretty messed up. He's got a couple of broken bones and is almost unconscious.</p>

Candy, too.The driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to the side of the road and got out to see what had become of the bunny carrying the basket. Much to his dismay, the colorful bunny was dead.The driver felt guilty and began to cry. A woman driving down the same highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. She stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong. ''I feel terrible,'' he explained. ''I accidentally hit the Easter Bunny and killed it. There may not be an Easter because of me. What should I do?''The woman told the man not to worry. She said she knew exactly what to do. She went to her car trunk and pulled out a spray can. Then she walked over to the limp, dead bunny and sprayed the entire contents of the can onto the firry little animal. Miraculously, the Easter Bunny came back to life, jumped up, gathered the spilled eggs and candy, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped on down the road.Fifty yards away, the Easter Bunny stopped, turned around, waved and hopped on down the road another 50 yards. Then he turned, waved, hopped another 50 yards, turned and waved again. The man was astonished. He couldn't even begin to imagine what could have been in that woman's spray can. So he asked her: ''What in heaven's name is in your spray can? What was it that you sprayed on the Easter Bunny?''The woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label. It said: ''Hair spray. Restores life to dead hair. Adds permanent wave.''</p>

<p>The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.</p>
<p>A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.</p>
<p>Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him!</p>
<p>The morals of this story:</p>
<p>1) Not everyone who drops crap on you is your enemy.</p>
<p>2) Not everyone who gets you out of crap is your friend.</p>
<p>3) And when you're in deep doo-doo, keep your mouth shut.</p>

41393,"<p>With Viagra such a hit, Pfizer is bringing forth a whole new line of drugs oriented towards improving the performance of men in today's society:</p>
<p>DIRECTRA - a dose of this drug given to men before leaving on car trips caused 72 percent of them to stop and ask directions when they got lost, compared to a control group of 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>PROJECTRA - Men given this experimental new drug were far more likely to actually finish a household repair project before starting new one.</p>
<p>CHILDAGRA - Men taking this drug reported a sudden, over-whelming urge to perform more child-care tasks - especially cleaning up spills and ""little accidents.""</p>
<p>COMPLIMENTRA - In clinical trials, 82 percent of middle-aged men administered this drug noticed that their wives had a new hairstyle. Currently being tested to see if its effects extend to noticing new clothing.</p>
<p>BUYAGRA - Married and otherwise attached men reported a sudden urge to buy their sweeties expensive jewelry and gifts after talking this drug for only two days. Still to be seen: whether the drug can be continued for a period longer than your favorite store's return limit.</p>
<p>NEGA-VIAGRA - Has the exact opposite effect of Viagra. Currently undergoing clinical trials on sitting U.S. presidents.</p>
<p>NEGA-SPORTAGRA - This drug had the strange effect of making men want to turn off televised sports and actually converse with other family members.</p>
<p>FLATULAGRA - This complex drug converts men's noxious intestinal gases back into food solids. Special bonus: Dosage can be doubled for long car rides.</p>
<p>FLYAGRA - This drug has been showing great promise in treating men with O.F.D. (Open Fly Disorder). Especially useful for men on Viagra.</p>
<p>PRYAGRA - About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men in the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal affairs of other people. Note: Apparent over-dose turned three test subjects into ""special prosecutors.""</p>
<p>LIAGRA - This drug causes men to be less than truthful when being asked about their sexual affairs. Will be available Regular, Grand Jury, and Presidential Strength versions.</p>

""It's a good thing we isolated it�I wouldn't want that faggot-ass gene messing with the straight ones.""

41460,"<p>A man and his wife had been stranded on a deserted island for many years. The morning following a bad storm, a new guy washes up on the shore. The new guy and the wife are very attracted to each other right away, but they realize that certain protocols will have to be observed. The husband, oblivious to the pheromones floating around, is very glad to see the second man there. 'This is wonderful! Now we'll be able to have three people doing 8-hour shifts in the watchtower instead of two people doing 12-hour shifts.' The new man is only too happy to help, and in fact volunteers to do the first shift. He climbs up the tall tower and stands watch, scanning the ocean horizon for any ships. Soon, the husband and wife start placing stones in a circle in order to make a fire to cook supper. The new man yells down, 'Hey, no screwing!' They look at each other and yell back, 'We're not screwing!' A few minutes later, they start to put driftwood into the stone circle. Again, the new man yells down, 'Hey, no screwing!' Again they yell back, 'We're not screwing!' Later, they are putting palm leaves on the roof of the shack to patch leaks. Once again, the new man yells down from high above, 'Hey, I said no screwing!' They yell back, 'And we said we're not screwing!' Finally the shift is over and the new man climbs down from the tower and the husband starts to climb up. By the time he gets halfway up, his wife and the new man are going at it. Once at the top, the husband turns around and looks down and says to himself, 'Son-of-a-gun. From up here it DOES look like they're screwing.'</p>

41467,"<p>GEORGE W. BUSH:<br /> We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to<br /> know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is<br /> either against us or for us. There is no middle ground here. </p>
<p>COLIN POWELL:<br /> Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image<br /> of the chicken crossing the road. </p>
<p>JOHN KERRY:<br /> Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road I am now against it! </p>
<p>RALPH NADER:<br /> The chicken's habitat on the other side of the road had been polluted<br /> by unchecked industrial greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled<br /> habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the<br /> wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV. </p>
<p>PAT BUCHANAN:<br /> To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American. </p>
<p>RUSH LIMBAUGH:<br /> I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but I'll bet it was<br /> getting a government grant to cross the road, and I'll bet that somebody<br /> out there is already forming a support group to help chickens with<br /> crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this<br /> can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their<br /> tax dollars. And when I say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money,<br /> money the government took from you to build a road for chickens to<br /> cross. </p>
<p>MARTHA STEWART:<br /> No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a<br /> standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price<br /> dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information. </p>
<p>JERRY FALWELL:<br /> Because the chicken was gay --- isn't it obvious? Can't you people see<br /> the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the<br /> ''other side'. That's what they call it the other side. Yes, my friends,<br /> that chicken is gay. And if you eat that chicken, you will become gay<br /> too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination<br /> that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like<br /> ""the other side."" </p>
<p>DR. SEUSS:<br /> Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the<br /> chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told. </p>
<p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY:<br /> To die in the rain. Alone. </p>
<p>MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.:<br /> I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads<br /> without having their motives called into question. </p>
<p>GRANDPA:<br /> In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody<br /> told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough. </p>
<p>BARBARA WALTERS:<br /> Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the<br /> chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it<br /> experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its<br /> life long dream of crossing the road. </p>
<p>JOHN LENNON:<br /> Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together - in<br /> peace. </p>
<p>ARISTOTLE:<br /> It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. </p>
<p>KARL MARX:<br /> It was an historic inevitability. </p>
<p>CAPTAIN KIRK:<br /> To boldly go where no chicken had ever gone before. </p>
<p>SIGMUND FREUD:<br /> The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the<br /> road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. </p>
<p>BILL GATES:<br /> I have just witnessed eChicken2003, which will not only cross roads,<br /> but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your<br /> checkbook.... and Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken. </p>
<p>ALBERT EINSTEIN:<br /> Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the<br /> chicken? </p>
<p>BILL CLINTON:<br /> I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What is your definition of<br /> chicken? </p>
<p>AL GORE:<br /> I invented the chicken! </p>
<p>THE BIBLE:<br /> And God came down from heaven, and he said unto the chicken ""THOU SHALT CROSS THE ROAD."" And the chicken didst cross the road, and there was much rejoicing. </p>

"
41472,"<p>Bill Gates dies in a car accident. He finds himself in purgatory, being<br /> sized up by St. Peter. </p>
<p>""Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call. I'm not sure whether to<br /> send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by<br /> putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created<br /> that ghastly Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before<br /> in your case. I'm going to let you decide where you want to go."" </p>
<p>Bill replied, ""Well, what's the difference between the two?"" </p>
<p>St. Peter said, ""I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it<br /> will help your decision."" </p>
<p>""Fine, but where should I go first?"" asked Bill. </p>
<p>""I'll leave that up to you."" replied St. Peter.</p>
<p>""Okay then,"" said Bill, ""Let's try Hell first."" </p>
<p>So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear<br /> waters and lots of bikini-clad women running around, playing in the<br /> water,laughing and frolicking about.The sun was shining, the temperature<br /> perfect. He was very pleased. </p>
<p>""This is great!"" he told St. Peter. ""If this is hell, I REALLY want to see<br /> heaven!"" </p>
<p>""Fine,"" said St. Peter. And off they went. </p>
<p>Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing<br /> harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell.</p>
<p>Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision. ""Hmmm. I think<br /> I'd prefer Hell,"" he told St. Peter. </p>
<p>""Fine,"" retorted St. Peter, ""as you desire."" So Bill Gates went to Hell. </p>
<p>Two weeks later, St. Peter decided to check on the late billionaire to see<br /> how he was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a<br /> wall, screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned and<br /> tortured by demons. ""How's everything going?"" he asked Bill. </p>
<p>Bill responded, with his voice full of anguish and disappointment, ""This<br /> is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't<br /> believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the<br /> beautiful beaches, and the scantily-clad women playing in the water?!???""</p>
<p>""That was a demo,"" replied St. Peter.</p>

"
41474,"<p>A man passed away and went to Heaven.  Upon arriving at the pearly  gates,  St. Peter said, 'Come on in. I'll show you &gt;around. I really  think you'll like it here.' Walking through the gates, the man noticed that there were clocks everywhere. It appeared that Heaven was nothing more than a giant clock warehouse.Surprised at how Heaven looked, the man asked St. Peter, 'what's the  deal with all the clocks?' St. Peter replied, 'they keep track of  everybody on earth. There is one clock for each person. Every time  someone tells a lie, his clock moves forward one minute. For  instance,this clock belongs to Sam, a used car salesman. If you watch  it closely,it will move any second.' Click! The minute hand on Sam's  clock moved forward one minute. Click! It moved forward another  minute. 'Sam must be closing on a deal right now,' said St. Peter.  'The minute hand on his clock moves all day long.'The man and St. Peter continued walking and soon came across a clock  covered with cobwebs. 'Whose clock is this?' asked the man. 'That  clock belongs to the Widow Audrey. She is one of the finest persons on earth. I bet her clock hasn't moved in a year or two.' They continued  walking and touring Heaven. The man enjoyed watching the clocks of all his friends.When the tour was finally finished, the man said, 'I've seen  everyone's clock but one! W here is President Clinton's clock kept?'  St. Peter smiled and said, 'Look up there. We use his for a ceiling  fan.</p>

41475,"<p>Late at night this guy runs into a pub and demands a glass of water from the landlord.  </p>
<p>The guy drinks it in one gulp then asks for a second glass. </p>
<p>Six pints later, and he has recovered enough to speak.  ""Thanks,"" he croaks. </p>
<p>""That's one hell of a thirst you've got,"" says the landlord.</p>
<p>The guy says: ""Any man would be as bad if they'd just had sex with the woman in my car.  </p>
<p>She's insatiable.  She wants me to go right back out there and do it all again, but I can't."" </p>
<p>""Where's your car?"" the landlord asks. </p>
<p>""At the roadside,"" the guy gasps.</p>
<p>""Tell you what,"" says the landlord, ""you watch the bar for me while I nip out and take your place."" </p>
<p>""Be my guest,"" the guy says. </p>
<p>So the landlord goes outside and gets in the car.  It's totally dark, so the woman doesn't realize she's with a different man.  And they get right down to it, humping away.</p>
<p>Five minutes later there's a knock on the window.  It's a cop, and he shines his flashlight on the naked couple. </p>
<p>""What's going on here?"" he asks. </p>
<p>""It's all right, officer,"" explains the landlord,  ""She's my wife."" </p>
<p>The officer replies apologetically, ""Oh, sorry sir, I didn't realize.""</p>

<p>9&gt; The intoxicating rush of fame from ""The Simple Life"" has already worn off, and Paris drew the longer straw.</p>
<p>8&gt; Your cousin Paula described your blind date as a world-famous pop singer with millions of fans and a great down-to-earth personality -- but conveniently failed to mention his giant goofy head.</p>
<p>7&gt; Your date can't dance, can't sing... oops, never mind. False alarm: He's just a normal white guy.</p>
<p>6&gt; As you approach the karaoke bar for that after-dinner drink, the owner hurriedly turns the sign around from ""OPEN"" to ""CLOSED.""</p>
<p>5&gt; He manages to tear your dress, trash your corsage and step on *both* your feet dancing, but that doggone goofy charm convinces you to give it up anyway.</p>
<p>4&gt; Despite his embarrassing performance in the back seat of his car, his earnest demeanor landed him a $25,000 porno deal.</p>

But it's fun.------------A Charlotte, North Carolina man, having purchased a case (24) of rare, very expensive cigars, insured them against . . . (get this) fire. Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of fabulous cigars, and having yet to make a single premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that he had lost the cigars in ''a series of small fires.'' The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in a normal fashion.The man sued . . . and won. In delivering his ruling, the judge stated that since the man held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable, and also guaranteed that it would insure the cigars against fire, without defining what it considered to be ''unacceptable fire,'' it was obligated to compensate the insured for his loss.Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the judge's ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in ''the fires.'' -- And Now for the Rest of the Story --After the man cashed his check, however, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used as evidence against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning the rare cigars and sentenced to 24 consecutive 30-day terms in jail.</p>

41570,"<p>There was this guy who worked as a stockbroker. Being a stockbroker, he led a very tense kind of life. So one day, he decided that enough is enough, I am going away to somewhere to relax. So he visited all the travel agencies in his town, and decided on a trip to a really unpopulated island. So off he went.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the island, he was overwhelmed by the beauty of the place. He had also heard from the locals about this very beautiful lake located nearby. So after putting down his stuff, he decided to explore the island by himself, to see the lake for himself. So he trekked across the terrain, armed with a towel and a cake of soap. It was then that he saw the lake. It indeed was most beautiful lake he had ever seen in his whole life. He could not control his desire to go for a dip in the lake. However, he also realised that he had forgot his trunks. </p>
<p>Looking around, he then told himself that it would be rather safe to swim naked here, since there was no one around within 5 miles. So off came his shorts, and into the water he went. What a fantastic feeling! He was so engrossed that he did not realise a group of young convent nuns approaching. When he finally did realise, he had run out of time, so he jumped out of the water and pretended to be a statue. Holding his towel on his right hand and the cake of soap on his left hand, he could only stay very still and pray that the nuns were just passing through. </p>
<p>As luck would have had it, the group of convent nuns were actually here to have their shower. As they started to undress, the guy realised that some of them had the most wonderful figures the man had ever set his eyes on. Naturally, he began to get a hard-on. After swimming in the lake for a while, one of the nuns finally saw the 'statue' from afar. So she ran towards it to take a closer look. She saw a funny looking lever at the bottom, and started to tug at it. The man started to squirm, and got weak in his right arm. Poof, down came to towel . </p>
<p>The nun ran back enthusiastically and exclaimed, ""Hey look, PULL the lever and get a towel!"" </p>
<p>So a second nun came along and tugged at the lever. Again, the man started to squirm, and poof, down came the cake of soap. </p>
<p>So the second nun ran back enthusiastically and exclaimed, ""Hey look, PULL the lever and get a free cake of soap!"" </p>
<p>A third nun then came along, and tugged at the ""lever"", hoping for some freebies. By this time, the man was already on the verge of a climax, having been handled by two women. The third nun continued to pull the lever furiously, but without success. </p>
<p>Finally, she went back and told the earlier two nuns, "" I pulled the lever so many times, and all I got was some shampoo..."".</p>

41580,"<p>Proper Care of Floppies: 1. Never leave diskettes in the disk drive, as data can leak out of the disk and corrode the inner mechanics of the drive. Diskettes should be rolled up and stored in pencil holders. 2. Diskettes should be cleaned and waxed once a week. Microscopic metal particles can be removed by waving a powerful magnet over the surface of the disk. Any stubborn metallic shavings can be removed with scouring powder and soap. When waxing diskettes, make sure application is even. This will allow the diskettes to spin faster, resulting in better access time. 3. Do not fold diskettes unless they do not fit in the drive. 'Big' diskettes may be folded and used in 'little' disk drives. 4. Never insert a disk into the drive upside down. The data can fall off the surface of the disk and jam the intricate mechanics of the drive. 5. Diskettes cannot be backed up by running them through the Xerox machine. If your data is going to need to be backed up, simply insert two diskettes together into the drive. Whenever you update a document, the data will be recorded on both diskettes. 6. Diskettes should not be inserted into or removed from the drive while the red light is flashing. Doing so could result in smeared or possibly unreadable text. Occasionally the red light continues to flash in what is known as a 'hung' or 'hooked' state. If your system is 'hooking' you, you will probably need to insert a few coins before being allowed to access the disk drive. 7. If your diskette is full and you need more storage space, remove the disk from the drive and shake vigorously for two minutes. This will pack the data enough (Data Compression) to allow for more storage. Be sure to cover all the openings with scotch tape to prevent loss of data. 8. Data access time can be greatly improved by cutting more holes in the diskette jacket. This will provide more simultaneous access points to the disk. 9. Diskettes can be used as coasters for beverage glasses, provided they have been properly waxed beforehand. Be sure to wipe the diskettes dry before inserting into drive (see item #2 above.)10. Never use scissors and glue to manually edit documents. The data stored is much too small to be seen with the naked eye, and you may end up with data from some other document stuck in the middle of your document. Razor blades and scotch tape may be used, provided the user is equipped with an electron microscope.11. Periodically spray diskettes with insecticide to prevent system bugs from spreading.12. And particularly, watch out for that Bobbit virus. It will turn your harddrive into a 3.5' floppy.</p>

41590,"<p>In a certain suburban neighborhood, there were two brothers, 8 and 10 years old, who were exceedingly mischievous. Whatever went wrong in the neighborhood, it often turned out that they had had a hand in it. Their parents were at their wit's end trying to control them. Hearing about a priest nearby who worked with delinquent boys, the mother suggested to the father that they ask the priest to talk with the boys.The father replied: 'Sure, do that before I kill them!' The mother went to the priest and made her request. He agreed, and said he wanted to see the younger boy first and alone. So the mother sent him to the priest.The priest sat the boy down across a huge, impressive desk. For about five minutes they just sat  and stared at each other.  Finally, the priest pointed  his gnarled and boney forefinger at the boy and asked:  'Where is God?'The 8 year old boy looked under the desk, in the  corners of the room, all around, but said nothing.Again, louder, the priest pointed at the boy and asked: 'Where is God?'Again the boy looked all around but said nothing. A third time, in a louder, firmer voice, the priest leaned far across the desk and put his forefinger almost to the boy's nose, and asked: 'Where is God?'The boy panicked and ran all the way home. Finding his older brother, he dragged him upstairs to their room and into the closet, where they usually plotted their mischief. He finally said: 'We are in BIIIIG trouble.'The 10 year old asked: 'What do you mean, BIIIIG trouble?' His brother replied: 'God is missing and they think  we did it.'</p>

41591,"<p>A blind man walks into a restaurant and sits down. The waiter, who is also the owner, walks up to the blind man and hands him a menu.""I'm sorry sir, but I am blind and can't read the menu. Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer, I'll smell it and order from there.""A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. He returns to the blind man's table and hands it to him.The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath.""Ahh, yes that's what I'll have, meatloaf and mashed potatoes.""Unbelievable, the owner says to himself as he walks towards the kitchen. The cook happens to be the owner's wife and he tells her what had just happened. The blind man eats his meal and leaves.Several days later the blind man returns and the owner mistakenly brings him a menu again.""Sir, remember ? I'm the blind man.""""I'm sorry, I didn't recognise you. I'll go get you a dirty fork.""The owner again retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man.After another deep breath, the blind man says, ""That smells great, I'll take the macaroni and cheese with broccoli.""Once again walking away in disbelief, the owner thinks the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he's going to test him.The blind man eats and leaves. He returns the following week, but this time the owner sees him coming and runs to the kitchen. He tells his wife, ""Mary, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man.""Mary complies and hands her husband the fork back just as the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting.""Good afternoon sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you.""The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff and says�""Hey! I didn't know that Mary worked here!""</p>

41602,"<p>There's this young couple, Louise and Al, they've been married for about a year, and the bride isn't getting any sex. Just about every night hubby comes home, has a shower, gets changed and goes down to the pub. She's getting increasingly rampant as the days go on,<br /> but each night she is disappointed.</p>
<p>Al comes home every night completely hammered and unfit for sexual activity. One particular night when Al gets in from work, Louise is seated provocatively on the sofa, wearing the skimpiest dress she has, suspenders, stockings, and very sexy lace panties and bra.</p>
<p>As is always the case, Al comes home runs upstairs, gets ready and goes to the pub. Once again Louise is rejected, so she sits back with a bottle of wine to console herself. Then at 11 pm (well before normal) she hears Al coming up the driveway and opening the front door. Louise re-adopts her sexually provocative pose on the sofa and to her surprise, Al's first words are, ""Right woman, get upstairs - into the bedroom.""</p>
<p>""YES!"" she says under her breath as she runs upstairs, ""This is the night, I'm gonna get some!""</p>
<p>When Louise reaches the bedroom, she removes her outer garments and sits on the edge of the bed in her black lace panties - ready for Al, as he stomps up the stairs. As Al pushes the bedroom door open he says, ""Right, now get your clothes off!""</p>
<p>Louise doesn't need telling twice, it's off with everything. ""Now get over in front of the mirror..,""</p>
<p>""Kinky!"" she thinks. ""Great!""</p>
<p>""and do a handstand...""</p>
<p>""Oh god, I've been waiting for this for ages,"" thinks Louise...</p>
<p>Al walks over to Louise, parts her legs and places his chin in her crotch... ""Perhaps the guys at the bar were right, a beard would suit me!""</p>

41603,"<p>There was once a Scotsman and an Englishman who lived next door to each other. The Scotsman owned a hen and each morning would look in his garden and pick up one of his hen's eggs for breakfast. </p>
<p>One day he looked into his garden and saw that the hen had laid an egg in the Englishman's garden. </p>
<p>He was about to go next door when he saw the Englishman pick up the egg. The Scotsman ran up to the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged to him because he owned the hen. </p>
<p>The Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property. </p>
<p>""In my family,"" the Scotsman said, ""we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I knock you down and time how long it takes you to get back up. Then you kick me down and time how long it takes for me to get up. Whoever gets up quicker wins the egg."" </p>
<p>The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman found his heaviest pair of boots kicked the Englishman as hard as he could and knocked him over. The Englishman fell to the floor and howled in agony for 30 minutes. </p>
<p>Eventually the Englishman stood up and said, ""Now it's my turn to kick you.""</p>

<p>''Mister, it's caused by loose living, being with cheap, wicked women, too much alcohol, and contempt for your fellow man,'' the priest replied. ''Imagine that,'' the drunk muttered. He returned to reading his paper. </p>
<p>The priest, thinking about what he had said, turned to the man and apologised: ''I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come on so strong. How long have you had arthritis?'' </p>
<p>''I don't have arthritis, Father,'' the drunk said, ''but I just read in the paper that the Pope does.''</p>

<p>Next Grumpy yelled, ""She's taking off her skirt,"" which was followed by the echoes ""Taking off her skirt,"" ""She's taking off her skirt,"" ""Skirt's coming off,"" ""Taking off her skirt,"" etc. </p>
<p>Of course the next line from Grumpy was, ""She's taking off her bra!"" and the echo chorus went down the line: ""She taking off her bra!"" ""She's taking off her bra!"" ""She taking off her bra!"" etc. </p>
<p>Then Grumpy said, ""She's taking off her panties!"" which again cascaded down the dwarf tower. ""She's taking off her panties!"" ""She's taking off her panties!"" ""She's taking off her panties!"" ""She taking off her panties!"" etc. </p>

41625,"<p>News just in of Microsoft's latest venture: Microsoft Corporation has taken another step toward dominating every aspect of American life with the introduction of Contraceptive98, a suite of applications designed for users who engage in sex. Microsoft has been a pioneer in peer-to-peer connectivity and plug and play.<br /> It believes these technologies will give it substantial leverage in penetrating the copulation enhancement market.The product addresses two important user concerns: the need for virus protection and the need for a firewall to ensure the non-propagation of human beings. </p>
<p>The Contraceptive98 suite consists of three products: Condom98, DeFetus 1.0 (from Sementec), and AIDScan 2.1 (from Norton Utilities). A free copy of Intercourse Explorer 4.0 is bundled in the package. The suite also comes in two expanded versions. Contraceptive98 Professional is the Client/Server edition, for professionals in the sexual services sector. Contraceptive98 Small Business Edition is a package for startups, aimed at the housewife and gigolo niches. </p>
<p>While Contraceptive98 does not address nontraditional copulatory channels, future plug-ins are planned for next year. </p>
<p>OPERATION: Only one node in a peer-to-peer connection needs to install the package. </p>
<p>At installation, the Condom98 software checks for minimum hardware. If the user meets the requirements, the product installs and is sufficiently scaleable to meet most requirements. After installation, operation commences. One caution is that the user must have sufficient RAM to complete the session. When the session is complete, a disconnect is initiated, and the user gets the message, it is now safe to turn off your partner. </p>
<p>DRAWBACKS: Usability testers report that frequent failures were a major concern during beta testing. General Protection Fault was the most serious error encountered. Early versions had numerous bugs, but most of these have been eliminated. The product needs to be installed each time its used. </p>
<p>CONCLUSION: Contraceptive98 is a robust product. Despite its drawbacks, it is reasonably good value for its $49.95 price tag, and is far superior to its shareware version. Hopefully, future releases (of the software, that is) will add missing functionality, such as Backout and Restore, uninterruptible Power Supply, and Onboard Camera. </p>
<p>Microsoft CEO Bill Gates is optimistic about ""Our contraceptive products will help users do to each other what we've been doing to our customers for years.""</p>

41631,"<p>It seems that when God was making the world, he called man over and bestowed upon him twenty years of normal sex life. Man was horrified. ""Only twenty years of normal sex life?"" but the Lord was very adamant that was all man could have.</p>
<p>Then the Lord called the monkey and gave him twenty years. ""But I don't need twenty years"", he protested, ""Ten is plenty for me.""<br /> Man spoke up eagerly. ""Can I have the other ten?"" The monkey graciously agreed.</p>
<p>Then the Lord called the lion and gave him twenty years, and the lion, like the monkey, wanted only ten.<br /> Again the man spoke up, ""Can I have the other ten?"" The lion said of course he could.</p>
<p>Then came the donkey and he was given twenty years - but like the others, ten was sufficient - and again man pleaded, ""Can I have the other ten?"" </p>
<p>This explains why man has twenty years of normal sex life, plus ten years of monkeying around, ten years of lion about it, and ten years of making an ass of himself.</p>

41639,"<p>At the 1994 annual awards dinner given by the American Association for Forensic Science, AAFS President Don Harper Mills astounded his audience in San Diego with the legal complications of a bizarre death. </p>
<p>Here is the story. ""On 23 March 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound of the head. The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide (he left a note indicating his despondency). </p>
<p>As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter no the decedent was aware that a safety net had been erected at the eighth floor level to protect some window washers and that Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide anyway because of this."" </p>
<p>""Ordinarily,"" Dr. Mills continued, ""a person who sets out to commit suicide ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended. That Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below probably would not have changed his mode of death from suicide to homicide. But the fact that his suicidal intent would not have been successful caused the medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on his hands. </p>
<p>""The room on the ninth floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing and he was threatening her with the shotgun. He was so upset that, when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the a window striking Opus. ""When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with this charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. The old man said it was his long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her - therefore, the killing of Opus appeared to be an accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded. </p>
<p>""The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal incident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus. There was an exquisite twist. ""Further investigation revealed that the son had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. </p>
<p>This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23, only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a ninth story window. [Yup, the son was Ronald Opus] ""The medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.""</p>

41641,"<p>A very wealthy man, old and desperately ill, summons to his bedside his three closest advisors: his doctor, his priest, and his lawyer. I know, he says, they say 'you can't take it with you.' But who knows? Suppose they're mistaken. I'd like to have something with me, just in case. So I am giving each of you an envelope containing one hundred thousand dollars and I would be grateful if at my funeral you would put the envelopes in my coffin, so that if it turns out that it's useful, I'll have something. They each agree to carry out his wish. Sure enough, after just a few weeks, the old man passes away. At his funeral, each of the three advisors is seen slipping something into the coffin. After the burial, as the three are walking away together, the doctor turns to the other two and says, -Friends, I have a confession to make. As you know, at the hospital we are desperate because of the cutbacks in funding. Our CAT SCAN machine broke down and we haven't be able to get a new one. So, I took $20,000 of our friend's money for a new CAT SCAN and put the rest in the coffin as he asked. At this the priest says, I, too have a confession to make. As you know, our church is simply overwhelmed by the problem of the homeless. The needs keep increasing and we have nowhere to turn. So I took $50,000 from the envelope for our homeless fund and put the rest in the coffin as out friend requested. Fixing the other two in his gaze, the lawyer says, I am astonished and deeply disappointed that you would treat so casually our solemn undertaking to our friend. I want you to know that I placed in his coffin my personal check for the full one hundred thousand dollars.</p>

41643,"<p>I was riding to work yesterday when I observed a female driver cut right in front of a pickup truck, causing him to have to drive on the shoulder. This evidently pissed the driver off enough that he hung out his window and flipped the woman off. ""Man, that guy is stupid"" I thought to myself. I ALWAYS smile nicely and wave in a sheepish manner whenever a female does anything to me in traffic and here's why. I drive 38 miles each way, every day, to work. That's 76 miles, of these, 16 each way is bumper-to-bumper. Most of the bumper-to-bumper is on an 8 lane highway. So, if you just look at the 7 lanes I am not in, that means I pass something like a new car every 40 feet per lane. That's 7 cars every 40 feet for 32 miles. That works out to be 982 cars every mile, or 31,424 cars. Even though the rest of the 34 miles is not bumper-to-bumper. I figure I pass at least another 4000 cars. That brings the number to something like 36,000 cars I pass every day. Statistically half of these are driven by females, that's 18,000. In any given group of females, 1 in 28 are having the worst day of their period. That is 642. According to Cosmopolitan, 70% describe their love life as dissatisfying or unrewarding, that's 449. According to the National Institutes of Health, 22% of all females have seriously considered suicide or homicide, that's 98. And, 34% describe men as their biggest problem, that's 33. According to the National Rifle Association, 5% of all females carry weapons, and the number is increasing. That means, that EVERY SINGLE DAY, I drive past at least one female that has a lousy love life, thinks men are her biggest problem, has seriously considered suicide or homicide, is having the worst day of her period, and is armed. No matter what she does in traffic, I wouldn't DREAM of flipping her off.</p>

<p>While reflecting on their problem, the zoo administrators noticed Mike, an employee responsible for cleaning the animals' cages.  Now Mike, it was rumored, possessed ample ability to satisfy any female, and he wasn't very bright. So the zoo administrators thought they might have a solution. Perhaps they could entice Mike to satisfy the female gorilla.</p>
<p>So he was approached with a proposition: would he be willing to have sex with the gorilla for $500. He responded that he was interested but would have to think the matter over.</p>
<p>The following day, Mike announced that he would accept their offer, but only under three conditions: ""First,"" he said, ""I don't want to have to kiss her,"" and ""Second, I want nothing to do with any offspring that may result from this union.""</p>
<p>The zoo administration quickly acceded to these conditions, but what could be the third?</p>
<p>""Well,"" said Mike, ""You've gotta give me another week to come up with the five hundred bucks.""</p>

41656,"<p>TO: ALL EMPLOYEES<br /> FROM: EMPLOYEE RELATIONS DEPARTMENT<br /> SUBJECT: RESTROOM TRIP POLICY (RTP) </p>
<p>An internal audit of employee restroom time (ERT) has found that this company<br /> significantly exceeds the national ERT standard recommended by the President's<br /> Commission on Productivity and Waste. At the same time, some employees<br /> complained about being unfairly singled out for ERT monitoring. Technical<br /> Division (TD) has developed an accounting and control system that will solve<br /> both problems. </p>
<p>Effective 1 April 1987, a Restroom Trip Policy (RTP) is established. </p>
<p>A Restroom Trip Bank (RTB) will be created for each employee. On the first day<br /> of each month employees will receive a Restroom Trip Credit (RTC) of 40. The<br /> previous policy of unlimited trips is abolished. </p>
<p>Restroom access will be controlled by a computer-linked voice-print<br /> recognition system. Within the next two weeks, each employee must provide two<br /> voice prints (one normal, one under stress) to Personnel. To facilitate<br /> familiarity with the system, voice-print recognition stations will be<br /> operational but not restrictive during the month of April. </p>
<p>Should an employee's RTB balance reach zero, restroom doors will not unlock<br /> for his/her voice until the first working day of the following month. </p>
<p>Restroom stalls have been equipped with timed tissue-roll retraction and<br /> automatic flushing and door-opening capability. To help employees maximize their<br /> time, a simulated voice will announce elapsed ERT up to 3 minutes. A 30-second<br /> warning buzzer will then sound. At the end of the 30 seconds the roll of tissue<br /> will retract, the toilet will flush and the stall door will open. Employees may<br /> choose whether they wish to hear a male or a female ""voice"". A bilingual<br /> capability is being developed, but is not yet on-line. </p>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access (e.g., sneaking in behind someone with an RTB<br /> surplus, or use of a tape-recorded voice), video cameras in the corridor will<br /> record those seeking access to the restroom. However, consistent with the<br /> company's policy of respecting the privacy of its employees, cameras will not be<br /> operative within the restroom itself. </p>
<p>An additional advantage of the system is its capability for automatic urine<br /> analysis (AUA). This permits drug-testing without the demeaning presence of an<br /> observer and without risk of human error in switching samples. The restrooms and<br /> associated plumbing are the property of the company. Legal Services has advised<br /> that there are no privacy rights over voluntarily discarded garbage and other<br /> like materials. </p>
<p>In keeping with our concern for employee privacy, participation in AUA is<br /> strictly voluntary. But employees who choose to participate will be eligible for<br /> attractive prizes in recognition of their support for the company's policy of a<br /> drug-free workplace. </p>
<p>Management recognizes that from time to time employees may have a legitimate<br /> need to use the restroom. But employees must also recognize that their jobs<br /> depend on this company's staying competitive in a global economy. These<br /> conflicting interests should be weighed, but certainly not balanced. The company<br /> remains strongly committed to finding technical solutions to management<br /> problems. We continue to believe that machines are fairer and more reliable than<br /> managers. We also believe that our trusted employees will do the right thing<br /> when given no other choice.</p>

"
41658,"<p>Every once in a while each of us experiences a perfect crap. It's rare, but a thing of beauty in all respects. You sit down expecting the worst, but what you get is the smooth-sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. But that's not the end of it. You use some toilet paper only to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right with the world and you are in perfect harmony with it. On the other hand (so to speak) there is:The Beer Crap Talk about nasty craps. Depending on the crapper's tolerance, the beer crap is the result of too many beers. It could have been two or 22, it doesn't matter. What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy crap accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom for days.The Chilli Crap Hot when it goes in and rocket fuel when it leaves. The chilli crap stays with you all day, making your tush feel like a heat shield.The Cable Crap Long, curly and perfectly formed like two feet of telephone coaxial cable. It loops lazily around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. You wonder admiringly, 'Did I do that? Where did it come from?' You leave the toilet pleased with yourself.The Latrine Crap In case you didn't know, a latrine is a hole in the ground with a tent around it - where soldiers, boy scouts and flies go to crap. Tip: don't ever look down the hole.The Mona Lisa Crap This is the masterpiece of craps. It's as perfectly formed as it can be. Delicate and slender with intricacies that would make Da Vinci weep. And just think, you made it yourself. You may even want to break out the Polaroid camera, but maybe that's going too far.The Empty Roll CrapYou're done... you reach for the toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. A mild panic begins coldly in your throat. You could use the curtains... no, someone would say, 'Where are the curtains?' Then what would you say. The rug? Too cumbersome. Then you must come to the same conclusion that every 'empty roll crapper' must face... pull up your daks, tighten your arse and wriggle yourself to the nearest full roll.A mate about to run the London Marathon lined up outside the dozens of portaloos on Blackheath to unload a nervous one and discovered when the business was done and he was ready to run a world record race, there was no paper. Panic. The only thing available was a pound note - the last he possessed because they were being replaced by the coin - and he used that, being careful not to use the side with the Queen's head, of course!The Splash Back CrapYou send the crap on its way; it drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now you're wet and embarrassed. Tip: blot instead of wipe.The Aborted CrapYou are in mid-crap when the phone rings. What do you do? ABORT! Pinch it off; go for the phone and save the rest for later. It isn't pretty, but you've gotta do what you've gotta do.The Caesarean CrapPain, that's what this crap and childbirth have in common. It's simply a case of too much crap trying to go through too small a hole and there's no obstetrician to help.The Alfresco CrapEveryone has had to go outdoors from time to time. This can be a rather pleasant experience really. The open air, the nature, and a good bush all contribute to the peaceful ambience that our primitive forefathers must have enjoyed. What can screw up this harmonious interlude is a troop of Brownies or a patch of poison ivy.The Tijuana Trot Crap (also known as Delhi Belly, Rabat Runs, Seskatchewan Squits, Balsall Heath Balti Bypass) The phrase 'shit happens' really applies here in a big way. When the ice in your tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal tract, the fun begins. For the next 72 hours you'd be better off if you carried your own portable toilet with you because you will spend most of that time on the pot and the rest of the time in a fetal position.The Machine Gun CrapYou're just sitting there in a state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like machinegun fire. The guy in the next stall hits the floor like a combat veteran - cradling his umbrella like an AK47.The Sound Effect CrapYou feel a noisy one coming on. Relatives, friends or workmates are within earshot, so you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is obviously very important here. At the precise moment of release, try the following sound effects: 1. Flush the toilet. 2. Sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem. 3. Drop a handful of change on the floor.The Security CrapYou have enough on your mind when you're in the toilet without worrying about a lockless door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-crap mode. So how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from taking place? One way is to strategically place your foot against the door. If you can't reach to do this... hum loudly.The Cling-On CrapFor the most part you've completed your crap, but there's one little morsel that refuses to drop off. You're getting impatient. Someone else wants to use the toilet. So you grip the seat with both hands and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water. Maybe the person pounding impatiently on the door has scissors.The Houdini CrapYou go, then you stand up to flush and the damn thing has disappeared. Where'd it go? Did it creep down the pipe? Did you dream the whole thing? Is it lurking out of sight? Should you wipe... maybe you should just to make sure you went. Should you flush? You'd better, because if you don't, you know it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.The Hangover CrapYou feel so bad that you don't know which end of you to put down first. You have roaring cramps, so you sit down. Then a wave of nausea rolls over you like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your intestines like a vice so you sit down again... up down, up down. Don't you wish Mum was close by.The Porta-Pottie DumpConstruction workers and outdoor concertgoers will tell you about going in a portable toilet. My best description would be, 'It's like taking a shit in an upright coffin.' It's claustrophobic and it smells bad. Best advice: go in a paper cup.The Proctologist CrapIn the beginning, the Lord created the earth, the sky and the firmament, but I hope he didn't create this dump because there is nothing biblical about it. You run out of gas. That's right, you run out of propulsion. The crap is right there at the end of your barrel and refuses to go any further. You grunt, you squeeze, you wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. You've only got two choices here. One is to squeeze the damn thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. The other is to pretend you're a proctologist and go after it yourself. Not a pretty picture is it?The Whole Roll CrapNo matter how much you wipe, it doesn't seem to be enough. You blow the whole roll and you have to flush 25 times too. The whole episode is consumer waste.The Graffiti CrapYou flush the crap and the swirling motion of the receding bowl water forces the crap to the porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way down. You flush again but the curly-Q hangs there... love it or leave it, it's your choice.The Encore Crap'Ahhh!' You're done, so you wipe, put yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate the toilet when you feel another crap on its way. You have to return for a curtain call.The Born Again CrapThis is a dump that's going badly. You say, 'Lord, if I live through this, I'll take up religion.' You always get through it, but seldom keep the promises you made in desperation, because a born-again crap is like childbirth - you forget the pain quickly.</p>

41664,"<p>(Every year, teacher Mike Wilson of Ballwin, Missouri has his elementary-school students study the presidential election process in America. From the resulting essays and exam papers, Wilson has culled some gems of youthful insight and wisdom, not to mention skepticism worth of a politics-weary adult. As the 1984 presidential election grows near, we offer some of Wilson's treasures.) </p>
<p>Did you ever think what I used to think about candidates running neck-and-neck? Well it is not true. </p>
<p>Universal suffrage means that even the illegible get to vote. </p>
<p>Calling a person a runner-up is the polite way of saying you lost. </p>
<p>The difference between a king and a president is that a king is the son of his father but a president is not. </p>
<p>What I learned about elections is that we aren't really getting to elect the president. It is some people in a college who get to. I have not decided what to do about it yet but I am not going to just sit around. </p>
<p>It is possible to get the majority of electoral votes without getting the majority of popular votes. Anyone who can ever understand how this works gets to be president. </p>
<p>Some of our presidents never did much else and are famous only because they became president. </p>
<p>The more I think about trying to run for president the less I think of it. </p>
<p>The president has the power to appoint and disappoint the members of his cabinet. </p>
<p>Much has been said about balancing the budget. It has been found that the budget is more talkable than balanceable. </p>
<p>The campaign is when the candidate tells what he stand for and the election is when the votes tell if they can stand for his being elected. </p>
<p>Actually, elections are different from politics. Elections come and go while politics are with us all the time. </p>
<p>The winning candidate is elected and inoculated. </p>
<p>In January, the president makes his Inaugural Address after he has been sworn at. </p>
<p>Once he is elected, sometimes the president has to work 24 hours a day until he finds out what he is supposed to do. </p>
<p>The nominees are usually called candidates or campaigners although I have heard them called other things. </p>
<p>One of the strictest rules is all dark horses running for president must be people. </p>
<p>Popular votes tell who is the most popular. Electoral votes tell who is the most elected. </p>
<p>Heredity is a bad thing in politics because it gets us kings instead of presidents. </p>
<p>A caucus is something people vote in. Sort of a small booth. </p>
<p>An overwhelming favorite is a candidate that often comes over to the convention and whelms the delegates. </p>
<p>The jobs of delegates is to resent their states. </p>
<p>Noncommittal is to be able to talk and talk without saying anything. </p>
<p>When the radio mentions a landslide, cross your fingers and hope it is talking about an election. </p>
<p>A dark horse is a candidate that the delegates don't know enough about to dislike yet. </p>
<p>Political science is to try to figure out what makes candidates act that way. </p>
<p>A split ticket is when you don't like any of them on the ticket so you tear it up. </p>
<p>When they talk about the most promising presidential candidate, they mean the one who can think of the most things to promise. </p>
<p>Elephants and donkeys never fought until politics came along. </p>
<p>Political strategy is when you don't let people know you have run out of ideas and keep shouting anyway. </p>
<p>A candidate should always renounce his words carefully. </p>
<p>We are learning how to make our election results known quicker and quicker. It is our campaigns we are having trouble getting any shorter. </p>
<p>One of the mainest rules of campaigning is you are not allowed to go on a whistle-stop tour without a train. </p>
<p>Politician is the bawling out name for a candidate you don't like. </p>
<p>Speaking of defeat, candidates are told never to. </p>
<p>Campaigns give us a great deal of happiness by their finally ending.</p>

41665,"<p>A king had a gorgeous daughter of wedding age. Three princes wanted to<br /> marry the princess. So the king said, ""Whoever can bring me back the most<br /> ping pong balls gets to marry the my daughter."" So the three princes went<br /> out looking for ping pong balls.</p>
<p>The first prince came back with his horse carrying two sacks filled with<br /> ping pong balls. He figured he made it with no problem.</p>
<p>Then, the second prince came back with ten horse carrying sacks filled<br /> with ping pong balls on each horse. He thought he would make it all the<br /> way.</p>
<p>Finally, the third prince came back. He was all beat up. His clothes were<br /> all ripped up, black and blue eyes, skinned knees, and the rest of him was<br /> completely demolished. The king asked, ""What happened? You didn't find any<br /> ping pong balls?""</p>

"
41666,"<p>It seems that a lot of people are dieting recently, trying everything from an all-carbohydrate to an all-protein mix. I have another suggestion, one that has worked through the ages: the ""Beer-Me"" diet. Personally, I have a ""liquid dinner"" every time I go to the club on Friday night! </p>
<p>FACT: A lite beer has between 70 and 100 calories, is almost all water, and the part that isn't water is almost pure carbohydrates. </p>
<p>FACT: The average diet recommends a daily caloric intake of 1,200 calories for women, 1,500 for men, if you want to lose the medically safe two to three pounds a week. On the ""Beer-Me"" diet, that equates to at least 12 beverages a day for women, and 15 for men. A measurable goal. </p>
<p>FACT: The alcohol in beer is a diuretic, which causes the water to flush out almost immediately, leading to a consistent workout regimen including deep knee bends (getting out of the chair), fast walking (very good for your heart) and squats (as the case may be). </p>
<p>FACT: Drinking beer actually helps you sleep-even when you aren't necessarily tired. All that added rest is certain to help any problems you may have experienced in sleep deprivation, counting calories on those other fad diets. In addition, you may experience the occasional ""How did I get here?"" when you wake up, which always makes for lively conversation, and possibly additional exercise if you have to sneak out and run home. </p>
<p>FACT: The ""Beer-Me"" diet is good for your heart. After just one day of consuming your required 12-15 beers, you will certainly want to consume some aspirin, which is medically proven to help prevent heart attacks. </p>
<p>FACT: On the ""Beer-Me"" diet you can eat anything you want. The only rule is that you cannot consume any food until you have consumed at least half of the day's required beers. This way the food will probably only stay in your body a short time, until you again exercise the deep knee bends, quick walk and, this time, the ""lean-over-and-hurl"" stomach crunches. </p>
<p>FACT: Beer drinking is often done in bars, where other forms of exercise are common. Dancing, for example, is a good way to build up a thirst, as is chasing members of the opposite sex. If you really want to maximize your workout, try actually walking up to the bar, versus using a waitress. To take this to the extreme, you could even get up and get someone else a beer-perhaps someone who is newer to the diet plan than yourself. </p>
<p>FACT: Beer is cheaper than Jenny Craig. </p>
<p>Based on these facts, let's run through a given scenario for diet implementation. </p>
<p> CAUTION: This is a weekend diet plan, and should be attempted during the work week by only the staunchest of dieters. </p>
<p> MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY: Eat junk food, and basically be a slob. </p>
<p>FRIDAY: Feeling ""huge,"" swing by the liquor store and stock up. Go to favorite place of beer drinking and begin the consumption process (remember 12 for women, 15 for men).</p>
<p> SATURDAY: Wake up (as required) and lounge around all day, feeling slightly smaller after expunging any food that you may have accidentally consumed (particularly if it involved beef jerky from 7-11). Take aspirin. Notice that you have absolutely no interest in food, anyway. </p>
<p>SATURDAY (p.m.): Restart cycle, noticing that your appetite has still not returned. Perhaps only meet half of your consumption goal due to an ongoing discussion with ""the dog that bit you."" This is a good thing, as only half-consumption means less than 1,000 calories for the day, and you still don't feel hungry. </p>
<p>SUNDAY (a.m.): Wake up for mandatory sports day. This is a very convenient diet during football season, but it can be successfully implemented year-round. There is some major professional sport being played every day of the year except the day before and the day after the Major League All-Star game (fact-look it up). Consumption on this day should be paced to cover the entire day-you don't want to peak too soon. Again you notice a lack of appetite, and are feeling thinner all the time. Don't forget the aspirin. </p>
<p> MONDAY: Return to work, feeling thinner, well rested, and surprisingly mellow. Mark your log book, and begin preparation for the upcoming weekend. </p>
<p>Happy dieting.</p>

41679,"<p>One day, an English man, a Scott and an Irish man were working<br /> on the top of a skyscraper, which was under construction. And as<br /> they always do, at 1:30pm sharp, the hear the wistle for the<br /> lunch hour, and get out their lunch boxes.</p>
<p>The English man sits next to the Scott and the Irish man and<br /> opens his lunch box. He starts to complain, ""Not again! I hate<br /> it when i get peanut butter sandwiches!"" The Scott then said,<br /> ""At least you didn't get marmite on yours!"" The Irish man<br /> disgustingly remarks his lunch ""Tuna! I hate tune, and I'm<br /> allergic."" So the trio complain with themselves until the end of<br /> the lunch hour, then get back to the work on the construction.</p>
<p>The next day at 1:30pm. The English man sadly says ""Dammit! Not<br /> again! Peanut butter, ugh! If i get peanut butter again I'll<br /> kill myself!"" The Scott just as horrified, ""God almighty, its<br /> sick! I honestly hate marmite, I think i'll join you if I get<br /> this rubbish again!"" he says to the English man. The Irish man<br /> eager to quote hes lunch says ""Mother of Earth! Not more tuna! I<br /> hate the stuff. I just might join you two if I get the same<br /> tomorrow!""</p>
<p>The next day, at 1:30pm. The English man opens his lunch box,<br /> ""OH MY GOD!

Now the Irish man, all alone thinks to himself,<br /> ""Please don't be tuna,"" and he opens his lunch box , low and<br /> behold... tuna sandwiches. ""On my mothers grave, why me!? It's<br /> tuna again!"" and he thinks for a second and then the stupid<br /> paddy jumps after the two before him.</p>
<p>At their funeral, the widows all gather together and talk about<br /> what had happened. The English mans wife sobs to the others, ""IF<br /> only I knew he hated peabut butter sandwiches, i wish he would<br /> ahve told me."" Now the Scotts wife upsettingly says, ""I wish<br /> that he had told me that he hated marmite, he never complained,<br /> he was so kind."" Now the Irish mans wife was just standing with<br /> the other widows, very confused, ""I have no idea why my husband<br /> killed himself? He knows he makes his own sandwiches!?""</p>

"
41688,"<p>* Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun is loaded and the deer is in sight. </p>
<p>* When approaching a four-way sto`, the vehicle with the largest tires always has the right of way. </p>
<p>* Never tow another car using pantyhose and duct tape. </p>
<p>* When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer. </p>
<p>* Never relieve yourself from a moving vehicle, especially when driving. </p>
<p>* Do not remove the seats from the car so that all your kids can fit in. </p>
<p>* Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession. </p>
<p>* Unlike clothes and shoes, a toothbrush should never be a hand-me-down item. </p>
<p>* If you have to vacuum the bed, it's time to change the sheets. </p>
<p>* While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys. </p>
<p>* Plucking unwanted nose hair is time-consuming work. A cigarette lighter and a small tolerance for pain can accomplish the same goal and save hours. Note: Its a good idea to keep a bucket of water handy when using this method. </p>
<p>Redneck Dining Out </p>
<p>* Remember to leave a generous tip for good service. After all, their mobile home costs just as much as yours. </p>
<p>Redneck Entertaining in Your Home </p>
<p>* A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist. </p>
<p>* Do not allow the dog to eat at the table . . . no matter how good his manners are. </p>
<p>* If your dog falls in love with a guest's leg, have the decency to leave them alone for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Redneck Dating (Outside the Family) </p>
<p>* Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date. </p>
<p>* Be aggressive. Let her know you are interested: ""I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the men's bathroom wall two years ago. </p>
<p>* If a girl's name does not appear regularly on a bathroom wall, water tower, or an overpass, odds are good that the date will end in frustration. </p>
<p>* Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately after the movie has ended. </p>
<p>* Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven they can't hear you. </p>
<p>Redneck Wedding Etiquette </p>
<p>* Livestock is usually a poor choice for a wedding gift. </p>
<p>* Its is not okay for the groom to bring a date to a wedding. </p>
<p>* When dancing, never remove undergarments, no matter how hot it is. </p>
<p>* A bridal veil made of window screen is not only cost effective but also a proven fly deterrent. </p>
<p>* For the groom, at least rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a natty appearance. Though uncomfortable, say yes to socks and shoes for this special occasion.</p>
<p>Redneck Etiquette for All Occasions </p>
<p>* Never take a beer to a job interview or ask if they press charges. </p>
<p>* Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them. </p>
<p>* Always say ""Excuse me"" after getting sick in someone else's car. </p>
<p>* It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church. </p>
<p>* Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it's considered poor manners to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home. </p>
<p>* The socially refined never fish coins out of public toilets, especially if other people are around. </p>
<p>* Always provide an alibi to the police for family members.</p>

41700,"<p>A farmer buys several pigs, hoping to breed them for ham, bacon, etc.<br /> After several weeks, he notices that none of the pigs are getting<br /> pregnant, and calls a vet for help.</p>
<p>The vet tells the farmer that he should try artificial insemination. The<br /> farmer doesn't have the slightest idea what this means but, not wanting to<br /> display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the pigs<br /> are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and<br /> will, instead, lay down and wallow in the mud when they are pregnant.</p>
<p>The farmer hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion<br /> that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the pigs himself.<br /> So, he loads the pigs into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has<br /> sex with them all, brings them back and goes to bed.</p>
<p>Next morning, he wakes and looks out at the pigs. Seeing that they are all<br /> still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't take, and<br /> loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, has sex<br /> with each pig twice for good measure, brings them back and goes to bed. </p>
<p>Next morning, he wakes to find the pigs still just standing around. One<br /> more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them<br /> out to the woods. He spends all day with them and, upon returning home,<br /> falls listlessly into bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the<br /> pigs. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the pigs are laying in<br /> the mud.</p>

41716,"<p>1. January 2000. Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, was awarded $780,000 by a jury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler who was running amok inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict, considering that the misbehaving tyke was Ms. Robertson's son.</p>
<p>2. June 1998. Nineteen-year-old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over Carl's hand with a Honda Accord. Mr. Truman apparently didn't notice that someone was at the wheel of the car whose hubcap he was trying to steal.</p>
<p>3. October 1998. Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was exiting a house he had finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go up as the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. He couldn't reenter the house because the door between the garage and the house had locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation, so Mr.Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found, and a large bag of dry dog food. This upset Mr.Dickson, so he sued the homeowner's insurance company, claiming the situation had caused him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of half a million dollars and change.</p>
<p>4. October 1999. Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded $14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door neighbor's beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner's fenced-in yard. Mr. Williams was also in the yard. The award was less than the amount sought because the jury felt that the dog may have been provoked by Mr. Williams, who, at the time, was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun.</p>
<p>5. May 2000. A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, $113,500 after she slipped on a spilled soft drink and broke her coccyx. The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson threw it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.</p>
<p>6. December 1997. Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out two front teeth. This occurred when Ms. Walton was trying to sneak out through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.</p>

41732,"<p>An old farmer decided it was time to get a new rooster for his hens. The current rooster was doing his job okay, but he was getting on in years. And the farmer figured it wouldn't hurt anything. So he gets a young cock and and lets it loose in the barn yard. The old rooster sees the young one strutting around and he gets a little worried. So, they are trying to replace me, thinks the old rooster. I've got to do something about this. </p>
<p>He walks up to the new bird and says,""So, your the new guy in town. I bet you think you're really hot stuff don't you? I'm not exactly ready for the chopping block yet. I bet I'm still the better bird and to prove it, I challenge you to a race around the hen house over there. We'll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens to himself."" </p>
<p>Well, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he definitely thought he was more than a match for the old guy. ""You're on,"" said the young rooster. ""And since I know I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of half a lap. I'll still win easily,"" said the young cocky rooster. </p>
<p>So, the two roosters go over to the hen house to start the race and all the hens gather around to watch. The race begins and all the hens start cheering the roosters on. After the first lap, the old rooster is still maintaining his lead. After the second lap, the old guys lead has slipped a little but he's still hanging in there. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the old roosters lead continued to slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he just barely led the young rooster. By then the farmer had heard all the commotion. He ran into the house, got his shot gun, and ran out to the barn yard figuring a fox or something was after his chickens. When he got there, he saw the two roosters running around the hen house, with the old rooster still slightly in the lead. He immediately took his shot gun, aimed, fired, and blew the young rooster away. </p>
<p>He walked away slowly, saying to himself.................. ""Damn, that's the third gay rooster I've bought this month.""</p>

<p>Make sure you have a pen and paper to write down all of your answers... or<br /> just a really good memory. Try to imagine this happening...</p>
<p>1) You are walking to your love's house. There are two roads to get there.<br /> One is a straight path which takes you there quickly, but it is very plain<br /> and boring. The other is curvy and full of wonderful sights on the way,<br /> but it takes quite a while to reach your loved one's house.</p>
<p>Do you choose the short or the long path?</p>
<p>2) On the way, you see two rose bushes. One is full of red roses, the<br /> other is full of white roses. You decide to pick 20 roses for your love.<br /> You can give your love any kind of color combination of roses that you<br /> choose. All white, 15 red and 5 white, half and half, 19 white and 1 red,<br /> whatever!</p>
<p>What color combination do you choose?</p>
<p>3) You finally reach your love's house. You ring the bell and the maid<br /> answers. You can ask the maid to please get your loved one for you, or you<br /> may go upstairs and get your love yourself.</p>
<p>Do you ask the maid or get your love yourself?</p>
<p>4) Now, you go upstairs to your love's room. No one is there. You want to<br /> suprise your love by leaving the roses on the bed or by the windowsill.</p>
<p>Do you leave the roses on the bed or windowsill?</p>
<p>5) Later, it's time for bed. You and your loved one go to sleep in<br /> separate rooms. You wake up early in the morning to check on your love.<br /> You enter the room.</p>
<p>Is your love awake or sleeping?</p>
<p>6) It's time to go now, and you start to head back. You can take either<br /> path home now: the plain, boring one that gets you home fast or the curvy,<br /> sight filled path that you can casually take your time with and enjoy the<br /> view on your way home.</p>
<p>Do you choose the short or long path home?</p>
<p>The interpretations are below... Make a wish about your love on your way<br /> down!</p>

<p>Hope you made a wish!</p>
<p>Interpretations:</p>
<p>1) If you chose the short path to reach your love's house, you fall love<br /> quickly, easily, and probably very often. If you chose the long path, hit<br /> takes you a while to trust someone and fall in love.</p>
<p>2) The number of roses you choose of each color determines how much of<br /> yourself you give in a relationship and how much you expect from the other<br /> person. The number of white is how much of yourself you give, the nuumber<br /> of red is how much you expect from your partner. For example, if you chose<br /> all white, you give yourself fully and unconditionally in a relationship.<br /> If you chose half and half your relationships are equally balanced. Or if<br /> you chose a few more red than white you tend to take a bit more than give<br /> in a relationship.</p>
<p>3) If you asked the maid to go get your love for you, you tend to avoid<br /> confrontation and ignore problems in your relationship for as long as<br /> possible. If you went to get your loved one yourself you always bring up<br /> problems with your partner and want them resolved quickly. You don't mind<br /> fighting once in a while.</p>
<p>4) If you left the roses on the bed, you're very attached and you want to<br /> see your love all the time. If you left the roses on the windowsill, you<br /> don't mind just seeing your love once in a while.</p>
<p>5) If your love is awake you want for them to change. If you chose<br /> sleeping, you love them just the way they are.</p>
<p>6) If you chose the short path home, you tend to fall out of love easily.<br /> You are fickle and have a tendency to bounce around from relationship to<br /> relationship. It is easy for you to get over someone. If you chose the<br /> long path home, you stay in love for a long time. When you fall, you fall<br /> hard. </p>
<p>Now..about that wish...</p>

However, if her husband did any work or moved around much or got upset about anything, he would die. The doctor asked if she understood these conditions, and the wife assured him that she did.

41802,"<p>Years ago while lying in my hammock and drinking JD from the bottle I<br /> noticed my dog dragging something under the fence. Upon inspection, to my<br /> dismay, I realized it was the next door neighbor's 10 year old daughter's<br /> rabbit.</p>
<p>For years I had watched her come home from school and head straight out to<br /> its cage, free it and play with it in the yard. I knew today would be no<br /> different and fearing for our dog, I had to think fast.</p>
<p>The rabbit was quite dirty, as if it had put up quite a struggle, so I<br /> washed it off with the hose, combed it with the Dog brush and blew it dry<br /> with the leaf blower. Upon finishing it's grooming I jumped the fence and<br /> replaced back in it's cage hoping it's death would be written off as<br /> ""natural causes"".</p>
<p>Back to the hammock and JD. Within the hour the neighbors Volvo pulled in<br /> as usual and out popped the little girl, and as usual she headed straight<br /> for the cage. Only this time she stopped about six feet away and screamed:<br /> ""DDDDDAAAADDDDDDDYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""</p>
<p>Her father panic stricken stood looking at the cage. Being the good<br /> neighbor that I am I rushed to fence and asked if there was anything I<br /> could do.</p>
<p>Her father less than calmly blurted, ""What kind of sick individual would<br /> dig up a little girl's dead rabbit and put it back in it's cage??""</p>

I thought she was too beautiful, for me to even try.A few times I approached her, she just smiled and walked away. I could not get the courage up, and ""Hi"" was all I'd say.Then, I had an idea, I would get her home address, And send a valentine to her, and with it I'd express,The way I feel about her, and the way she makes me feel, And the feelings that I have, are very, very real.I'll tell her, that I dream of her, and how it all would be, If she would only take the time, to be alone with me.I poured my heart out in the card, and ask her to be mine, And then I dropped it in the mail, my special valentine.In just a few short days, I had a response in my mail, A card with her return address, I started feeling pale.I wondered what she said in it, and what she thinks of me, I guess the only way to know, is open it and see.With great anticipation, I removed the envelope, And closed my eyes a moment, as my heart filled up with hope.I opened up my eyes to see, a card shaped like a heart, And in the center, someone drew, a bloody piercing dart.I opened up the card to see, if writing was inside, And when I started reading it, I damn near almost died.I'd love to be your valentine, but I think I will pass, My husband says he'll be at work, to kick your stupid a**.I'm glad you like my body, and you think it's really fine, My husband says this card is going, where the sun don't shine.In your card, you said there's things to me you'd love to do, I think my husband's going to do, all of those things to you.So, have a Happy Valentines, I'll see you Monday morn, My husband says on Tuesday, you'll wish you were never born.</p>

41811,"<p>It's 1880, the decade of gunslingers and gentlemen.  This is a story of one such young man that wanted more than anything to be the fastest and most respected gunslinger in the west.</p>
<p>The place was Dodge City, Kansas in the Sawdust Saloon. The young man walked into the Sawdust Saloon and, to his surprise, saw Wyatt Earp sitting at a table playing poker.  The young man walked up to Wyatt and said, ""Mr. Earp, I would like to be a gunslinger just like you. Could you give me some tips?""</p>
<p>Wyatt put his cards down, looked up at the boy and said, ""Son, I don't usually give out tips like this cause it could someday be detrimental to my health, but step back and let me take a look at you.""</p>
<p>The boy stepped back and Mr.  Earp said, ""You look good.  You're wearing black, you've got two ivory handled guns with waxed holsters, and you look like a gunslinger.  But what's more important, son, is: Can you shoot?""</p>
<p>The young man, happy to show how good he was, quickly drew his pistol from his right holster and without aiming shot the cuff link off of the piano player's right sleeve.</p>
<p>Wyatt said, ""That's good shooting son, but can you shoot with your left hand?""</p>
<p>Before Earp could even finish, the boy had already drawn the pistol from his left holster and shot the cuff link off of the piano player's left shirt sleeve.  Very proud of himself the young man blew the smoke away from his six shooter and holstered his gun. ""How was that?"" the boy asked.</p>
<p>Wyatt smiled and looked up and the boy and said, ""That was pretty good shooting son.  I couldn't do better than that myself, but I do have one good tip for you.""</p>
<p>""What's that?""  the boy asked.</p>
<p>""I suggest that you go to the kitchen and ask the cook for a large can of lard. Then take both guns of yours and stick them down deep into the lard.""</p>
<p>Puzzled the young gunslinger asked why he should do that.</p>
<p>Earp put his cards down again, leaned back in his chair, and said, ""Well son, when Doc Holliday gets done playing the piano over there, he's going to take those two guns of yours and.  .  .  ""</p>

41812,"<p>A proper man met a beautiful girl and agreed to spend the night with her for $500.00. </p>
<p>When he was ready to leave, he told her that he did not have any cash with him but that he would have his secretary write a check and mail it to her, calling it ""Rent For Apartment.""</p>
<p>On the way to the office he decided that the whole event was not worth the price he agreed to pay, so he had his secretary send a note with a check for $250.00 and enclosed the following note:</p>
<p>Dear madam,</p>
<p>Enclosed, you should find a check in the amount of $250.00 for rent of your apartment. I am not sending the amount agreed upon because when I rented the apartment I was under the impression that:</p>
<p>1. It had never been occupied.<br /> 2. That there was plenty of heat.<br /> 3. It was small.</p>
<p>Last night I found out that it had been previously occupied, that there wasn't any heat and it was entirely too large.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250.00 with the following note:</p>
<p>Dear sir,</p>
<p>I cannot understand how you expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. As for the heat, there is plenty of it, if you know how turn it on. And if you don't have enough furniture to fill it, don't blame me.</p>

<p>She says, ""It's for the Mother Superior, she's constipated."" </p>
<p>So he sells it to her. Later that night, he walks out, and there's the nun on the stoop, with the empty bottle, drunk as a skunk, singing and laughing. </p>

41816,"<p>Dear Mom and Dad:<br /> It has been four months since I left for college. I have been remiss in<br /> writing and am very sorry for my thoughtlessness. I will bring you up to date<br /> now, but before you read on, please sit down. Don't read any further unless you<br /> are sitting down ... </p>
<p>OK? </p>
<p>Good. I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the<br /> concussion I got from jumping out of the window of my dormitory when it caught<br /> fire, shortly after my arrival, are pretty well healed now. I only spent two<br /> weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get three<br /> headaches a day. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump were witnessed by an<br /> attendant at a nearby gas station, and he was able to call the Fire Department<br /> and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and since I had nowhere to<br /> live because of the burnt-out dorm, he was kind enough to invite me to share his<br /> apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but it is kind of cute. He is a<br /> very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married.<br /> We haven't set the exact date yet, but I'm sure it will be before I start to<br /> show. </p>
<p>Yes, Mom and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward to<br /> being grandparents, and I know you will give the baby the same love and devotion<br /> and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our<br /> marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from<br /> passing our premarital blood tests, and I carelessly caught it from him. This<br /> will soon clear up, thanks tomy daily penicillin injections. I know you will<br /> welcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind, and although not well<br /> educated, he is ambitious Also, he is of a different race and religion than<br /> ours, but I know, after all your years of teaching me tolerance, that you won't<br /> mind the fact that heis somewhat darker than we are. I am sure you will love him<br /> as I do. </p>
<p>His family background is good, too; I am told that his father is an important<br /> gunbearer in his native African village. </p>
<p>I guess that's it. Now that I have brought you up to date, I want you to know<br /> ... There was no dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion or skull fracture,<br /> I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged, I do not have<br /> syphilis and there is no man of another race in my life. </p>
<p>However, I am getting a ""D"" in History and an ""F"" in Science, and I wanted you<br /> to see these marks in their proper perspective. </p>
<p>Your loving daughter, </p>
<p>Chelsea </p>
<p>P.S. Stanford is great...I love it, though I miss you both terribly...and<br /> Socks, too! </p>
<p>P.P.S Dad, please give my best to Monica &amp; the others.</p>

<p>Chris looked so down and dejected, that John just had to go up and say something to him.</p>
<p>""Say, Chris, how ya doing? How's the tractor selling business these days?""</p>
<p>If Chris had looked sad before, at the mention of tractor sales, his face sank even more, and a tear came to his eye.</p>
<p>""John,"" he said, shaking his head, ""I don't know what it is. I can't sell a tractor these days to save my life. I'll tell you, I just gotta sell one tractor and soon, or else I'll lose that dealership for good.""</p>
<p>""Well,"" John said, taking the barstool next to him, ""If you think you got it bad, I got it worse. </p>
<p>Now you listen to this...."" ""I went out to the barn the other morning to milk Bessy. That ol' cow gets more ornery as the years go by. </p>
<p>Anyway, no sooner did I sit down on the milking stool and get to work, but ol' Bes starts a slappin' me with her tail. </p>
<p>After a minute or so, I got fed up with it, so I threw a rope up over the rafters, and tied ol' Bessy's tail to the rafters.</p>
<p>Then I got back to work.""</p>
<p>""I didn't even get two squirts into the bucket, when Bes gives me a kick. Knocked me clean off the stool! Boy, if that upset me! </p>
<p>So I get me another rope an' tie Bessy's right hind leg to the side of the milking stall, and get a started trying to milk her again.""</p>
<p>""Well by this time, Bessy's about livid, and she doesn't want any part of it, so she let's me have it with her other hind leg. </p>
<p>I wasn't about to give in to this ol' cow, so I got me yet another piece oh rope and tied up Bessy's left leg to the other side of the stall.""</p>

41829,"<p>A lion woke up one morning feeling really rowdy and mean. He went out and cornered a small monkey and roared, 'Who is mightiest of all jungle animals?' The trembling monkey says, 'You are, mighty lion! 'Later, the lion confronts a wildebeest and fiercely bellows, 'Who is the mightiest of all jungle animals?' The terrified wildebeest stammers, 'Oh great lion, you are by far the mightiest animal in the jungle!' On a roll now, the lion swaggers up to an elephant and roars, 'Who is the mightiest of all jungle animals?' Fast as lightning, the elephant snatches up the lion with his trunk, slams him against a tree half a dozen times, making the lion feeling like it'd been run over by a safari wagon. The elephant then stomped on the lion until it looked like a corn tortilla and then ambled away. The lion let out a moan of pain, lifted his head weakly and hollered after the elephant, 'Geez, just because you don't know the answer, you don't have to get so pissed off!'</p>

<p>I believe that if you are selling me a Big Mac, you'd better do it in English.<br /> I'm not in touch with my feelings and I like it that way.<br /> I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child, it takes two parents.<br /> I think owning a gun doesn't make you a killer. </p>
<p>I want to know which church is it exactly where the Reverend Jesse Jackson preaches. And where does he get his money. And why is he always part of the problem and not the solution. </p>
<p>I believe if she has her lips on your willie, it is sex, and it is sex for both of you. This even applies when you are President of the United States. </p>

41883,"<p>This useful tool, commonly found in the range of 8 inches long. The functioning of which is enjoyed by members of both sexes. It is usually found hung, dangling loosely, ready for instant action. It boasts of a clump of little hairy things at one end and a small hole at the other. In use, it is inserted, almost always willingly, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, into a warm, fleshy, moist opening where it is thrust in and drawn out again and again many times in succession, often quickly and accompanied by squirming bodily movements. Anyone found listening will most surely recognize the rhythmic, pulsing sound, resulting from the well lubricated movements. </p>
<p>When finally withdrawn, it leaves behind a juicy, frothy, sticky white substance, some of which will need cleaning from the outer surfaces of the opening and some from its long glistening shaft. After everything is done and the flowing and cleansing liquids have ceased emanating, it is returned to its freely hanging state of rest, ready for yet another bit of action, hopefully reaching its bristling climax twice or three times a day, but often much less. </p>

One night after the zoo had closed and all the animal keepers had left, he decided he was going to tear the bars apart and screw the first thing he could find. As he left his cage and ran through the zoo he came upon a lion sleeping in the grass. He really wasn't thrilled with his find but since he had promised himself he would take the first thing he could get, he grabbed the lion and screwed it. Just as the gorilla finished, the lion awoke and was really pissed. The lion started chasing the gorilla through the zoo and was beginning to gain on him. The gorilla turned a corner and saw a park bench with a newspaper on it. Thinking quickly, the gorilla sat down on the bench and held the newspaper in front of him like he was reading it. When the lion turned the corner he stopped at the park bench. Not knowing what was behind the newspaper he asked the reader if he had seen a gorilla run by. From behind the paper, the gorilla said, 'You mean the one that screwed the lion?' The lion shook his head and shouted, 'Oh no! It's already in the papers!'</p>

41900,"<p>Once upon a time there was a little girl who wanted a kitten for Christmas.<br /> Her mother couldn't buy a kitten and parcel it up for Christmas Day, so she<br /> bought it a week before Christmas and gave it to the little girl.<br /> 'You're getting your Christmas present a week early this year,' her mother<br /> explained as she handed over the fluffy little tabby kitten. 'Is that what you<br /> want?'<br /> The little girl said, 'It's wonderful; mother...just what I wanted. There's<br /> just one thing wrong!'<br /> 'What's that?' her mother asked.<br /> 'Well, it has a cute little claw on the outside of every paw and another<br /> little claw on the inside of every paw - but the poor little thing has no claws<br /> at all in the middle of its paws!'<br /> Her mother smiled. 'Don't worry, Kitty. When you wake up on Christmas morning<br /> you'll find the claws are there.'<br /> Now Kitty loved her kitten dearly, but she worried about the claws in the<br /> middle of its paws. The days passed and there wasn't even a hint, a clue or an<br /> inkling of claws in the middle of its paws.<br /> When Christmas Eve arrived and there was still no sign, Kitty went to her<br /> mother and asked again, 'Are you absolutely sure that the kitten will have its<br /> middle claws tomorrow? There's only a few hours to go and there's not a hint or<br /> clue or an inkling as to claws as far as I can see.'<br /> 'Wait till you wake up on Christmas morning,' her mother smiled and went on<br /> stuffing the turkey.<br /> So Kitty went to sleep a worried girl. When she woke up on Christmas morning<br /> she ignored the presents in her stocking and rushed downstairs to look at her<br /> little kitten.<br /> She was astounded, amazed and just a little surprised to see that her kitten<br /> had four claws on every paw! The middle ones had appeared as if by magic.<br /> Kitty rushed to her parent's bedroom. 'Mummy, Mummy! The kitten has grown its<br /> middle claws!'<br /> 'Of course it has,' her mother grinned.<br /> 'But how did you know?' Kitty demanded.<br /> Her father rolled over sleepily and sighed, 'Oh, Kitty, everybody knows that<br /> Centre-claws always comes at Christmas!'</p>

41907,"<p>Customer: Hi. How much is your paint?<br /> Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends on quite a lot of things.</p>
<p>Customer: Can you give me a guess? Is there an average price?<br /> Clerk: Our lowest price is $12 a gallon, and we have 60 different prices up to $200 a gallon.</p>
<p>Customer: What's the difference in the paint?<br /> Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.</p>
<p>Customer: Well, then I'd like some of that $12 paint.<br /> Clerk: When do you intend to use the paint?</p>
<p>Customer: I want to paint tomorrow. It's my day off.<br /> Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.</p>
<p>Customer: When would I have to paint to get the $12 paint?<br /> Clerk: You would have to start very late at night in about 3 weeks. But you will have to agree to start painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until at least Sunday.</p>
<p>Customer: You've got to be *&amp;%^#@* kidding!<br /> Clerk: I'll check and see if we have any paint available.</p>
<p>Customer: You have shelves FULL of paint! I can see it!<br /> Clerk: But it doesn't mean that we have paint available. We sell only a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price per gallon just went to $16. We don't have any more $12 paint.</p>
<p>Customer: The price went up as we were talking?<br /> Clerk: Yes, sir. We change the prices and rules hundreds of times a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with your paint yet, we just decided to change. I suggest you purchase your paint as soon as possible. How many gallons do you want?</p>
<p>Customer: Well, maybe five gallons. Make that six, so I'll have enough.<br /> Clerk: Oh no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy paint and don't use it, there are penalties and possible confiscation of the paint you already have.</p>
<p>Customer: WHAT?<br /> Clerk: We can sell enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do the bedroom, you will lose your remaining gallons of paint.</p>
<p>Customer: What does it matter whether I use all the paint? I already paid you for it!<br /> Clerk: We make plans based upon the idea that all our paint is used, every drop. If you don't, it causes us all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>Customer: This is crazy!! I suppose something terrible happens if I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!<br /> Clerk: Oh yes! Every gallon you bought automatically becomes the $200 paint.</p>
<p>Customer: But what are all these, ""Paint on sale from $10 a liter"" signs?<br /> Clerk: Well that's for our budget paint. It only comes in half-gallons. One $5 half-gallon will do half a room. The second half-gallon to complete the room is $20. None of the cans have labels, some are empty and there are no refunds, even on the empty cans.</p>
<p>Customer: To hell with this! I'll buy what I need somewhere else!<br /> Clerk: I don't think so, sir. You may be able to buy paint for your bathroom and bedrooms, and your kitchen and dining room from someone else, but you won't be able to paint your connecting hall and stairway from anyone but us. And I should point out, sir, that if you paint in only one direction, it will be $300 a gallon.</p>
<p>Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $200!<br /> Clerk: That's if you paint around the room to the point at which you started. A hallway is different.</p>
<p>Customer: And if I buy $200 paint for the hall, but only paint in one direction, you'll confiscate the remaining paint.<br /> Clerk: No, we'll charge you an extra use fee plus the difference on your next gallon of paint. But I believe you're getting it now, sir.</p>
<p>Customer: You're insane!<br /> Clerk: Thanks for painting with United.</p>

41918,"<p>Three scientists were one day discussing what would happen if they rammed a cork up an elephant's backside and force fed it for 2 weeks. But because the experiment had never been documented and the idea was hard to comprehend they decided to have a go.</p>
<p>A week after the experiment had started they began to realize WHY the idea had never been tried: they were stuck for someone to pull the cork out.</p>
<p>One of the scientists came up with the bright idea of training a monkey to do the job, so they spent the next week training it to pull out corks once a buzzer had rung, then push it back in for another go. When the big day arrived they set up all the monitoring equipment and moved out to a safe distance.</p>
<p>The first scientist went 1 mile away, the second went 2 miles away and the third went 3 miles. When they were all ready the first scientist pushed the button to sound the buzzer. BBBAAANNNGGG!!!!!!!</p>
<p>The third scientist (3 miles away) was up to his ankles in shit, the second (2 miles away) was up to his knees and the first (1 mile away) was up to his waist. When the others joined the scientist who was 1 mile away they noticed that he was in fits of laughter.</p>

<p>The doctor told her husband that they would have to do a skin graft, but they could not graft any skin from her own body because she was too thin and her skin was dry.</p>
<p>So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin.</p>
<p>However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks. </p>
<p>The husband and wife agreed to the graft, and that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and they requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter.</p>
<p>After the surgery was completed, and the woman healed, everyone was astounded at her beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before with her lovely, soft skin. </p>
<p>All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her new youthful beauty! One night, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. </p>
<p>She said, �Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you.�</p>
<p>�My darling,� he replied, �I get all the thanks I need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek!�</p>

41929,"<p>One Christmas Eve, a frenzied young man ran into a pet shop<br /> looking for an unusual Christmas gift for his wife. The shop<br /> owner suggested a parrot, named Chet, which could sing famous<br /> Christmas carols. This seemed like the perfect gift. ""How do I<br /> get him to sing?"" The young man asked, excitedly. ""Simply hold a<br /> lighted match directly under his feet."" was the shop owner's<br /> reply. The shop owner Chet began to sing: ""Jingle Bells! Jingle<br /> Bells! ..."" The shop owner then held another match under the<br /> parrot's right foot. Then Chet's tune changed, and the air was<br /> filled with: "" Silent Night. Holy Night...""</p>
<p>The young man was so impressed that he paid the shop-keeper and<br /> ran home as quickly as he could with Chet under his arm. When<br /> the wife saw her gift she was overwhelmed. ""How beautiful!"" She<br /> exclaimed, ""Can he talk?"" ""No,"" the young man replied, ""But he<br /> can sing. Let me show you."" So the young man whipped out his<br /> lighter and placed it under Chet's left foot, as the shop-keeper<br /> had shown him, and Chet crooned: ""Jingle Bells! Jingle<br /> Bells!..."" The man then moved the lighter to Chet's right foot,<br /> and out came: ""Silent Night. Holy Night...""</p>
<p>The wife, her face filled with curiosity, then asked, ""What if<br /> we hold the lighter between his legs?"" The man did not know.<br /> ""Let's try it."" He answered, eager to please his wife. So they<br /> held the lighter between Chet's legs. Chet twisted his face,<br /> cleared his throat, the little parrot sang out loudly (like it<br /> was the performance of his life): ""Chet's nuts roasting on an<br /> open fire....""</p>

41930,"<p>""I think I have a problem, doc,"" says the patient, ""one of my balls has turned blue"". </p>
<p>The doctor examines the man briefly and concludes the patient dies if they don't have his testicle removed.</p>
<p>""Are you crazy?!"" bursts the patient, ""how could I let you do such a thing to me!"" </p>
<p>""You want to die?"", asks the doctor rhetorically, and the patient has to agree to have his testicle removed. </p>
<p>But, two weeks after the operation, he comes back. ""Doc, I don't know how to say this, but the other ball has turned blue, too."" </p>
<p>Again, the doctor tells him if he wants to live, his other testicle must be cut off, too, and, again, the man is very reluctant to the idea. </p>
<p>""Hey, you want to die?"", asks the doc, and the patient has to agree with the operation.</p>
<p>But, about two weeks after he is testicleless, he returns to the doctor: ""I think something is very wrong with me. My penis is now completely blue."" </p>
<p>After briefly examining the patient, the doc gives him the bad news: if he wants to live, his penis has to go. Of course, he does not want to hear about it. </p>
<p>""You want to die?"", asks the doctor. </p>
<p>""But... how do I pee?"" </p>
<p>""We'll install an plastic pipe, and there will be no problem."" </p>
<p>So, he has his penis removed, and, a while after the operation, the unfortunate man enters, again, the doctor's office. He is very angry: ""Doctor, the plastic pipe turned blue."" </p>
<p>""What?""</p>
<p>""Can you tell me what a hell is happening?"" </p>
<p>So, the doctor examines the patient more carefully and says: ""Hm, I don't know, could it be the jeans?...""</p>

41952,"<p>A teacher decides that she is going to teach her second grade class a new word today. She tells them that the word is ""definitely"" and its meaning is ""absolute, positive, without a doubt.""She asks the class if anyone can think of a sentence with the word in it. She calls on little Susan who is in the back raising her hand, quite sure of herself. Susan stands up and says, ""The sky is definitely blue.""The teacher replies to her, ""Well, that's a good sentence but sometimes the sky is gray, and sometimes its cloudy, and sometimes its red and pink so the sky is not definitely blue. Anyone else?""Tom's hand flies up and she calls on him. Tom answers, ""The water is definitely clear.""""Well, Tom that's a good sentence but sometimes the water is muddy, and sometimes it's green, and sometimes it's full of seaweed so it's not definitely clear. Anyone else?""Finally, in the far corner, little Robert slowly raises his hand.""Yes, Robert?""asks the teacher.""Can I ask a question, teacher?""Robert replies.""Yes.""""Do farts have lumps?""""No. Why do you ask.""""Well, then I've definitely pooped in my pants.""</p>

41996,"<p>Four men were bragging about how smart their dogs are. The first man was an<br /> Engineer, the second man was an Accountant, the third man was a Chemist, and the<br /> fourth was a Government Worker. </p>
<p>To show off, the Engineer called to his dog. </p>
<p>""T-Square, do your stuff."" </p>
<p>T- Square trotted over to a desk, took out some paper and a pen and promptly<br /> drew a circle, a square and a triangle.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed that was pretty smart. But the Accountant said his dog could<br /> do better. </p>
<p>He called his dog and said, ""Slide Rule, do your stuff."" </p>
<p>Slide Rule went out into the kitchen and returned with a dozen cookies. He<br /> divided them into 4 equal piles of 3 cookies each. </p>
<p>Everyone agreed that was good. But the Chemist said his dog could do better. </p>
<p>He called his dog and said, ""Measure, do your stuff."" </p>
<p>Measure got up, walked over to the fridge, took out a quart of milk, got a 10<br /> ounce glass from the cupboard and poured exactly 8 ounces without spilling a<br /> drop.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed that was good. </p>
<p>Then the three men turned to the Government Worker and said, ""What can your<br /> dog do?"" </p>
<p>The Government Worker called to his dog and said, ""Coffee Break, do your<br /> stuff.""</p>
<p>Coffee Break jumped to his feet, ate the cookies, drank the milk,<br /> dumped on the paper, sexually assaulted the other three dogs, claimed he injured<br /> his back while doing so, filed a grievance report for unsafe working conditions,<br /> put in for Worker's Compensation and went home on sick leave.</p>
